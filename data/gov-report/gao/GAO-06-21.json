GAO found that DOT considered the statutory eligibility criteria and priority factors as well as other factors in evaluating proposals and in making awards. The number of grant applications has declined since 2002. DOT officials see this as a consequence of the large number of ongoing grants and the impact of 2003 legislative changes. In surveying airport directors we found that grantee airports generally responded positively to DOT's process for awarding grants, about two-thirds were satisfied with the clarity of the selection criteria, while about one-third of directors at airports not receiving grants were satisfied with the clarity. DOT oversight is based on reviews of grantee reports and reimbursement requests, and DOT has terminated some projects and reallocated the unexpended funds to others. Individual grant projects had goals including adding flights, airlines and destinations, lowering fares, obtaining better planning data, increasing enplanements, and curbing the loss of passengers to other airports. Grantees used a number of strategies to achieve their goals, including subsidies and revenue guarantees to the airlines, marketing to the public and to the airlines, hiring personnel and consultants, and establishing travel banks. Results for the 23 projects completed by September 30, 2005 were mixed: about half of the airports reported air service improvements that were self-sustaining after the grant was over. Some projects were not successful due to factors beyond the project, such as an airline decision to reduce flights at a hub. However, it is too soon to assess the overall effectiveness of the program, because most funded projects are not complete--127 of the 157 awarded grants are ongoing. DOT designates one airport each year as an Air Service Development Zone. The communities selected in 2002, 2003, and 2004 expressed similar concerns about the usefulness of this designation. None of the communities could cite any effect the Air Service Development Zone had for them. Instead, communities expressed confusion as to what DOT's designation was supposed to provide."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade significant changes have occurred in the airline  industry that have impacted service to small communities. Today many of  the legacy carriers are facing challenging financial conditions.  Competition from low-cost carriers has contributed to passengers driving  long distances to obtain low fares rather than use their small community  airport. Since 2000, there has been a decrease in the use of small turboprop  aircraft that serve small community airports, with many operators opting  for larger regional jets holding 50 or more passengers. These changes, and  others, have challenged small communities to attract adequate commercial  air service at reasonable prices.", "By establishing the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot  Program in 2000, Congress created a new source of funds to help small,  underserved airports improve their air service. The Congress has  appropriated $20 million annually since 2002 for the Department of  Transportation (DOT) to award up to 40 grants each year to communities  that have demonstrated insufficient air carrier service or unreasonably high  air fares. We reviewed (1) DOT\u2019s implementation of the Small Community  Air Service Development Program and (2) the strategies communities  receiving grants have used and the results obtained by the grants provided  under the program. In addition, this report provides information on factors  affecting air service to small communities, which is included in appendix II.", "To determine how DOT has implemented the Small Community Air Service  Development Program, we reviewed legislation authorizing and funding the  program as well as related orders and guidelines. We interviewed DOT  officials about their grant selection process and criteria. We reviewed grant  award information and examined how DOT used its grant criteria to select  grantees. We also reviewed program controls, receipts, quarterly reports,  and the final reports that grantees submitted. We obtained and reviewed  budget and finance data from DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary as well as  reimbursement data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  which reimburses the grantees. To determine what strategies have been  used and what results have been obtained, we reviewed the grant  applications and agreements for all 157 grants awarded through September  1, 2005. In addition, we reviewed the grants awarded, classified the types of  strategies carried out within the grants, and summarized the types of  activities funded. We also visited each of the 10 grantees that had  completed their grants by December 31, 2004, and interviewed airlines and  aviation consultants associated with these completed grants. We also  contacted 13 additional grantees who completed their projects between  January 1 and September 30, 2005. Further, we conducted two Web-based  surveys. We used self-administered electronic questionnaires posted to the  World Wide Web to survey the 146 airport directors involved in the 122  grants DOT awarded from 2002 through 2004, as well as 116 airport  directors representing airports that applied for, but did not receive a grant  during that period. We received response rates of 83 percent and 72  percent, respectively. To view our surveys and airport directors\u2019 responses,  go to www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-101SP.

Most legacy carriers, free to determine their own routes, developed  \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d networks. These carriers provide nonstop service to  many spoke cities from their hubs. The airports in the small spoke  communities include the smallest airports in the nation\u2019s commercial air  system. Depending on the size of those markets (i.e., the number of  passengers flying nonstop between the hub and the spoke community), the  legacy airlines may operate their own large jets or use regional affiliate  carriers to provide service, usually with regional jet or turboprop aircraft.  (See fig. 1 for an example of a turboprop aircraft.) However, low-cost  carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, use a different  model, flying point-to-point generally to and from secondary airports in or  near major metropolitan areas, such as Ontario International near Los  Angeles and Chicago Midway.", "The nation\u2019s commercial airports are categorized into four main groups  based on the annual number of passenger enplanements\u2014large hubs, medium hubs, small hubs, and nonhubs. The 30 large hubs and 37 medium  hub airports together enplaned the vast majority\u201489 percent\u2014of the  almost 703 million U.S. passengers in 2004, the most recent data available.  In contrast, the 69 small hubs enplaned about 8 percent, and the 374  nonhub airports enplaned only 3 percent of U.S. passengers.", "Air service to nonhub airports has generally declined in recent years, as  measured by the number of departure flights. As shown in figure 2,  nonhubs have had an overall decrease in departures since July 2000. While  all airports showed a decrease in service from July 2001 to July 2003,  scheduled departures at small, medium, and large hub airports have  increased since 2003. By July 2005, scheduled departures at small, medium,  and large hub airports largely rebounded, with departures from large and  small hubs exceeding the July 2000 number. However, the decline of  service at nonhub airports continued, with 17 percent fewer departure  flights serving these airports in July 2005 compared with July 2000. While  small hubs and nonhubs are eligible to apply for Small Community Air  Service Development grants, the nonhub airports have been the main  beneficiaries of the program. As of fiscal year 2005, only 6 percent of the  airports receiving grants have been small hubs.", "This decline in air service to small communities is particularly prevalent at  small community airports that are near larger airports. Passengers  sometimes drive or take other modes of transportation to neighboring  larger airports to take advantage of more frequent flights and lower fares, a  phenomenon called leakage. Appendix II provides more information on the  factors that have influenced the reduction of passenger traffic and air  service at the nation\u2019s small community airports.", "We have previously reported on the decline of air service to small  communities noting the challenges these communities face in obtaining or retaining commercial passenger air service. These challenges include the  lack of demand, inability to operate profitable air service, and competition  from neighboring larger hub airports. Also, according to an aviation  consultant, these factors, plus network carrier financial difficulties and  changes in aircraft usage, have negatively affected nonhubs.", "Two programs have been established to help address air service to small  communities\u2014the Essential Air Service program and the Small Community  Air Service Development Pilot Program. The Congress established the  Essential Air Service program as part of the Airline Deregulation Act of  1978. In general, the program guarantees that communities that received air  service prior to deregulation will continue to receive air service. If an air  carrier could not continue service to a community without incurring a loss,  DOT (and before its sunset, the Civil Aeronautics Board) could then use  Essential Air Service program funds to award a subsidy to that carrier or  another carrier willing to provide service. These subsidies are intended to  cover the difference between a carrier\u2019s projected revenues and expenses,  and include a 5 percent profit margin. Our prior work on the Essential Air  Service program found, in part, that financial incentives may offer the best  opportunity for communities to attract the new or additional service but  that it may be difficult to bring about service that can be sustained after the  incentives end.", "More recently, the Congress authorized the Small Community Air Service  Development Pilot Program as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation  Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, P.L. 106-181 (AIR-21), to  help small communities enhance their air service. AIR-21 authorized the  program for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The Vision 100-Century of Aviation  Reauthorization Act, P.L. 108-176 (Vision 100), reauthorized the program  for an additional 5 years, through fiscal year 2008, and eliminated the  \u201cpilot\u201d status of the program. While Vision 100 increased the annual  authorization amount to $35 million, the Congress has appropriated $20  million for the program each year from 2002 through 2005, for a total of $80  million. No funds were appropriated for the first year of the program, 2001.", "Under this program, DOT is authorized to award grants to up to 40  communities served by small hub or nonhub airports (as classified in 1997)  that have demonstrated air service deficiencies or higher-than-average  airfares. The Office of Aviation Analysis in DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary is  responsible for administering the program. The grants may be made to a  single community or to a consortium of communities, although no more  than four grants each year may be in the same state. Consortiums are  considered one applicant for the purpose of this program. Some relatively  large airports qualify for this program. For example, Buffalo Niagara  International Airport in Buffalo, NY, and Norfolk International Airport in  Norfolk, VA, are eligible for the program, enplaning over 2.2 million and  over 1.8 million passengers in 2004, respectively. In contrast, small nonhub  airports such as the airports in Kake, AK, with about 2,500 enplanements,  or Owensboro, KY, with about 2,800 enplanements, are also eligible. The  program is available in the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and  U.S. territories and possessions.", "The statute also directs DOT to designate one of the grant recipients each  year as an Air Service Development Zone and work closely with the  designated community on ways to attract business to the areas surrounding  the airport and to develop land use options for the area. There are no  additional funds associated with this designation, and no special benefit or  preference is to be given to communities seeking this designation in  receiving a grant under the program. Communities apply for this  designation through the regular grant application process.", "DOT has not issued separate regulations for the Small Community Air  Service Development Program. Instead, DOT issues an order every year  that requests applications and provides guidance for the proper format and  content of the applications. The authorizing legislation provides that if  funds are used to subsidize air service, the subsidy cannot last more than 3  years. However, the time needed to obtain the service is not included in the  subsidy time limit. While the legislation does not limit the period for  expenditure of funds on non-subsidy projects, DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2005 order  indicates that in general, grant funds should be expended within 3 years of  the award.", "As shown in figure 3, DOT\u2019s awards have been geographically spread  covering all states except Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, and  Rhode Island. To date, no communities in Delaware or Rhode Island have  applied for a grant.

In 2002, the first year the  program was funded, DOT received 179 grant applications, but this number  has been declining and was at a low of 84 applications by 2005. DOT  officials believe this decline is natural as the program matures; many  airports are currently implementing grants and others now understand  DOT\u2019s expectation of local matching funds. DOT evaluates the applications  according to legislatively established priority factors and other criteria.  DOT first considers five priority factors specified in the laws and then  considers numerous other factors in a second tier review of the projects.  Certain legislative factors, such as whether a local community can  demonstrate support by contributing some local matching funds, or DOT  factors such as whether an airport has received a grant in the past, were  major considerations in award decisions. In our survey of airport directors,  we found that airports that received grants generally were positive about  DOT\u2019s process for awarding grants. However, only about one-third of the  airports we surveyed that applied for but did not receive a grant expressed  satisfaction over the clarity of selection criteria. DOT\u2019s oversight of  projects relies largely on reviews of reimbursement documents and  required grantee quarterly reports; it does not perform on-site monitoring  visits. DOT monitoring has been sufficient to identify cases where grant  funds have not been utilized and reallocated the funds to other applicants.  As of September 30, 2005, 23 of the grants awarded were completed\u201420 for  2002, 2 for 2003, and 1 for 2004. About $12.5 million, or 62 percent of the  $20 million total funds for 2002 had been expended by grantees as of  September 30, 2005. DOT officials said that the newness of the program in  2002, and the need to negotiate agreements with airlines, help explain why  many early grants are still ongoing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOT Has Awarded 157 Grants Since 2002, but Grant Applications are Declining", "paragraphs": ["To be considered for a Small Community Air Service Development Program  grant, airport communities prepare a grant proposal in response to a notice  in the Federal Register. The applications should discuss, among other  things, the need for additional or improved air service, the available fares at  the airport, and how the grant will help communities address these  situations. From 2002 through 2005, DOT has awarded 157 grants. In the  first year of the program, demand was the highest, with 179 applications  requesting a total of about $142.5 million in federal funding. However, from  2002 through 2005 the program has experienced about a 50 percent decline  in the number of applications. (See fig. 4 for details on the number of  applications, awards, and completed and terminated grants each year.)", "According to officials at DOT\u2019s Office of Aviation Analysis, the downward  trend in the number of applications was a natural consequence of the  implementation of the program. First, many eligible airport communities  have already received a grant and are still implementing their projects\u2014as  of September 30, 2005, 127 of the 157 grants were ongoing. Current  grantees are not likely to reapply soon because many of the projects that  were funded take time to implement, with some taking over 3 years to  complete. Second, Office of Aviation Analysis officials told us that the  airport community has learned that DOT expects that a local cash match  should be part of the proposal and that communities must honor their  committed local contribution for the proposed projects. The officials told  us that some applicants did not fully appreciate this expectation during the  pilot phase of the program. Finally, according to DOT officials, legislative  changes in 2003 prohibited communities or consortiums from receiving  more than one grant for the same project and established the timely use of  funds as a priority factor for DOT to consider in awarding grants.", "Based on our survey, for airports that had applied for but never received a  grant at the time of the survey, 58 of 81 airport directors, or about 72  percent, said that they would reapply. The remaining 23 airport directors  indicated that they would not, or were unsure whether they would apply.  These airport directors cited two primary reasons for not applying\u2014the  cost and effort of applying, or a belief that DOT would not fund their  desired project.", "Finally, some eligible airports have never applied for a grant. To understand  why, we contacted airport directors from a group of 20 randomly selected  airports that had never applied under the program but were eligible to do  so. Although this does not constitute a generalizable sample, it provides  some useful information on the reasons why some communities did not  apply. Among the more common reasons cited by the directors for not  applying were that they did not know about the program, or they felt that  the cost and effort of applying were too burdensome. Among the other  reasons given by more than one airport director were the airport already  had sufficient air service, officials thought the airport was not eligible, their  grant application would not be competitive, or DOT would not fund the  kind of project the airport would like to do.", "In our survey of 2002 though 2004 grantees and discussions with officials of  the 10 completed projects, we found that the grantees were generally  satisfied with the application process and paperwork requirements. Of the  121 grantee airport directors responding, 103 were satisfied or very  satisfied with the application process. In addition, in our discussions with  the directors of the 10 community airports that had completed grant  projects, most were satisfied with the application process, although three  expressed concern about the limited amount of time they had to complete  their applications after the 2002 announcement. In our survey of grantees,  this issue did not appear to be significant, especially in years subsequent to  2002. DOT has made minor modifications in the application process as it  has gained experience with the program, such as allowing 90 days instead  of 60 days to complete the application, and has continued to allow for  flexibility in application format, according to Office of Aviation Analysis  officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Evaluates Grant Applications According to Legislatively Established Priority Factors and DOT Criteria", "paragraphs": ["The Small Community Air Service Development Program is a discretionary  program that allows DOT considerable flexibility in selecting projects for  financial assistance, within the basic eligibility criteria. To be eligible, the  airport cannot be larger than a small hub airport based on 1997 FAA  boarding data and must have insufficient air service or unreasonably high  air fares. In addition to the basic eligibility criteria, DOT must give priority  to projects according to five factors established in the law. These factors  constitute DOT\u2019s Office of Aviation Analysis\u2019 first tier of project evaluation.  DOT must give priority consideration to communities that (1) have air fares  higher than average for all communities, (2) provide a portion of the cost of  the project from local sources other than airport revenues, (3) have or will  establish a public-private partnership to facilitate air carrier service to the  public, (4) will provide material benefits to a broad segment of the public  that has limited access to the national air transportation system, and (5)  will use the assistance in a timely manner. Although a local community  match from nonairport revenues enhances a community\u2019s chance of  receiving a grant, it is not required under the act. However, DOT has funded  only two projects that did not contain a local cash match.", "In addition to the priority factors, DOT has, as part of a second tier  evaluation, other \u201cservice-related\u201d and \u201cproject-related\u201d factors that it takes  into consideration in evaluating competing proposals. (See app. III for a list  of the factors used in DOT selections.) DOT uses this second tier  evaluation to ensure that a project has a strong justification, and the factors  themselves have changed and evolved over time, according to DOT  officials. For example, as part of this second tier evaluation, DOT looked at  15 air service factors to identify whether a carrier served the airport and  reviewed the airport\u2019s existing service frequencies, destinations, aircraft  size, and passenger boardings. It also examined air service in the broader  geographic area, including the applicant community\u2019s proximity to larger  airports and the quality of the roads providing access to those airports.  DOT also considered 26 project-related factors, which include such items  as whether the area\u2019s demographics will support the project or whether the  project actually addressed the community\u2019s air service problem. Some  project-related factors can make it less likely to be selected, including  whether (1) the proposal simply shifted costs from the local to the federal  level, (2) the air service was in proximity to other service that would  detract from the proposal, and (3) the proposal potentially worked at cross  purposes with another grant if the airport is located close to a past grant  recipient.", "DOT has developed review procedures that detail how it processes the  applications that it receives and how it applies this two-tier evaluation of  projects. DOT moved to a more structured process when the Congress, in  December 2003, changed the status of the program, dropping the pilot  designation of the program. For 2004, DOT developed more formal  documentation of its assessment of how well projects met the statutory  eligibility criteria and priority factors for each grant application.", "The DOT application evaluation reports we reviewed have shown how DOT  incorporates the priority factors in its 2004 deliberations and how those  results then translate into the projects it recommends to the Secretary of  Transportation. Generally, applications that meet fewer of the priority  considerations are less likely to be selected for grant assistance. However,  priority factors are not the sole criteria in the final selection. As shown in  table 1, applications that met four or five of the priority factors were not  guaranteed selection. Twelve of the 35 applications that met four out of five  of the priority considerations did not make the final award list, and one  proposal that met all five was not selected. In contrast 13 applications that  met three priority considerations were funded.", "Projects that meet priority factors may not be funded for a number of  reasons. According to a DOT official, a project may meet the priority  factors yet not have any realistic possibility of implementation or success.  DOT may also choose to award a grant to a community that has never  received one before awarding a second grant to another community. DOT\u2019s  review of the priority factors involves determining a yes or no response for  each factor. DOT does not use a weighting or point system or other scoring  system to numerically rate the projects. However, DOT officials told us that  they are aware that, although in some cases a proposal may technically  meet the factor, it may do so very weakly. For example, a project satisfies a  priority factor if it will use nonairport revenues as part of its local  contribution, no matter how small that nonairport contribution may be. On  the other hand, a large non-airport contribution can be viewed as a strong  indicator of community support. The final decisions on which projects are  selected are thus a result of the consideration of both the priority factors  and other factors that affect the quality of the proposal and its perceived  chances of success.", "Once Office of Aviation Analysis staff have reviewed and analyzed the  individual projects, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International  Affairs reviews the staff assessments and finalizes a list of recommended  projects for the Secretary of Transportation. According to Office of  Aviation Analysis staff, through fiscal year 2004, the Secretary had agreed  with the recommended list. In fiscal year 2005, subsequent to the meeting  with the Secretary to review recommended awards, DOT made changes in  the recommended grants. According to Office of Aviation Analysis staff,  this was done to achieve a better balance of participating communities and  a better balance in the distribution of funds.", "Our survey of grantee airports showed that a large majority of the directors  at these airports were satisfied with DOT\u2019s selection criteria and process  for the program, while fewer nongrantee airport directors thought the  selection criteria were clear. Eighty of 121 grantees responding\u2014or 66  percent\u2014were either satisfied or very satisfied with the clarity of the  selection criteria, while only 26 of 82 nongrantee airport directors\u2014or 32  percent\u2014were either satisfied or very satisfied with the clarity of the  selection criteria. A possible explanation for this is that while DOT has  flexibility in making awards and considers many criteria in addition to the  five priority factors, the ultimate selection decision is discretionary. A few  of the fiscal year 2002 airport grantees we visited observed that although  they were pleased they were chosen, they were not sure how grantees are  selected and what criteria were used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Oversees Projects Largely by Reviewing Reimbursement Documents and Reports from Grantees", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s Office of Aviation Analysis staff are responsible for oversight of the  grants and serve as contact points with grantees. For the 2005 program  cycle, six staff were assigned part-time to the program, an increase from  four part-time staff during the program\u2019s first 3 years. DOT uses a  document review approach to oversight in which it requires grantees to  submit quarterly reports that are used to assess a project\u2019s progress and  timeliness. The agency also requires that grantees submit a final report on  the project, which is used as the basis for its overall evaluation of the  project and holds back 10 percent of the grant funds until the receipt of a  final report. DOT operates the program on a reimbursable basis\u2014grantees  must first expend funds from their own resources for project activities and  then request reimbursement from DOT for allowable expenses. To ensure  that government reimbursements are proper and allowable, DOT reviews  expense receipts, invoices, and other evidence of expenditures grantees  submit for reimbursement and, if satisfactory, will authorize FAA to make  payment. DOT and FAA maintain and monitor reimbursement information  on their financial databases. Office of Aviation Analysis officials told us  that they use this approach because performing on-site visits is impractical  given the small number of DOT staff who administer the over 100 active  grantees currently in the program. They also noted that there is no  provision for administrative expenses in the appropriation, thus DOT does  not have funds available for site visits.", "DOT monitoring has been sufficient to identify cases where grant  recipients have been both successful and unsuccessful in implementing  their grants. In those cases where sponsors have difficulty implementing  their projects and are unable to utilize their grant awards, the grants are  terminated and funds reverted back to DOT for reallocation to other  applicants. From 2002 through 2004, DOT reallocated about $4.5 million to  other projects.", "The manner in which DOT administers oversight of grantee  reimbursements and provides assistance generated a favorable response  from grantees. Our survey found that grantees had high levels of  satisfaction with the way DOT monitored the grants and provided  assistance to grantees. Specifically, 108 of 121, or 89 percent, of grantee  airport directors who responded to our survey said that they were satisfied  or very satisfied with DOT\u2019s assistance. Likewise, 96 of 121, or 79 percent,  of responding airport directors were satisfied or very satisfied with DOT\u2019s  monitoring or oversight activities.", "In general, grantees did not see the amount of paperwork required by  DOT\u2019s quarterly reporting mandate as burdensome, with 86 of 121\u201471  percent\u2014of survey respondents being satisfied or very satisfied with this  quarterly reporting requirement. A lower number, 58 of 119\u2014or about half  of airport respondents\u2014said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the  paperwork DOT required for reimbursement and only 5 respondents were  dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.

The only limitation the authorizing legislation places on the timely  expenditure of funds is that air service subsidies cannot last more than 3  years. DOT\u2019s 2004 and 2005 grant announcements set an expectation that  the funds should be used within 3 years. Although this criterion was not  part of the 2002 grant process, it does provide a benchmark for  performance, and 2002 grants are at the 3-year point. As of September 30,  2005, 16 of 40 fiscal year 2002 grants were still active, 20 were completed,  and 4 had been terminated by DOT. About 62 percent of the $20 million  total 2002 program grant allocation had been reimbursed to 2002 grantees.  In addition, 58 grants are scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2006.

According to the officials, a number of factors contributed to the  2002 projects being delayed. First year grants were not awarded until late  fall of 2002. In addition, the airlines were at that time still recovering  following September 11, which made it difficult for communities to attract  new service. Many projects included revenue guarantees, which can take  some time to finalize. Finally, communities may wait to ask for  reimbursements after several months of expenditures, which slows the  payout of federal funds. The reimbursement data indicate that the 2003  grants also experienced low reimbursements the first year. Only about 11  percent of the 2003 grant funds were reimbursed by the end of calendar  2004.", "Finally, it should be noted that when a project includes a revenue  guarantee, the slow expenditure of funds does not always indicate a  problem. Revenue guarantees are only paid out if the airline fails to meet a  revenue target. If it meets the target, no funds are drawn down, which may  actually be an indication of project success. For example, the $500,000  grant award to Rhinelander, WI, included almost $492,000 for a revenue  guarantee. However, upon project completion, Rhinelander had used about  $254,000 for the revenue guarantee. According to the airport director, the  new route initiated under the grant generated more revenue for the airline  during the grant period than had been expected. Therefore, the airport did  not have to reimburse the airline as much as it had anticipated.", "As part of our survey of grantees, we asked whether their projects were  proceeding on schedule, and, if not, why they were proceeding more slowly  than expected. About 40 percent\u201442 of 106\u2014of the grantee airport  directors reported that their projects are behind schedule, including 11 of  26 airport directors surveyed who were involved in implementing grants  awarded in 2002. (See table 3.) Most of these respondents, 23 of the 42,  cited difficulties in entering and finalizing agreements with the airlines as  the main reason for the delay. Grantees we surveyed also cited other  reasons for delays, including issues with airport personnel and among the  grant consortium, operational changes at Chicago O\u2019Hare airport, and the  need to coordinate the grant with the Essential Air Service program.", "On a case-by-case basis, DOT has approved a number of grant  amendments, including extending the grant expiration date, to projects that  have been slow to be implemented. As of July 26, 2005, DOT had amended a  total of 47 grants, including 27 of the 2002 grants. For example,  Binghamton, NY, wanted to obtain enhanced service to Washington, D.C.,  via United Express and Detroit, MI, via Northwest Airlink by providing the  airlines with revenue guarantees. According to officials from the Office of  Aviation Analysis, there was some delay because of difficulties in  negotiating with the airlines. DOT agreed to extend the grant expiration  date, allowing Binghamton extra time to work out agreements with United  and Northwest. However, during these extended negotiations, the airlines  told Binghamton that they would agree to provide the enhanced service  only if the community offered subsidies rather than revenue guarantees. As  a result, DOT also allowed Binghamton to amend its grant to provide the  airlines with subsidies rather than revenue guarantees to better  accommodate the airlines\u2019 requirements. Another example is the grant  agreement amendment DOT provided Lamar, CO. Lamar did not have any  commercial service prior to its grant award. The purpose of the grant was  to obtain service from Rio Grande Airlines to access scheduled service to  Denver International Airport. Lamar was not successful in obtaining  service from Rio Grande Airlines and instead obtained service to Denver\u2019s  Front Range Airport from Lamar Flying Service, a charter carrier. The  Office of Aviation Analysis agreed to amend Lamar\u2019s grant to allow Lamar  Flying Service the time to expand its base of operations and establish  dependable air transportation. Lamar subsequently provided four  scheduled trips a week to Denver International Airport and has since been  able to upgrade its aircraft."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Variety of Goals and Strategies to Improve Air Service are Used, but the Results to Date of Completed Projects are Mixed", "paragraphs": ["The Small Community Air Service Development Program allows  communities to set a variety of goals for projects, and individual projects  have been directed at adding flights, airlines, and destinations; lowering  fares; changing the aircraft serving the community; completing a study for  planning and marketing air service; increasing enplanements; and curbing  the leakage of passengers to other airports. To achieve these goals, grant  sponsors have used a number of strategies, commonly including subsidies  and revenue guarantees to the airlines, marketing to the public and to the  airlines, hiring personnel and consultants, and establishing travel banks in  which a community guarantees to buy a certain number of tickets. In  addition, communities have employed a number of other strategies,  including buying an aircraft, subsidizing the start-up of an airline, and  taking over ground station operations to reduce the costs for an airline. The  outcomes of the grants may be affected by broader industry factors that are  independent of the grant itself, such as larger strategic decisions on the  part of the airlines. Our evaluation of completed projects indicates mixed  results, but only 23 of 157 projects were completed as of September 30,  2005. While officials at 19 of the 23 airports reported improvements to air  service or fares during the life of the grant, only about half said that the  improvements appeared to be self-sustaining.

Recapturing passenger traffic\u2014that is, stopping leakage to other  airports\u2014was also a frequent objective that increased in importance each  year of the program. In contrast, conducting a study of the local market or  changing the type of aircraft serving the community were relatively  infrequent goals. By 2004, relatively few airports cited these goals for their  grants. Finally, although addressing high fares is an explicit goal of the  program, lowering fares was cited as an objective by 62 airport directors of  the 146 airport directors over the 3-year span."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grant Projects Use Many Different Strategies to Meet Their Goals", "paragraphs": ["Grantees engaged in a number of strategies to meet their goals, including  various financial incentives, marketing, studies, and other approaches.

Ground  personnel such as baggage handlers and ticket agents become airport  employees and may be shared among the airlines. Airlines pay for these  services, but their cost can be lower than if provided by the airline itself.", "Marketing support generally took a variety of forms, including mass media  such as television, radio, magazine and newspaper advertising, outdoor  advertising such as billboards and banners, direct mail, internet advertising  including using the airport web site, airport special events such as open  houses, frequent flyer promotions, travel agent incentives, and other  approaches. Figure 6 shows an example of the use of outdoor advertising in  one of the marketing projects funded by the grants.", "The Small Community Air Service Development Program also has funded  studies and various other approaches. For example, in 2002, DOT awarded  the Aleutians East Borough in Alaska a $240,000 grant to study the air  service market for some rural airports in the lower Alaskan peninsula and  the eastern Aleutian Islands. DOT also subsequently awarded the Aleutians  East Borough $70,000 in 2003 to expand the study. Finally, other  approaches have included developing alternative ground services such as  bus service to nearby hubs and funding personnel such as airport economic  development staff positions or consultants.", "We reviewed the grant applications and agreements for all 157 grants  awarded from 2002 through 2005. Projects commonly include more than  one strategy, such as combining a revenue guarantee with marketing for the  air service provided under the grant. Over time, a few trends can be seen in  the strategies used by communities. First, while marketing activities have  always been heavily used as a strategy, by 2004 marketing had virtually  become a universal strategy. All 46 grants\u2014the initial 40 DOT awarded plus  the 6 additional grants awarded with reallocated prior year grant funds\u2014 included marketing as a component. Second, the number of projects using  direct subsidies and travel banks declined by 2004 and remained low in  2005, while the number of projects using revenue guarantees increased  after 2002. Revenue guarantees have been the most common form of  financial assistance each year of the program. Figure 7 provides a summary  of the types of strategies communities have used under the program.", "Because marketing was such a heavily used strategy, we contacted all 23  airports that had completed their grants by September 30, 2005, to  determine what types of marketing they actually did. We found that 22 of  the 23 completed grants had included some kind of marketing component  to encourage greater use of the airport or the airlines that fly there; the lone  exception was a grant which funded a study only. All 22 grantees used  newspaper advertising, 21 used radio advertising, and 21 used the  Internet\u2014for example, the airport Web site. Television and outdoor  advertising were also common strategies, 17 grantees used television and  18 used outdoor advertising. After these strategies, the most common  forms of marketing were airport special events (14 projects), magazine ads  (12 projects), and direct mail (11 projects).

We contacted each of the airlines associated with the 10 projects  completed by January 1, 2005, including Continental Airlines, Delta Air  Lines, Horizon Airlines, Rio Grande Air, TransStates Airlines, US Airways,  and Westward Airways. Although their comments do not constitute a  comprehensive analysis of industry views of the grant program, they  provide a useful perspective on how participating airlines view the  program. Several airline officials noted that reducing financial risk has  become a key factor for airline and airport officials and consultants we  interviewed also made this observation. Finally, airline officials said they  perform their own due diligence doing market analyses of the airports, the  competitive situation, and route finances regardless of what a local study  says.", "Airlines face challenges when initiating air service to a community. Start-up  costs can be significant and include repositioning equipment, renting  space, and hiring and training personnel. Also, even if a viable air travel  market exists in a community, entering a new market involves changing  passengers\u2019 existing travel patterns and loyalties, which may take time.  Airline officials noted that given the current financial condition of the  industry, airlines cannot afford to take a year of losses to build a customer  base in a market, as they had in the past. For this reason, airline officials  stated that they often could not enter smaller markets without some kind of  revenue guarantee, such as that provided by a Small Community Air  Service Development Program grant, or other financial support from the  community.", "Airline officials emphasized that for a project to be of interest to them, the  market must be potentially self-sustaining without subsidy or revenue  guarantee in the longer term. The grant will eventually end and airlines do  not wish to start over in another market, with the accompanying costs and  risks. Airline officials also emphasized the importance of local funding to  provide marketing for the new service; for some airlines, this was a crucial  factor in selecting the community. A related observation by airline officials  was that the level of local support and commitment to air service was a key  factor in their decision to work with a local community. The Small  Community Air Service Development Program has this component of local  commitment, which some airline officials saw as important. In addition,  some airline officials said that the overall project (grant and local match)  must be sufficiently large to gain their interest. Finally, most airline officials  were unfavorably disposed toward travel banks citing the difficulty in  administering them and their poor track record of success. However, one  airline official said they had been involved with successful travel banks and  was open to the prospect of trying that strategy again.", "All airline officials we talked to had positive views of the Small Community  Air Service Development Program. Several officials stated that the program  was superior to the Essential Air Service program because it addressed  markets that were potentially self-sustaining but were underserved.  However, in one case, airline officials said they were concerned about  communities using the program to attract low-cost carriers to compete  with existing service they were already providing to the community. Office  of Aviation Analysis officials noted that higher than average fares is a  statutory criterion for priority consideration in the selection of grantees, so  introducing a low-cost carrier into a community is an acceptable strategy  for a community under the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completed Grants Indicated Mixed Results", "paragraphs": ["We contacted officials of the 23 Small Community Air Service Development  Program grant projects that were complete by September 30, 2005, and  compared them against the program\u2019s goals of improved air service and  found that there were mixed results. In general, we found that the airport  officials reported almost all the completed projects had some positive  effect on air service during the life of the grant, but in some cases the  improvements did not remain after the initial grant period, or that the  improvements were not self-sustaining. For most completed grants, 19 of  the 23, airport officials reported some kind of improvement in service,  either in terms of an added carrier, destination, flights, or change in the  type of aircraft. Of the 23, 8 reported adding a new carrier, 13 a new  destination, and 13 an increase in the number of flights. In addition, 13  reported that some fares had lowered at the airport during the grant. These  service and fare improvements may explain the positive effect on  enplanements the airport officials reported\u201419 grantees reported  enplanements rose during the course of the grant. However, the  improvements seen during the grant did not always continue afterwards.  Fourteen of the 23 grantees reported that the improvements were still in  place as of October 1, 2005. Further, there is the question of whether the  service or fare improvement is self-sustaining and will continue without  additional funding. About half the grantees with completed grants\u201411 of  the 23 grantees\u2014reported that the improvements they experienced as a  result of the program were self-sustaining thus far. It should be noted that  these outcomes are preliminary. Thirteen of these grants were completed in  2005, and determining whether a particular project is successful may  depend on the timeframe used. For example, Westward Airways was able  to initially provide service to Scottsbluff, NE, under the grant, but later  went out of business.", "We also visited 10 airports that had completed grants by January 1, 2005, in  order to gain a more detailed understanding of the outcomes of their  projects (app. V contains discussion of each of these). Of these, five  projects\u2014Charleston, WV; Daytona Beach, FL; Hailey, ID; Lynchburg, VA;  and Mobile, AL, were generally successful in achieving their goals and had  made self-sustaining improvements to air service at the time of our review.", "Charleston was able to add a new air carrier (Continental) and  destination (Houston). However, Continental subsequently reduced the  number of daily flights from two to one. Charleston officials said this  was a result of a larger strategic allocation of equipment by Continental,  and the airline later restored this second flight to Charleston.", "Daytona Beach\u2019s objective was to add service to Newark, NJ, which has  remained in place after the grant was completed. After the grant was  completed, Continental extended its agreement with the airport. DOT  officials said that Continental has also expanded its service at the  community to additional destinations.", "Hailey successfully added air service to Los Angeles via Horizon Airlines  (see fig. 8). Although the service continues, it does not operate all year  long due to the seasonal nature of demand to this resort community.  After the grant expired, a local resort funded the revenue guarantee to  Horizon, indicating that the service was initially not self-sustaining.", "However, Horizon now offers the service without a grant guarantee. In  addition, the grant helped convince Horizon to add another flight to a  new destination, Oakland, CA.", "Lynchburg, VA, was able to upgrade service to Atlanta from 30-seat  turboprops to 50-seat regional jets through a revenue guarantee. The  new jet service resulted in higher load factors on the larger regional jets  than on the smaller turboprops due to increased demand. This service  also has continued after the completion of the grant. DOT officials said  that the community has also succeeded in negotiating, with its carrier,  relative fare parity with the carrier\u2019s operations with a nearby airport.", "Mobile, AL, established an innovative program to assume the ground  operations, including baggage handling and staffing ticket counters for  US Airways, which was about to abandon service to the airport,  according to an airline official. US Airways has maintained its  operations in Mobile, and the airport has expanded this program, with  American Airlines joining the ground operations service.", "The four projects that did not result in self-sustaining improvements in air  service were Fort Smith, AR; Reading, PA; Scottsbluff, NE; and Taos, NM.", "Ft. Smith provides an example of how larger events in the aviation  industry can affect the outcome of the grant. Ft. Smith obtained the air  service it sought under the grant, however, American Airlines\u2019 strategic  decision to reduce the number of flights at its St. Louis hub resulted in  Ft. Smith losing the service.", "In the case of Reading, PA, the grant may have had a negative effect on  air service. The grant established a bus service from Reading Airport to  the Philadelphia airport, with the goal of demonstrating that air travel  demand existed in Reading and service could be added to the airport.  However, the bus service provided competition to the existing air carrier  at Reading, which subsequently withdrew its service. The bus service  ultimately failed (although a private operator has re-established bus  service without subsidy), and Reading was left for a time without any  scheduled air service.", "Scottsbluff, NE, was initially successful in resuming an intrastate air  service between Scottsbluff, North Platte, Lincoln, and Omaha via start- up air carrier Westward Airways. This service did not reach the  expected level of enplanements and Westward Airways, which was able  to begin operations with the help of the grant, ceased operations in July  2005.", "Taos, NM, was not able to achieve sufficient enplanements to make its  air service self-sufficient, and Rio Grande Air, the small carrier that  provided the service to Taos, went bankrupt.", "Finally, it is too early to determine whether the $95,000 grant to Somerset,  KY, may be considered a success. The purpose of the grant was to conduct  a study, which has been successfully completed. However, the ultimate goal  of the program and the grant is to improve or attract air service. Because  the community received a second grant in 2005, it will be possible in the  future to determine the ultimate outcome of the initial and subsequent  grants. Until the results of Somerset\u2019s efforts to attract service are known,  it is too soon to evaluate this grant.", "Some of the 10 grantees we visited identified additional positive and  negative indirect effects not anticipated at the time of the grant. For  example, one airport cited increased community involvement as a positive  outgrowth of the grant\u2014it helped forge ties between the airport and  business community that were not there before. In addition, the study  performed with grant funding fostered better community understanding of  the local airline market. In a few instances, services begun under the grant  stimulated other air service not part of the grant such as attracting other  new service or improved service by a competing carrier. Conversely, some  airport officials were concerned that grants to nearby competing airports  could dilute effects of the grant at their airports. An airport official and an  industry consultant also expressed concern that the program was no longer  producing innovative ideas. Instead, some airports were copying  approaches that had been funded in the past as a way to improve their  chances of receiving a grant.", "Because a large majority of Small Community Air Service Development  Project grants are not complete (127 of the 157 grants were ongoing as of  September 30, 2005), it is too soon to determine which strategies have  performed the best or assess the overall effectiveness of this program to  improve air service to small communities. However, in addition to the  preliminary results from the projects we studied, comments from DOT  officials, airport directors, and airline officials provide some indications of  what strategies that had positive results. Airline officials saw projects that  provide direct financial benefits to the airline, such as revenue guarantees,  as having the greatest chance of success. These officials noted that these  types of projects allow the airline to test the real market for air service in a  community without enduring the typical financial losses that occur when  new air service is introduced. Airline officials also said that marketing  efforts were important for success. DOT and some airline officials doubted  the effectiveness of travel banks, in part because of the difficulty with  administering the program. Finally, one strategy that airport and airline  officials found innovative was for airports to take over the airlines\u2019 ground  station operations, such as ticketing and baggage handling. Only two  airports have used this strategy under the program, so it is too early to tell  if this model will be more widely adopted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Airport Directors Indicated That Their Grant Projects Were Effective or That It Was Too Soon to Tell", "paragraphs": ["Most grantee airport directors we surveyed indicated that their projects  were at least partially successful or that it is too early to make an  assessment.

Examining the effectiveness of this program when more projects are  complete would allow the evaluation of whether additional or improved air  service was not only obtained but whether it continues after the grant  support has expired. This may be particularly important since our work on  the limited number of completed projects found that only about half of the  grantees reported that the improvements were self-sustaining after the  grant was complete. In addition, our prior work on the Essential Air Service  program found that once incentives are removed, additional air service  may be difficult to maintain. Over the next year, an additional 58 projects  are scheduled to expire and examining the results from completed grants at  that time may provide a clearer picture of the value of this program. Any  improved service achieved from this program could then be weighed  against the cost to achieve those gains.

First, many network carriers have cut service to small  communities while carriers face financial difficulties and restructure their  operations. Regional carriers now operate at small communities where  network carriers have withdrawn. Second, regional carriers are phasing out  turboprops in favor of regional jets, which has had a negative effect on  small communities that have not generated the passenger levels needed to  support regional jet service. Third, the \u201cCommuter Rule\u201d that FAA enacted  in 1997 might have also had an effect. This rule was intended to bring small  commuter aircraft operated under the same safety standards as larger  aircraft. This change created challenges for small communities because it  is more difficult to economically operate smaller aircraft such as 19-seat  turboprops under the new safety requirements. In addition, the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act instituted the same security requirements  for the screening of passengers for smaller airports as it did for larger  airports, creating a \u201chassle factor\u201d for passengers. Fourth, low cost  carriers have emerged in the deregulated environment, but these airlines  have generally avoided small communities, leading to the phenomenon of  \u201cleakage\u201d\u2014that is, passengers choosing to drive to a larger airport instead  of the small community airport.

Thus, according to an aviation consultant,  regional jets have not been a direct substitution for turboprops on routes;  rather, regional jets may fly to denser passenger markets where they can  profitably operate. Another trend that might negatively affect service to  small communities is that some airlines have been procuring more 70 and  90 seat aircraft. According to the FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years  2005-2016, because the larger aircraft allow for longer flight lengths, new  markets may be tapped for point-to-point service that will by-pass  congested hub airports. We have reported in the past that small  communities may have particular difficulty attracting regional jet service  because their passenger demand could not support it.", "In addition, an aviation consultant and industry airline association official  both stated that scope clauses in labor agreements between regional and  network carriers can constrain regional airlines in the aircraft size, routes,  and airports served.

The additional costs required to  meet the increased safety standards made some smaller aircraft  uneconomical to operate.

According to  the FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2005-2016, in 1998, 1 year after  the implementation of the Commuter Rule, the number of city pairs  serviced by the regional or commuter carriers fell to its lowest level of the  decade.

At  that time, the service was discontinued because the airline went bankrupt.  An airline official from Rio Grande Airline told us that the support from the  community had not sustained after the Small Community Air Service  Development Program funding was completed. He also told us that there  were many setbacks that the grant could not control, such as a tremendous  drought in the region leading to a weak ski season, a major forest fire that  caused a drop in enplanements and a drop in the overall economy after  September 11. Additionally, the Rio Grande official told us that the airline  needed more planes to improve their economies of scale to support itself.  The official also told us that an airline cannot succeed if all the overhead  costs have to be applied to just two aircraft, since the aircraft become too  expensive to operate.", "However, the Rio Grande official told us that the service, when operating,  helped build enplanements and a steady growth in passengers for Taos. An  airport official told us that the project was a success because the  community had a taste of air service and that there is now a demand for  service from Taos to Albuquerque. Table 12 shows the passenger traffic for  Rio Grande Airways from the 2002 grant application year through May  2004.", "In 2003, Taos and a consortium of New Mexico communities received  another Small Community Air Service Development grant. The grant  provided intrastate service for Gallup, Taos, and Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The new service began in December 2004 and was provided by Westward  Airways.
