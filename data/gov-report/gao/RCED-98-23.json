To balance the budget, the government is cutting discretionary spending, and R&D funding is expected to decline by about 14 percent between fiscal years 1997 and 2002. Twenty-two federal departments and agencies receive federal R&D funding, and 17 of the 22 own 514 R&D laboratories and T&E centers.

Funds from these three sources were estimated to total more than $184 billion in 1996. While industry contributes a larger share overall, federal research is essential where the risk is too great for private companies to make investments or where the public benefit is large despite small private return. For example, about 60 percent of the basic research performed in the United States is funded by the federal government. U.S. industry also depends heavily on federal research and development for the innovations that drive productivity and new products.", "Twenty-two federal departments and independent agencies receive federal R&D funding for projects in six fundamental research areas: national security, health and safety, energy security, environmental protection and cleanup, industrial competitiveness, and fundamental science. As shown in table 1.1, 17 of the 22 organizations own 514 RDT&E facilities, 62 of which are operated by nongovernment entities\u2014for-profit businesses, universities, or other nonprofit organizations under contracts or cooperative agreements with a federal agency, some of which are federally funded research and development centers (FFRDC). Sixty-five of these RDT&E facilities also operate a total of 221 additional satellite locations. Much of the R&D funding the Congress provides to agencies is passed on to laboratories and centers operated by other agencies, universities, or the private sector. For example, DOE carries out over $1 billion in research and development for other agencies each year. Most of the federal government\u2019s research and development is conducted under contract with industry and universities\u2014not in government-owned and -operated laboratories.", "The federal RDT&E network is complex and definitions of what constitutes RDT&E infrastructure can vary significantly. For example, the number of laboratories counted depends upon the definition used for the term \u201claboratory.\u201d In fact, not all agencies use that term. A NASA \u201cCenter of Excellence\u201d is an overall capability that resides within a center or laboratory. Likewise, DOD differentiates strictly its R&D laboratories from its T&E centers. The \u201cinfrastructure\u201d associated with these facilities often has varying definitions. (See the glossary for agency definitions of key terms.) Figure 1.1 shows the number of RDT&E facilities located in each of the 50 states (as of February 1996). 4 DOD, NASA, and DOE combined own most of the federal RDT&E infrastructure. This infrastructure consists of thousands of buildings and large acreage of government property. More than 180,000 research and support personnel work in these facilities (see table 1.2). Their numbers vary greatly by agency and by facility. DOD facilities may have as few as 18 or as many as 20,000 employees. NASA facilities may have as few as 206 or as many as 6,104 employees.

These organizations report to dozens of congressional committees and subcommittees. Further, each RDT&E facility generally does not receive its funding in a large allocation. For example, each DOE laboratory budget is comprised of individual funding decisions by the Department\u2019s senior management and program managers and by other agencies.", "The $72 billion appropriation for the conduct of federal R&D in fiscal year 1997 represented only about 4 percent of the total budget but about 14 percent of discretionary funding. About $2.2 billion also was appropriated separately for RDT&E facilities. Of the $72 billion, about 72 percent was to be used by DOD, NASA, and DOE, the three largest laboratory systems. As seen in figure 1.2, DOD received about $37.3 billion, or about 52 percent of the total. In addition to R&D funding, this amount includes funding for T&E facilities and a significant amount of it is spent to support work in DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories and with NASA. In fact, DOE\u2019s weapons laboratories receive more than one-half of their R&D funding from DOD.", "While most agencies break out R&D into the three categories of basic research, applied research, and development, DOD divides its RDT&E account into seven categories (basic research, exploratory development, advanced technology development, demonstration and validation, engineering and manufacturing development, management and support, and operational systems support). Finally, NASA received about $9 billion and DOE received about $5.3 billion.", "The President\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget projected a significant decline in research and development (see fig. 1.3).

However, for fiscal year 1998, the Congress approved increases greater than the expected 2.5-percent rate of inflation for every major R&D funding agency except the Departments of Agriculture and Transportation. Moreover, the Congress funded only the fiscal year 1998 installment of the administration\u2019s request for almost $1 billion in construction costs of various R&D facilities.

DOD plans to reduce RDT&E funding every year until fiscal year 2001 and then projects a small increase for fiscal year 2002.

Recommendations included focusing unclear missions, aligning laboratory activities with DOE goals, consolidating facilities, and replacing its cumbersome, inefficient management structure. In particular, the 1995 Task Force on Alternative Futures for the Department of Energy National Laboratories (the Galvin Task Force) reported DOE\u2019s entire laboratory system could be reduced productively by eliminating obsolete and redundant missions and supporting infrastructure.", "Although it did not make specific recommendations to consolidate NASA infrastructure, the 1995 Foster Task Force reported that it found overlaps in capabilities at NASA and other agencies and recommended that NASA should reduce redundant capabilities among its centers.

Previously, DOD and NASA established integrated product teams and then alliances to improve coordination between their laboratories. However, interagency rivalries hampered their efforts. Further, some areas either started slowly or have not started at all. More importantly, these teams had no explicit goal to identify ways to reduce their infrastructures through this effort. As a result, their efforts achieved minimal infrastructure reduction to date.", "Although agencies say that they assess continuously the infrastructure required to fulfill their mission requirements through their strategic planning processes, in some cases, instead of restructuring their infrastructure to support core missions, agencies have expanded missions to preserve existing infrastructure. Rather than expanding the agency\u2019s mission, NASA has focused and redefined its centers\u2019 missions.

The lack of repair of aged facilities may reflect the realities of recent deficit reduction efforts and associated funding priorities. In addition, excess capacity and aged facilities in DOE, for example, may continue to exist because facilities suffer from toxic contamination that cannot be disposed of currently or is too costly to decontaminate and decommission.

R&D laboratories and T&E centers later were reviewed independently using different methodologies. Also, the services protected their own facilities, which undermined the BRAC process. The services did not adopt scenarios that could have eliminated excess T&E infrastructure and could not agree on comparable definitions of laboratories and centers or potential realignments or closures, since they were unwilling to collocate or rely on each other. Thus, BRAC 1995 resulted in little joint cross-servicing.", "Upon expiration of BRAC legislation and full implementation of previous BRAC recommendations, DOD and the Congress realized that RDT&E infrastructure needed to be reduced further. Because DOD was unable to do it on its own, the Congress directed the Secretary of Defense, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (sec. 277), to develop a 5-year plan to consolidate and restructure DOD\u2019s RDT&E facilities for the 21st century. The Secretary of Defense was to specify the administrative and legislative actions needed to consolidate RDT&E facilities into as few as practical and possible by October 1, 2005. The Secretary of Defense responded with a plan and developed a legislative package entitled Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Vision 21, Reduction, Restructuring and Revitalization Act of 1997 (commonly referred to as Vision 21). DOD initially sought unilateral authority to reduce its RDT&E infrastructure. However, while the legislative package was being reviewed for interagency coordination, officials from OMB told DOD that it must include an independent commission in the Vision 21 process, since DOD has historically been unable to reduce significantly its RDT&E infrastructure.", "DOD officials consider Vision 21 the equivalent of a BRAC round for RDT&E facilities. DOD officials structured Vision 21 to incorporate the lessons learned from BRAC 1995 concerning the decision-making process, which had resided solely with the services. Thus, Vision 21 became another DOD opportunity for interservice consolidations. Moreover, DOD\u2019s plan incorporated most of the critical elements used by the Boeing Company Defense & Space Group and the Defence Research Agency, such as the collection of accurate, reliable, and comparable data that captured the total cost associated with RDT&E operations and an analysis of the data along functional lines and related directly to the agency\u2019s overall mission. The legislative package was modified to include a provision for an independent commission outside of DOD to make the final realignment and closure recommendations to the Congress.", "Vision 21 did not contain any provision to review related or duplicative facilities in other agencies, however, because the Congress, in section 277, did not direct DOD to seek interagency cooperation. Moreover, DDR&E officials want to rationalize DOD\u2019s RDT&E facilities before addressing issues inherent in analyzing NASA and DOE facilities as well.", "More recently, the Quadrennial Defense Review called for two additional BRAC rounds for fiscal years 1999 and 2001. DOD decided not to submit its legislative package for Vision 21 and instead opted to include RDT&E infrastructure in any future BRAC round, again rejecting efforts that would result in interservice consolidation and delaying this opportunity to implement the critical elements used in the Boeing Company Defense & Space Group\u2019s and the Defence Research Agency\u2019s restructuring. Since the Congress has not accepted DOD\u2019s BRAC legislative package and DOD\u2019s recommendation for two new BRAC rounds in 1999 and 2001, it remains unclear whether DOD will attempt to consolidate and restructure its RDT&E infrastructure and how it might proceed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although there are no easy solutions for how a successful consolidation process can be used to restructure and reduce RDT&E infrastructure throughout the federal system, our review indicates that lessons from the Boeing Company Defense & Space Group and British Ministry of Defence models could be applied successfully to federal agencies.", "A Catalyst to Spark Action. Catalysts that precipitated successful laboratory consolidations by the Boeing Company Defense & Space Group and the British Ministry of Defence (i.e., severe fiscal constraints, structural changes that shift significantly control of budgets, mission failures, etc.) are not affecting federal agencies in ways that effect bold actions. In an enterprise as broad and diverse as the federal laboratory system, the potential effects of catalysts such as \u201cbudget crises\u201d may be averted for years because the impacts of funding reductions and mission shifts can often be delayed indefinitely. It is well understood by many laboratory managers and budgeteers, however, that a federal budget \u201ccrunch\u201d precipitated, in part by continued decreases in federal discretionary spending, is \u201cright around the corner.\u201d Considering conditions that exist in the federal laboratory systems, now is the time to act.", "An Independent Authority to Direct Restructuring. Many government officials responsible for directing federal RDT&E activities, as well as academic and industry representatives, have said that significant barriers impede successful infrastructure reduction efforts. Further, many of them agree that, while a more rational R&D infrastructure is needed, agencies have been unable to achieve significant infrastructure reductions alone because they face intractable barriers. They further conclude that an independent, external panel or commission would be crucial to making significant reductions. At various times, some members of Congress, the GAO, and others, having reached similar conclusions, have called for consideration of this option for DOE, NASA, and DOD laboratories or T&E centers.", "However, there is little agreement on how to structure an independent authority to focus on governmentwide reductions of RDT&E infrastructure, and no agreement exists on the scope of the restructuring to be attempted. Such an approach could only succeed if both the Congress and the administration agree that change is necessary and openly demonstrate the willingness to scale the federal RDT&E infrastructure to better meet national needs.", "Core Missions That Support Organizational Goals and Strategies. Although federal laboratories acknowledge the need to focus their core missions better, they have been incapable of doing so on their own. However, it is taken for granted that missions must be refocused around agency core functions if they are to meet impending fiscal constraints. Existing legislative frameworks, such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act), could be used to determine and establish appropriate core missions for each laboratory in the federal RDT&E system. The Results Act already engages agencies and the Congress in a dialogue about missions and performance. In addition, alternative approaches to reducing infrastructure, but also requiring legislative action, include the following:", "Establish an independent commission with the authority to (1) review and evaluate the agencies\u2019 R&D laboratory and T&E center missions, (2) conduct comparative analyses of the RDT&E capabilities and capacities, and (3) make recommendations regarding mission focus and infrastructure reductions to the Congress and the administration.", "Prepare for a comprehensive RDT&E infrastructure reduction effort by having an independent authority begin a \u201cpilot program\u201d to focus on one or two lines of research or documented areas of duplication, redundancy, or excess capacity. Potential areas or commodities include chemical and biological warfare agents, solar power, nuclear nonproliferation, or energetics.", "Amend current mandates, such as section 277 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, to require interagency analyses in decision-making regarding reductions of RDT&E infrastructure.", "The Full Scope of Infrastructure Clearly Delineated. Agency efforts to identify and disclose the scope and capabilities of their RDT&E infrastructure, which have only recently emerged, have not yet been used for infrastructure reductions. The computerized Major Facilities Inventory, which includes more than 1,494 RDT&E facilities operated by DOE, NASA, and DOD, as well as R&D facilities owned by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, is a first step and could provide data to set the stage for reductions.

The missions of R&D laboratories and T&E centers are being redefined within a changed global environment as agencies compete for scarce federal resources. Future pressures to reduce discretionary spending governmentwide suggest that, without changes now, a greater share of science funding will be devoted to operating and maintaining an aged, inefficient, and costly infrastructure at the expense of research and development. The current condition, although unsettled, provides an opportunity to shape the future in a way that ensures an efficient and rational RDT&E infrastructure is in place to support current and future science priorities.", "Adjusting the federal infrastructure to meet the most important current and future RDT&E requirements is an enormous task that has, to date, proven to be intractable. Cultural and parochial barriers have, in large part, been responsible for federal agencies\u2019 inability to achieve a major restructuring of RDT&E facilities within and across the agencies. As is apparent in reviewing the restructuring process of the Boeing Company\u2019s Defense & Space Group and the British Defence Research Agency, the use of an independent authority to direct the process was key to achieving streamlined RDT&E operations and infrastructure. The approaches taken by individual agencies have not been sufficient to balance the federal RDT&E infrastructure with focused core missions and has resulted in concerns about mission overlap and duplication and the retention of excess capacity. For example, the September 1997 plans submitted by these agencies as mandated by the Results Act did not use cross-agency criteria for assessing missions as required by the Results Act.", "The critical elements of the best practices model we analyzed, when compared to ongoing efforts in the federal government, suggest approaches that could prove successful. However, consensus must be reached that significant changes in the RDT&E infrastructure would better position federal agencies to support current and future science priorities through a more efficient and rational RDT&E infrastructure possible.", "First, we encourage the federal departments and independent agencies to continue their individual efforts to achieve management efficiencies in their respective RDT&E infrastructure restructuring efforts, but with an increased focus on interagency approaches. Cross-agency efforts to support an RDT&E infrastructure restructuring process could begin in the executive branch with two agencies: (1) OSTP, which has technical cognizance across the federal RDT&E arena, but no direct means to effect change and (2) OMB, which is responsible for helping to maintain effective government by reviewing the organizational structure and management procedures of executive branch agencies and developing efficient coordinating mechanisms to implement government activities and expand interagency cooperation.", "Although these agencies have engaged DOE, NASA, and DOD in internal reviews, such as OSTP\u2019s recently established NSTC Interagency Working Group, no independent mechanism exists to undertake a structured approach for streamlining the overall federal RDT&E infrastructure, that is, looking at the infrastructure of individual agencies in support of the government\u2019s broader strategies and missions. OMB, in responding to a draft of this report, said that it prefers to see federal RDT&E infrastructure examined as a whole only after reductions using the current agency-by-agency approaches are completed.", "Ultimately, however, many of the structural and other barriers that exist between agencies go beyond those found at the agency level. Initiating a governmentwide process that includes all five elements discussed in this report could mitigate virtually all of the parochial concerns that stymied past efforts to restructure.", "Establishing an independent decision-making authority could ensure that all elements of the process are administered fairly. In implementing the process described in this report, such an authority could benefit from information developed through ongoing initiatives, such as proper implementation of the Results Act, to help coordinate missions and goals of individual agencies that are involved in crosscutting program areas and balancing individual agencies\u2019 multiple strategic goals. It also could benefit from lessons learned from the government\u2019s past uses of independent authorities, such as the defense base closure and realignment commissions, and from activity and budget details about research and development accumulated in the RaDiUS database that is used to compile systematically data on federal R&D investments.", "The need to reduce RDT&E infrastructure in balance with mission requirements is a long-standing and complex issue. Agency efforts to date, while encouraging in some cases, are too narrowly focused and likely will promote or sustain duplication and excess capacity. Further, many of the elements employed as best practices by other organizations are neither integral to nor readily available to federal agencies. Thus, a governmentwide approach, which could focus both within and across agencies may offer a viable alternative and increase the likelihood of successfully reshaping the nation\u2019s RDT&E infrastructure to meet current and future needs.

Lessons learned from the federal government\u2019s past uses of independent, external authorities could be used to provide structure to this process. Ongoing restructuring efforts of the agencies could be assessed for their potential to contribute to overall RDT&E infrastructure streamlining. The RaDiUS database could provide preliminary inputs indicating possible duplication of effort.

To illustrate further the infrastructure reduction steps the agencies have initiated, we have added information that recognizes other agency plans and activities.", "Although the agencies acknowledge that they need to reduce further their infrastructure, there was no universal view expressed as to how to effect significant change in the federal RDT&E infrastructure. For example, while each of the four agencies recognized the importance of mission focus in their comments, they had varying perspectives regarding the efficacy of the model\u2019s other critical elements. DOE, for example, does not believe a \u201ccrisis\u201d is needed to spur action, stating that changing missions and budget reductions provide the external pressure needed to get change. However, as the report points out, DOE\u2019s new missions are being developed from the inside and decreases in budgets have been addressed largely through plans to improve management efficiencies. Conversely, NASA agreed with the need for accurate and reliable data about the true cost of operating RDT&E facilities and pointed out that it is developing an integrated financial management system to gather such data. DOD agreed with our conclusion regarding the need for an independent, BRAC-like authority to effect significant change. DOE and NASA, on the other hand, believe they can make, or have already made, appropriate changes regarding the future strategies for their RDT&E infrastructure. OMB\u2019s strategy blends the two. OMB believes each agency should rationalize individually its infrastructure before a more complex interagency approach is attempted. OMB agrees with GAO, however, that an interagency approach is needed. With respect to defining fully the scope RDT&E infrastructure, the agencies comments largely were silent.", "After reviewing carefully the agencies\u2019 comments, we believe that the comments generally reflect the parochialism and structural and organizational barriers discussed in the report. For example, when the agencies\u2019 comments discussed planned RDT&E infrastructure reductions, those plans were limited in scope and focused exclusively on internal reductions. While acknowledging, in some cases, overlapping capability and excess capacity in RDT&E infrastructure, Departments of Energy and Defense and NASA comments generally reflect their belief that (1) their missions and associated infrastructure are unique, (2) they have planned to do enough restructuring and consolidation on their own, and (3) they already coordinate among agencies to the maximum extent practicable.", "OMB states that although additional steps are necessary to ensure success, agencies should downsize first before crosscutting analysis is conducted. We believe that, to the extent the agencies actively pursue interagency approaches as they restructure their respective RDT&E infrastructures, the potential for success in ongoing efforts may be increased. Decision-making on the size and scope of infrastructure needed by an individual agency in the absence of information and consideration of related missions and activities has resulted in decisions that are neither rational nor cost effective when looked at from a broader perspective. We and the agencies agree that maintaining more RDT&E infrastructure than warranted by requirements does not well serve the nation\u2019s research needs and that successful consolidation and reduction efforts are key ingredients to assuring adequate resourcing of future research in science and technology.", "Our perspective differs from the agencies\u2019 in that we believe the best way to achieve this end is through a governmentwide restructuring process.", "DOD generally supported the findings in our report. For example, DOD said that a significant reduction in infrastructure can only be achieved under BRAC-like authority. However, DOD responded that (1) we did not give appropriate weight to the role of the Congress in reducing infrastructure by the BRAC process and to the reductions in RDT&E infrastructure prior to the 1995 BRAC round, (2) the Vision 21 effort should not be listed as a lost opportunity because it is expected to continue under existing authority, (3) excess capacity expressed in work years may not necessarily match up to excess physical facilities, (4) the personnel component of the RDT&E infrastructure has been declining steadily by 4 to 5 percent annually since 1993, and (5) the supporting mission of the DOD laboratories and T&E facilities in providing superior warfighting technology has never been challenged. We agree fully with DOD on the need for an independent, BRAC-like authority and recognize that the Congress has an important role to play, as it has on prior occasions. We believe the extent DOD\u2019s Vision 21 effort proceeds under existing authority may be largely dependent on continuing congressional support for reductions. We acknowledge fully that personnel reductions of the magnitude suggested by DOD have occurred and continue under congressional mandates. However, we have reported that, overall, defense civilian acquisition workforce costs are about the same as they were in 1980 as measured in constant dollars.", "DOE questioned the basic applicability of the best practices model, stating that the scale and complexity of its R&D enterprise presents a much bigger challenge than that faced by the Boeing Company Defense & Space Group and the Ministry of Defence. We do not imply that the model could be transplanted exactly to any organization or situation, but indicate that the basic underlying principles and processes are key. For example, we report that DOD\u2019s Vision 21 process, which contains provisions for an independent authority, inclusion of full operating costs, and strong mission focus incorporated many of the same critical elements described in the model. Further, while it is self-evident that differences in scale (and complexity) may make it more difficult to overcome challenges and barriers, these differences do not negate the validity of the process for different types of organizations nor of the key elements employed in successful consolidations. DOE also commented that (1) the end of the Cold War has had a major direct effect on its mission and the mission of its laboratories, (2) DOE\u2019s Offices of Defense Programs, Nuclear Energy, and Energy Research will declare excess an estimated 1,000 facilities over the 5-year period from 1996 to 2000, (3) DOE laboratories have unique facilities and capabilities that also serve other federal agencies, and (4) the agency\u2019s Laboratory Operations Board has developed a \u201cStrategic Laboratories Mission Plan.\u201d We have reported that much of DOE\u2019s \u201cevolved mission\u201d is not unique, but is shared, at a minimum, with the NSF and the Department of Commerce.", "NASA said that (1) it has experienced upheaval, restructuring, downsizing, and streamlining and has been reinventing itself since well before the 1995 National Performance Review, (2) it does not have an integrated financial system, (3) a major objective of its strategic planning process is proper sizing of its infrastructure, and (4) based on its Zero-Base Review, it has made appropriate plans to implement closure of unnecessary facilities. NASA also believed that by addressing the three major agencies in the same report, we had overly generalized conclusions and overlooked its accomplishments. We acknowledge fully the goals of NASA\u2019s completed Zero-Base Review in our report, but we conclude that it is unlikely that NASA\u2019s planned reductions will meet its own internal objectives.", "NASA further commented that it was concerned about our publishing the report because, in NASA\u2019s opinion, the report did not meet our normal standards, largely because NASA believes the report overlooks its accomplishments in reducing RDT&E infrastructure while focusing on governmentwide issues. While we recognize NASA\u2019s accomplishments, we also note that NASA has not closed any of its major facilities, as supported by its own comments on this report."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
