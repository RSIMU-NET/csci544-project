Diplomatic Security trains its workforce and others to address a variety of threats, including crime, espionage, visa and passport fraud, technological intrusions, political violence, and terrorism. To meet its training needs, Diplomatic Security relies primarily on its Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC). GAO was asked to examine (1) how Diplomatic Security ensures the quality and appropriateness of its training, (2) the extent to which Diplomatic Security ensures that training requirements are being met, and (3) any challenges that Diplomatic Security faces in carrying out its training mission. GAO examined compliance with accreditation processes; analyzed data and documentation related to the agency's training efforts; and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C., and five overseas posts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the quality and appropriateness of its training, Diplomatic Security primarily adheres to Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA) standards, along with other standards. Diplomatic Security incorporated FLETA standards into its standard operating procedures, using a course design framework tailored for DSTC. To meet standards, DSTC also integrates both formal and informal feedback from evaluations and other sources to improve its courses. However, GAO found DSTC's systems do not have the capability to obtain feedback for some required training, including distributed learning efforts (interactive online course content). Without feedback, DSTC is less able to ensure the effectiveness of these efforts. Diplomatic Security developed career training paths for its personnel that identify the training required for selected job positions at different career levels. It uses various systems to track participation in its training, but DSTC's systems do not have the capability to track whether personnel have completed all required training. DSTC systems also are not designed to track training delivered through distributed learning. Diplomatic Security faces significant challenges to carrying out its training mission. DSTC must train Diplomatic Security personnel to perform new missions in Iraq as they take on many of the protective and security functions previously provided by the U.S. military. DSTC also faces dramatic increases in high-threat training provided to State and non-State personnel, but State does not have an action plan and time frames to manage proposed increases. These expanded training missions constrain DSTC's ability to meet training needs. In addition, many of DSTC's training facilities do not meet its training needs, a situation that hampers efficient and effective operations. To meet some of its needs, in 2007, DSTC developed an Interim Training Facility. In 2009, State allocated funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and other acts to develop a consolidated training facility; State is in the process of identifying a suitable location."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State enhance DSTC's course evaluation and tracking capabilities.

According to DSTC officials, evaluations conducted by  other agencies are not automatically shared with DSTC. Instead, to  measure the effectiveness of its training for non-State personnel, DSTC  relies on voluntary comments from the agencies or individual students  from those agencies.", "DSTC officials noted that they are pursuing access to a more robust  learning management system to address some of the difficulties with their  existing systems. Learning management systems are software applications  for the administration, documentation, tracking, and reporting of training  programs, classroom and online events, e-learning programs, and training  content. DSTC officials stated that their current suite of software,  including Microsoft Office SharePoint and several State-specific systems,  does not provide all the functionality they need to effectively evaluate all  of their courses. DSTC has increased its reliance on using Microsoft Office  SharePoint to store current learning materials for DSTC courses on its  intranet, but the software does not have an evaluation mechanism in place.", "According to DSTC officials, they were interested in procuring a learning  management system that would cost about $284,000, with additional  maintenance and technical support costing about $28,500 a year. In 2009,  DSTC officials conducted a cost-benefit analysis by examining the savings  from converting two existing courses into courses delivered entirely  online. The analysis indicated that State would save about $2 million a  year in travel costs alone as well as give DSTC a number of additional  functionalities. According to DSTC, as of May 2011, its request to purchase  the system is under review, and DSTC was advised to explore FSI\u2019s  learning management system.

In addition to this expanded training mission, State has  proposed a fivefold increase in the amount of training DSTC provides to  non-Diplomatic Security personnel. At the same time, many of DSTC\u2019s  training facilities pose additional challenges. DSTC lacks a consolidated  training facility of its own and therefore uses 16 different leased, rented, or  borrowed facilities at which DSTC\u2019s training needs are not the priority.  Moreover, several of the facilities do not meet DSTC\u2019s training needs  and/or are in need of refurbishment. According to Diplomatic Security  officials, this situation has proven inefficient; it has expanded training  times and likely increased costs. To meet some of its current needs, in  2007 DSTC developed an Interim Training Facility, and in 2009 State  allocated funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and  other acts to begin the process of building a consolidated training facility.

Consequently,  Diplomatic Security is leveraging Department of Defense expertise and  equipment to build the capabilities and capacity necessary to undertake its  new missions. For example, the Department of Defense is assisting  Diplomatic Security with the operation of a sense-and-warn system to  detect and alert to artillery and mortar fire. As a result of its increased  security responsibilities, Diplomatic Security anticipates substantial use of  contractors to provide many of these specialized services. Nevertheless,  Diplomatic Security personnel will still need training in order to properly  manage and oversee those contractors and to perform those services for  which contractors are not being hired.", "DSTC noted that it is following events in Iraq, seeking feedback from  Embassy Baghdad, and evaluating and updating its training programs to  ensure they remain relevant to the needs of post personnel and conditions  on the ground. To identify training needs, DSTC is collaborating with  multiple offices on various contingency plans. DSTC is a member of the  Diplomatic Security Iraq Transition Working Group. The purpose of this  working group is to identify and analyze the structural, logistical,  personnel, and training impacts of the transition on Diplomatic Security  and the Regional Security Office in Baghdad as U.S. military forces draw  down in Iraq. Additionally, DSTC is an active participant in the  Contingency Operations Working Group, whose purpose is to improve  collaboration within Diplomatic Security to support RSO operations in  Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Sudan. DSTC also is a member of  the Iraq Policy and Operations Group, chaired by State\u2019s Bureau of Near  Eastern Affairs, and the Iraq Training Course Advisory Group, chaired by  FSI.", "DSTC is developing training plans to address various contingencies arising  from anticipated Diplomatic Security personnel increases in Iraq and  introduction of new equipment. Regarding personnel increases, DSTC is  identifying resources and planning to train additional security personnel to  meet Embassy Baghdad\u2019s goal of filling 84 Security Protective Specialist  positions and 25 new special agent positions in Iraq. High-threat courses  are also being added to accommodate additional Diplomatic Security  personnel being assigned to Iraq and other high-threat locations. For  example, an additional four HTT courses were added to the DSTC training  schedule, making a total of 13 course offerings in fiscal year 2011  compared with 9 in fiscal year 2010.", "According to DSTC, it is endeavoring to meet the need for new capabilities  and equipment. DSTC, in coordination with the Diplomatic Security Mine- Resistant/Ambush Protection (MRAP) armored vehicles working group, is  developing ways to integrate MRAP training into Diplomatic Security  courses, and as of March 2011 had completed the design and development  of a training course. This effort includes acquiring an MRAP egress trainer  at the ITF in West Virginia and one at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. To  address expanding RSO air operations, DSTC acquired UH-1 and CH-46  nonflyable helicopter airframes from Cherry Point Marine Air Station in  order to improve air operations training. An additional helicopter airframe,  a CH-53, is also being acquired from the same location. For FACT  students, protective vests and helmets were obtained to better accustom  students to working conditions on the ground. Other HTT additions will  include personnel recovery, tactical communications, and tactical  operations command training. DSTC is working closely with the Iraq  Training Course Advisory Group to develop a new Iraq predeployment  immersion training course for civilian employees, as well as special agents,  which will combine both security and operational exercises. According to  Diplomatic Security officials, this training will likely increase the time  needed to get trained Diplomatic Security personnel into the field.", "Despite these efforts, Diplomatic Security noted that the locations,  personnel numbers, and resources that Diplomatic Security will require in  Iraq are being finalized through the various transitional working groups  mentioned above, as well as by Embassy Baghdad and U.S. Forces-Iraq.  However, according to State\u2019s Inspector General, Diplomatic Security does  not have the funding, personnel, experience, equipment, or training to  replicate the U.S. military\u2019s security mission in Iraq. Similar concerns  were raised by the Commission on Wartime Contracting and a majority  report issued by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Diplomatic  Security acknowledged it is not designed to assume the military\u2019s mission  in Iraq and will have to rely on its own resources and the assistance of the  host country to protect the U.S. mission in the absence of the funding,  personnel, equipment, and protection formerly provided by the U.S.  military. Furthermore, with clear deadlines in place for the U.S. military  departure from Iraq, delays in finalizing State\u2019s operations in Iraq could  affect DSTC\u2019s ability to develop and deliver any additional required  training."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Future Training Requirements May Further Strain DSTC Resources", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the resource demands placed on DSTC by the pending  drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq, DSTC has seen a significant  increase in the number of U.S. personnel to whom it provides training,  especially high-threat training such as FACT, SNOE, and HTT (see fig. 4).  Most notable is the increase in the number of non-Diplomatic Security  personnel to whom Diplomatic Security must provide training since both  FACT and SNOE are designed for nonagents. For example, the number of  U.S. personnel taking high-threat training in fiscal year 2006 was 971. That  number more than doubled in fiscal year 2010 to 2,132.", "In addition to the significant increase in students, State has levied  additional training requirements on DSTC that may further strain DSTC\u2019s  resources. State\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review  (QDDR) stated that all personnel at high-threat posts, as well as those at  critical-threat posts, will now receive FACT training. According to  Diplomatic Security officials, this change in policy would increase the  number of posts for which FACT is required from 23 to 178, increasing the  number of students taking FACT each year from 2,132 in fiscal year 2010  to over 10,000. DSTC officials noted that they lack the capacity to handle  so many students and that current FACT classes are already filled to  DSTC\u2019s capacity. DSTC would need to locate or build additional driving  tracks, firearms ranges, and explosives ranges, as well as obtain  instructors and other staff to support such a dramatic increase in students.  At a cost of almost $4,000 per student, not including the need to develop  additional facilities, this requirement could cost government agencies over  $30 million. The QDDR did not identify additional resources or facilities to  support this decision. According to Diplomatic Security officials, State has  not completed an action plan or established time frames to carry out the  QDDR recommendation.

For example, DSTC maintains a  fleet of vehicles to transport students from one training facility to another.  In 2009, DSTC officials estimated that students spent 1 week of the then 8- week HTT course in transit. According to DSTC officials, until recently the  Training Directorate used four additional facilities, including three other  military bases, but military officials at those bases decided that they could  no longer accommodate DSTC and still meet their own training needs.  This forced DSTC to find or make use of alternative training sites.", "Diplomatic Security leases, rents, or borrows all the facilities it uses, and  the number of facilities in use at any given time and how they are used will  vary based on training requirements and facility availability. For example,  although Marine Corps Base Quantico is primarily used for firearms  training, Diplomatic Security also uses its ranges for land navigation and  its mock villages for scenario training with nonlethal ammunition.  According to DSTC officials, because Diplomatic Security does not own  the facilities it uses (or the land on which they are built, in the case of its  ITF), its access to some facilities may be constrained by the facility  owners. For example, Diplomatic Security uses the firearms ranges at  Marine Corps Base Quantico to train with heavier weapons that none of its  other facilities can accommodate (see fig. 5). However, according to  Diplomatic Security officials, the Marines occasionally force Diplomatic  Security to change its training schedule, sometimes with minimal notice,  which increases costs and makes it difficult for DSTC staff to meet  training objectives within the time available. DSTC noted, however, that  the Marines work with them to minimize the disruptions to Diplomatic  Security training at Marine Corps Base Quantico.", "Several of the leased facilities, notably the State Annex (SA) buildings, do  not meet DSTC\u2019s needs. For example, SA-7, in Springfield, Virginia, was  originally leased commercially in the 1970s when, according to Diplomatic  Security officials, Diplomatic Security had fewer than 500 special agents,  less than one-third of the approximately 1,900 it has now. Both SA-7 and  SA-31 are overcrowded and need various repairs, according to Diplomatic  Security officials, in part because of disputes between Diplomatic Security  and its lessor over which party is responsible for structural repairs such as  leaks in the ceiling, repairs to water pipes, and repairs to the ventilation  systems (see fig. 6 for pictures of SA-7). DSTC\u2019s main firearms ranges are  located in these buildings, but according to DSTC officials, the ranges are  small and have some unusable firing lanes (see fig. 6). Because of the  limitations of its facilities, Diplomatic Security has had to improvise with  makeshift solutions to provide some types of training, for example, placing  tape on the floors of its garage at SA-11 to simulate walls for conducting  room-entry training (see fig. 7). DSTC officials commented that this was  not the most effective way to conduct training.", "To help meet the training demands of its growing mission, DSTC has  identified alternate sites as backup training locations and used them in the  past year when other facilities could not be used to meet training  requirements. For example, the HTT course used a paintball park in 2010  when Marine Corps Base Quantico could not accommodate DSTC\u2019s final  practical exercise. As noted below, with the increased capability at the  ITF, Diplomatic Security has been able to consolidate some functions and  reduce, but not eliminate, the need for other facilities. In April 2011,  Diplomatic Security officials stated that DSTC began firearms training and  requalifications at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center\u2019s  Cheltenham, Maryland, facility. Diplomatic Security now has access to the  firing ranges at Cheltenham to conduct agents\u2019 firearms requalifications, as  well as support office, classroom, and storage space\u2014allowing them to  use the small SA-7 firing range as a backup range."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Diplomatic Security Is Developing an Interim Training Facility to Address Some Current but Not Future Needs", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that its existing facilities were inadequate, in 2007, according  to DSTC officials, Diplomatic Security signed a 5-year contract with one of  its lessors, Bill Scott Raceway, to fence off 12.5 acres of land and build a  modular Interim Training Facility in Summit Point, West Virginia, for  approximately $10 million (see fig. 8). The facility includes a number of  training features that Diplomatic Security needs, including a gymnasium  with mat rooms, a two-story indoor tactical maze, an indoor firing range, a  video-based firearms simulation, and a mock urban training area.

Nevertheless, Diplomatic Security  officials noted that the ITF is only a stopgap solution with inherent  limitations and cannot meet a number of Diplomatic Security\u2019s training  needs such as the firing of heavier weapons, the use of more powerful  explosives to train agents in incident management, and the integrated  tactical use of driving and firearms training in a mock urban environment.  The ITF also lacks space for Diplomatic Security to train its personnel for  many of the additional missions that they are expected to take over from  the U.S. military in Iraq, such as land navigation and downed aircraft  recovery, among others.

State began the search for a dedicated training facility  in 1993 and revisited the need in 1998 following the embassy bombings in  Africa prior to developing the Interim Training Facility. In 2004, State  received funding to develop the Center for Antiterrorism and Security  Training. In 2006, when the plans for locating such a center at Aberdeen  Proving Ground were not successful, the development of CAST was  abandoned and Diplomatic Security sought guidance from State\u2019s legal  office. According to Diplomatic Security officials, based on the legislative  language, State\u2019s legal office stated that no specific site was indicated.  Therefore, according to officials, based on Diplomatic Security\u2019s critical  need for an antiterrorism training center, the funds could be spent on a  temporary facility. Consequently, the remaining funds were used to  expand Diplomatic Security\u2019s use of the Bill Scott Raceway facilities and  develop the ITF.

State  had planned to begin building by early 2011; however, on June 28, 2010,  State and the General Services Administration determined that the site  would no longer be considered, because of local concerns regarding  environmental and other land use issues that could delay the project for  several years.", "State subsequently expanded its FASTC criteria, most notably increasing  the acceptable distance from Washington, D.C., and\u2014because of a  presidential memorandum issued in June 2010 requesting that agencies try  to use existing federal land instead of purchasing new property\u2014focusing  the search on publicly owned properties. The General Services  Administration evaluated approximately 40 sites against the revised site  criteria, which include four steps to determine the viability of the site for  placement of the FASTC project. Step 1 evaluates the site regarding public  ownership, size, the ability to support 24/7 operations, climate conditions,  and proximity to Diplomatic Security headquarters. A site that meets Step  1 criteria continues on to Step 2, which evaluates the site\u2019s developable  area, compatible surroundings, ease of acquisition, life support and  community support, and suitable climate, and includes performing initial  test fits of the site. A site that meets Step 2 criteria will move on to Step 3,  in which a feasibility study is conducted on the site. The feasibility study  takes into consideration the mission, program requirements, phasing, risk,  cost, procurement, environmental assessment, and utilities. Step 4 of the  criteria is to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement under the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for the preferred site.", "Two of the evaluated sites met the Step 1 criteria. One site also met Step 2  criteria, and moved on to Step 3 in which a feasibility study was  completed. The second site under consideration is currently being  evaluated under Step 2 criteria.

However, a separate application must be submitted  for each program and academy. In most cases, agencies first submit  applications for their basic agent training and instructor training first.  Once those have been accredited, the agency submits an application to  have its academy accredited.  2.  Agency preparation: The agency conducts a self-assessment and gap  analysis to identify which of the FLETA standards it does not meet;  identifies corrective steps, if necessary; and reports its results to  FLETA\u2019s Office of Accreditation.  3.  FLETA assessment: FLETA carries out its assessment. The  assessment teams visit training locations, review files documenting the  agency\u2019s compliance with standards, observe training, and interview  administrators and trainers. If deficiencies are found during the  assessment process, the agency must prepare a corrective action plan.  The assessment team prepares the final report of the FLETA  assessment, which is submitted to the FLETA Board Review  Committee.  4.  FLETA accreditation: A FLETA Board Review Committee reviews  the findings before FLETA awards accreditation to the submitted  course, academy, or both. Afterward, the agency provides annual  updates to FLETA in order to maintain the accreditation.

For a program to receive accreditation, an agency  must demonstrate that the program\u2019s policies and procedures, facilities,  and resources comply with applicable FLETA standards. In general, the  academy meets the same FLETA standards as the programs, but the  standards are applied to the organization as a whole. As of 2010, agencies  applying for accreditation must provide evidence that at least five other  programs, in addition to the basic agent training and instructor  development training, comply with FLETA standards.", "FLETA standards are designed to describe what must be accomplished;  however, it is up to each agency to determine how it will meet the  standards. FLETA has one set of academy standards and four sections of  program standards, which include: (1) program administration, (2) training  staff, (3) training development, and (4) training delivery. Each set or  section of standards has 7 to 23 individual standards. For example, 1  academy standard requires that the academy establish a vision, mission,  goals, and objectives, while 1 training staff standard requires that new  instructors are monitored and mentored.", "A FLETA Assessment Team reviews all documented administrative  controls and supporting evidence submitted, including academy policies,  procedures, and operations, and the team also conducts interviews with  key personnel.

In general, when special agents are overseas, they manage post security  requirements; when they serve domestically, they conduct investigations  and provide protective details.

For example, after the 3-week orientation  provided by FSI, special agents go through the basic special agent course.  It includes about 12 weeks at the Federal Law Enforcement Training  Center and is followed by about 12 weeks of additional DSTC training.  Upon assignment to an overseas post, special agents must take the basic  Regional Security Officer course, the basic field firearms officer course,  and the security overseas seminar. If special agents are posted to a  designated high-threat post, they must also take the high-threat tactical  training course. In addition, at all career levels, depending on the post,  special agents may have to take language training.", "Once special agents are in a supervisory role, both midlevel and senior- level agents have additional required training. For example, they are  required to attend FSI-provided leadership and management training. If  agents are posted to a designated high-threat post at this level, they must  take the HTT course if they have not taken HTT within the previous 5  years.

Each specialty has its own required training. Those opting to  specialize in security protection and training can apply to join the Mobile  Security Deployment Division (MSD) for a 3-year tour.
