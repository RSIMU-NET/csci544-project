GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed\u2014for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure).", "Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification.", "In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2017, the federal government provided over $122 billion in  grants, loans, and work study funds through federal student aid programs  to help students pay tuition, fees, and other expenses at almost 6,000  postsecondary schools.

We  also interviewed staff from Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid  (FSA) in headquarters and managers and analysts in four of its eight  regional offices to learn more about how they implement the school  certification process. We selected these regional offices based on  high certification decision volume and geographic dispersion. We also  reviewed case file documents for a non-generalizable sample of 21  certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selecting  cases that included a mix of certification decisions, regional offices,  and school characteristics (e.g., 2-year and 4-year, and public,  nonprofit, and for-profit). To determine how often schools are  approved and denied certification, we obtained and analyzed data  from Education\u2019s Postsecondary Education Participants System  (PEPS) on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006  through 2017. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing  Education\u2019s PEPS data system documentation; testing the data for  outliers, obvious errors, or missing data; and interviewing Education  officials, and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  reporting purposes.", "To determine the role of compliance audits in the certification process  and the steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit  information, we reviewed laws, regulations, policy manuals, training  materials, and other agency documents related to compliance audits  and compliance audit quality.

Provisional certification is the only approval status  available to new schools. In addition, FSA may decide to recertify a  school provisionally if it determines that a school has not fully complied  with federal student aid requirements. FSA prohibits provisionally  certified schools from opening new campus locations or offering new  programs without approval from FSA, and provisionally certified schools  that are denied recertification have a less substantive appeals process  than fully certified schools. Further, recertified schools in provisional  status are subject to more FSA oversight than schools that are fully  certified.

For example, FSA staff  said that for-profit and vocational schools that apply for initial certification  are required to provide an eligible program continuously for 2 years prior  to their initial application. FSA staff may also advise schools that do not  meet basic eligibility requirements not to apply, which could result in  fewer initial certification denials overall.

The audits provide direct  information collected by independent auditors from school visits and file  reviews examining how schools administer federal student aid and  comply with program requirements. For example, OIG audit guidance  directs auditors to check whether schools are distributing federal student  aid to eligible students and accurately calculating student loan amounts.  FSA officials and staff from all four of our selected regional offices said  that compliance audits are a key source of information they use to assess  a school\u2019s administrative capability.", "Officials from Education\u2019s OIG said that the quality of information in  compliance audits varies substantially and depends on the auditor. The  OIG has found quality problems in some of the compliance audits it  selects\u2014based on auditor and school risk factors\u2014for its annual quality  control reviews. Because the OIG selects higher risk audits to review, its  reviews are more likely to detect problems, and OIG officials said they  cannot make any conclusions about the overall prevalence of quality  problems in compliance audits. However, our analysis of OIG quality  review data found that of the 739 compliance audits reviewed by the OIG  from fiscal years 2006 through 2017, the OIG passed 23 percent (173)  and failed 59 percent (436). An additional 18 percent (130) passed with  deficiencies. For example, across the 41 compliance audits it reviewed  in fiscal year 2016, the OIG identified 264 quality deficiencies with the  auditor\u2019s work, according to our analysis of quality reviews provided by  the OIG. The most frequently cited issues in these 41 audits were:  reporting (24 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor tested  whether the school correctly reported student enrollment status;  student eligibility (20 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor  verified student school attendance; and administrative capability (19 audits), such as lack of evidence that the  auditor determined whether the accreditor had been notified about a  change in school ownership within 10 days.", "FSA officials also identified quality issues with the compliance audits of  some schools. FSA headquarters officials and staff we interviewed in  several regional offices said they have seen schools with significant  program review findings that had not been identified in annual compliance  audits. FSA staff said they have referred some compliance audits to the  OIG for quality reviews when they have had questions about the  thoroughness of an audit. We also found a couple of examples in our  review of school certification documents in which the findings identified in  a school\u2019s compliance audit were different from the findings identified by  FSA in a program review of the same school covering the same time  period. In one case, FSA staff said they probably would have fully  recertified the school if they had relied solely on the compliance audit.  Instead, they used the program review to determine that the school  should be provisionally recertified. Compliance audits and program review  findings are based on a sample of student records, and FSA staff said  some differences in findings might be explained by differences in the  records reviewed.", "FSA and OIG officials cited several issues that can affect the quality of  compliance audits. FSA and OIG officials we interviewed said that some  auditors conducting compliance audits have insufficient training in federal  student aid, which contributes to audit quality problems. OIG staff also  said that even if an auditor meets the general training hour requirements  for auditors, the training content may not be relevant for federal student  aid audits. In addition, FSA and OIG officials said some schools\u2014 particularly smaller schools\u2014tend to hire less experienced auditors in  order to save money, often resulting in poor quality audits. FSA officials in  most selected regional offices said that additional training on federal  student aid for auditors who are new to or unfamiliar with federal student  aid could help improve audit quality.", "FSA and the OIG recently have taken steps to address audit quality and  the information available to FSA staff when making certification decisions.  These efforts include:", "Training for auditors: The OIG has taken steps to enhance training  offered to auditors of schools\u2019 administration of federal student aid  and is exploring opportunities to provide additional training. In  December 2017, the OIG and the American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants cosponsored training for auditors on the OIG\u2019s  2016 revised guide for audits of for-profit schools, and other topics  related to auditing federal student aid. The training included  discussion of common audit quality issues and areas of highest risk.  According to an OIG official, about 200 auditors attended, and after  the event, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and  the OIG posted a recording of the training to their websites to make it  available to additional auditors. In addition, OIG officials said they  maintain an email account\u2014listed on the OIG website\u2014through which  auditors can ask questions and receive responses. In March 2018, the  OIG posted frequently asked questions and answers to the website.", "Timeliness of OIG quality reviews: Both FSA and OIG officials said  that the OIG has recently renewed efforts to issue compliance audit  quality reviews more quickly, after several years in which staffing  shortages and other issues led to some delayed quality reviews.", "Guidance to schools on selecting an auditor: OIG officials said  that at the 2017 FSA training conference for school financial aid staff,  they presented to more than 400 participants about factors schools  should consider when hiring an auditor. For example, they suggested  that schools verify the licenses of certified public accountants, ask  about the types of engagements an auditing firm has conducted,  request and check references, check for any actions that may have  been taken against a firm, and ask whether the auditor has been  subject to a previous review by the OIG or another agency. FSA  officials said they expected to invite the OIG to present at future FSA  conferences, and OIG officials said they were seeking additional  opportunities to share information on auditor selection with schools,  including a planned presentation to an association of postsecondary  schools.", "FSA working group: FSA recently established a working group to  update its guidance to FSA staff on how to coordinate with the OIG to  address compliance audits with quality problems. Among other topics,  the working group has consulted with the OIG about how schools are  made aware of the OIG\u2019s findings regarding the quality of their audits.

They  said that because the revised guide clarified some issues that were  confusing to auditors in the previous guide issued in 2000, auditors  might be better able to implement the guidance. The audit guide  revisions include more testing and reporting requirements, clarified  procedures, and guidance on issues such as fraud reporting and  coordinating financial and compliance audits. The 2016 revisions first  applied to audits for fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, and  FSA began receiving those audits at the end of 2017.
