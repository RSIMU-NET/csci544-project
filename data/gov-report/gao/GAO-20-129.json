To this end,  in November 2016, we issued an IT workforce planning framework that  identifies four workforce planning steps and eight activities, including  assessing gaps in competencies and skills, and developing strategies and  plans to address those gaps. This framework is based on relevant laws  and guidance issued over approximately the past 20 years. These include  the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the legislation referred to as the Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) Workforce Planning Model.", "This report responds to your request that we conduct a government-wide  review of federal IT workforce planning efforts.

We then analyzed these documents to determine  whether they were consistent with the eight workforce planning activities  identified in our November 2016 framework. We assessed each activity  as fully implemented, substantially implemented, partially implemented,  minimally implemented, or not implemented. Our review focused on IT  workforce planning efforts at the agency level, including processes for  maintaining visibility and oversight into component-level IT workforce  planning.

These laws and guidance focus on the importance of (1)  setting the strategic direction for workforce planning, (2) analyzing the  workforce to identify skill gaps, (3) developing strategies to address skill  gaps, and (4) monitoring and reporting on progress in addressing skill  gaps. For example:", "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agency chief information  officers (CIO) to annually (1) assess the requirements established for  agency personnel regarding knowledge and skills in information  resource management and the adequacy of such requirements for  facilitating the achievement of performance goals; (2) assess the  extent to which the positions and personnel at executive and  management levels meet those requirements; (3) develop strategies  and specific plans for hiring, training, and professional development to  address any deficiencies; and (4) report to the head of the agency on  the progress made in improving information resources management  capability.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 requires the Director of OPM, in  consultation with the Director of OMB, the CIO Council, and the  Administrator of General Services to (1) analyze, on an ongoing basis,  the personnel needs of the federal government related to IT and  information resource management; and (2) identify where current IT  and information resource management training do not satisfy  personnel needs. In addition, the law requires the Director of OMB to  ensure that agency heads collect and maintain standardized  information on their IT and information resources management  workforce.", "In 2010, OMB issued its 25-point plan for IT reform and outlined  several action plans to build workforce capabilities, including  capabilities for acquisition and program management. For example,  the plan directed OPM to create a specialized career path for IT  program managers. In addition, OMB stated that it would work with  OPM to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for program  managers. OMB also tasked agencies with identifying program  management competency gaps and reporting to OMB on those gaps.", "Subsequent to the 25-point plan, in July 2011, OMB released  guidance for agencies to develop specialized IT acquisition cadres.  Among other things, this guidance required agencies to analyze  current acquisition staffing challenges; determine if developing or  expanding the use of cadres would improve program results; and  outline a plan to pilot or expand cadres for an especially high-risk  area, if the agency determined that such an effort would improve  performance.", "Further, in November 2011, OPM issued guidance for developing  career paths for IT program managers. OPM\u2019s career path guide  was to build upon its IT Program Management Competency Model  released in July 2011 by serving as a roadmap for individuals  interested in pursuing a career in this area. In addition, the roadmap  was to provide employees and their supervisors with a single-source  reference to determine appropriate training opportunities for career  advancement.", "In December 2014, Congress enacted legislation commonly referred  to as FITARA. Among other things, the law aims to ensure timely  progress by federal agencies toward developing, strengthening, and  deploying IT acquisition cadres consisting of personnel with highly  specialized skills in IT acquisition, including program and project  managers. Almost all of the 24 CFO Act agencies (other than the  Department of Defense (Defense)) are required to update their annual  acquisition human capital plans to address how they are meeting their  human capital requirements to support timely and effective  acquisitions.", "To assist agencies in implementing the provisions of FITARA and to  build upon agency responsibilities under the Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996, OMB issued guidance to agencies in June 2015. In doing so,  OMB directed agencies (other than Defense) to, among other things,  (1) develop a set of competency requirements for staff, including  leadership positions; and (2) develop and maintain a current  workforce planning processes to ensure that agencies can anticipate  and respond to changing mission requirements, maintain workforce  skills in a rapidly developing environment, and recruit and retain the  talent needed to accomplish their missions. Each agency is to conduct  an annual self-assessment of its conformity with these requirements  and develop an implementation plan describing the changes it will  make.", "The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015  required OPM, with support from the National Institute of Standards  and Technology, to establish a coding structure to be used in  identifying all federal civilian and noncivilian positions that require the  performance of IT, cybersecurity, or other cyber-related functions.  The act also required agencies, in consultation with OPM, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), to then utilize this coding structure to  annually assess, among other things, the IT, cybersecurity, and other  cyber-related work roles of critical need in their workforce.", "In April 2016, OPM issued an update to agency chief human capital  officers stating that it had recently revalidated the need to continue  working to close skill gaps in certain government-wide high-risk  mission critical occupations, including those in the cybersecurity and  the science, technology, engineering and mathematics functional  area.", "OMB released its Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy in July  2016. Among other things, the strategy cited the need for agencies  to examine specific IT, cybersecurity, and cyber-related work roles,  and identify personnel skills gaps, rather than merely examining the  number of vacancies by job series. The strategy identified several  actions that agencies could take to identify workforce needs, expand  the cybersecurity workforce through education and training, recruit  and hire highly skilled talent, and retain and develop highly skilled  talent.", "In July 2016, OMB issued updated policy for the planning, budgeting,  governance, acquisition, and management of federal information,  personnel, equipment, funds, IT resources, and supporting  infrastructure and services. Among other things, OMB\u2019s updated  policy requires an agency\u2019s chief human capital officer, CIO, chief  acquisition officer, and senior agency official for privacy to develop a  set of competency requirements for staff and develop and maintain a  current workforce planning process.", "Further, in September 2016, OPM updated its guidance regarding the  annual submission of agencies\u2019 mission critical occupation resource  charts. These charts are to identify current staffing levels, staffing  targets, projected attrition, actual attrition, and retirement eligibility in  government-wide and selected agency-specific mission critical  occupations.", "While these laws and guidance focus on IT workforce planning, other  broader initiatives have also been undertaken to improve federal human  capital management. For example, we and OPM have developed human  capital management models that call for implementing workforce planning  practices that can facilitate the analysis of gaps between current skills  and future needs. In addition, the models call for the development of  strategies for filling the gaps, as well as planning for succession.  Further, our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  stress that management should consider how best to retain valuable  employees, plan for their eventual succession, and ensure continuity of  needed skills and abilities.", "Based on the aforementioned laws, guidance, and initiatives, in  November 2016, GAO issued an evaluation framework to support the  assessment of whether selected federal agencies are adequately  assessing and addressing gaps in IT knowledge and skills. The  framework identifies four workforce planning steps and supporting  activities that address (1) setting the strategic direction for IT workforce  planning, (2) analyzing the IT workforce to identify competency and  staffing gaps, (3) developing and implementing strategies to address the  gaps, and (4) monitoring and reporting progress in addressing the gaps."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Previously Reported on Shortfalls in Federal IT Workforce Planning", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that effectively addressing mission critical  skill gaps in IT requires a multifaceted response from OPM and  agencies. Specifically, our high-risk update in February 2013 noted that  OPM and agencies would need to use a strategic approach that (1)  involves top management, employees, and other stakeholders; (2)  identifies the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to  achieve current and future programmatic results; (3) develops strategies  that are tailored to address skill gaps; (4) builds the internal capability  needed to address administrative, training, and other requirements  important to support workforce planning strategies; and (5) includes plans  to monitor and evaluate progress toward closing skill gaps and meeting  other human capital goals using a variety of appropriate metrics.", "In January 2015, we reported that the Chief Human Capital Officers  Council had identified skill gaps in six government-wide occupations  including IT/cybersecurity and contract specialist/acquisition. We noted,  however, that the effort had shortcomings, and that it would be important  for the council to use lessons learned from these initial efforts to inform  subsequent ones to identify skill gaps. We also reported that key features  of OPM\u2019s efforts to predict emerging skill gaps beyond those already  identified were in the early planning stages, and OPM and selected  agencies could improve the manner in which they address skill gaps by  strengthening their use of quarterly data-driven reviews.", "Further, we reported that individual agencies across the federal  government have not always effectively planned for IT workforce  challenges. For example,  In May 2014, we concluded that the Social Security Administration\u2019s  (SSA) IT human capital program had identified skills and  competencies to support certain workforce needs, but lacked  adequate planning for the future. The agency had developed IT  human capital planning documents, such as an Information  Resources Management plan, and skills inventory gap reports that  identified near-term needs, such as skill sets for the following 2 years.  Nevertheless, SSA had not adequately planned for longer-term needs  because its human capital planning and analysis were not aligned  with long-term goals and objectives and the agency did not have a  current succession plan for its IT efforts. Accordingly, we  recommended that SSA identify long-term IT needs in its updated  human capital operating plan. The agency agreed with, and  subsequently implemented the recommendation.", "In August 2016, we determined that the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) had performed key steps, such as documenting an IT  human capital strategic plan and regularly analyzing workforce data.  However, the agency had not tracked and reviewed historical and  projected leadership retirements and had not identified gaps in future  skill areas. We recommended that the agency track and review  historical workforce data and projections related to leadership  retirements, and identify IT skills needed beyond the current fiscal  year, to assist in identifying future skills gaps. The agency concurred  with our recommendations and has partially implemented them by  identifying the IT skills it needed beyond the current fiscal year.", "In November 2016, as a part of the review in which we developed the  IT workforce planning framework discussed previously, we assessed  five agencies\u2014the Departments of Commerce (Commerce), Defense,  Transportation (Transportation), the Treasury (Treasury), and Health  and Human Services (HHS)\u2014against the eight key workforce  planning activities. While all five agencies had demonstrated  important progress in either partially or fully implementing key  workforce planning activities, each had shortfalls. For example, only  one agency (Defense) had implemented a workforce planning  process, none had identified IT competency gaps for their entire  workforce, and three (Defense, Transportation, and Treasury) were  performing some level of monitoring toward the closure of identified  skill gaps. We reported that, until the agencies fully implemented key  workforce planning activities, they would have a limited ability to  assess and address gaps in knowledge and skills that are critical to  the success of major IT acquisitions. As a result, we recommended  that the agencies implement the eight IT workforce planning activities  to facilitate the analysis of gaps between current skills and future  needs, the development of strategies for filling the gaps, and  succession planning. Defense partially agreed with our  recommendations and the other four agencies agreed with our  recommendations. An updated assessment of actions to implement  our recommendations is described in our evaluation of agencies\u2019  implementation of key IT workforce planning activities in appendix II.", "In May 2018, as part of a review of the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) approach to overseeing and  managing IT, we found that the agency had partially implemented five  of the eight key IT workforce planning activities and had not  implemented three. For example, NASA had not assessed  competency and staffing needs regularly or reported progress to  agency leadership. We reported that, until the agency implemented  the key IT workforce planning activities, it would have difficulty  anticipating and responding to changing staffing needs. As a result,  we recommended that NASA fully implement the eight key IT  workforce planning activities. The agency disagreed with our  recommendation stating that its workforce improvement activities  were already underway. Nevertheless, implementing the workforce  planning activities discussed in this report could enhance and  complement the agency\u2019s ongoing and future efforts.", "In a June 2018 report on the progress of agencies\u2019 efforts to  implement the requirements of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce  Assessment Act of 2015, we noted that most CFO Act agencies had  developed baseline assessments to identify cybersecurity personnel  within their agencies that held certifications. However, because  agencies had not consistently defined the workforce and the National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education had not developed a list of  appropriate certifications, efforts such as conducting the baseline  assessment to determine the percentage of cybersecurity personnel  that hold appropriate certifications had yielded inconsistent and  potentially unreliable results. Further, we reported that, while most  CFO Act agencies had developed procedures for assigning  cybersecurity codes to positions, several agencies had not addressed  activities required by OPM to implement the requirements of the  Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act.", "As a result, we made 30 recommendations to 13 agencies to develop  and submit their baseline assessments and to fully address the  required activities in OPM\u2019s guidance in their procedures for assigning  employment codes to cybersecurity positions. Of the 13 agencies,  seven agreed with the recommendations made to them, four did not  state whether they agreed or disagreed, one agency agreed with one  of the two recommendations made to it, and one did not provide  comments on the report. As of July 2019, the agencies had  implemented 20 of the recommendations.", "In August 2018, as part of a government-wide review of CIO  responsibilities, we reported that CIOs are responsible for assessing  agency IT workforce needs and developing strategies and plans for  meeting those needs. However, we noted that the majority of the  agencies minimally addressed or did not address the role of their  CIOs in the area of IT workforce and reported major challenges  related to their IT workforce. Specifically, 19 agencies\u2019 policies had  not addressed their CIOs\u2019 role in conducting annual assessments of  IT management and skill requirements and the remaining five  agencies had only partially addressed this responsibility. We noted  that the shortcomings in agencies\u2019 policies were attributable, at least  in part, to incomplete guidance from OMB. Consequently, we  recommended that OMB issue guidance that addresses the IT  workforce responsibilities of CIOs that were not included in existing  guidance. OMB partially agreed with the recommendation and has not  yet implemented it. We also recommended that 24 agencies ensure  that their IT management policies address the role of their CIOs in the  IT workforce management area. Of the 24 agencies, 14 agreed with  the recommendations, five had no comments, five partially agreed,  and one disagreed. We are monitoring the status of the agencies\u2019  actions to implement our recommendations.", "In March 2019, as part of an update on the status of agencies\u2019  progress in implementing the requirements of the Federal  Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act, we reported, among  other things, that most of the 24 CFO Act agencies had not  completely or accurately categorized work roles for IT positions within  the 2210 IT management occupational series (IT management). The  agencies reported that this was, in part, because they may have  assigned the associated codes in error or had not completed  validating the accuracy of the assigned codes. We noted that, by  assigning work roles that are inconsistent with the IT, cybersecurity,  and cyber-related positions, the agencies were diminishing the  reliability of the information they needed to improve workforce  planning. We made recommendations to 22 agencies to take steps to  address the inaccuracies. Of these agencies, 20 agreed with the  recommendations, one partially agreed, and one did not agree with  one of the two recommendations. As of August 2019, three of the  agencies have implemented their recommendation, and two of the  agencies have implemented one of their two recommendations.

First, the agency disagreed with our finding that it minimally implemented  the establish and maintain a workforce planning process activity, stating  that it has a department-wide workforce planning process that includes  the IT workforce. However, while the agency issued a policy in 2013,  which we reviewed during our engagement, that directs bureaus to  annually conduct workforce planning, it did not define a process for doing  so. In addition as we further note, in 2018, the agency issued guidance  addressing workforce planning issues for bureaus to consider in  developing their own processes. However, this does not constitute an IT  workforce planning process. Since Treasury did not provide any  additional evidence of an IT workforce process, we are not changing our  rating for this activity. Second, Treasury disagreed with our finding that it  did not implement the activities associated with monitoring and reporting  on its progress in addressing competency and staffing gaps. Specifically  the agency stated that it has designed and begun implementing a new  governance structure for workforce management that reinforces the  monitoring and reporting of workforce related issues to agency leadership  during quarterly performance reviews.

To address this objective, we relied on practices from GAO\u2019s IT  workforce planning framework as criteria. The framework identifies eight  key IT workforce planning activities that, when effectively implemented,  can facilitate the success of major acquisitions. These activities are listed  in table 2.", "To ensure consistent understanding and application of the activities in our  evaluations, we reviewed the supporting laws, policy, and guidance for  each activity and identified specific evaluation criteria. The criteria are  listed in table 3.", "We reviewed IT workforce planning policies and other workforce planning  documentation for each of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990  agencies, including workforce planning processes; competency  requirements; annual mission critical occupation resource charts required  by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which document staffing  requirements and gap assessments; strategies and plans to address  gaps; and reports on progress in addressing gaps. For the six agencies  for which we previously performed IT workforce planning assessments,  we reviewed the previously reported information and obtained and  analyzed updates, as appropriate.", "We compared the information obtained to our evaluation criteria and  identified gaps and their causes. We also interviewed cognizant officials  from each of the 24 agencies, to discuss their implementation of the IT  workforce planning activities and causes for any gaps. Our review  focused on the agency\u2019s IT workforce planning efforts at the agency level,  including the extent to which the agency maintained visibility and  oversight into component-level IT workforce planning. Based on our  assessment of the documentation and discussions with agency officials,  we assessed each agency\u2019s implementation of our evaluation criteria as:  fully implemented\u2014the agency provided evidence which showed that  it fully or largely addressed the elements of the criteria. partially implemented\u2014the agency provided evidence that showed it  had addressed at least part of the criteria. not implemented\u2014the agency did not provide evidence that it had  addressed any part of the criteria.", "To determine an overall rating for each of the eight key workforce  planning activities, we summarized the results of our assessments of the  evaluation criteria. Specifically, we assessed each activity as:  fully implemented\u2014the agency fully implemented both of an activity\u2019s  evaluation criteria.  substantially implemented\u2014the agency fully implemented one of an  activity\u2019s evaluation criteria and partially implemented the other  evaluation criteria. partially implemented\u2014the agency fully implemented one of an  activity\u2019s evaluation criteria and did not implement the other criteria, or  partially implemented both of an activity\u2019s evaluation criteria. minimally implemented\u2014the agency partially implemented one of an  activity\u2019s evaluation criteria and did not implement the other evaluation  criteria. not implemented\u2014the agency did not implement either of an activity\u2019s  evaluation criteria.", "We assessed the staffing evaluation criteria for the develop competency  and staffing requirements, assess competency and staffing needs  regularly, and assess gaps in competencies and staffing activities as fully  implemented if agencies provided evidence of a complete mission critical  occupation resource chart to meet OPM reporting requirements and were  able to demonstrate that the mission critical staff represented most or all  of their IT workforce. In addition, we assessed the competency evaluation  criteria for these activities as fully implemented if agencies provided  evidence that they performed them for most or all of their IT workforce.", "For the implement activities that address gaps activity, we assessed  agencies as having fully implemented the evaluation criteria on other  efforts if they provided evidence as having implemented at least four of  the efforts identified in the Federal Information Technology Acquisition  Reform Act (FITARA). We rated this evaluation criteria as partially  implemented if agencies provided evidence of having implemented fewer  than four of the efforts.", "Finally, in making our assessments, we also considered the extent to  which an agency had implemented prerequisite activities. For example, to  implement the competency evaluation criteria for the develop strategies  and plans to address gaps activity, the agency needed to have also  implemented the competency evaluation criteria for the assess gaps in  competencies and staffing activity. We did not assess any activity higher  than the prerequisite activity.", "We also determined if there was a common factor which led to the rating  for a particular activity. For example, we noted whether most agencies  partially implemented an activity because they had fully implemented one  of the evaluation criteria, but had not implemented the other criteria. To  determine the reliability of staffing data in the mission critical occupation  resource charts, we reviewed the charts for obvious errors and for  completeness and obtained clarification from agencies on identified  errors. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of this report, which was to determine the extent to which  agencies had implemented the key activities.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to October 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Agencies\u2019 Implementation of Key IT Workforce Planning Activities", "paragraphs": ["This appendix contains assessments of the extent to which the 24 Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990 agencies implemented each of the eight  key IT workforce planning activities identified in GAO\u2019s information  technology (IT) workforce planning framework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XII: Comments from the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIII: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIV: Comments from the United States Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XV: Comments from the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVI: Comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, the following staff made key  contributions to this report: Sabine Paul (Assistant Director), Scott Borre  (Analyst in Charge), Rebecca Eyler, Cassaundra Pham, Thomas B.
