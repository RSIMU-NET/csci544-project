GAO was asked to assess whether (1) adequate controls exist over the use of federal funds, including processes to determine institution and student eligibility, manage the cash needs of the program, and pay administrative expenses; (2) funds for the DCTAG program are accounted for separately from the District's general fund; and (3) administrative expenses for the program charged against federal funds are within the 7 percent limit of the total amount appropriated for the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The District's State Education Office (SEO) has taken actions to put program and financial management procedures in place, but DCTAG is at risk in the areas of student eligibility and program budgeting. The District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant program has effective controls for determining the eligibility of higher education institutions to participate in the program and for processing institutions' invoices for payment. Other controls, however, were less effective. SEO did not have sufficient documentation to demonstrate that some students approved for DCTAG program funds were eligible because documents required to be submitted by applicants were not available. The most commonly missing documents were those intended to establish domicile in the District. Moreover, SEO officials were not verifying applicants' Social Security numbers, which should be used to establish citizenship. Furthermore, SEO did not have documentation or procedures for determining the eligibility of applicants with special circumstances. The SEO has experienced significant turnover at the top management levels since it was created by legislation in 2000. High management turnover affects an organization's control environment and its ability to plan, direct, and control operations to effectively and strategically achieve its mission. The District established dedicated cash accounts for the DCTAG program, separate from the District's general fund, as required by law. Reconciliations between these dedicated bank accounts and the District's financial management system, however, had not been performed prior to our review. At our request, the Office of Finance and Resource Management (OFRM) reconciled the dedicated bank accounts and discovered that the District's general fund had not been reimbursed for approximately $8.3 million for prior-period cash expenditures made from the District's general fund on behalf of the DCTAG program. Also, about $2.7 million in interest earned since the DCTAG-dedicated accounts were established had not been recorded as funds available for the program. The District's forecasting method to project the number of students eligible to receive DCTAG funds in current and future years has not been reviewed for methodological soundness. While projections are based on the numbers of students that apply for the first time and those who submit renewal applications during a fiscal year, these projections have not been measured against actual results to include the historical experience of the program. While the District reported that it used 5.3 percent ($0.9 million) of the federal funds during fiscal year 2004 for DCTAG program administrative expenses, the District does not track the full amount of administrative expenses incurred for the program. District officials estimate that operating the DCTAG program costs more than the 7 percent legislatively set limit, and these additional costs were absorbed using District funds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (1999 Act), as  amended by the District of Columbia College Access Improvement Act of  2002 (2002 Amendment), established a program to provide eligible college- bound students who are domiciled in the District of Columbia with greater  choices among institutions of higher education.  The program was  established under the administrative control of the Mayor of the District of  Columbia and is commonly referred to as the District of Columbia Tuition  Assistance Grant (DCTAG) program.

In addition, we selected statistical samples of tuition  assistance payments made during fiscal year 2004 to test internal controls  over the processes in place to test institution and student eligibility, as  defined by the legislation and regulations, and the related disbursements.   To review the District\u2019s accounting for DCTAG program funds, we reviewed  the procedures for (1) maintaining the dedicated cash accounts for the  DCTAG program and (2) reimbursing the District\u2019s general fund for  disbursements made on behalf of the program.  We also inquired about the  frequency of reconciliations performed and reviewed the differences  identified as a result of the District\u2019s first-ever reconciliation of the  dedicated DCTAG bank accounts to the balances shown in the District\u2019s  financial management system.  To assess whether administrative expenses  charged against federal funds for the program were within the established  7 percent limit of the total amount of federal funds appropriated for the  DCTAG program, we obtained information concerning the types and  amounts of administrative expenses incurred to operate the DCTAG  program, and reviewed the procedures followed by the District intended to  provide safeguards that the 7 percent limit on these expenses was not  exceeded.  We took several steps to assess the reliability and  reasonableness of the DCTAG program disbursement transactions for  fiscal year 2004, in the District\u2019s financial management system, System of  Accounting and Reporting (SOAR).  Overall, we found the disbursement  transaction data to be sufficiently complete and reliable for the purpose of  testing the controls over institution and student eligibility and for  documenting the total amount of DCTAG program administrative expenses  paid with federal funds for fiscal year 2004.

An eligible institution must have signed a  PPA, which is also signed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, to  participate in the DCTAG program.  The PPA states that the institution  must follow the DCTAG program regulations and all provisions of the  legislation that established the program.  Once the SEO has a signed PPA  on file, the District makes grant payments directly to that institution for the  approved applicants in the DCTAG program attending that institution.   Payments for each academic period are based on invoices submitted by the  institutions to the SEO.  Each payment period, institutions must submit a  roster of eligible students for payment containing (1) the institution\u2019s Tax  Information number and Dun and Bradstreet number; (2) the student\u2019s  name, Social Security number, permanent address, enrollment status,  amount of financial aid received, amount of tuition and fees charged for the  payment period, the amount that would be charged to an in-state student  for the payment period, and the award amount that should be paid to the  institution for the payment period for each student on the roster.

As a result of the reconciliation performed by OFRM,  we also found that a significant amount of expenditures, $8.3 million, had  not been captured in OFRM\u2019s calculations of the amount to be reimbursed  to the District\u2019s general fund, and had not been transferred from the  DCTAG-dedicated bank accounts to the District\u2019s general fund.  According  to District officials, the transactions were year-end accruals that  subsequently became expenditures in succeeding fiscal years and were  paid from the District\u2019s general fund on behalf of the DCTAG program, and  it was an oversight by OFRM to not have included them in its calculations  of the amount of funds to be transferred from the DCTAG-dedicated  accounts to the general fund.  In July 2005, District officials told us that  they had electronically transferred the $8.3 million from the DCTAG- dedicated accounts to the general fund to reimburse the general fund for  these expenditures.", "The other part of the unreconciled difference of $11 million discussed  above, $2.7 million, was identified by District officials as interest earned on  funds from the time the dedicated bank accounts were established in 2001  through June 30, 2005.  Although these interest earnings appeared on the  bank statements, District officials informed us that the $2.7 million had not  been recorded as available funds for expenditure for the DCTAG program.   District officials told us that the interest earned is considered to be an  integral part of the long-term planning and available budget for the DCTAG  program; however, budget authority for the interest earned on DCTAG  program funds had not been requested.  The interest earned was not  included as funds available for the DCTAG program in quarterly reports  provided to congressional staff.  They explained that up until 2005, there  had been a carryover of funds from one year to the next for the DCTAG  program.  Due to the successful outreach of the program, District officials  stated that they have reached the point where the carryover has been  nearly exhausted. District officials also stated that based on their analysis  of cost drivers that affect the program, such as the number of students and  cost of tuition, it would be prudent for the District to budget the earned  interest during fiscal year 2006.", "Without routine reconciliations between DCTAG-dedicated bank accounts  and SOAR, errors that occur can go undetected.  Errors that result in the  failure to reimburse the District general fund for DCTAG program  disbursements paid can affect the District\u2019s cash flow and could potentially  contribute to the need for the District to borrow to cover short-term needs.   Moreover, these errors could result in the understatement or overstatement  of DCTAG program expenditures as well as the amount of funds available  to be expended.  Reconciliations are most effective when they are done  soon after the close of the month when differences can still be researched  easily."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The SEO\u2019s Forecasting Method to Project Future Funding Needs Has Not Been Reviewed for Methodological Soundness", "paragraphs": ["The District\u2019s forecasting method to estimate the number of students and  the average cost per student for those participating in the DCTAG program  each year for future years is based on assumptions that have not been  reviewed against historical experience or developed using other available  information.  The SEO\u2019s projections for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 are  based on a flat 6 percent increase in the number of students in the program  each year and an annual increase of 10 percent in the average cost per  student to attend college.  SEO officials do not have documentation or  analysis supporting the appropriateness of these percentages for  estimation purposes.  According to SEO officials, the DCTAG program is  unique because no other city in the United States has this type of program  and, therefore, information already available on the numbers of high school  graduates continuing on to college in other states or jurisdictions is not  applicable.  SEO officials stated that they recognize the need to develop a  sound methodology for making these projections, but the focus has been  on recruitment of students and colleges and universities to participate in  the program.  The officials explained that they have not yet had an  opportunity to develop such a methodology or obtain the historical data  needed to project current and future needs based on District information.   This would require capturing, among other information, tuition rates at  DCTAG participating institutions as well as historical graduation data from  the District\u2019s public schools, 54 charter schools, and D.C.\u2019s private high  schools, and keeping statistics on the number of high school graduates that  continue on to college and remain in college in subsequent years.

The SEO does not  allocate indirect costs by program, thereby likely undercharging the  DCTAG program for administrative expenses incurred.   District officials  acknowledged that they did not know how much the total administrative  costs were, but estimated that operating the DCTAG program costs more  than the 7 percent legislatively set limit for federal funding.  They explained  that these additional costs are absorbed using District funds.  According to  SEO officials, they are working on a cost allocation process so that they  can more fully track administrative expenses.", "The 2002 Amendment provides that the DCTAG program may not use more  than 7 percent of the total amount appropriated for the program since  November 12, 1999, for administrative expenses.  Administrative  expenses are defined as any program costs other than tuition grants, and  generally include such things as payroll, supplies, materials, and utilities as  well as SEO overhead costs.  As noted, the District used 5.3 percent of the  DCTAG federal payment for administrative expenses for fiscal year 2004.   For fiscal year 2004 we reviewed, but did not audit, the administrative  expense information included in the quarterly expenditure reports  submitted to the Senate and House appropriations committees.  The  amount of DCTAG administrative expenses reported for fiscal year 2004  may not be the full amount of those expenses.  District officials told us that  they estimate the cost of administrative expenses for the DCTAG program  based on the established limit of 7 percent, and explained that they do not  have a process where they can accumulate and assign administrative costs  to the SEO\u2019s various programs, including DCTAG.  Also, during our review  of fiscal year 2004 expenditures, we identified nine transactions amounting  to $34,510 of non-DCTAG expenditures for fiscal year 2004 that had been  charged to the program in error.  These expenditures were for  administrative expenses incurred by the District\u2019s Tuition Assistance  Program Initiative for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.  Once we  notified the District of these improperly recorded transactions, District  officials made the correcting entries in SOAR.

The District needs well-designed and executed internal controls to provide  reasonable assurance that DCTAG program objectives will be met and that  only District residents meeting the eligibility criteria are awarded these  tuition grants.  These controls are crucial for the credibility of the program  and the appropriate use of federal funding.  To address the challenges of a  growing program, the SEO will need continuity of leadership going forward  to plan, direct, and control operations to effectively and strategically  achieve the goals of the DCTAG program.  Moreover, SEO and OFRM  officials must closely monitor DCTAG program funds to ensure that  accurate records are maintained, account reconciliations are performed  and documented, and that sufficient funds are available to meet current  and future financial needs.  To ensure that the District has the resources to  meet the demand for DCTAG tuition grants, the District needs projections  of both the short-term and long-term financial needs of the program based  on a sound analytical methodology.

In his comments, the Mayor  characterized the findings in the draft report as stemming from weaknesses  existing in the program\u2019s start-up years versus more currently.  However, as  described in our scope and methodology (see app. I), our testing was based  on a sample of payments from all fiscal year 2004 expenditure transactions  for the DCTAG program.  These expenditure transactions for fiscal year  2004 included payment transactions for students receiving grants for both  the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 school years.  Students receiving payments  during that time period may have submitted their original applications  during previous years depending on the year in which they entered the  program.  In order to test the sufficiency of documentation to obtain  assurances on student eligibility, we reviewed the initial application  submitted by each student, as well as the application submitted for fiscal  year 2004.  Our report identified a total of 16 exceptions that occurred as  follows: 6 in the initial year of the program (2000-2001); 1 during academic  year 2001-2002; 4 for academic year 2002-2003; and 5 during academic year  2003-2004.

The CFO added that these reconciliations were performed timely.   However, we found that the reconciliations had not been performed prior  to our review.

While the CFO stated that the  earned interest was reflected in the annual budget submissions to  Congress, our review of information provided by the Office of Budget and  Planning shows that the earned interest was not included in the budget  request submissions.  According to the CFO, the interest had not been  budgeted because in the early years of the DCTAG program, the yearly  congressional appropriation was more than sufficient to meet total  expenditures.
