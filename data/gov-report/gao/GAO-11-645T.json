Specifically, Congress could explore opportunities to foster  state and local innovation in integrating services and consolidating  administrative structures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Greater Colocation of Services at One-Stop Centers May Increase Efficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed WIA partly in response to concerns about fragmentation  and inefficiencies in federal employment and training programs. WIA  authorized several employment and training programs\u2014including Job  Corps and programs for Native Americans, migrant and seasonal  farmworkers, and veterans\u2014as well as the Adult Education and Literacy  program. WIA replaced the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)  programs for economically disadvantaged adults and youths and  dislocated workers with three new programs\u2014WIA Adult, WIA Dislocated  Worker, and WIA Youth. These programs provide a range of services,  including occupational training and job search assistance. Beyond  authorizing these programs, WIA also required the establishment of one- stop centers in all local areas and mandated that many federal  employment and training programs, including the ES and WIA Adult  programs, provide services through the centers.", "Under WIA, sixteen different categories of programs, administered by four  federal agencies, must provide services through the one-stop system,  according to Labor officials. Thirteen of these categories include  programs that meet our definition of an employment and training program,  and three categories do not, but offer other services to jobseekers who  need them (see fig. 1). These 13 program categories represent about 40  percent of the federal appropriations for employment and training  programs in fiscal year 2010.", "One-stop centers serve as the key access point for a range of services that  help unemployed workers re-enter the workforce\u2014including job search  assistance, skill assessment and case management, occupational skills and  on-the-job training, basic education and literacy training, as well as access  to Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits and other supportive services\u2014 and they also assist employers in finding workers. Any person visiting a  one-stop center may look for a job, receive career development services,  and gain access to a range of vocational education programs. In our 2007  study, we found that a typical one-stop center in many states offered  services for eight or nine required programs on-site.", "In addition to required programs, one-stop centers have the flexibility to  include other, optional programs in the one-stop system, such as the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program, the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and  Training Program, or other community-based programs, which help them  better meet specific state and local workforce development needs. The  Dayton, Ohio, one-stop center, for example, boasts over 40 programs on- site at the 8-1/2 acre facility, including an organization that provides free  business attire to job seekers who need it, an alternative high school  program that assists students in obtaining a diploma, and organizations  providing parenting and self-sufficiency classes. Nationwide, services may  also be provided at affiliated sites\u2014designated locations that provide  access to at least one employment and training program.", "While WIA requires certain programs to provide services through the one- stop system, it does not provide additional funds to operate one-stop  systems and support one-stop infrastructure. As a result, required  programs are expected to share the costs of developing and operating one- stop centers. In 2007, we reported that WIA programs and the ES program  were the largest funding sources states used to support the  infrastructure\u2014or nonpersonnel costs\u2014of their comprehensive one-stop  centers. To help cover operational costs and expand services, some one- stop centers that we visited for a study of promising practices raised  additional funds to support the infrastructure through fee-based services,  grants, or contributions from partner programs and state or local  governments. For example, one-stop operators in Clarksville, Tennessee,  reported that they raised $750,000 in one year through a combination of  business consulting, drug testing, and drivers\u2019 education services. In  addition, the one-stop center in Kansas City, Missouri, had a full-time staff  person dedicated to researching and applying for grants. The one-stop  generated two-thirds of an entire program year\u2019s operating budget of $21  million through competitive grants available from the federal government  as well as from private foundations.", "One-stop centers required under WIA provide an opportunity for a broad  array of federal employment and training programs\u2014both required and  optional programs\u2014to coordinate their services and avoid duplication.  Although WIA does not require that programs be colocated within the one- stop center, this is one option that programs may use to provide services  within the one-stop structure. Labor\u2019s policy is to encourage colocation of  all required programs to the extent possible; however, officials  acknowledged that colocation is one of multiple means for achieving  service integration. We have previously reported that colocating services  can result in improved communication among programs, improved  delivery of services for clients, and elimination of duplication. While  colocating services does not guarantee efficiency improvements, it affords  the potential for sharing resources and cross-training staff, and may lead,  in some cases, to the consolidation of administrative systems, such as  information technology systems. Our early study of promising one-stop  practices found that the centers nominated as exemplary did just that\u2014 they cross-trained program staff, consolidated case management and  intake procedures across multiple programs, and developed shared data  systems.  More broadly, these promising practices streamline services for  job seekers, engage the employer community, and build a solid one-stop  infrastructure. Other types of linkages between programs, such as  electronic linkages or referrals, may not result in the same types of  efficiency improvements, but they may still present opportunities to  streamline services.", "Although the potential benefits of colocation are recognized,  implementation may pose challenges. WIA Adult and the Employment  Service are generally colocated in one-stop centers, but TANF  employment and training services are colocated in one-stops to a lesser  extent. In our 2007 report, we found that 30 states provided the TANF  program on site at a typical comprehensive one-stop center. These states  accounted for 57 percent of the comprehensive one-stop centers  nationwide. Some previous efforts to reauthorize WIA have included  proposals to make TANF a mandatory one-stop partner. Increasing  colocation, however, could prove difficult due to issues such as limited  available office space, differences in client needs and the programs\u2019 client  service philosophies, and the need for programs to help fund the operating  costs of the one-stop centers. HHS officials noted, that when TANF  employment and training services are not colocated in one-stop centers,  they are typically colocated with other services for low-income families,  such as SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, and Medicaid.  Officials acknowledged that colocating TANF employment and training  services in one-stop centers may mean that they are no longer colocated  with these other services, although Florida, Texas, and Utah provide SNAP  services through one-stops along with TANF services, and Utah also  provides Medicaid through one-stops. Officials said that in states where  this is not the case, the potential trade-off would need to be considered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidating Administrative Structures May Also Increase Efficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Given that the purpose of WIA, in part, was to transform the fragmented  employment and training system into a coherent one, our work suggests  that greater efficiencies could be achieved. Three of the largest  employment and training programs, the TANF, ES, and WIA Adult  programs, provide some of the same employment and training services to  low-income individuals, despite differences between the programs (see fig.  2). While the TANF program serves low-income families with children, the  ES and WIA Adult programs serve all adults, including low-income  individuals. Specifically, the WIA Adult program gives priority for intensive  and training services to recipients of public assistance and other low- income individuals when program funds are limited. All three programs  share a common goal of helping individuals secure employment, and the  TANF and WIA Adult programs also aim to reduce welfare dependency.  However, employment is only one aspect of the TANF program, which has  other broad social service goals, and as a result, TANF provides a wide  range of other services beyond employment and training, including cash  assistance.", "Jo search workshops.", "Susidized employment.", "The TANF, ES, and WIA Adult programs maintain separate administrative  structures to provide some of the same services to low-income individuals.  At the federal level, the TANF program is administered by HHS, and the ES  and WIA Adult programs are administered by Labor. At the state level, the  TANF program is typically administered by the state human services or  welfare agency, and the ES and WIA Adult programs are typically  administered by the state workforce agency. By regulation, ES services  must be provided by state employees. At the local level, WIA regulations  require at least one comprehensive one-stop center to be located in every  local workforce investment area. These areas may have the same  boundaries as counties, may be multicounty, or may be within or across  county lines. Similarly, every county typically has a TANF office. TANF  employment and training services may be delivered at TANF offices, in  one-stop centers, or through contracts with for-profit or nonprofit  organizations, according to HHS officials. In one-stop centers, ES staff  provide job search and other services to ES customers, while WIA staff  provide job search and other services to WIA Adult customers.", "Florida, Texas, and Utah have consolidated the state workforce and  welfare agencies that administer the TANF, ES, and WIA Adult programs,  among other programs. In Utah, the workforce agency administers the  TANF program in its entirety. In Florida and Texas, the workforce  agencies administer only that part of TANF related to employment and  training services. In all three states, the one-stop centers serve as portals  to a range of social services, including TANF. Officials from these three  states told us that consolidating agencies led to cost savings through the  reduction of staff and facilities. For example, a Utah official said that the  state reduced the number of buildings in which employment and training  services were provided from 104 to 34. According to a Texas official,  Texas also privatized 3,000 full-time staff equivalents (FTE) at the local  level, which reduced the pension, retirement, and insurance costs that had  previously been associated with these state positions. Officials in the three  states, however, could not provide a dollar figure for the cost savings that  resulted from consolidation.", "State officials also told us that consolidation improved the quality of  services for participants in the WIA Adult and TANF programs. An official  in Utah noted the consolidation allowed job seekers to apply for  assistance they had not considered in the past, allowed employment  counselors to cluster services that made sense for the client, and allowed  clients to experience seamless service delivery. These benefits reflected  what the official said was one of the visions of consolidation: having one  employment plan per client, rather than multiple employment plans for  clients served by multiple programs. While Florida officials acknowledged  that a subset of TANF clients have significant barriers to employment\u2014 such as mental health issues\u2014that one-stop centers may not be well  equipped to address, officials said that the one-stops in their state are able  to address the employment and training needs of the majority of TANF  clients. When asked about the quality of the TANF and workforce  programs in Florida, Texas, and Utah, Labor officials were not aware of  any performance problems in these programs and added that they view all  three states as forerunners in program improvement efforts. That said,  they noted that Utah may not be representative of other states, due to its  relatively small and homogenous population. In addition, officials from the  Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) said that Texas and Florida may  place more of an emphasis on quickly finding work for TANF clients than  other states.", "Even with the benefits identified by state officials, consolidation may have  its challenges. An official in Utah noted that the reorganization of state  agencies and staff was time-consuming and costly, and it took several  years before any cost savings were realized. For example, developing a  shared database across programs increased costs temporarily. In addition,  when states consolidate their agencies, they must still adhere to separate  program requirements for TANF and WIA. A 2004 article on service  integration by authors from CLASP and the Hudson Institute concluded  that options were available for states to make significant progress in  integrating TANF and WIA services, but it also noted the difficulty in  administering separate programs with different requirements. The article  specifically noted differences in work requirements, program performance  measures, and reporting requirements, among others. A Utah official said  that it was important for program administrators to be knowledgeable  about these separate reporting requirements and processes across the  multiple federal agencies that oversee these programs. Similarly, this  official said that direct service staff needed to be knowledgeable about  multiple programs and how to allocate costs across these programs. For  states that have not consolidated their workforce and welfare agencies,  not knowing what actions are allowable under the law may present a  challenge to consolidation. According to the article on service integration,  states face some legal barriers to fully integrating TANF and WIA services,  but if they do not know what is allowable under the law, they may not  always exercise the full range of options available to them.", "In conclusion, understanding how well the one-stop system is reducing  fragmentation through coordinated service delivery would be useful in  deciding where efficiencies could be achieved, but no study has been  undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the one-stop system approach.  While a few program impact studies have been done or are underway,  these studies largely take a program-by-program approach rather than  focusing on understanding which approaches are most effective in  streamlining service delivery and improving one-stop efficiency. In  addition, Labor\u2019s efforts to collaborate with other agencies to assess the  effects of different strategies to integrate job-seeker services have been  limited. We previously recommended that Labor collaborate with  Education, HHS, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) to develop a research agenda that examines the impacts of various  approaches to program integration on job seeker and employer  satisfaction and outcomes. Labor has committed to collaborating with  other agencies and has involved them in developing inter-agency initiatives  for certain targeted activities, but has not yet evaluated the effectiveness  of the one-stop system.", "While states and localities have undertaken some potentially promising  initiatives to achieve greater administrative efficiencies, little information  is available about the strategies and results of these initiatives; therefore, it  is unclear the extent to which practices in these states could serve as  models for others. Moreover, little is known about the incentives states  and localities have to undertake such initiatives and whether additional  incentives may be needed. We recently recommended that the Secretaries  of Labor and HHS work together to develop and disseminate information  that could inform such efforts, including information on state initiatives to  consolidate program administrative structures and state and local efforts  to colocate additional programs at one-stop centers. As part of this effort,  we recommended that Labor and HHS examine the incentives for states  and localities to undertake such initiatives and, as warranted, identify  options for increasing them. In their responses, Labor and HHS agreed  with our recommendations. However, HHS noted that it lacks legal  authority to mandate increased TANF-WIA coordination or to create  incentives for such efforts.", "Increasing efficiencies among federal employment and training programs  is clearly challenging. These are difficult issues to address because they  may require agencies and Congress to re-examine within and across  various mission areas the fundamental structure, operation, funding, and  performance of a number of long-standing federal programs and activities.  As the nation rises to meet its current fiscal challenges, GAO will continue  to assist Congress and federal agencies in identifying actions needed to  address these issues.", "Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Hinojosa, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
