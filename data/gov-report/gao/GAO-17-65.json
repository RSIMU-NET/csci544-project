GAO surveyed all SEC employees (staff in its six key divisions and offices, staff in all other offices and divisions, and all senior officers, with response rates of 69, 60, and 70 percent, respectively); evaluated SEC policies and procedures against relevant criteria; and analyzed information on SEC's practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Employee views on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) organizational culture have generally improved since 2013. Employees GAO surveyed cited improved levels of morale and trust within the agency compared to 2013 and noted that SEC was less hierarchical and risk-averse. However, GAO's survey indicated that SEC still operates in a compartmentalized way and that there is little communication and collaboration between divisions.", "SEC made limited progress on improving personnel management. SEC has addressed two of seven recommendations from GAO's 2013 report, but it faces added challenges in cross-divisional collaboration and hiring and promotion.", "Mechanisms to monitor supervisors' use of performance management system . Recently, SEC began to monitor how supervisors (1) provide feedback to staff, (2) recognize and reward staff, and (3) address poor performance. SEC's efforts address the related 2013 recommendation.", "Accountability system . SEC implemented a system to monitor its human capital programs and inform its human capital goals consistent with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance.

SEC has developed a workforce and succession plan in response to two of GAO's recommendations, but the plan does not include some elements of OPM guidance, such as a skills gap analysis for all SEC staff. As a result, SEC continues to lack assurance that all staff have the necessary skills.", "Performance management. Although GAO found in 2013 that SEC's performance management system was generally consistent with relevant criteria, SEC redesigned it in 2014 without first examining its effectiveness\u2014a recommendation GAO made in 2013. SEC officials stated they do not plan any future reviews because they are piloting a new system. As a result, SEC lacks assurance that the new system will perform better than the current one.", "Communication and collaboration . SEC has made little progress to address GAO's two recommendations related to improving cross-divisional collaboration. While SEC has recognized some staff for collaborating, it has yet to set expectations for all staff to collaborate across divisions as needed or implement relevant best practices to break down existing silos. As a result, SEC staff still report that divisions operate in isolation. Other than the SEC Chair's Office, which has competing demands on its time, no official has authority to affect the daily operations of the entire agency. Other organizations rely on their Chief Operating Officer (COO) to make such changes, but because SEC's COO lacks such authority, the agency will likely continue to face challenges.", "In addition, GAO found that because SEC has not identified skills gaps among its hiring specialists, its training of these staff is limited. As a result, SEC lacks assurance that its hiring specialists have the necessary skills to hire and promote the most qualified applicants, in accordance with key principles of an effective control system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["SEC should (1) provide authority to the COO or other official to enhance cross-divisional collaboration and (2) develop and implement training for hiring specialists that is informed by a skills gap analysis.

To carry out its mission, SEC requires public  companies to disclose meaningful financial and other information to the  public, examines firms it regulates, and investigates potential securities  law violations. SEC oversees more than 25,000 market participants,  including nearly 12,000 investment advisers, approximately 10,500  mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and nearly 4,500 broker- dealers. Under the Dodd\u2010Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), the agency\u2019s jurisdiction was  expanded to include certain participants in the derivatives markets,  private fund advisers, and municipal advisers, among other changes.  The large number of entities SEC oversees, combined with the increased  complexity of these entities, underscores the importance of SEC\u2019s  regulatory oversight of the securities markets.", "Effectively carrying out its regulatory responsibilities requires that SEC  attract and retain a high-quality workforce. However, because SEC faced  a high-profile enforcement failure during the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis,  we and others have previously reported on the personnel management  challenges SEC has faced in building and retaining such a workforce.  These challenges have included a lack of emphasis on personnel  management and weaknesses in linking pay and performance. We most  recently reported on SEC\u2019s personnel management challenges in 2013.  In our July 2013 report, we made seven recommendations to improve  SEC\u2019s personnel management, including developing comprehensive  workforce plans, implementing mechanisms to monitor how supervisors  use the performance management system, conducting periodic  validations of the performance management system, exploring  collaboration practices of leading organizations, and regularly assessing  these efforts.", "SEC is not unique in facing personnel management challenges. For  example, in February 2011, we found a number of cross-cutting skill gaps  across the federal government and recommended that actions be taken  by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), federal agencies, and the  Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council to address critical skills  gaps that cut across several agencies. In response, OPM and agencies  launched several initiatives. For example, in September 2011, OPM and  the CHCO Council established an interagency working group to identify  and mitigate selected skills gaps in mission-critical occupations. Most  recently, in January 2015, we recommended that OPM and the CHCO  Council incorporate lessons learned from their initial efforts to close skill  gaps to strengthen future approaches. Strategic human capital  management has remained on our list of high-risk areas since 2001.", "Section 962 of the Dodd-Frank Act includes a provision for us to report  triennially on SEC\u2019s personnel management, including the competence of  professional staff; the effectiveness of supervisors; and issues related to  employee performance assessments, promotion, and intra-agency  communication. This report examines (1) employees\u2019 views of SEC\u2019s  organizational culture and personnel management, and the extent to  which these views have changed since our 2013 report and (2) the extent  to which selected SEC personnel management practices have been  implemented consistent with relevant standards.", "To examine employees\u2019 views of SEC\u2019s organizational culture and the  extent to which they have changed since 2013, we implemented three  web-based surveys, based largely on our 2013 surveys, of all 4,236  nonsupervisory and supervisory staff and 148 senior officers. The three  surveys were of (1) the mission-critical office and divisions, (2) all other  offices and divisions, and (3) all senior officers, and their response rates  were approximately 69 percent, 60 percent, and 70 percent respectively.  Our three surveys consisted of both multiple-choice and open-ended  questions and the results from the multiple choice questions are detailed  in a separate GAO report (GAO-17-95SP). We do not make any attempt  to extrapolate the findings to the eligible staff who chose not to complete  our surveys.", "To determine the extent to which selected SEC personnel management  practices have been implemented consistent with relevant standards, we  examined a variety of policies and identified the ones that were designed  consistent with relevant criteria and tested their implementation. First,  we assessed SEC policies, procedures, and other documents related to  personnel management against applicable federal regulations, OPM\u2019s  Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (HCAAF), key  human capital practices, our prior work on personnel management and  workforce issues, and federal standards for internal control. Second,  based on our assessment of SEC documents (e.g., plans, policies,  standard operating procedures, and annual reports), interviews with  officials from SEC\u2019s mission-critical office and divisions and the Office of  Human Resources, and discussions with our internal human capital  officials, we identified four practices that were designed consistent with  relevant OPM criteria and best practices: hiring and promotions,  recognizing and rewarding performance, providing feedback, and  addressing unacceptable performance. Finally, we tested these four  practices to determine whether SEC was implementing them consistent  with its policies and procedures. This testing consisted of performing file  reviews and data analysis. We also conducted interviews with relevant  SEC staff in the Office of Human Resources and the mission-critical office  and divisions. As part of this effort, we reviewed actions SEC had taken to  address the seven recommendations from our 2013 report related to four  personnel management areas: (1) workforce planning, (2) performance  management, (3) communication and collaboration, and (4) human  capital accountability.", "For all objectives, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a  nonprobability sample of SEC supervisors selected based on whether  they worked in the mission-critical office and divisions, their position and  grade level, geographic location, and their willingness to participate. We  also interviewed former SEC employees, officials from the SEC Office of  Inspector General (IG), and self-selected representatives and members of  the SEC employees\u2019 union. We selected a nonprobability sample of  former employees to interview that reflected the diversity of former  employees in terms of pay grade, occupational category, and tenure,  among other factors. The views of these officials are not generalizable.", "We assessed the reliability of all of the data we used during this review  and determined they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, which  include describing trends and views on personnel management practices  at SEC. To assess the reliability of OPM\u2019s Federal Employee Viewpoint  Survey (FEVS) data, we examined descriptive statistics and data  distribution and we reviewed missing data. We also reviewed FEVS  technical documentation, as well as the statistical code OPM uses to  generate the index and variance estimates, and we interviewed officials  responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing the data. We used  SEC data derived from the Department of the Interior\u2019s Federal  Personnel/Payroll System to construct our sample frames for the three  surveys, test the implementation of various personnel management  practices, and develop summary tables in our appendixes. To determine  the reliability of these data, we interviewed SEC staff responsible for the  data to determine how data were collected, what controls existed over the  data, and any limitations on the data. In addition, where possible, we  compared data elements to the original source documents to corroborate  the accuracy of the data where available. Appendix II provides more  information on our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to December 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The mission-critical office  and divisions are supported by other offices, such as the Office of  Financial Management, the Office of Information Technology, and the  Office of Human Resources. The Office of Information Technology  supports SEC and its employees in all aspects of information technology  (IT) and has overall management responsibility for SEC\u2019s IT program,  including application development, infrastructure operations and  engineering, user support, IT program management, capital planning,  security, and enterprise architecture. SEC\u2019s Office of Human Resources  provides overall responsibility for the strategic management of SEC\u2019s  personnel management and assesses compliance with federal  regulations for areas such as recruitment, retention, leadership and staff  development, and performance management. However, certain divisions  have internal human resource coordinators that liaise between the Office  of Human Resources and their respective division heads.

As of  February 2016, SEC employed 4,674 staff. Of these, approximately 40  percent were attorneys, 21 percent were accountants or financial  analysts, and 6 percent were examiners. The remaining 33 percent were  other professional, technical, administrative, and clerical staff. From fiscal  years 2013 through 2015, SEC hired 1,310 employees. To help SEC  attract and retain qualified employees, Congress enacted the Investor  and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act (Pay Parity Act) in 2002, which  allowed SEC to implement a new compensation system with unique pay  scales comparable to those of other federal financial regulators.

According to HCAAF, the results of the human capital accountability  system should inform an agency\u2019s human capital goals and objectives as  well as its spending priorities. For example, SEC relied on the results of  its review of the Student Loan Repayment Program to set goals related to  attracting and retaining talent. Specifically, SEC found that the program  lacked a process to document why some employees\u2019 applications were  denied and therefore was unable to ensure that qualified and talented  employees benefited from the program. According to SEC officials, in  response to the results of the review, SEC broadened its goal of attracting  and retaining talented employees by incorporating goals related to  improvements to the management and oversight of the program.  Likewise, officials said that SEC used the results of its quarterly reviews  of its recruitment case files, which found improvements in aspects of the  recruitment and hiring process, to set more challenging goals to hire  larger numbers of staff in a more efficient manner. Based on the results of  these reviews, SEC requested additional Office of Human Resources  staff in its 2017 budget justification request, according to SEC officials.

For example, SEC\u2019s annual agency-wide  awards program includes awards that recognize outstanding teams,  including cross-divisional teams. SEC has also implemented tools and  procedures to facilitate collaboration. For example, SEC developed a  tracking system that facilitates collaboration on interdivisional  memorandums, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis  developed an electronic system that allows other divisions to request data  it collects. In addition, the Division of Enforcement created formal liaisons  that other divisions and offices can contact. Managers in four of the five  largest divisions and offices told us that these liaisons help to facilitate  cross-divisional communication and collaboration with the Division of  Enforcement.", "However, incentives for staff to support an environment of open  communication and collaboration are not present for all staff across SEC.  According to OPM guidance, supervisors and managers should foster an  environment of communication and collaboration.

We have previously identified best practices related  to collaboration, including supervisors fostering an environment of open  communication, promoting frequent communication among collaborating  divisions, and establishing compatible policies and procedures to operate  across agency boundaries. When we asked officials from the COO\u2019s  office whether they had researched best practices for improving  communication and collaboration across SEC, they provided two  examples. First, SEC officials told us that they reached out to officials at  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to discuss how FDIC  had obtained high survey scores related to communication and  collaboration. This outreach resulted in the creation of SEC\u2019s \u201cAll  Invested\u201d initiative, which SEC described as an initiative to encourage  collaboration and community to help the agency achieve its mission and  make SEC the best place in government to work. Second, SEC officials  mentioned a best practice in which they launched a \u201cvalues campaign\u201d to  promote important values, including teamwork, as a part of the \u201cAll  Invested\u201d initiative. However, many of the supervisors and staff we spoke  with told us that the \u201cAll Invested\u201d initiative was more of a marketing  campaign than a substantive change. SEC has also established a  number of working groups to improve communication and collaboration,  but these working groups are often focused on specific topics and do not  provide a means for divisions and offices to collaborate on the full range  of their day-to-day work activities. As a result of SEC\u2019s limited action, we  maintain that SEC has not taken sufficient steps to fully address our 2013  recommendation to explore and implement best practices to improve  communication and collaboration within and across SEC divisions and  offices.", "Of the seven recommendations that we made in 2013, SEC has made the  least progress on the recommendations related to enhancing intra-agency  communication and collaboration. One reason for this may be that, other  than the Office of the Chair, there is no senior-level office or official that  has authority over the daily operations of all SEC divisions and offices  (see previous fig. 1). For example, the COO is responsible for approving  budget requests, staffing levels, and reorganization requests for the SEC  as a whole. However, each mission-critical office and division has its  own director that is responsible for policies and programs that affect the  operations of each individual office and division. For example, the  Director of Enforcement and his staff facilitate communications with other  divisions and offices to conduct investigations and coordinate on policy or  legislative briefings. According to the March 2011 Boston Consulting  Group report, the function of the SEC COO has historically focused on  the annual congressional appropriation cycle, internal budgeting process,  and administrative duties. Based on a number of interviews with  relevant staff in the Office of Human Resources, we found that this  structure and the limited authority of the COO may help to explain in part  the inability of the COO to explore and implement best practices that  could affect the daily operations throughout SEC. For example, these  staff told us that the divisions and offices play the key roles in exploring  and implementing best practices that could affect daily operations  throughout SEC, not the COO.", "Key principles we have identified for organizational transformation call for  agencies to create a position such as a COO or Chief Management  Officer with authority over all operations of the agency; such a position is  one approach to help agencies address long-standing management  challenges. For example, there needs to be a single point within the  agency with the responsibility and authority to ensure successful  implementation of functional management and transformational change  efforts. Further, it is not practical to expect an official like the Chair\u2019s Chief  of Staff to undertake this vital responsibility due to competing demands on  their time in helping to execute the Chair\u2019s policy and program agendas.", "The lack of a central position or office with authority over the daily  operations of all SEC divisions and offices makes it difficult to lead SEC- wide changes to address long-standing management challenges related  to communication and collaboration. Because of the COO\u2019s limited  authority and the absence of another SEC official, other than the SEC  Chair, with the authority over the divisions and offices to take action to  facilitate efforts to improve cross-divisional communication and  collaboration, progress in this area will likely continue to be limited. An  environment of limited intra-agency communication may continue to  increase the risk of inefficiencies and less-than-optimal decision making,  which may affect SEC\u2019s ability to achieve its mission, as was the case  with SEC\u2019s actions related to the Bernard Madoff ponzi scheme and other  enforcement failures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hiring and Promotions", "paragraphs": ["SEC\u2019s hiring and promotion policies and procedures are generally  consistent with OPM and other relevant criteria, but SEC lacks assurance  that staff, particularly hiring specialists, know how to implement the  policies and procedures correctly. OPM\u2019s HCAAF specifies, among other  things, that agencies\u2019 hiring processes should help ensure that positions  are developed and validated by appropriate staff, that position  descriptions are established, and that appropriate assessment tools (e.g.,  processes for comparing application packages to qualifications and  conducting panel interviews) are developed prior to initiating a hiring  request. In addition, agencies should follow merit system principles and  must observe prohibited personnel practices to ensure a fair process and  may have to follow veterans\u2019 preference requirements. Key principles  for hiring that we have identified call for agencies to use vacancy  announcements that are clear, user friendly, and comprehensive.  Finally, federal internal control standards note that agencies should have  procedures to determine whether a particular candidate fits the  organizational needs and has the competence for the proposed role.", "Consistent with these criteria, SEC\u2019s hiring and promotion policies and  procedures require hiring specialists from the Office of Human Resources  and hiring managers from the divisions and offices to follow specific steps  and document these steps in recruitment case files. These steps include  the following: documenting consultations between SEC hiring specialists and  division hiring managers over the position to be filled by a hiring or  promotion action;  including descriptions of the position, job analysis, and the vacancy  announcement in the case file for the position; documenting the review of applications to help ensure they meet  issuing a certificate of eligibles, which lists all the applicants who are  determined to be best qualified for the position posted; providing evidence of whether hiring managers reviewed each  certificate of eligibles within established time frames and made a  selection from the list of certified eligibles; and obtaining signed offer letters and supporting documentation, including  starting salary.", "In addition, in 2015, SEC finalized standard operating procedures related  to the review and maintenance of case files. These procedures require  hiring specialists to complete checklists at various stages in the hiring and  promotion process to help ensure that documents are uploaded  appropriately. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and approving  the checklists before moving to the next stage in the process. In addition,  they are also responsible for conducting periodic compliance reviews to  ensure adherence to these procedures.", "However, although these policies and procedures meet relevant criteria,  we found a large number of deficiencies when we tested the policies\u2019  implementation. We reviewed a random sample of cases files from fiscal  years 2013 through 2015 to determine if SEC was following its hiring and  promotion policies and procedures. Based on our analysis of this  sample, we estimate that for 94 percent of the case files for fiscal years  2013 through 2015, SEC staff did not consistently follow at least one  policy or procedure for hiring and promotion actions, including the  following examples:", "Documentation missing: Based on our analysis of the sample, we  estimate that 16 percent of case files during these fiscal years had no  evidence that applicants were reviewed to ensure they met the  minimum job requirements. Further, we estimate that 16 percent of  the case files had no certificate of eligibles, which makes it difficult to  determine how officials selected the best qualified applicants. We  also found deficiencies once candidates were selected for the  position. For example, for 23 job offers made, we found no documents  that showed how the initial salary was determined.", "Supervisory approvals missing: Based on our analysis of the  sample, we estimate that 18 percent of case files for fiscal years 2013  through 2015 contained documents describing the consultation  between the hiring specialist and the hiring manager about the  position that were not completed or signed. As a result, determining  if the hiring specialist and hiring manager reviewed and developed the  documentation that is meant to support and defend the hiring decision  is difficult. In addition, we estimate that 16 percent of case files had  certificates of eligibles that were not signed by the responsible  officials. The selecting officials are responsible for returning the  certificate with their selection indicated, and their signature serves to  assure the Office of Human Resources that they have provided their  approval to extend an offer of employment, according to SEC staff.", "Time frames not observed: Based on our analysis of the sample, we  estimate that 29 percent of case files for fiscal years 2013 through  2015 had certificates of eligibles that were not returned on time, nor  was there documentation on why they were not returned on time.  This is particularly important because some SEC employees told us  that SEC cannot always hire the most qualified people due to slow  processing times. In addition, for 20 job offers, the offer letter was  sent before the initial salary determination was made, which is against  SEC policy.", "SEC has also conducted reviews of its case files and identified  deficiencies similar to those we found during our review. As discussed  previously, as part of SEC\u2019s implementation of its human capital  accountability system, SEC has implemented an internal quality control  process to help ensure that case files are accurate and complete, but this  process occurs after hiring and promotion decisions are made. The  purpose of this quality control process is to identify common deficiencies  in case files in order to improve the hiring and promotion process. SEC  has conducted four quarterly reviews of case files since September 2014  and continues to identify weaknesses similar to those we found, such as  missing evidence of ranking of job candidates and missing documentation  to support the initial salary of the candidate. SEC categorized the  deficiencies into five levels of severity and found that the frequency of the  minor (e.g., missing checklists) and moderate (e.g., missing descriptions  of the position) deficiencies has slowly decreased over time, with minor  deficiencies decreasing from 48 percent of case files reviewed during its  September 2015 quarterly review to 41 percent in the most recent March  2016 review. Likewise, according to SEC, the moderate deficiencies  decreased from 16 percent to 9 percent of case files reviewed over this  same time period. However, the frequency of significant (e.g., missing  reviews of whether applicants meet minimum qualifications) and major  (e.g., missing audit of certificate of eligibles) deficiencies had slowly  increased over time. Significant deficiencies have increased from 24  percent of case files reviewed during the September 2015 quarterly  review to 33 percent in the most recent March 2016 review. Likewise, the  major deficiencies increased from 12 percent to 17 percent of case files  reviewed over the same time period. SEC had no critical deficiencies  (e.g., violation of veterans\u2019 preference) over this period.", "OPM, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and an outside  consultant also reviewed SEC\u2019s hiring and promotion practices and  identified similar deficiencies in a sample of case files they reviewed,  including the following examples.", "OPM found that although SEC had various options for staff to  document their rationale for deeming an applicant who did not meet  minimum qualifications as \u201cbest qualified,\u201d in some cases, staff did not  provide sufficient documentation. As a result, OPM had difficulty  reconstructing some minimum qualifications to assess whether a  candidate met the minimum qualifications for the job posting. However  OPM did find that the qualifications were accurate.", "NCUA found that applicants were not consistently notified of the  status of their application at key stages. OPM has noted that it is a  good practice to keep applicants notified of their status.", "An outside consultant that reviewed SEC\u2019s internal promotion actions  from fiscal years 2011 through 2014 found, for example, that SEC\u2019s  lack of full adherence to uniform personnel practices and guidelines  appeared to result in a loss of promotional opportunities and unequal  treatment in the selection stage for certain groups. Specifically, the  consultant found that disparities existed in the way human resources  specialists processed promotion actions and that they failed to apply  processes and procedures established by OPM to promote fair and  equal opportunities for all employees. These practices included  restricting vacancy announcements to specific offices within SEC and  early closing of vacancy announcements. As a result of these  practices, the consultant reported that well-qualified applicants who  perform similar functions in another area of SEC may not be selected  or applicants may not have sufficient time to apply.", "SEC has taken a number of actions to address deficiencies identified by  OPM, NCUA, and the consultant. For example, in December 2015 during  our review, SEC began to mandate that all case file documents be  uploaded to an electronic case file. Previously, SEC case files were  maintained in a paper format. According to SEC staff, the electronic case  files allow for easier access and monitoring than paper files, allow for  controls over what documents are stored in the case files, and avoid  problems with documents being misplaced or lost. To address issues that  NCUA found, SEC now notifies applicants at key stages of the application  process. SEC\u2019s actions in response to recommendations in the  consultant\u2019s report include providing general training to all staff on how  SEC promotes staff, publicizing the promotion process to all staff, and  providing resources to staff interested in promotions, including guidance  regarding writing resumes and preparing for interviews.", "SEC has recently taken some steps to improve its hiring and promotion  practices, which may help to address the types of errors that we found in  our review of files from fiscal years 2013 through 2015. As discussed  previously, we found that hiring specialists failed to include the required  documentation for 94 percent of case files we reviewed. The presence of  errors in a large percentage of case files indicates that Office of Human  Resource supervisors, who are responsible for overseeing the work of the  hiring specialists, did not identify and resolve these issues as required by  SEC policy. According to federal internal control standards, managers  should perform ongoing monitoring as part of the normal course of  operations. Ongoing monitoring includes regular supervisory activities  and reconciliations, and may include automated tools, which can increase  objectivity and efficiency. SEC officials told us that the electronic case  files they began to create in December 2015, during the course of our  review, should allow them to more easily monitor and audit whether all  documentation is complete and properly uploaded at every stage of the  hiring and promotion process, and these actions are consistent with  federal internal control standards. Few completed electronic case files  were available during our review, and therefore it is too early to evaluate  the effectiveness of the new process. However, SEC\u2019s steps may help to  ensure that staff adhere to policies and procedures and may help to  address the types of errors that we found in our file review.", "We also found issues related to the training of SEC\u2019s hiring specialists,  which may be another factor contributing to the high rate of errors in the  case files we reviewed. When we spoke to SEC hiring managers, they  expressed some concern over the competence of hiring specialists in the  Office of Human Resources. Hiring specialists also told us that they  received only limited training. Based on our review of training offered by  SEC University, we did not find any specific training on hiring and  promotions targeted at hiring specialists. Further, SEC\u2019s 2015 training  plan for the Office of Human Resources has a course on adjudicating  veterans preference, but no courses are specifically targeted at how to  implement each stage of the hiring and promotion process. A key  principle of an effective control environment states that managers should  demonstrate a commitment to recruit, develop, and retain competent  individuals. For example, managers should establish expectations of  competence for key roles to help the entity achieve its objectives. This  competence is gained largely from professional experience, training, and  certifications. In addition, as previously discussed, we found that SEC has  not assessed whether some of its mission-support staff, including key  hiring specialists, have the necessary skills to conduct their work. OPM  has stated that agencies should conduct a learning needs analysis to  identify skills gaps across their entire workforce, and we found that SEC  has yet to fully address our 2013 recommendation to conduct such an  analysis. Rather, SEC only conducted a skills gap analysis of staff in the  mission-critical office and divisions and in the Office of Information  Technology. Without providing necessary training that is informed by a  comprehensive skills gap analysis, SEC may lack assurance that hiring  specialists have the skills required to conduct their work effectively, and  that it is hiring and promoting the most qualified applicants."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A high-performing workforce is critical to SEC effectively carrying out its  regulatory responsibilities in increasingly complex markets. While SEC  has taken steps to address our 2013 recommendations, its progress has  been limited, and five of the seven recommendations are not fully  addressed. We maintain that these five recommendations\u2014in the areas  of workforce and succession planning, the performance management  system, and communication and collaboration\u2014should be addressed in  order for SEC to fulfill its mission effectively.", "One of the most protracted personnel management challenges at SEC  remains communication and collaboration, and SEC\u2019s limited progress in  addressing our 2013 recommendations in this area points to a lack of  leadership in breaking down silos that prevent divisions and offices from  working more efficiently and effectively with each other. Apart from the  office of the Chair, which has broader responsibilities both within and  outside the agency, heads of each division and office are responsible for  their daily operations and are not accountable to any senior-level official,  such as the Chief Operating Officer. Our prior work has found that having  a senior-level position within the agency that has the responsibility and  authority to ensure that changes are implemented can help address  protracted personnel management challenges such as communication  and collaboration.", "Finally, our review found that SEC\u2019s training related to hiring and  promotion practices may be inadequate. According to federal internal  control standards, managers should demonstrate a commitment to  recruit, develop, and retain competent individuals, which depends in part  on adequate training. Because SEC has not conducted a skills gap  analysis across its entire workforce as we previously recommended in  2013, including its hiring personnel, it lacks the information needed to  develop an effective training program. Training for hiring specialists that is  informed by a comprehensive skills gap analysis should better enable  SEC management to hire and promote the most qualified applicants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help SEC address identified personnel management challenges, the  Chair should take the following two actions:", "Enhance or expand the responsibilities and authority of the COO or  other official or office so they can help ensure that improvements to  communication and collaboration across SEC are made. For instance,  if the duties of the COO were expanded, the COO could establish  liaisons in each mission-critical office and division for SEC employees  to contact or develop procedures to help facilitate communication and  collaboration among the mission-critical office and divisions.", "Develop and implement training for hiring specialists that is informed  by a skills gap analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided SEC a draft of this report for its review and comment. SEC  provided written comments that are reprinted in appendix IX. In its written  comments, SEC agreed with the majority of our findings and one of our  two recommendations, but it disagreed with the other.  In its letter, SEC  stated that it has made a number of improvements in its personnel  management since our 2013 report. The letter also highlighted that the  released rankings of the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government  show that SEC\u2019s workforce is among the most engaged in the  Government, ranking now 6 out of 27 mid-sized agencies; SEC has  climbed nine places in the rankings since our 2013 report. According to  the letter, this improvement, among other indicators, illustrates the  agency's success in building, sustaining, and growing an organization that  fosters and values innovation, communication, collaboration, and  transparency. In its letter, SEC also acknowledged that further  improvements could be made, and it noted that our report contained  useful information to strengthen personnel management at the  Commission.", "Related to personnel management, SEC acknowledged our second  recommendation in this report to develop and implement training for its  hiring specialists. Specifically, the letter stated that SEC University in  coordination with the Talent Acquisition Group in SEC\u2019s Office of Human  Resources will prioritize its competency assessment of its human  resource specialists (which includes hiring specialists) and develop  training plans to address any skill gaps identified.  SEC also agreed that it  still needs to conduct periodic validations of its performance management  system. According to the letter, SEC worked with OPM recently to  validate the new system that it is piloting and that the Commission will  continue to work with OPM to conduct additional surveys of supervisors  and employees regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of SEC's  performance management program. SEC also stated in its letter that  improvements can be made to its workforce and succession planning. In  its letter, SEC stated that it had already begun the planning process to  conduct a competency skills gap analysis on the non-mission critical  workforce in fiscal year 2017, and will develop appropriate action plans to  address the skill gaps that are identified. In addition SEC stated that the  Office of Human Resources is in the process of enhancing its current  succession planning program, and it will work with all SEC division  directors and office heads to institute additional fair and transparent  processes for identifying high-potential employees and communicating to  them opportunities for leadership development.", "SEC disagreed with our characterization of the current state of its intra- agency communication and collaboration.  In its letter, SEC stated that it  believes that significantly more progress has been made by the  Commission to resolve the recommendations from our 2013 report  (addressing interdivisional communication and collaboration) than our  report recognizes.  SEC also stated that interactions at both the staff and  senior leadership levels are continuous, and that it has instituted both  formal and informal mechanisms for additional coordination where it is  required, which have proven to be successful.  SEC also stated that  cross-divisional interaction may not be necessary, or even appropriate,  for some non-supervisory staff, and it noted concern with our reliance on  anecdotal accounts from one former employee.  We acknowledged the  improvement SEC has made, for example, by noting that the percentage  of non-supervisory and supervisory staff responding that information is  adequately shared across groups in their division or office increased from  2013 to 2016.  However, we found substantial evidence that siloed  communication remains a challenge at SEC. For instance, 78 of the 187  employees we interviewed (over 40 percent) cited issues around siloed  communication as an area where SEC needs to improve.  Additionally, of  the 1,947 written responses we received to our survey questions, 597 of  them cited various challenges related to communication and  collaboration. We provided examples from several current and one former  employee to illustrate the siloed communication at SEC.  Further, we  recognize that not all staff at SEC may need to coordinate and collaborate  for work-related issues. However, staff in mission-critical offices and  divisions should be enabled to collaborate and communicate with staff in  other offices and divisions. As acknowledged in our report, the Division of  Enforcement created formal liaisons that other divisions and offices can  contact, and these liaisons help to facilitate cross-divisional  communication and collaboration within the division. Based on our survey  results, staff in the Division of Enforcement more frequently interacted  with staff from other mission-critical offices and divisions.  As SEC  acknowledged in its response, the Division of Economic and Risk  Analysis is similar to the Division of Enforcement in that staff should be  routinely communicating and collaborating with them. However, unlike the  Division of Enforcement, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis  lacks a mechanism to easily facilitate cross-divisional communication and  collaboration. Our survey results show that interaction between Division  of Economic and Risk Analysis staff and staff from other mission-critical  offices and divisions is limited.", "SEC also disagreed with our recommendation related to enhancing the  responsibilities and authority of the COO or other official or office to help  ensure that improvements to communication and collaboration across  SEC are made.  In its letter, SEC stated that given the current legal and  management structure of SEC, as well as the requirements of its mission,  SEC does not believe that a position of that description would improve the  ability of SEC to discharge its obligations to protect investors. SEC also  stated that the agency\u2019s structure and the authority of the Chief of Staff  and the Deputy Chiefs of Staff enables them, in close consultation with  the Chair, to effectively pursue changes to enhance coordination and  collaboration throughout SEC.  We are not suggesting that an additional  layer of management is needed to help improve the ability of SEC to  discharge its obligations to protect investors. Rather, we are  recommending that the authority of the COO or some other official be  enhanced in order to ensure that each mission-critical office and division  establish a mechanism or develop procedures to facilitate communication  and collaboration.  SEC provided no evidence to illustrate why relevant  best practices that GAO has identified can work in other federal agencies  that have varied structures cannot benefit the Commission. The best  practices we have identified call for institutionalized accountability for  addressing management issues and leading transformational change  because the management weaknesses in some agencies are deeply  entrenched and long-standing, and it can take at least 5 to 7 years of  sustained attention and continuity to fully implement transformations and  change management initiatives.  The typical tenure of an SEC Chair is  shorter than the time needed to affect such change. Since 2001, SEC has  had 6 Chairs and none of them have had a tenure that lasted 4 years.    SEC also noted that our conclusions would have been better informed  with the full perspectives of the agency\u2019s Chief of Staff and Deputy Chiefs  of Staff.  We met with the Chief of Staff and Deputy Chief of Staff during  our review and they discussed efforts by SEC to address cross-divisional  communication and collaboration changes.  While we acknowledge  efforts SEC has made to improve collaboration and communication  across the agency, the evidence we present indicates that SEC should do  more to identify a single point of contact with the responsibility and  authority to ensure the successful implementation of a communication  and collaboration process.   As a result, we maintain that the  recommendation would help ensure such change.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and  other interested parties.

The three surveys were  administered to the following number of staff during the following time  periods:  1.  the survey to the mission-critical office and divisions was administered  to 2,627 staff from October 2015 to March 2016;  2.  the survey to all other offices and divisions was administered to 1,609  staff from May 2016 to September 2016; and  3.  the survey to all 148 senior officers was administered from April 2016  to July 2016.", "The surveys were administered to the different groups at various  timeframes to, for example, allow for the maximum response rate given  the competing demands of SEC staff at different times of the year. We  chose to survey all staff at SEC instead of a sample to obtain information  from the largest feasible number of SEC employees. We analyzed the  results of our 2016 survey of all supervisory and nonsupervisory staff and  senior officers and also compared the results from 2016 surveys to the  mission-critical office and divisions and the senior officers to the results  from the 2013 surveys. In addition, we reviewed the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) 2016 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS)  results to obtain additional perspectives from SEC staff on the agency\u2019s  personnel-management-related issues.", "Each GAO survey to SEC staff included questions on (1) personnel  management issues related to recruitment, training, staff development,  and resources; (2) communication between and within divisions and  offices; (3) leadership and management; (4) performance management  and promotions; and (5) organizational culture and climate. The separate  survey of all SEC senior officers (those at the SO-1, SO-2, and SO-3 pay  grades) covered the same topic areas but omitted questions not relevant  for senior officers and included additional questions specifically relevant  for senior officers. The survey to all other offices and divisions also  covered the same topic areas, but had some questions omitted, such as  the question related to the number of times they had interacted with the  mission-critical office and divisions over the past year. Our survey  included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions.", "For our survey of the mission-critical office and divisions, 1,819  nonsupervisors and supervisors responded to our survey for a response  rate of 69 percent; for our survey of all other offices and divisions, 969  nonsupervisors and supervisors responded for a response rate of 60  percent. A total of 104 of the 148 senior officers responded to our survey  of all senior officers for a response rate of 70 percent. For all surveys,  except the one for senior officers, we carried out a statistical nonresponse  bias analysis using available administrative data and determined that we  could not assume that the nonrespondents were missing at random. For  this reason, the results of the staff survey are presented as tabulations  from a census survey. 31 percent of mission-critical employees and 40  percent of all other employees who chose not to complete our survey.", "To minimize certain types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors, and enhance data quality, we employed recognized survey design  practices in the development of the questionnaires and the collection,  processing, and analysis of the survey data. To develop our survey  questions, we drew on information from one-on-one interviews, focus  group sessions held during our 2013 review, and prior GAO SEC  personnel management surveys. For the surveys of the mission-critical  office and divisions and senior officers, we took steps to ensure our  survey questions from 2013 were still relevant and to determine if new  issues warranted new questions. To do this, we sent draft survey  questions to SEC officials in the mission-critical office and divisions and  senior officers who volunteered to review our draft questions to obtain  their feedback on the survey questions. For the survey of the other offices  and divisions within SEC, we pretested the questionnaire with SEC  employees to validate the survey questionnaire and to ensure that we  were not omitting relevant questions from the survey. We met with six  SEC staff for the pretest of the survey. During survey development, we  reviewed the survey to ensure the ordering of survey sections was  appropriate and that questions in each section were clearly stated and  easy to comprehend. A GAO survey expert reviewed and provided  feedback on our survey instrument. To reduce nonresponse, another  source of nonsampling error, we undertook an intensive follow-up effort  that included multiple e-mail reminders to encourage SEC employees to  complete the questionnaire and a series of phone call reminders to  nonrespondents to encourage participation and to troubleshoot any  potential logistical issues with access to the questionnaire. We minimized  processing errors by having a second independent data analyst conduct  an accuracy check of the computer programs used for data analysis. We  also had respondents complete questionnaires online to eliminate errors  associated with manual data entry. On the basis of our application of  these practices and follow-up procedures, we determined that the data  were of sufficient quality for our purposes.", "Content analysis: To analyze the information we obtained from the  open-ended survey responses, we conducted a content analysis on the  1,947 responses to the six open-ended survey questions from the survey  of the mission-critical office and divisions using a text analytics tool. Two  analysts developed coding categories based on requirements in section  962 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (Dodd-Frank Act), our researchable objectives, and information collected  during individual interviews, as well as findings from our July 2013  report. Coding categories were as follows: (1) communication and  collaboration, (2) hierarchy, (3) risk aversion, (4) atmosphere of trust, (5)  morale, (6) performance management, (7) training and hiring, and (8)  awards.", "The team provided a \u201clexicon\u201d of key words and phrases associated with  each of the eight coding categories to the text analytics subject matter  expert.

The goal of this analysis was to determine the number of  respondents who mentioned at least one challenge in the respective  coding category. After obtaining the categorized open-ended responses,  two GAO analysts collaboratively reviewed the output and revised or  \u201ccalibrated\u201d the lexicon based on each result. This review involved  verifying the coding of a judgmental sample of responses. The subject  matter expert then reran the program with the updated lexicon. This  iterative process allowed the subject matter expert to refine the program  to isolate comments focused on challenges associated with the coding  categories. While human correction and evaluation of the content can  help improve the quality of the machine generated coding, a certain,  undetermined error remains. To minimize error and improve accuracy, the  calibration process continued for three iterations.", "Comments that were flagged by the text analytics tool as capturing a  challenge within a particular coding category were coded with a \u201c1.\u201d Once  coding was completed and the discrepancies were resolved, an analyst  tallied the total number of responses with a \u201c1\u201d in each of the coding  categories.

We coordinated with SEC to send  a broadcast message over its internal system to all staff to invite them to  meet with us either in person or to call a GAO toll-free number or use a  GAO e-mail account to provide their views on SEC\u2019s organizational  culture. At headquarters, we established office hours during which  employees could speak with GAO analysts. During the same period, we  set up a GAO toll-free phone number and e-mail account to communicate  with employees in the regional offices or headquarters who could not  attend the office hours. We asked certain key questions of every person  we interviewed and interjected additional questions as appropriate. We  also explained that our review was initiated due to a provision in section  962 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and provided a description of this section  when asked by SEC employees. We then asked them about (1) what  personnel management practices were working well, (2) what challenges  existed in personnel management, (3) what initiatives, if any, SEC had  taken to address these challenges, and (4) whether these individuals had  any recommendations to address such challenges. For those staff who  were not familiar with what areas encompassed personnel management,  we presented them with a list of areas for them to think about. Employees  were encouraged to talk openly and freely. To maintain the confidentiality  of individual responses, we did not record individual names in our  transcripts. Instead, we collected and analyzed the information by division  and rank only, and we aggregated our findings so that no individual  comments could be identified.", "We conducted a separate analysis to summarize key themes that  emerged from these individual interviews. GAO analysts independently  reviewed notes taken from these interviews and made a judgment about  appropriate codes that described the themes. The analysts compared  their decisions and reconciled any disagreements, resulting in the  following set of coding categories: (1) staff competence; (2) appropriate  levels of supervisory and non-supervisory staff; (3) effectiveness of  supervisors; (4) promoting staff criteria; (5) siloed communication issues;  and (6) other cross-cutting challenges. Once the coding structure was  finalized, one GAO analyst separately reviewed and coded each  response and tabulated the frequency of statements expressing certain  themes, while a second analyst verified the information to ensure the  tabulation was correct and that the analyst concurred with the results.  Where there were discrepancies, a third analyst was asked to review the  statements and to make a final determination about how a specific  statement would be coded.", "We also interviewed former SEC employees, officials from the SEC Office  of Inspector General (IG), and self-selected representatives and members  of the SEC employees\u2019 union.

The purpose of these  structured group interviews was to obtain their views on the following  personnel management practices related to: hiring, promotions,  supervision, strong and unacceptable performance, training, and  communication and collaboration. Our universe of supervisors consisted  of staff at the SK-15 or SK-17 level, with the exception of staff at the SK- 15 level in the Division of Enforcement, who are not considered  management. We obtained the e-mail addresses of all supervisors in  these divisions and sent them an invitation to participate in our structured  group interviews. We held eight meetings with the supervisors who  agreed to participate in our structured group interviews. We held a  meeting with each of the mission-critical office and divisions on  communication and collaboration. At two of these meetings, we had both  SK-15s and SK-17s, including staff from regional offices. In addition, we  had two meetings that covered the noncommunication topics. One of the  meetings consisted of SK-15s and the other consisted of SK-17s from  each of the mission-critical office and divisions. These meetings also  included regional office staff.

As part of this effort, we reviewed  actions SEC had taken to address the seven recommendations from our  2013 report related to four personnel management areas: (1) workforce  and succession planning, (2) performance management, including  performance feedback, (3) communication and collaboration, and (4)  human capital accountability. In addition to these four personnel  management areas, we also assessed the design and implementation of  four personnel management practices based on information we obtained  from SEC staff. Specifically, they identified these as potential areas of  concern (or areas of improvement) during individual interviews with us as  well as in responses to our surveys\u2014actions to recognize and reward  performance, actions to address unacceptable performance, hiring and  promotions, and training.", "Workforce and succession planning: To determine whether SEC\u2019s  workforce and succession planning practices were designed consistent  with relevant criteria, we obtained a copy of SEC\u2019s 2016 strategic  workforce plan. We reviewed this strategic plan and compared it to  OPM\u2019s HCAAF and our prior work on strategic workforce planning. For  example, we reviewed the skills gap analysis from the plan and compared  it to OPM\u2019s HCAAF related to identifying critical skills for an agency\u2019s  workforce. As part of this effort, we worked with our Director of Workforce  Planning to review SEC\u2019s strategic workforce plan and determine whether  the plan was sufficient to address our 2013 recommendations. In  addition, we met with SEC\u2019s Workforce Policy Group, Office of Human  Resources, and senior leaders from the divisions to obtain information on  what actions they had taken to address our recommendations related to  workforce and succession planning.", "Performance feedback: To determine what steps SEC had taken to  address our 2013 recommendation, in conjunction with staff from our  Human Capital Office, we examined SEC\u2019s process for monitoring  feedback as well as our survey results that relate to the performance  feedback employees receive. We obtained information on SEC\u2019s process  for monitoring feedback by reviewing documentation and interviewing  staff from the Office of Human Resources. As part of this effort, we  obtained a description of their audit of a sample of performance work  plans.", "Performance management: In our prior review (GAO-13-621), we  determined that the design of SEC\u2019s performance management system  reflected many elements of OPM guidance, but SEC staff expressed  concerns about implementation of the system. However, since our prior  review, SEC decided to make changes to its performance management  system. Therefore, in this review, we set out to determine the extent to  which SEC\u2019s changes to its performance management system were  consistent with relevant standards. To do this, we met with SEC staff from  the Office of Human Resources and union officials to inquire about what  actions SEC had taken to address our 2013 recommendations. Upon  learning that SEC decided to redesign its performance management  system in 2014, we assessed the actions SEC took to redesign its system  and compared these actions to OPM\u2019s HCAAF, our previous work on  performance management systems, and federal internal control  standards. We also worked with staff from our Human Capital Office to  assess the actions SEC had taken to redesign its system against the  relevant criteria.", "Communication and collaboration: To determine whether SEC\u2019s  communication and collaboration practices were designed consistent with  relevant criteria, we assessed SEC\u2019s actions to address our 2013  recommendations against OPM\u2019s HCAAF, our previous work, and federal  internal control standards. Specifically, we reviewed SEC\u2019s award  program to determine if the program provided incentives to support an  environment of open communication and collaboration, including  determining whether SEC provided awards for teamwork. In addition, we  reviewed 79 performance expectations, known as performance work  plans; all 28 supervisory performance work plans (including 5 plans under  the pilot performance management system), and 51 nonsupervisory performance work plans for the mission-critical office and divisions. For  the nonsupervisors, we selected the performance work plans for the  \u201cmission-critical\u201d staff we identified in our 2013 review\u2014accountants,  attorneys, economists, examiners, and financial analysts at the SK-12  through SK-16 levels. The results of our review of performance work  plans are not generalizable, but provide us with information on how  communication and collaboration are addressed as part of an employee\u2019s  performance expectations. To determine whether the performance work  plans contained expectations that addressed our 2013 recommendation,  one GAO analyst read through each performance work plan and  determined whether it contained all four of the following categories that  were derived from the recommendation:(1) communication, (2)  collaboration, (3) intra-agency communication and collaboration, and (4)  fostering an environment of open communication and collaboration\u2014for  example, encouraging acceptance, exchanging of information, and  sharing of diverse points of view regardless of individual differences. A  second GAO analyst independently conducted a similar analysis of each  performance work plan. A third GAO analyst reviewed the results of both  sets of reviews to reconcile any differences. In cases where the reviews  differed, the third GAO analyst reviewed each analyst\u2019s assessment and  made a judgment on which one was correct. In addition, we met with SEC  staff in the Office of Human Resources and senior officials from the  divisions to discuss what actions they had taken to address our 2013  recommendations.", "Human capital accountability: To determine whether SEC\u2019s human  capital accountability system was designed consistent with relevant  criteria, we obtained and reviewed SEC documentation on its recently  developed human capital accountability system, including policies  establishing the system, standard operating procedures, and evidence of  the system\u2019s implementation, such as a review of SEC\u2019s student loan  repayment program. We compared SEC\u2019s documentation on its human  capital accountability system to OPM\u2019s HCAAF and federal internal  control standards to determine whether this system addresses the  recommendation from our 2013 review. For example, we reviewed  SEC\u2019s schedule of human capital program reviews, the reports generated  from reviews of specific human capital programs, and actions taken by  SEC to address any identified weaknesses in internal controls and  compared them to OPM\u2019s HCAAF related to human capital accountability.  We also met with staff from SEC\u2019s Human Capital Strategy Group in the  Office of Human Resources to determine what criteria they used to  determine which human capital programs to review.", "Actions to recognize and reward performance: To determine whether  SEC\u2019s policies on awards have been designed consistent with relevant  criteria, we compared these policies to OPM\u2019s HCAAF and our prior work  on linking individual performance to organizational success.

For example, we reviewed  SEC\u2019s processes for monitoring how supervisors recognize and reward  performance and compared them to OPM\u2019s HCAAF related to awarding  staff.", "We next determined whether SEC\u2019s practices related to awards were  being implemented consistent with the agency\u2019s policies. To do this, we  obtained a list of all incentive awards (cash and time-off) for fiscal years  2013 through 2015. We randomly selected 96 award packages from fiscal  years 2013 through 2015. Of these 6 were from fiscal year 2012 and out  of the scope of our review, 19 were performance-based compensation  amounts, which were out of the scope of our review, and 1 was later  found by SEC to be out of our scope, thus 71 were analyzed. Because  the database we used to draw our sample contained data that was out of  the scope of our review (such as some packages from fiscal year 2012  and others that were not incentive awards), we did not attempt to  generalize the results of the sample. We were, however, able to use the  71 award packages to assess SEC\u2019s implementation of its awards  program. Each package should have contained the following information: written justification for the award;  the dollar amount or hours off for the award; evidence of approval (i.e., signatures) by the recommending official,  reviewing official (both usually from the divisions or office that  nominated the person for the award), and the office of human  resources staff in the awards program area; evidence of the Chief Operating Officer\u2019s approval for certain high  dollar amount or time-off awards; and a copy of the award recipient\u2019s official personnel record (SF-50) with  the correct dollar amount or time-off hours noted.", "We then had one GAO analyst review each of the 71 award packages  and complete a checklist noting whether the package contained the  information previously mentioned. A second GAO analyst then reviewed  each of the 71 packages and reviewed how the first analyst coded the  checklist. If the second analyst did not agree with the coding of the first  analyst, that information was noted and both analysts met to discuss any  disagreements. During this meeting, the two analysts were able to  discuss their disagreements and reach consensus on the proper coding  of the award packages. We also analyzed the award data for fiscal years  2013 through 2015, which we present in appendix IV. In addition, we met  with staff from SEC\u2019s Office of Human Resources who are responsible for  the awards program to obtain a better understanding of SEC\u2019s awards  program.", "Actions to address unacceptable performance: To determine whether  SEC\u2019s policies to address unacceptable performance have been  designed consistent with relevant criteria, we compared these policies to  OPM\u2019s HCAAF and our prior work on linking individual performance to  organizational success. Specifically, we reviewed the following policies  and documents related to addressing unacceptable performance:", "SEC\u2019s overview of its employee misconduct and nonperformance  support program,", "SEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement,  the performance management standard operating procedures for non- bargaining-unit employees, and", "SEC\u2019s senior officer performance management administrative  regulation.", "We worked with staff from our Human Capital Office to assess these  policies against OPM\u2019s HCAAF and our prior work, and determined that  they were consistent with relevant criteria.

To do this, we obtained all performance improvement  plans for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 (16 in all) and compared the  information in these plans against what SEC\u2019s policies require. We first  had one GAO analyst review each performance improvement plan,  compare the information in these plans and supporting documents to  what SEC requires for these plans, and record the findings in a  spreadsheet. We then had a second GAO analyst review the work of the  first analyst to determine if the spreadsheet was coded correctly. The two  analysts conferred on any differences in the coding and were able to  reach consensus on the proper coding.", "We also reviewed documentation associated with probationary  employees who are terminated due to performance issues. SEC\u2019s policies  related to addressing unacceptable performance do not apply to  probationary employees. The actions SEC can take against these  employees are governed by federal regulations related to actions taken  against probationary employees for unsatisfactory performance or  conduct. Similar to our approach with the performance improvement  plans, we obtained all files related to probationary employees terminated  due to unacceptable performance for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 (20  in all). We again had one GAO analyst review each file and compare the  information in these files and any supporting documents to what OPM  regulations require, such as a description of the unacceptable  performance, and record the findings in a spreadsheet. We then had a  second GAO analyst review the work of the first analyst to determine if  the spreadsheet was coded correctly. The two analysts conferred on any  differences in the coding and were able to reach consensus on the proper  coding. We also reviewed our recent work on the federal government\u2019s  actions to address unacceptable performance to compare actions SEC  had taken with actions taken across the federal government. In addition,  we met with the Office of General Counsel at SEC to obtain an  understanding of the agency\u2019s policies to address unacceptable  performance.", "Hiring and promotions: To determine whether SEC\u2019s hiring and  promotion policies have been designed consistent with relevant criteria,  we compared these policies to OPM\u2019s HCAAF, the President\u2019s 2011  memorandum on improving federal recruitment and hiring, our prior work  on best practices in human capital management, and federal internal  control standards. Specifically, we reviewed the following policies and  documents related to hiring and promotions:", "SEC\u2019s hiring program overview, which describes the entire hiring  process, including specific responsibilities of staff in the Office of  Human Resources and the divisions; a description of the various hiring authorities available to SEC; a description of how SEC establishes initial pay for new hires;", "SEC policies on promotions for non-bargaining-unit positions; and", "SEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.", "We worked with staff from our Human Capital Office to assess these  policies against OPM\u2019s HCAAF and our prior work, and determined that  they were consistent with relevant criteria. For example, we assessed  SEC\u2019s processes for hiring and promotions and compared them to OPM\u2019s  HCAAF related to hiring.", "We next determined whether SEC\u2019s hiring and promotion policies were  being implemented consistent with the agency\u2019s policies. To do this, we  reviewed recruitment case files, which are the documentation that  supports a hiring or promotion announcement, to determine if SEC was  following its hiring and promotion policies. We randomly selected 102  recruitment case files for review. Of these, 3 were duplicates and 18  recruitment case files could not be analyzed because they had already  been audited by OPM or SEC. This left us with a final sample of 81  recruitment case files. We express our confidence in the precision of  estimates derived from the sample of recruitment case files as 95 percent  confidence intervals. This is the interval that would contain the actual  population values for 95 percent of the samples that we could have  drawn. We then developed a checklist that contained steps SEC should  take during various stages of the hiring and promotion process. We  provided this checklist to staff from our Human Capital Office for their  review and also ensured that our checklist was consistent with the  checklists that SEC had developed to assess its hiring and promotion  processes. We then assembled a group of GAO analysts to review the  case files and complete the checklists. In order to ensure consistent  completion of the checklist, each GAO analyst\u2019s first few checklists were  independently reviewed by another analyst. After this stage, the two GAO  analysts compared the results of the checklists. Any discrepancies were  discussed among the two analysts as well as shared with the entire group  of GAO analysts. Once the entire group reached consensus on how to  address the discrepancies identified during this stage, all 81 case files  were reviewed against the checklist.", "The next step in the process involved an independent second review of  the completed 81 case file checklists. All 81 case files were checked by a  GAO analyst who was not involved in the initial review. Any discrepancies  found during this stage were discussed among the analysts, and a  consensus was reached on how to address the discrepancy. Once this  process was completed, the information from the checklists was tallied to  identify any deficiencies in the hiring and promotion process.", "To obtain the views of the key SEC staff involved in the hiring and  promotion process, we developed a set of structured interview questions  and conducted interviews with 18 of the 23 hiring specialists in the Office  of Human Resources and 16 hiring managers from the divisions. We  provided the set of structured interview questions to staff from our Human  Capital Office for review and revised the questions based on their  expertise. We attempted to interview all 23 hiring specialists, but 5 did not  respond to our request. We chose the 16 hiring managers to interview by  obtaining the list of names, titles, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers  of all hiring managers from the six mission-critical office and divisions. For  divisions that had more than two hiring managers, we randomly selected  two managers, except for the Division of Enforcement and the Office of  Compliance Inspections and Examinations. For this division and office,  we selected a judgmental sample of hiring managers, based on input  from SEC on what types of staff or regions would more likely be involved  in the hiring process. We used this approach for the Division of  Enforcement and the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations  because they have a large regional presence, and we interviewed 2  managers in headquarters and 2 in the regional offices for each. The  responses to the structured interview questions are not representative of  the views of all SEC staff involved in the hiring process but provide useful  information on the types of views and concerns held by these staff.", "We also reviewed OPM\u2019s 2014 review and the National Credit Union  Administration\u2019s 2015 review of SEC\u2019s hiring and promotion practices, as  well as an outside consultant group review of SEC\u2019s internal promotion  actions from fiscal years 2011 through 2014. We assessed the methods  used in these reviews and determined that they were reliable for our  purposes.

As a result, we asked selected SEC  supervisors about the effectiveness of training during structured group  interviews of SEC supervisors. We selected these supervisors based on  whether they worked in the mission-critical office and divisions, pay grade  and occupation, geographic location, and willingness to meet with us. We  also analyzed survey results on training collected from our 2016 surveys  of mission-critical office and divisions and senior officers and compared  them to the results of our 2013 survey. We also compared SEC  responses on training from the 2016 OPM FEVS to that of other  agencies.", "Finally, for all of the personnel management practices we assessed, we  reviewed responses from our surveys and from our individual and  structured group interviews, and we included relevant responses to  provide SEC staffs\u2019 perspectives on these practices.", "We assessed the reliability of all of the data we used during this review  and determined they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, which  include describing trends and views on personnel management practices  at SEC. To assess the reliability of the FEVS data, we examined  descriptive statistics, data distribution, and reviewed missing data. We  also reviewed FEVS technical documentation as well as the statistical  code OPM uses to generate the index and variance estimates, and we  interviewed officials responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing  the data. We used SEC data derived from the Department of the Interior\u2019s  Federal Personnel/Payroll System to construct our sample frames for the  three surveys, test the implementation of various personnel management  practices, and develop summary tables in our appendixes. To determine the reliability of these data, we interviewed SEC staff responsible for  these data to determine how data were collected, what controls existed  over the data, and any limitations on the data.

While staff turnover rates could be used to identify potential  areas for improvement and further develop current supervisors, officials  from the Merit Systems Protection Board noted that turnover was not a  good indicator of poor supervision for several reasons. For example, they  said that staff may leave to pursue opportunities with a different employer  or a different career path, or for personal reasons. SEC officials also  indicated that staff facing potential removal or termination often would  resign or retire, rather than going through removal or termination. Tables  21 and 22 show the percentage of staff who left SEC from fiscal years  2008 through 2015 from headquarters and the 11 regional offices,  respectively. Table 23 shows the total number of staff who left SEC  during the same period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Performance Ratings for Fiscal Years 2013\u20132015", "paragraphs": ["The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) current performance  appraisal system is designed to rate employees on a numerical scale  from 1 to 5. However, due to an agreement with the SEC employees  union, bargaining-unit employees are officially rated as either meets  expectations (that is, needs improvement, meets expectations, exceeds  expectations, or greatly exceeds expectations) or unacceptable. Table 24  shows the distribution of performance ratings for fiscal years 2013  through 2015. The initial rating for bargaining-unit staff is on the five-point  scale. The final rating translates that initial rating to either meets  expectations or unacceptable, based on the agreement reached between  SEC and the union."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We address these issues in our responses to comments 3 and 4.  2.  According to officials from the SEC union and the Office of Human  Resources, the pilot has only been implemented for non- bargaining-unit staff. Moreover, SEC did not provide us with  information on its agency-wide pilot of its new performance  management system, nor did it provide an implementation plan  that identified key milestone dates or schedules to pilot or fully  implement the new performance management system to all  employees in fiscal year 2017.  3.  We recognize that not all staff at SEC may need to coordinate and  collaborate for work-related issues.  However, staff in mission- critical offices and divisions should be enabled to collaborate and  communicate with staff in other offices and divisions. As  acknowledged in our report, the Division of Enforcement created  formal liaisons that other divisions and offices can contact, and  these liaisons help to facilitate cross-divisional communication and  collaboration within the division. Based on our survey results, staff  in the Division of Enforcement more frequently interacted with staff  from other mission-critical offices and divisions.  As SEC  acknowledged in its response, the Division of Economic and Risk  Analysis is similar to the Division of Enforcement in that staff  should be routinely communicating and collaborating with them.  However, unlike the Division of Enforcement, the Division of  Economic and Risk Analysis lacks a mechanism to easily facilitate  cross-divisional communication and collaboration. Our survey  results show that interaction between Division of Economic and  Risk Analysis staff and staff from other mission-critical offices and  divisions is limited.", "SEC also expressed concern that our report cited an anecdotal  account from one former employee. However, we found  substantial evidence that siloed communication remains a  challenge at SEC. For instance, 78 of the 187 employees we  interviewed (over 40 percent) cited issues around siloed  communication as an area where SEC needs to improve.  Additionally, of the 1,947 written responses we received to our  survey questions, 597 of them cited various challenges related to  communication and collaboration. We provided examples from  several current and one former employee to illustrate the siloed  communication at SEC.  4.  SEC expressed concern with our recommendation to expand the  responsibilities and authority of the COO or other official or office. We  are not suggesting that an additional layer of management is needed.  Rather, we are recommending that the authority of the COO or some  other official be enhanced in order to ensure that each mission-critical  office and division establish a mechanism or develop procedures to  facilitate communication and collaboration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Triana McNeil (Assistant Director), Jos\u00e9  R.
