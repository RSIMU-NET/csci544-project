The Army's goal is to be able to deploy a brigade anywhere in the world within 96 hours, a division within 120 hours, and five divisions within 30 days. The first step is to form and equip six interim brigade combat teams by 2008. Created to fill a gap in military capability, the teams are intended to be a lethal and survivable deterrent force that can be rapidly deployed around the world. The commanders in chief envision different uses for the teams according to the unique requirements of their respective regions. However, they generally agree that the teams should provide them with a broader choice of capabilities to meet their operational needs. The Army faces many challenges in assembling its first team. For example, some planned combat capabilities will not be present when the team is certified for deployment next year. In addition, the interim armored vehicle delivery schedule has compressed the time available for training. Army officials believe that the organization at Fort Lewis that was created to help assemble the brigades has been effective in dealing with day-to-day challenges. The Army is chronicling lessons learned in forming the teams, but this information is not readily available in a central source. As a result, the Army may be unaware of some best practices or may repeat mistakes in forming later teams."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In October 1999, the U.S. Army announced its intentions to transform its  forces into a more strategically responsive force that could more rapidly  deploy and effectively operate in all types of military operations, whether  small-scale contingencies or major theater wars.  Army plans call for an  over 30-year transformation that will lead to the ability to deploy a brigade  anywhere in the world within 96 hours, a division in 120 hours, and five  divisions within 30 days.   The first step in this process is to form and equip  six Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) by 2008.  The first two brigades  are being formed at Fort Lewis, Washington, with the goal of organizing,  equipping, training, and certifying the first such brigade to deploy by May  2003.  The Army Chief of Staff stated that it would cost approximately  $1 billion to form each brigade.", "Because these brigades are entirely new, many questions have arisen as to  how their capabilities differ from those of more traditional brigades, how  the Army plans to use them, and whether they will possess capabilities that  the war-fighting Commanders in Chief (CINC) need.  Thus, we monitored  IBCT formation at Fort Lewis during 2001 to gain a better understanding of  the challenges that have arisen that might apply to subsequent brigades  scheduled to be formed in other locations.  We also visited the war-fighting  CINCs responsible for Europe, Southwest Asia, Korea, and the Pacific to  gain their perspectives on how they might use these brigades.  Our  objectives were to (1) identify the expected capabilities of the IBCT,  (2) determine the CINCs\u2019 views on the utility of the IBCTs and how the  CINCs might use them, (3) identify the challenges that have arisen in  forming the brigades, and (4) determine if the Army has an effective means  of capturing lessons learned.

The Army plans to transform its forces over  a 30-year period.", "The first phase of the Army's transformation is to form six IBCTs, the first  two of which are being formed at Fort Lewis, Washington.  The first of  these brigades has been in the process of being formed since fiscal year  2000.  The Army's plan is to certify it as achieving its initial operational  capability by May 2003, at which time it will be deployable.  The second  brigade is in its early stages of formation.  The Army has programmed  funding for six IBCTs and has announced the locations of the remaining  four.   Under current plans, all six brigades are to have been formed,  equipped, trained, and ready to deploy by 2008.  The Army is also  considering how it might accelerate the fielding of the last three brigades  so that all six can be fielded by 2005.  Additionally, the 2001 Quadrennial  Defense Review stated that an IBCT be stationed in Europe.  Because this  was not in the Army's plans, it is considering establishing an IBCT in  Europe.  Taken together, the IBCTs represent what the Army terms its  Interim Force because it begins to meet the Army\u2019s rapid deployment needs  for the next decade.", "Beginning in 2008 and continuing beyond 2030, the Army plans to transition  to its Objective Force.  During this period, all Army forces, including the  IBCTs, are to be transformed into new organizational structures operating  under new war-fighting doctrine.  Their new combat systems are to be  lighter and more mobile, deployable, lethal, survivable, and sustainable  than current systems.  Four competing research and development teams  have completed work on alternative designs for these future combat  systems and a contract has been awarded to a single lead systems  integrator.", "As the Army transitions to its Objective Force, it plans to maintain the  organizational designs of a portion of its existing combat force, which it  terms its Legacy Force, and to modernize selected equipment in this force.   This equipment includes such major weapons systems as the Abrams tank,  Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and Black Hawk helicopter.  Figure 1 depicts  these weapons systems.  This selective modernization is intended to enable  the Army to maintain capability and readiness until the future combat  systems are delivered to the Objective Force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IBCTS Are Expected to Fill a Perceived Gap in Military Capability", "paragraphs": ["The Army expects the IBCT to provide a force capability that it does not  currently have:  a rapidly deployable early-entry combat force that is lethal,  survivable, and capable of operating in all types of military operations,  from small-scale contingencies like the Balkans\u2019 missions to a major  theater war.

As an early-entry force, the brigade is expected  to have sufficient built-in combat power to conduct immediate combat  operations upon arrival in theater if required.  It is designed to supply its  own needs for 72 hours, after which time it would need a source of  resupply.  The IBCT is intended, in general, to fight as a component of a  division or corps but also be capable of operating separately under the  direct control of a higher headquarters, such as a joint task force.  The  Army expects that in many possible contingencies, the IBCT could initially  be the single U.S. maneuver component under a higher headquarters.", "In a major theater war, the IBCT under current plans would fight as a  subordinate maneuver component within a division or corps.  However, the  brigade would be augmented with additional mission-specific combat  capabilities such as armor, aviation, and air defense artillery.  The Army,  however, is considering the need for an Interim Division structure that  would include IBCTs as the maneuver forces because some analyses have  concluded that placing an IBCT with its differing design into an existing  infantry or armored division might impede the division\u2019s ability to achieve  its full combat capabilities.  The Army expects to complete the new  divisional concept by spring 2003 if the Chief of Staff decides to go forward  with it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Organization, Equipment, and Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The IBCT is organized primarily as a mobile infantry organization and will  contain about 3,500 personnel and 890 vehicles.  The brigade includes  headquarters elements; three infantry battalions, composed of three rifle  companies each; an antitank company; an artillery battalion; an engineer  company; a brigade support battalion; a military intelligence company; a  signal company; and a unique Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target  Acquisition squadron.  This squadron is expected to be the IBCT\u2019s primary  source of combat information through the traditional role of  reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition.  However, the  squadron is also designed to develop a situational understanding of other  elements within the operational environment, including political, cultural,  economic, and demographic factors.  This awareness is expected to enable  the brigade to anticipate, forestall, or overcome threats from the enemy.   The squadron offers the IBCT a variety of new systems and capabilities that  are generally not contained in an infantry brigade including manned  reconnaissance vehicles and ground reconnaissance scouts,  counterintelligence, human intelligence collectors, unmanned aerial  vehicles, ground sensors, and radars.  Moreover, the squadron\u2019s all-weather  intelligence and surveillance capabilities, coupled with the digitized  systems, are designed to enable it to maintain 24-hour operations.", "All six of the IBCTs are planned to be equipped with new light-armored  wheeled vehicles, termed interim armored vehicles, which are significantly  lighter and more transportable than existing tanks and armored vehicles.   These vehicles include ten types of vehicles that share a common chassis\u2014 infantry carriers, mobile gun systems, reconnaissance and surveillance  vehicles, and others.  These wheeled vehicles are expected to enable the  IBCT to maneuver more easily in a variety of difficult terrains.  The first  vehicles were scheduled for delivery to the first brigade in April 2002.   Meanwhile, the brigade has been training on substitute vehicles, including  32 Canadian infantry vehicles and German infantry carrier and nuclear,  biological, and chemical vehicles.  These vehicles approximate the  capabilities of the interim armored vehicles. Figure 2 depicts two of the  interim armored vehicles.", "The brigade\u2019s digitized communications are designed to enable brigade  personnel to \u201csee\u201d the entire battlefield and react before engaging the  enemy.  In addition to light armored vehicles equipped with digital systems,  the IBCT is expected to rely on advanced command, control, computer,  communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems  purchased from commercial or government sources.   The squadron\u2019s all- weather intelligence and surveillance capabilities, together with its  digitized systems, are intended to enable it to maintain 24-hour operations.   The Army expects this awareness to enable the IBCT to anticipate,  forestall, or overcome threats from the enemy.", "The IBCT's planned capabilities also differ in other ways from those found  in traditional divisional brigades.  For example, the Army determined that  achieving decisive action while operating in various types of terrain,  including urban settings, would require the brigade to possess a combined  arms capability at the company level, rather than at the battalion level.   Focusing on dismounted assault, companies are expected to support  themselves with  (1) direct fire from weapon systems on the infantry  carrier vehicle and from the mobile gun system and (2) indirect support  through mortars and artillery.  This combined arms capability is to be  reinforced through the Army\u2019s current development of a training program  aimed at developing soldiers with a wider range of skills as well as leaders  who can adapt to many different kinds of conflict situations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Deployment Capability and Relation to Objective Force", "paragraphs": ["The Army expects the IBCT to rely on new sustainment concepts that will  permit it to deploy more rapidly because it will carry fewer supplies and  have lighter vehicles, resulting in less weight to be shipped.

According to this schedule, the first IBCT  would begin receiving its vehicles in April 2002.  The second brigade would  begin receiving its vehicles in February 2003.", "The Army cannot acquire vehicles for more than the second IBCT until it  meets certain legislative requirements.   The Army must compare the costs  and operational effectiveness of the Interim Armored Vehicle with its  existing vehicles before it can acquire the Interim Vehicle for the third  IBCT.  The Army must also complete an operational evaluation of the first  IBCT.  The evaluation must include a unit deployment to the evaluation site  and execution of combat missions across the spectrum of potential threats  and operational scenarios.  The Army cannot acquire vehicles for the fourth  and subsequent IBCTs until the Secretary of Defense certifies that the  operational evaluation results indicate that the IBCT design is operationally  effective and suitable.  The significance of this is that the Army would need  to complete this evaluation and authorize vehicle production for the fourth  brigade by June 2003 for the Army to accelerate formation of the fourth and  subsequent brigades, as has been proposed.

According to the CINCs, if the IBCTs are formed and deployable as  planned, they should fill the perceived near-term gap in military capability.   The CINCs view the IBCT as a means to provide them with a broader  choice of capabilities to meet their varied operational requirements rather  than a substitute for current force structure.  However, CINC planners  need information about the brigade\u2019s deployability and other limitations for  planning purposes.

In announcing the Army\u2019s  plans for its transformation in October 1999, the Army\u2019s Chief of Staff  pointed to this gap in current war-fighting capabilities and the IBCT\u2019s  planned ability to rapidly deploy.  He noted that although the Army can  dominate in all types of conflicts, it is not strategically responsive.  The  light forces can deploy within a matter of days but lack combat power,  tactical mobility, and the ability to maintain sustained operations.  On the  other hand, armor and mechanized forces possess significant combat  power and are able to maintain sustained operations but cannot deploy  rapidly.", "CINC officials cited past military operations that pointed to this gap.  For  example, in the Persian Gulf War, the Army deployed a light infantry  force\u2014the 82nd Airborne Division\u2014as the early entry force to deter Iraq  and defend Saudi Arabia.  However, there is general agreement that this  force did not possess the anti-armor capability to survive and stop a heavy  armored attack.  Moreover, it took 6 months to position the heavy forces  and associated support units and supplies needed to mount offensive  actions against Iraq\u2014a time frame that might not be available in the future.   The urban operation in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993 that resulted  in the deaths of 16 U.S. soldiers was also mentioned to illustrate the need  for a force that is lethal, is maneuverable, and provides sufficient  protection to U.S. forces.  The difficulty in maneuvering heavy vehicles in  peacekeeping operations in the Balkans was also cited by CINC  representatives as a reason why lighter, more maneuverable vehicles are  needed.", "CINC officials pointed out many features of the IBCT that they felt would  address the existing capability shortfalls.  These features included its  planned ability to deploy within 96 hours anywhere in the world and to  provide a formidable, survivable deterrent force that could bring combat  power to bear immediately if necessary.  Also mentioned was its expected  ability to rapidly transition from being a deterrence, to serving in a small- scale contingency, to fighting in a major theater of war in the event  operations escalated.", "CINC officials also commented on the IBCT\u2019s enhanced capabilities for  situational awareness.  Situational awareness is the ability to see and  understand the battlefield before coming into actual contact with the  opponent through the use of advanced integrated systems that provide  command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance,  and reconnaissance capabilities.  This expected improvement in awareness  should provide a major comparative advantage over potential enemies.   They also noted that the IBCT would support their rapid deployment needs  by using interim armored vehicles that would be deployable within theater  by C-130 aircraft, which are more readily available, better able to access  small airfields, and therefore better able to be moved around the  battlefield.  CINC officials also pointed out that the IBCT relies on a family  of vehicles with a common platform, which reduces logistics and support  requirements through commonality of spare parts, fuel, and lubricants.", "While generally positive about the IBCTs, CINC officials cautioned that  many questions remain about whether these brigades will be able to  achieve all their envisioned capabilities, especially by the time they are  certified for deployment.  Concerns expressed to us included  whether the IBCT would actually be available to deploy anywhere in the  world in 96 hours, given many potential competing demands for mobility  assets;  what combat capability shortfalls might exist in the IBCT until it  receives all its planned vehicles and weapon systems;  whether new logistics concepts would succeed in reducing supply  tonnages sufficiently to achieve rapid deployment and intratheater  goals;  when the vehicles that need further development, such as the mobile  gun system and the nuclear, biological, and chemical vehicle, would be  available; and  whether the IBCT will be able to provide sufficient combat power when  heavy forces are needed.", "CINC operational and logistics planners need specific data regarding the  brigade\u2019s combat capabilities and logistics factors that are not yet available.   They emphasized that it was important to have these data to adequately  integrate the IBCTs into their plans.  If, for instance, certain planned  capabilities would not be in place when the first IBCTs become deployable,  planners would need to know this so that they could plan for mitigating any  risks that this might create.  For example, Army officials in Korea related  their concern that the IBCT will not include the mobile gun system until  after the Army certifies the brigade as operationally capable.  In the Korean  theater, the capability of this weapon system is a high priority.", "CINC officials raised additional concerns about the IBCT\u2019s support on our  visits.  Logistics planners in Korea said the amounts of fuel, water, and  ammunition used by the brigade need to be analyzed to determine what the  theater needs to have when a brigade arrives.  Although Korea contains  significant support resources, logistics planners need to know the unit\u2019s  unique and specific support requirements.

Officials of the U.S. Central Command, which covers Southwest  Asia, said that an IBCT had utility in their theater\u2014notably Africa\u2014where  fighting in urban terrain might occur.  According to Pacific Command  officials, their theater could use Army forces that are more deployable,  lethal, and sustainable than currently assigned, especially for use in the  urban areas prevalent in that theater.

This rapid reaction force is composed of both  light and heavy forces and is expected to deploy within 24 hours after being  alerted.  By using on-hand forces and equipment, the European Command  has created an immediate reaction force that possesses some of the IBCT's  capabilities.  However, this reaction force lacks the intelligence,  reconnaissance, and surveillance systems found in the IBCT that allows  greater situational understanding of the battlefield.

These vehicles  have been passed from unit to unit, thereby limiting training to company  level and below.  Training officials said that although they were  disappointed that they did not have sufficient vehicles to train as a  battalion or brigade, a hidden benefit was that the IBCT was able to focus  more training on individual and dismounted infantry skills instead.   According to a senior Fort Lewis official, subsequent brigades should not  experience the same training limitations as the first brigade unless, for any  unforeseen reason, the contractor\u2019s expected delivery schedule cannot be  met.

However, a senior Fort Lewis official also told us that  he is confident that all the training requirements will be accomplished in  the lesser time available.", "The need to train IBCT soldiers in digital systems has posed other  challenges.  Digitization provides a critical situational awareness capability  to the IBCT similar to that afforded units at Fort Hood, Texas, under the  Army\u2019s Force XXI program.  These systems use sophisticated information  technology, that allows personnel in the IBCT to achieve superior  battlefield information enabling them to engage the enemy long before  coming into contact.  IBCT soldiers train with many digitized systems and  must maintain specific levels of proficiency.   Maintaining proficiency in  these systems has been challenging due to personnel turnover in the IBCT.   The Army does not currently have a formal digital sustainment-training  program for individual soldiers and leaders.  Fort Lewis officials cited their  concerns that without a digital sustainment-training program, soldier skills  will quickly erode.  The Army Training and Doctrine Command is currently  developing an individual digital sustainment-training program for the two  brigades, which may be applicable to the entire Army.  However, the Army  has not yet implemented initial formal training in digitized systems within  its institutional centers and schools; as a result, many individual leaders  and soldiers arrive at the IBCT unit without any prior experience with the  hardware or software.  The Army plans to begin teaching digitized systems  at its schoolhouses in 2004, but even then, the training will only be an initial  overview.", "As part of the Army's multi-skilled soldier concept, the Army\u2019s Infantry  branch has combined the occupational skill specialties of infantryman,  fighting-vehicle infantryman, and heavy anti-armor weapons infantryman  into a single consolidated specialty and will train them in a wide range of  infantry skills.  Army officials spoke favorably about this concept and said  that concerns that the Army may be requiring too many skills and  capabilities for individual soldiers to absorb have not been borne out in  their experience so far.  In their view, individual soldiers at Fort Lewis had  adapted well to the requirements of the digitized systems and multiple  combat skills needed for IBCT missions.  They are generally satisfied with  the progress being made to date and believe that the IBCT is on track to  meet its certification milestone of May 2003.  Figure 5 depicts a schematic  of this multi-skilled soldier approach.", "The Army\u2019s ability to meet its rapid deployment goal for the first IBCT will  depend on availability of aircraft to transport unit equipment, completed  infrastructure improvements at Fort Lewis specifically, and Air Force  certification of the IBCT as deployable.  In commenting on the draft report,  Army officials stated that Air Force certification of the interim armored  vehicle is currently underway with weight and load certification scheduled  for May 2002.", "Initially the Army announced that the IBCTs would be capable of deploying  within 96 hours anywhere in the world, but the Army has since made it a  goal for the IBCTs rather than a requirement.  It has not established a  substitute deployability timetable for the first IBCT.  However, under  current plans, the Army retains the 96-hour deployment requirement for the  future transformed units entering the Army\u2019s force following formation of  all six brigades in 2008.  Other requirements for this future force are to be  able to deploy a division in 120 hours and five divisions in 30 days.", "It appears that this 96-hour deployability goal for the first IBCT will not be  achieved.  Army transportation planners have determined that it would  take 201 C-17 and 51 C-5 aircraft to transport all of the IBCT\u2019s equipment to  a distant theater.  (See fig. 6.)  Army officials have stated that with all the  competing demands for these aircraft, the Air Force currently does not  possess sufficient numbers of them to meet the 96-hour goal for the IBCTs.   Additional analyses would be needed to evaluate other ways to supplement  this capability, such as through the forward positioning of some materials  or the use of commercial aircraft.   Strategic airlift is an Air Force  responsibility and therefore beyond the purview of the Army.", "The installation where an IBCT is located will dictate the additional  infrastructure requirements necessary to deploy the brigade.  In October  2000, the Army\u2019s Military Traffic Management Command reported in its  Army Transformation study that the existing infrastructure at Fort Lewis  and McChord Air Force Base could not meet the Army\u2019s requirements for  deploying the IBCT.   The study identified five projects at the air base and  Fort Lewis that needed to be constructed or upgraded at an estimated cost  of about $52 million.  Since the publication of the report, the Army has  funded four of the five projects at a cost of more than $48 million and  begun one of the projects. The remaining project requires improvements to  deployment ramps at McChord Air Force Base.  According to Army  officials, the remaining project has not been funded and will most likely not  be completed before the Army certifies the IBCT as deployable in May  2003.", "Another impediment to achieving this goal is the Air Force\u2019s certification  that the IBCT and all its equipment items can be loaded on and deployed by  aircraft.  The Air Force cannot certify the unit until the vehicles are fielded  and loaded aboard the aircraft in accordance with combat mission  requirements.  The fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act  requires the Secretary of the Army to conduct an operational evaluation of  the first IBCT and the Secretary of Defense to certify that its design is  operationally suitable and effective.  The evaluation is to include  deployment of the brigade to the site of the evaluation.  Generally, the IBCT  cannot be deployed outside the United States until this requirement is met.   A successful evaluation will be necessary if the Army is to achieve its goal  of having six IBCTs by 2008."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Challenges Have Arisen at Fort Lewis", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Personnel Stabilization Has Been the Key Human Capital Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Army officials recognized early on that some form of personnel  stabilization policy for the IBCTs might be needed to provide sufficient  continuity of leadership and training to the brigade.  However, the delay in  setting up the policy and certain exemptions from the policy have led to  more turbulence than officials would have liked.  They believe that the  personnel turnover may have diminished training effectiveness in some  instances and may have led to devoting more time than they could afford to  digitization training.", "Officials explained that the need for stabilization stems from the unique  nature of the training being done at Fort Lewis and from the normal Army  rotational policy that generally has personnel rotating between  assignments in 2 years or less.  In short, when the trained personnel rotate  out of the IBCT, they take their training with them; but no equally trained  personnel are available to rotate in.  Consequently, the IBCT requires a  constant program of providing basic training to incoming personnel on  digital equipment, which is available only at Fort Lewis or Fort Hood.", "Moreover, because this skill is perishable, periodic refresher training is also  required.   Similarly, the IBCT is training to future war-fighting concepts  and doctrine and new concepts for leadership development.  Finally, the  first IBCT expects to begin receiving some of its interim armored vehicles,  which are not available elsewhere in the Army.  These unique training  requirements argue for more continuity than can be achieved through the  normal Army rotational policies that create a constant turnover of  personnel within a 24-month period.", "Recognizing this need for more continuity, Fort Lewis officials expressed to  Army headquarters their concern that permitting normal policies to remain  in place would adversely affect the IBCT\u2019s readiness and ability to achieve  certification on time.  In response, the Department of the Army established  a formal stabilization policy for the IBCTs in May 2001.  Except for certain  exemptions under this policy, soldiers must remain in an IBCT for 1 year  following certification of the brigade\u2019s operational capability.", "By stabilizing its soldiers, the unit had hoped to reduce the amount of time  it has to spend on training soldiers new to the IBCT on digital and other  specialized equipment.  Unfortunately, the stabilization policy has not been  as effective as officials had hoped.  First, the stabilization policy was not in  place until May 2001, and by then, many IBCT soldiers had already begun  leaving the unit under normal Army rotational procedures.  As a result,  IBCT trainers spent much of the year repeating their training to new  soldiers.", "A second problem in the stabilization policy\u2019s effectiveness stemmed from  the exemptions that are allowed under the policy.  For example, soldiers  are allowed to rotate out of an IBCT to attend a required school, when  promoted, or they can elect to leave an IBCT when they come up for  reenlistment.  Fort Lewis officials have been encouraged by the fact that  IBCT soldiers re-enlisted in fiscal year 2001 at higher rates than those  achieved by either of the brigade\u2019s higher headquarters\u2014I Corps at Fort  Lewis and Forces Command (FORSCOM).  As shown by figure 7, all three  organizations achieved over 100 percent of the retention goals set by the  Army.", "Officials noted, however, that IBCT soldiers who have elected to remain in  the Army have not necessarily elected to remain in the IBCT.  As shown by  figure 8, whereas 34 percent on average of I Corps soldiers elected to  remain in their units, only 27 percent of IBCT soldiers elected to stay with  the IBCT.  Moreover, despite the acknowledged need for continuity in the  IBCTs, officials have not been capturing data on the reasons why IBCT  soldiers are re-enlisting to leave the brigade early and therefore lack  information that could help them reduce personnel turbulence.  Further,  data are not available to determine which re-enlistment options IBCT  soldiers are choosing other than remaining in the unit.", "Fort Lewis officials said that the problems with stabilization may not be as  severe with subsequent brigades since the stabilization policy will be in  effect from the beginning, unlike the first brigade when the policy was not  instituted until months after its formation began.  As a result, Army officials  anticipate that these latter brigades will experience fewer departures.   Personnel turbulence related to reenlistments would become more  significant if the brigades experience slippage in their certification dates  and lose more soldiers to re-enlistment transfers."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Installation Support Needed for IBCTs Has Been Greater than Anticipated", "paragraphs": ["The Army specifically designed the IBCT to have fewer support personnel,  fewer supplies, and lighter vehicles so that the brigade could be quickly  deployed.  As a result, the IBCT cannot provide all its own support and  requires installation support when located at its home station and other  outside support after 72 hours once deployed.  In addition, the home  station must provide additional and costly facilities for that support.", "The IBCT is designed with an austere support battalion that contains fewer  mechanics to support and maintain its vehicles.  IBCT battalion  commanders pointed out, however, that the number of vehicles to support  has remained the same, even though the number of mechanics has been  reduced by two-thirds.  Therefore, the IBCT is capable of conducting only  about one-third of its vehicle maintenance requirements.  As a result, the  IBCT must depend on its home installation for scheduled maintenance  support.  Fort Lewis addressed this capability limitation by hiring  contractors and temporary employees to meet the IBCT support  requirements.  Fort Lewis officials estimate the IBCT\u2019s recurring  maintenance requirements at about $11.1 million a year.", "After being deployed for 72 hours, the IBCT must be supported by other  organizations due to its streamlined support battalion and, under  transformation concepts, must \u201creach\u201d for this support.  Under the reach  concept, the IBCT is expected to request fuel, ammunition, food, spare  parts, water, and other supplies through an integrated distribution system  by a linked communications network that includes the IBCT home station,  contractor support, and multinational or foreign national commercial  systems.  Army logistics planners have not yet determined how all this will  work.  Further, in the interim, the support battalion logistical systems are  not yet integrated and lack a dedicated secure network interface to the  Army\u2019s computerized Battle Command System.  As a result, IBCT soldiers  are being temporarily used as couriers to relay logistics data between  headquarters.  The Army\u2019s immediate solution to this challenge may be to  increase the IBCT support battalion personnel.  For the long term, the  Army is developing a system software fix.", "Providing support to IBCTs will require Army installations to provide new  and costly facilities to meet IBCT requirements. The extent and cost of  needed improvements at the other installations will vary widely depending  upon the location.  Army planners noted that it takes at least 3 to 5 years to  plan and construct maintenance and other needed infrastructure facilities  and that therefore it will be important to develop these plans as soon as  possible.  Moreover, Army officials have determined that at a minimum,  future IBCT home stations will require a mission-support training facility, a  fixed tactical Internet, ammunition igloos, and digital classrooms.   Examples of long-term requirements include live-fire ranges, maneuver- training areas, mock villages for urban training, and deployment facilities.   Figure 9 shows the facility constructed at Fort Lewis to train soldiers in  urban warfare techniques.", "At Fort Lewis and Yakima Training Center, existing support facilities\u2014such  as barracks, motor pools, ammunition storage facilities, and training  ranges\u2014need to be upgraded or constructed.  To meet IBCT training needs,  Fort Lewis converted an existing building to a mission-support training  facility, which accelerated the normal new construction timeline.  However,  all support requirements have not yet been funded.  For example, Fort  Lewis has requested about $10 million for IBCT communication  infrastructure requirements that include a secure fiber optic upgrade to  link to McChord Air Force Base.

The BCC is empowered to  directly coordinate with other Army major commands and agencies.  It  provides a centralized link between the IBCT and a variety of Army  organizations responsible for doctrine, training, organization, material, and  leadership development.  Fort Lewis officials emphasized to us that  resolving some of the challenges they are facing points to the need for  subsequent installations to establish some sort of mechanism, such as a  Brigade Coordination Cell, to deal with the many issues that will inevitably  arise.", "The BCC is designed as a matrix organization and conduit for feedback  between various Army organizations pertaining to training, equipment, and  logistics.  IBCT soldiers as well as analysts from the BCC, the Army Test  and Evaluation Command, and the Center for Army Lessons Learned  evaluate and validate training doctrine provided by the Infantry and Armor  schools.  After training exercises, IBCT commanders and soldiers as well as  the appropriate Army agencies provide informal and formal lessons- learned data to the cell.  The BCC communicates these data to the doctrine  writers for their use as they develop the training support packages for  squad-to brigade-level collective tasks and formulate conceptual guidance  for use by the IBCT commanders.  Cell personnel are a part of the working  groups created to solve issues in training, deployment, and logistics.  A  representative from the Army Materiel Command coordinates the vehicle  fielding and its associated new equipment training between the IBCT and  the civilian contractors.", "The BCC supplements an existing staff hierarchy.  It provides staff  enforcement and support for the I Corps staff while existing external to the  Fort Lewis chain of command.  The BCC is not a higher headquarters staff  for the IBCT.  The cell\u2019s focus is the same as its mission\u2014to successfully  deliver the first two IBCTs to the Army.", "Senior Fort Lewis officials have stated that the BCC has proven to be a  valuable means of coordinating activities related to brigade formation and  has offered several important benefits.  For example, they noted that some  of the difficulties that have arisen have been time-consuming to resolve.   The existence of the BCC has relieved such burdens from brigade  operations personnel so that they could concentrate more on their  substantive work, such as training.  The BCC also acted as a  communication intermediary between the IBCT and the institutional  schoolhouses to develop training doctrine for the brigade\u2019s new mission  requirements.  In addition, the BCC relieved Fort Lewis from some of the  public affairs requirements.

During our review, we determined that  while fielding the initial IBCT at Fort Lewis, the Army learned valuable  lessons that would be critical to future IBCT formation.

Furthermore, there is an indication that all lessons learned are not being  forwarded to the Center.

Concerns include, notably, the unavailability of the  mobile gun system, which provides a key combat capability, and the  likelihood that the IBCT will be unable to meet the 96-hour deployment  goal due to insufficient quantities of aircraft.  Because the IBCT could be  deployed to their theaters, it is important that CINC war planners know as  soon as possible what planned capabilities are likely to be missing when  the brigade is certified as having achieved its initial operating capability.    Similarly, logistics planners will need logistics data soon to enable them to  plan how best to meet the support requirements of the IBCT if it is  deployed to their theater.", "Certain challenges have also arisen in forming the first IBCT at Fort Lewis.   These challenges include concerns about retaining skilled personnel in the  brigade, the ability of IBCT soldiers to sustain their skills on digital  systems, and the need for and cost of facility improvements to support the  formation of this brigade and, potentially, subsequent brigades.

However, the Department noted that  the Army, through the CINC Requirements Task Force, has provided a  successful forum to address CINC concerns and derive solutions.  We  acknowledge that the CINC Requirements Task Force meetings provide a  valuable communication tool.  Nevertheless, during our fieldwork, CINC  operational and logistics planners, who have been represented at these  meetings, expressed concerns about not yet receiving specifics regarding  the combat capabilities of the IBCT and its logistics requirements.
