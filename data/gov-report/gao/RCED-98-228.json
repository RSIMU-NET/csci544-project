In these reports, we recommended several actions, including the use of automated systems, to identify such ineligible participants. In response to your request, this report focuses on individuals who were included as members of recipient households in more than one state during the same period, a problem referred to as \u201cduplicate participation.\u201d Because many states already compare information with neighboring states to identify duplicate participation, we focused on duplicate participation in widely separated states.", "Specifically, we (1) determined how many individuals were included as members of food stamp households in more than one state during 1996 and the estimated value of the benefits that were improperly issued to those households, (2) determined how these individuals could be improperly included without being detected, and (3) identified an option for detecting or preventing future food stamp overpayments caused by such duplicate participation.", "To identify individuals concurrently counted as members of households receiving food stamps in more than one state, we conducted a computer match comparing calendar year 1996 food stamp rolls of four states (California, Florida, New York, and Texas) against one another. These four states account for 35 percent of the nation\u2019s participants in the Food Stamp Program. (See app. I.) To provide the highest level of confidence that our analyses resulted in valid matches, we used only those matches that (1) met the most stringent criteria used by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to verify Social Security numbers and (2) showed that food stamp benefits were issued to the households on behalf of the same person during the same month or months."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp Program is designed to promote the general welfare and to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation\u2019s population by raising the nutritional levels of low-income families.

USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) manages the Food Stamp Program through agreements with state agencies. FNS approves the states\u2019 plans to operate the program and ensures that states administer the program in accordance with regulations. The federal government pays all of the costs for benefits and one-half of the administrative costs for each state. In fiscal year 1997, USDA provided over $21 billion in benefits to about 23 million participants and paid the states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia about $1.8 billion to administer the program.", "Food stamps are issued to households, which can be an individual, a family, or another group that lives together and customarily purchases and prepares food in common. Households applying for benefits must provide a Social Security number for each member. The value of the food stamp benefits for a household is determined by the number of eligible household members and their income, adjusted for assets and such costs as shelter and utilities. Therefore, a household\u2019s monthly food stamp allotment increases with each additional member, provided income limits are not exceeded. The average monthly benefit per household member in 1996, which varied by state, was about $73 nationally, but the benefit could have been as much as $122 for a single-person household.", "Eligibility workers in service centers work directly with applicants or their representatives to certify household eligibility and determine the amount of benefits at the time of the application and at least annually thereafter. Households that receive food stamps are required to report changes in household membership, such as the loss or the addition of a member, to the administering state or local agency.", "Generally, the service centers maintain the clients\u2019 detailed case records while the computerized eligibility and benefit issuance data are maintained at the state or the local level. State agencies in Florida, Texas, and New York maintain both types of data, while California\u2019s state agency maintains the information on eligibility and its counties maintain the information on benefit issuance.", "Each state is required to establish a performance reporting system to monitor its food stamp program, including a quality control review process to help ensure that benefits are issued only to qualifying households and that the amounts of these benefits are correct. Federal regulations (7 C.F.R. Ch. II, part 273.3) specify that no individual may participate as a member in more than one food stamp household or in more than one area in any month. This regulation also applies to participation in more than one state.

The California and Texas pairing produced the largest number of duplicate participants, while the New York and Texas pairing produced the fewest. In total, we identified about 20,000 duplicate participants.", "The individuals we identified in our match were members of households of varying sizes, some with multiple members and some with a single member\u2014the individual was the household. Households with multiple members may have (1) fraudulently listed an individual as a member when applying or (2) neglected to report that the individual was no longer in the household, resulting in the continued issuance of benefits on the presumption that the individual was still present in the home. For single-member households, the individual or the individual\u2019s authorized representative (or someone posing as the individual or representative),may have applied for and obtained food stamp benefits in one or more states. For our match, we did not determine whether the duplicate participation was the result of inadvertent or intentional actions by the household, nor did we determine which state each individual actually resided in during the months of duplicate participation.", "We found that duplicate participation was generally concentrated in a relatively small number of counties in each state. (See app. II.) Such information may help states determine where to focus their efforts, such as intensifying the screening of applicants, to reduce duplicate participation. While counties with the most duplicate participation were generally also those with the greatest number of program participants in each state, we did find some exceptions. For example, New York City, which has about 65 percent of the state\u2019s food stamp participants, had the fifth highest number of duplicate participants, while Monroe County, New York, which has only about 4 percent of the state\u2019s food stamp participants, had the most duplicate participants.", "While we focused our analysis on duplicate participation in the Food Stamp Program, such participation may be indicative of similar problems in other public assistance programs administered by the states. In our review of the sample case files in each of the four states we visited, we found that some duplicate food stamp participants were also participants in other benefit programs in those states, including Aid to Families With Dependent Children (now Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and general assistance. Similarly, FNS reported in its 1996 study of the characteristics of households receiving food stamps that 52 percent of the recipients also received family aid and general assistance benefits.", "The possibility of duplicate participation in multiple benefit programs is consistent with a September 1997 analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

HHS compared the Social Security numbers, surnames, and dates of birth of the participants in each of the 15 participating states and the District of Columbia against those of the other participating states. All cases in which at least the Social Security numbers matched between states were considered to potentially indicate duplicate participation. HHS referred all such cases to the states for follow-up and for each client listed the programs that provided benefits, such as TANF, food stamps, general assistance, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and indicated when the client had participated in each program.

To implement this provision, states must track information on clients receiving these benefits, not only within their own jurisdictions, but across state boundaries as well. Recognizing the potential impact of the legislation on information systems and capabilities within and among the states, the Congress directed HHS to prepare a report that would address (1) the status of automated data-processing systems operated by the states to assist in welfare administration and (2) the requirements to establish a system to track participants in public programs over time and check state records to determine whether individuals are participating in welfare programs in two or more states.", "In December 1997, HHS reported to the Congress that significant modifications to the states\u2019 automated systems were needed to respond to the requirements of the Welfare Reform Act. Furthermore, a November 1996 HHS survey of all the states; the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; and the District of Columbia found that little progress had been made to meet those requirements. Specifically, 78 percent of the survey respondents stated that no progress had been made in developing an automated system to track and help prevent duplicate payments of benefits among the states, 11 percent indicated that they were in the planning stage, and the remainder indicated that they were in a more advanced (developmental or operational) stage. Several respondents also recommended establishing a national database to facilitate interstate tracking.", "While HHS\u2019 report identified five potential systems that could be developed for interstate tracking, the report did not recommend developing any specific system. Instead, the report offered several approaches that the Congress could consider should it decide to pursue developing such a system. When a system might be implemented is uncertain, because HHS\u2019 Director of State System Approvals told us that the Department does not intend to independently implement a national interstate tracking system for public assistance programs without guidance and funding from the Congress.

A household that wishes to receive benefits must present an application listing all the members of that household and their Social Security numbers and provide information about their income and other eligibility factors. The applications include questions designed to determine whether the applicant is receiving benefits elsewhere, for example, another county or state. Eligibility workers review this information, interview a household representative, obtain identification documents (such as a driver\u2019s license from the representative), certify the eligibility of household members, and determine the amount of benefits. In addition, they recertify the household at least annually. At no time are all household members required to appear and present identification; however, clients are responsible for identifying changes in household membership.", "According to FNS, which identifies overall error rates for each state by reviewing a random sample of cases, client errors or misrepresentations contribute significantly to incorrectly issued benefits, particularly when an overpayment occurs. In 1996, FNS reported that about 7 percent or $1.5 billion of the $22 billion of benefits issued nationwide were overpayments and that 57 percent of overpayments were attributable to intentional or unintentional inaccuracies in client-provided information. (Errors also resulted in underpayments of about $518 million in fiscal year 1996.)", "Nevertheless, FNS\u2019 regulations do not require verification of client-provided information on household membership, unless the caseworker deems the information \u201cquestionable.\u201d The regulations allow each state agency to develop guidance for identifying questionable information. In the four states we visited, the guidance defined questionable information as applicants\u2019 statements that were contradictory or did not agree with information that was in the case record or otherwise available to the eligibility workers. Consistent with its practice of allowing states flexibility in administering the program, FNS does not require the states to match client information such as Social Security numbers with those of clients on the food stamp rolls in other states.", "When the eligibility workers in the states we visited suspected questionable or fraudulent information, they could refer the application to investigators before granting aid. Investigators in each state told us that they try to verify questionable information on household composition by visiting homes and making collateral contacts to confirm information with friends, neighbors, or landlords.

However, this notification is provided only if the Social Security number belongs to an individual already receiving RSDI payments.

All of the states we visited\u2014California, Florida, New York, and Texas\u2014have established a matching program between the state\u2019s public assistance rolls (for all assistance programs, not just food stamps) and the public assistance rolls of selected states, usually those on their borders. Of those states, New York conducts the most extensive matching, comparing information with five border states, as well as with Florida, Virginia, and Puerto Rico.", "Texas\u2019 public assistance duplicate participation match is characteristic of the neighboring-state matches conducted in the states we visited. Texas conducts a quarterly match for all the public assistance programs it administers, including food stamps, using computer tapes provided by the bordering states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and New Mexico, and is in the process of establishing a match with Arkansas. Texas sends a tape of participants to each of the other states on the same quarterly schedule so that they can conduct their own matches. Texas established the data exchange for each match through a separate memorandum of understanding negotiated with each state. Aside from some initial system compatibility and data reliability problems, Texas officials have found the matches to be simple, low-cost routines to maintain and are satisfied with the results. A Texas state official estimated that computer matches of Texas and Oklahoma public assistance programs for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1998 identified 715 potential duplicate participants.", "While computer matching to identify duplicate participants in neighboring states is useful, the effectiveness of such matches is limited to those states that agree to share data. States generally establish cooperative agreements to exchange data only with border states, because (1) they are the most accessible to clients and therefore considered the most likely place for clients to be included in another household and (2) establishing cooperative agreements requires significant administrative effort. While many states are able to establish data exchange agreements with border states, state officials told us of several cases in which states declined to participate in a duplicate participation matching effort because they had higher-priority issues to work on.", "Furthermore, our findings of duplicate participation and HHS\u2019 similar findings involving remote states show that matching between neighboring states goes only part of the way towards identifying improper payments.

The state agencies had verified the Social Security numbers for the data on food stamp beneficiaries through SSA\u2019s Enumeration Verification System. Texas state officials provided electronic benefit transfer (EBT) data for a selected sample of 75 cases.In California, where issuance data is maintained at the county level, we determined that eligibility was predictive of participation in two counties, so we used the state\u2019s eligibility information in lieu of issuance data for our match.", "We matched the verified Social Security numbers of members of food stamp households in each state with those of members of food stamp households in each of the other three states. For each individual identified as a member of households in more than one state, we determined the periods during which food stamps were issued to both (or, in a few cases, as many as three) households for that individual. For double participation, we estimated the dollar value of the improperly issued food stamps by applying the average of the two states\u2019 average monthly issuance per individual recipient from fiscal year 1996 to each period in which issuance occurred concurrently in the states. (See table III.1.) Triple participants were treated as double participants in each set of states where we found them. Our findings cannot be used to estimate potential overpayments nationwide, because our methodology was not designed for that purpose.", "Food stamp benefits are calculated for households, not for individuals. As such, it is difficult to determine the exact value of benefits issued to an individual included in a household, unless he or she is the only member of a household. Even then, the amount will vary from individual to individual, on the basis of such factors as income, assets, and the cost of shelter. Therefore, we relied on the average monthly benefit issued per person in the locations we reviewed, which ranged from a high of $82 in New York to a low of $68 in California. We realize that the actual issuance may be higher or lower than our estimates; for example, the maximum issuance to single-member households who are included in our findings was $119 in fiscal year 1996. Our estimates are intended to show the general magnitude of the problem.", "We considered every month of duplicate issuance in more than one state to be an overpayment, in keeping with food stamp regulations (7 C.F.R. Ch. II, part 273.3), which specify that no individual may participate as a member in more than one household or in more than one area in any month. However, our estimates of overpayments were conservative in that we assumed that the individual was actually eligible to participate in one of the states.", "Because of the quality control program operated by the Food and Nutrition Service and the states\u2019 ongoing quality assurance efforts, we accepted their computerized food stamp data as reliable. To provide additional confidence in the data\u2019s accuracy, we reviewed a limited number of food stamp case files at social service centers in four large metropolitan areas\u2014Los Angeles County, California; Dade County, Florida; El Paso County, Texas; and New York City. We compared the Social Security number and the date of birth of each individual in the computerized database with information in the relevant case files and found no significant differences. To further verify participation in the household, we reviewed copies of available documents in the case files, such as birth certificates, drivers licenses, and Social Security cards. We attempted to obtain additional verification of the periods of participation and identify participation in other public assistance programs by reviewing approved applications; however, many case files did not contain complete information. To evaluate the extent to which individuals may be exempt from the prohibition on duplicate participation, we reviewed applications and other relevant documentation to determine if the individuals were residents of shelters for battered women and children.", "For a sample of 75 Texas cases, we compared the computerized food stamp months of participation with EBT data showing the months that the benefit accounts were accessed to determine whether program participation had actually occurred, i.e., benefits had in fact been drawn out. The resulting analysis showed that benefits had been drawn from the EBT account within 3 months of being credited in 91 percent of the months for which Texas\u2019 computerized food stamp data indicated participation. This analysis attests to the accuracy of Texas\u2019 computerized participation data and indicates a high correlation between the availability of benefits and their use.", "To determine why the inclusion of an individual in a food stamp household was not detected, we contacted state agency officials in Sacramento, California; Tallahassee, Florida; Albany, New York; and Austin, Texas, to discuss and review policy and procedures for verifying an applicant\u2019s data and any subsequent changes, including determining whether an applicant or client is a household member in another state. We discussed fraud detection and computerized data-matching efforts, quality control and assurance efforts, and methods of food stamp issuance with state officials. In the four large metropolitan areas we selected for review, we discussed local fraud detection and computerized data-matching efforts with officials at the state\u2019s social service agency.", "To identify the options for detecting or preventing future food stamp overpayments caused by duplicate participation, we discussed with agency officials in each of the states we visited their opinions regarding the value of computer matching. We contacted state officials to determine the cost, the quality, the savings, and the barriers to computer matching to identify duplicate participation. To determine the effort associated with data matching to identify such individuals, we calculated the time used by our programmer to develop and implement the match programs and reviewed studies performed for FNS, OMB, and HHS regarding the costs and the effectiveness of data-sharing and matching."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s letter dated July 8, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We have revised our report to delete any implication that the Department\u2019s Disqualified Recipient Subsystem might be modified to encompass a system for identifying duplicate participation. But we continue to believe that the lessons learned by the Department in developing and implementing the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem will be useful in creating such a system. 2. We agree that the knowledge and views of the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the development of a national database to track participation in assistance programs across state lines would be helpful to the Department in creating such a system for the Food Stamp Program. However, the Department should not delay its efforts in anticipation of action by another agency. A Department of Health and Human Services official told GAO that it does not plan to create a national system, nor is it responsible for doing so. 3. Because of privacy concerns, GAO does not usually release data on individuals resulting from computer matches. Most of GAO\u2019s computer matches have involved federal or federal and state databases. Under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act, executive branch agencies must adhere to data integrity and privacy requirements before such computer matches can take place. Although not subject to the act, GAO has denied requests for GAO computer matches because providing the information would enable agencies to obtain data without adhering to the kinds of requirements contained in the act. However, in the present case, under the federal food stamp regulations, states can match food stamp recipient databases if there is an agreement in effect between the states which, for privacy concerns, limits their use of such information. If any of the states have matching agreements to share food stamp recipient information, we would, in this instance, consider providing the computer matches with a written undertaking that they would be subject to such agreements.
