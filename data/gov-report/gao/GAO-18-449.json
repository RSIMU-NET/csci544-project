For example, DOD\u2019s 2016 assessment of several projects  in one partner nation indicated that small-scale construction projects  often present problems in achieving objectives. According to the  assessment, these problems are largely due to the limited number  and capability of construction firms willing to bid on work in remote  locations and a dollar ceiling for small-scale projects ($750,000) that  often cannot cover all expenses at such sites. The assessment found  that relying on a partner nation to provide the additional funds  frequently results in the construction not being completed. In addition,  DOD\u2019s 2016 assessment report indicated a problem with the  adequacy of an airplane spare-parts package provided in some  Global Train and Equip projects. The assessment found that the  Cessna Caravan spare parts, intended to cover 2 years of  maintenance, proved insufficient for high-speed combat flight  operations. (See fig. 7 for an example of a Cessna Caravan at a  partner nation airbase.) The report also noted that this problem had  been identified in other Global Train and Equip projects that included  spare-parts packages for Cessna Caravans. The report indicated that  the equipment manufacturers determine the package contents without  regard to the unique operational and environmental conditions in the  receiving partner nation.", "Equipment suitability and procurement issues. A lack of suitability  of equipment provided by Global Train and Equip projects, as well as  problems with procuring the equipment, can make it difficult to  achieve desired capability-building objectives. For example, a 2017  assessment report of a 2015 project found that size distributions for  body armor and helmets were not aligned with the general size  requirements\u2014an issue that had been identified in other countries  receiving Global Train and Equip assistance. Additionally, the  assessment noted that consideration was not given to providing body  armor with built-in buoyancy for personnel operating in a maritime  environment. Further, the assessment noted that bright orange life  jackets were provided as tactical equipment, when a subdued color  would have been more appropriate. Moreover, the 2016 assessment  report found that equipment procurement issues in a 2012 project  caused maintenance problems for the partner country. According to  the report, the U.S. Army did not have an existing contract to obtain  diesel vehicles from the manufacturer specified in the project proposal  and congressional notification and therefore used an existing contract  to obtain vehicles from a different manufacturer. The assessment  observed that, while delivery of available vehicles provides some  value, in this case it created maintenance problems for the partner  nation because there was no dealership in the country to provide  repairs and spare parts for the vehicles. The assessment found that in  such situations it may be best to delay fulfillment until a contract is  available to procure vehicles from the specified manufacturer.", "Partner nation shortfalls. Shortfalls of partner nations, including not  using assistance for the envisioned purposes, inability to maintain and  sustain equipment, and difficulty in manning and training recipient  units, can negatively affect the achievement of project objectives. For  example, the 2016 assessment report for a 2015 project found that,  although the recipient unit was able to plan and execute more  complex operations to combat regional threats, such as Boko Haram,  in a professional manner, the assessment team received no evidence  that the unit had played more than a minor role in counter\u2013Boko  Haram operations. In a separate review of a partner nation\u2019s Global  Train and Equip projects, the 2016 assessment found that the  recipient unit had difficulties in maintaining weapons in a fully mission- capable status. The assessment found that a number of the unit\u2019s  small arms were old and many had warped barrels, making them  much less accurate. A 2017 assessment of a 2013 project found that  the recipient unit suffered from shortages of junior noncommissioned  officers and officers. The unit was also found to have few soldiers in  specialty jobs who had received school training. The assessment  report acknowledged that certain conditions in the partner nation,  such as low levels of education, presented a multitude of problems in  ensuring the development and maintenance of national security forces  capable of working with, and integrating, a range of modern combat  systems.", "Workforce management challenges. DOD officials indicated that  workforce challenges, particularly related to turnover and staffing  levels, can inhibit effective project design, program implementation,  and oversight. DOD officials acknowledged that staff turnover, an  issue that we previously identified, remains a challenge. According  to the officials, there is a high degree of institutionalized turnover,  particularly among security cooperation officers, at U.S. embassies  and to some extent within the geographic combatant commands. As  a result, the officials overseeing project implementation may not have  been responsible for project development and are less likely to  understand the capabilities of the intended recipient units or the  capability gaps that could be addressed by equipment and training.  DOD officials also told us that they have been challenged to meet  programmatic demands with current staffing levels, particularly given  the influx of funds appropriated for the Counterterrorism Partnerships  Fund in 2015. DOD officials said that the volume of Global Train and  Equip projects expanded with the large increase in funding in 2015  and 2016, which stressed the foreign military sales system as well as  geographic combatant commands\u2019 ability to plan for, and manage, the  program with existing resources. For example, DOD officials said that  teams of three staff at geographic combatant commands were  managing over three times more funding than in prior years. As a  result, staff were unable to maintain consistent levels of due diligence  on issues such as ensuring that proposal packages addressed  absorptive capacity and sustainment planning. According to DOD  officials, negative effects of this inconsistent due diligence included  the arrival of equipment not suitable for operations and overestimation  of one partner nation\u2019s absorptive capacity, necessitating unplanned  training and resulting in project delays. DOD officials said that they  are now in the process of acquiring additional staffing to address  capacity constraints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Officials Described Several Ongoing Changes to Improve Assessments", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials told us that they are in the process of evaluating the  effectiveness of the assessment process conducted in 2016 and 2017  and described a variety of changes that they are making to improve  assessments of Global Train and Equip projects. DOD officials  acknowledged that baseline and post-implementation assessments, as  well as monitoring activities, had been conducted inconsistently in prior  years, including for the projects developed and implemented in 2016 and  2017. DOD officials said that staffing constraints were a contributing  factor. In March 2017, we also identified some weaknesses in the design  of evaluations for Global Train and Equip projects and recommended that  DOD develop a plan for improving the quality of these evaluations.", "While prior laws required DOD to conduct assessments and evaluate the  program\u2019s effectiveness, the fiscal year 2017 NDAA requires that DOD  maintain a program of assessment, monitoring, and evaluation in support  of the agency\u2019s security cooperation programs and activities. Given the  requirements for an assessment, monitoring, and evaluation program,  and recognizing the importance of improving the assessment processes,  DOD officials said they are developing an enhanced assessment process  that includes increased staffing dedicated to monitoring and evaluation.  For example, DOD officials said that they had hired several full-time contractors to perform key tasks related to monitoring and evaluation.  According to the officials, several full-time contractor positions will be  located in the various geographic combatant command locations, with  responsibilities to develop baseline assessments in coordination with the geographic  combatant commands and oversee the quality and completeness of  those assessments; write performance indicators and performance plans into every Global  Train and Equip project proposal;  conduct monitoring and provide reports to the geographic combatant  command and to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency on the  status of project objectives and performance indicators; and  conduct annual, independent evaluations to assess a few Global Train  and Equip projects in detail.", "In addition, DOD officials stated that they had hired a full-time contractor  who will be based at headquarters and provide further support for each  geographic combatant command and who will be charged with  documenting that baseline assessments were completed and conducting  quality reviews of assessment-related documents."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Global Train and Equip program is a critical tool for building partner  capacity to counter terrorism worldwide, and allocations for the program  totaled more than $4.1 billion in 2009 through 2017. DOD has established  an interagency process to develop and select Global Train and Equip  projects that takes into account four required security assistance planning  elements. However, although DOD consistently addressed project  objectives in its 2016 and 2017 project proposals, DOD did not  consistently address the other three planning elements. In addition, DOD  guidance no longer includes instructions for addressing one of these  elements, sustainment planning, in proposals for projects for which DOD  does not intend or anticipate sustainment. Updating its guidance to  include such instructions would help ensure decision makers\u2019 access to  complete information on annual sustainment costs, even costs anticipated  to be negligible. Moreover, although officials reported having recently  developed an informal quality review process designed to ensure that  proposal packages address all required planning elements, DOD has not  formalized this process as written policy. Formalizing the process would  enhance DOD\u2019s ability to provide consistent oversight of project  development and to ensure that decision makers have access to  complete information about each planning element for proposed projects.

This report examines (1) the status of funding that the Department  of Defense (DOD) allocated for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009  through 2017; (2) the extent to which DOD addressed security assistance  planning elements in project proposals in 2016 and 2017; and, (3) DOD\u2019s  reporting on the achievement of Global Train and Equip project objectives  and any factors affecting its ability to achieve those objectives.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed funding data, program  guidelines, project proposal documents, and congressional notifications.  We discussed the funding data, project proposal process and key  elements of project planning, documentation, and assessment with  officials from DOD and the Department of State (State); geographic  combatant commands in whose areas of responsibility partner nations  received 2016 or 2017 assistance\u2014the U.S. Africa Command, the U.S.  Central Command, and the European Central Command; and the U.S.  embassies in Jordan, Niger, and Uganda. We selected these countries on  the basis of their having received a higher proportion of DOD\u2019s allocations  for the Global Train and Equip program in fiscal years 2016 and 2017; we  also considered factors such as the number of project assessments  conducted in each country, the maturity of projects, embassy officials\u2019  project assessment experience, and the countries\u2019 geographic  distribution.", "To identify the status of funding that DOD allocated for Global Train and  Equip projects in fiscal years 2009 through 2017, we assessed funding  data for 2009 through 2017. DOD provided data on allocations, amounts  reallocated, unobligated balances, unliquidated obligations, and  disbursements of funds for program activities according to the fiscal year  when the funds were appropriated. We analyzed these data to determine  the extent to which funds had been allocated, obligated, and disbursed.  DOD also provided data on project funding by year of allocation. We used  these data to report allocations for Global Train and Equip projects by  fiscal year and recipient country. We assessed the reliability of these data  by interviewing cognizant agency officials and comparing the data with  previously published data. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To assess the extent to which DOD addressed key elements of security  sector assistance for projects it planned to implement in 2016 and 2017,  we analyzed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. We  reviewed Presidential Policy Directive 23 on Security Sector Assistance,  which identified four key elements to be considered for security sector  assistance programs: (1) project objectives that address partner needs,  (2) the absorptive capacity of the recipient unit, (3) the baseline  capabilities of the recipient unit, and (4) the arrangements for the  sustainment of the project. We also reviewed DOD guidance, which  requires these elements to be considered in project proposal  development. To determine the extent to which DOD addressed these  elements in project proposals, we analyzed the content of agency- approved project proposals in 2016 and 2017. Two reviewers  independently analyzed 41 proposal packages for 2016 and 31 proposal  packages for 2017. The reviewers resolved any disagreements through  discussion of the information used to make their independent  determinations. We also interviewed State and DOD officials who develop  and review proposals, discussing (1) how they use information in the  project proposal packages to consider planning elements and (2) other  factors they may consider in developing and reviewing proposals.", "Further, we reviewed congressional notifications DOD developed  subsequent to agency approval of Global Train and Equip project to  determine the extent to which those documents included information  about the four planning elements. With respect to our reporting on  support for information about baseline assessments, congressional  notifications lay out a standardized assessment framework to be used to  assess the effects of projects. This framework includes a baseline  assessment that DOD requires to be completed for inclusion in project  proposal packages. DOD provided baseline assessments for 38 of 41  project proposals notified to Congress in 2016 and 30 of 31 project  proposals notified to Congress in 2017. To evaluate the completeness of  the required baseline assessment sections, we compared these 38  baseline assessment documents included in 2016 project proposal  packages and 30 baseline assessment documents in 2017 project  proposal packages with DOD internal guidance. To assess the  completeness of sustainment plans, we used DOD\u2019s Global Train and  Equip guidance for 2016 and 2017, which defined complete sustainment  plans to include three elements: (1) an identification of funding sources  for project sustainment, (2) an estimate of the annual sustainment costs,  and (3) an assessment of the sustainment capability of the partner nation.", "To examine DOD reporting on the achievement of project objectives in  2016 and 2017, we reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency  officials. In particular, we analyzed DOD\u2019s annual project assessment  reports and supporting documents for 2016 and 2017 as well as the  assessment framework handbook. DOD submitted an annual assessment  report to Congress in 2016 but was not required to submit an annual  assessment report in 2017. As a result, DOD prepared country-level  assessments in 2017 but did not compile them and submit them to  Congress as it did in 2016. To examine the extent to which DOD\u2019s  assessments and supporting documents indicated progress in building  partner capacity, we compared baseline assessments of recipient unit  capability and performance levels, conducted when projects were  proposed, with post-implementation assessments of recipient unit  capability levels, conducted after the delivery of program assistance.  DOD uses a standard framework for evaluating the capabilities and  performance of each recipient unit. Baseline assessments rate the  recipient unit\u2019s level of capability and performance before project  implementation on a 5-point scale, with 1 defined as the ability to perform  some basic tasks to at least a low standard of performance and 5 defined  as the ability to perform most of the advanced tasks for the unit\u2019s  missions and to operate almost continuously throughout its assigned area  of operations. After project implementation, project assessments and  supporting documents use the same 5-point scale to rate any changes  (positive or negative) in the recipient unit\u2019s level of capability and  performance. DOD\u2019s 2016 assessment report and 2017 country-level  assessment reports included information on 84 Global Train and Equip  projects; of these, 21 projects included both a baseline and a post- implementation assessment of the recipient unit. We relied on DOD\u2019s  assessment reports and did not systematically validate the assessment  results because it was beyond the scope of this engagement to assess  the reliability of the assessments. However, for the purposes of this  analysis, we met with DOD and contracted officials responsible for  conducting and reviewing project assessments to gather information  about their processes for assessing recipient unit capabilities. In addition,  we reviewed DOD\u2019s project assessment guidance and their template for  conducting project assessments, which was consistently used in the  assessments we reviewed.", "Finally, to examine DOD reporting on factors affecting the achievement of  project objectives, we reviewed the assessment reports and interviewed  DOD officials responsible for implementing the program, including officials  from DOD\u2019s policy guidance and oversight office and its geographic  combatant commands; officials at embassies in the three selected  countries; and officials at State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. We  also considered the factors that we identified as affecting the  achievement of project objectives for our 2016 report that considered  2015 project proposals.
