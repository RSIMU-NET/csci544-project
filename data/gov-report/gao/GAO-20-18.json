Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) data show that the majority of older adults have chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. Research shows that such individuals may have different nutritional needs. As older adults age, they may also face barriers, such as a reduced appetite, impairing their ability to meet their nutritional needs. HHS plans to focus on older adults in a future update to the guidelines, but has not documented a plan for doing so. Documenting such a plan could help ensure guidelines better address the needs of the population.", "Of the six federal nutrition assistance programs serving older adults, four have requirements for food that states and localities provide directly to participants, and federal agencies oversee states' monitoring of these requirements. In HHS's and U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) meal programs, states must ensure meals meet requirements. Yet, HHS does not gather information from states, such as approved menus, to confirm this, and localities in two of the four selected states said state monitoring of menus was not occurring. Further, USDA regional officials told GAO they lack information on how meal programs operate at adult day care centers as they primarily focus on other sites for their on-site reviews. Additional monitoring could help HHS and USDA ensure meal programs meet nutritional requirements and help providers meet older adults' varying needs.", "In the states GAO selected, meal and food providers of the four nutrition programs with nutrition requirements reported various challenges, such as an increased demand for services. Providers in three of the four states reported having waiting lists for services. Providers of HHS and USDA meal programs in all four states also reported challenges tailoring meals to meet certain dietary needs, such as for diabetic or pureed meals.

Although the risk of developing chronic conditions increases  with age, research has shown that poor nutrition is a contributor to  negative health outcomes, including many chronic conditions. For  example, research shows that over- and under-consumption of certain  nutrients, in addition to physical inactivity, is associated with the  development of chronic conditions, including certain cancers, obesity,  heart disease, and diabetes. The CDC reported that, in 2016, nutrition- related chronic conditions, including heart disease and stroke, were  among the leading causes of death for older adults 65 and older in the  United States, with heart disease accounting for 25 percent of deaths  among this population.", "At the same time, research shows that nutrients and diet can prevent,  delay, or assist in managing many chronic conditions, and individuals with  certain chronic conditions may have different nutritional needs compared  to healthy individuals. For example, according to research reviewed  during development of the dietary guidelines and DRIs: diets low in sodium that also replace some carbohydrates with protein  or unsaturated fats lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, both  reducing the risk of developing heart disease and helping to manage  it;  consumption of certain types of dietary fats, such as omega-3 fatty  acids found in fish and flaxseed, for example, may help prevent or  manage heart disease;  increased consumption of fiber reduces total blood cholesterol, and  high cholesterol is both a chronic condition as well as an increased  risk for developing other chronic conditions, such as heart disease  and stroke; and decreased consumption of foods high in added sugars, saturated fats,  and sodium helps reduce the risk of diabetes, stroke, or heart attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Older Adults\u2019 Meeting Nutritional Needs May Negatively Affect Their Health Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Research has shown that certain age-related changes may impair older  adults\u2019 ability to meet their nutritional needs, potentially resulting in  negative health outcomes. According to a study conducted by the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, physiological changes that occur with  age, such as decreased metabolism and reductions in muscle mass and  nutrient absorption, may make it difficult for older adults to meet their  nutritional needs. Research reviewed to develop the dietary guidelines  also indicates that older adults experience a decline in calorie or energy  needs as they age, due in part to decreased physical activity. As a result  of reduced energy needs, older adults exhibit less hunger and also  experience changes in taste sensation and sense of smell, all of which  may lead to decreased food consumption, according to the Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics study. Inadequate consumption of certain  nutrients, such as potassium, may lead to increased risk of negative  health outcomes, including the development of chronic conditions, as  noted earlier.", "Age-related physical or mental impairments also may impact older adults\u2019  ability to meet their nutritional needs, potentially resulting in negative  health outcomes. The Older Americans Act defines disability to include a  physical or mental impairment, or combination of the two, that results in  substantial functional limitations to certain major life activities, including  self-care and mobility, among other things. An HHS official we spoke  with noted that some older adults\u2019 inability to perform daily activities\u2014 which can include eating, walking, or leaving the home to obtain groceries  or meals, because of a physical or mental impairment\u2014can contribute to  inadequate nutrition. According to the CDC, age-related declines in  cognitive functioning, such as the ability to reason and remember, may  affect some older adults\u2019 ability to leave their homes and shop for food,  hindering their ability to meet their nutritional needs.", "Further, HHS reported that older adults with age-related physical  impairments, such as impaired mobility and vision, may have difficulty  opening, reading, and using food packaging, limiting their ability to  prepare food. According to an Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study,  older adults with a physical impairment, such as an inability to chew or  swallow food, may have reduced ability to consume nutrients, which, as  previously noted, may increase their risk of negative health outcomes.", "Older adults may also require the use of medication, which may impact  their ability to absorb or consume nutrients and meet their nutritional  needs. For example, according to the National Institute on Aging,  common side effects of certain medications can include reduced appetite  and dry mouth, which may make it difficult to chew and swallow. In  addition, some medications require older adults to limit their consumption  of certain foods, such as citrus fruit, as consumption of these foods may  change the effectiveness of the medications or cause other negative  health outcomes. However, such restrictions may impact older adults\u2019  ability to obtain the nutrients commonly found in those foods.", "Further, some older adults experience food insecurity, and therefore have  limited access to adequate food and nutrients, which research has shown  may lead to negative health outcomes. According to research reviewed  to develop the dietary guidelines, food insecurity is a leading nutrition- related public health issue that compromises nutrient intake, potentially  resulting in an increased risk of developing a chronic condition, as well as  difficulty managing chronic conditions. USDA reported that 8 percent of  U.S. households with an older adult and 9 percent of U.S. households in  which an older adult lived alone experienced food insecurity in 2017\u2014the  most recent year for which data are available. According to HHS, food  insecure older adults are more likely to experience negative health  outcomes than their food secure counterparts.

Specifically, the guidelines focus  on the foods and nutrients healthy individuals need to maintain health and  prevent nutrition-related chronic conditions, which limit their applicability  to older adults who already have chronic conditions. According to the  scientific report for the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, the guidelines are  expected to evolve to address public health concerns and the nutritional  needs of specific populations. Further, a report from a DRI working  group indicates that the growth of the older adult population and the  prevalence of chronic conditions in this group highlight the importance of  understanding how nutrition can help to address chronic conditions.  Although DRI researchers recently took steps to examine research on the  relationship between nutrition and chronic conditions, they noted in a  March 2019 report that current research on this issue is somewhat  limited.", "At the same time, the federal nutrition guidelines do not address the  varying nutritional needs of older adults of different ages and instead  focus on guidelines for broad age groups. Specifically, the dietary  guidelines provide information by gender on the nutrient needs of all adults 51 or older, and the DRIs provide this information by gender for  older adults 51 through 70 and 71 or older. However, research has shown  that these broad age categories do not account for how needs change  with age among older adults, particularly for those 71 or older. For  instance, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study, the  nutrient needs of older adults can be wide-ranging given the various  changes that may occur with aging, such as those associated with  reduced energy needs. Further, according to a summary report on the  DRIs, physiological functioning, such as nutrient absorption, varies greatly  after age 70. HHS officials similarly noted that nutritional needs change  with each stage in life, and the needs of older adults who are in their 60s  and those who are in their 90s or older may be substantially different.", "Additionally, researchers note that information on the varying nutritional  needs of the different age groups of older adults is limited. For instance,  the advisory committee that developed the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines  noted that more data are needed on older adults\u2019 diets, particularly for  those 71 or older, and the degree to which age-related changes affect  older adults\u2019 ability to establish and maintain proper nutrition. Similarly,  researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center  on Aging\u2014one of the largest research centers studying nutrition and  aging in the United States\u2014told us that research on different age groups  has been hindered in part by limitations in national nutrition and health  data on older adults, and adults 85 or older, in particular, despite the  projected growth of this age group.", "HHS officials said they intend to include a focus on nutritional guidance  for older adults in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines update, but they  have not yet documented their plans to do so. Broadly, HHS and USDA  officials told us they intend to address the nutritional needs of individuals  across the entire lifespan in future updates to the dietary guidelines.  USDA is leading the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines update, which will  include guidance for those individuals in the earliest stages of life. HHS  officials said that when they lead the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines  update, they intend to include a focus on nutritional guidance for older  adults. However, HHS has not yet documented this intention, such as  through a formal plan. As noted, older adults\u2019 nutritional needs can vary  with age and many face certain challenges that additional nutrition  guidance could help address, such as the management of chronic  conditions or age-related changes, yet guidance currently falls short in  part because of limited research evaluating older adults\u2019 nutritional needs.  In its Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2018-2022, HHS notes that one of the  department\u2019s objectives is to prevent, treat, and control communicable  diseases and chronic conditions. As previously noted, the dietary  guidelines are also expected to evolve to address public health concerns  and the nutritional needs of specific populations.

Through federal management evaluations, USDA  regional staff review states\u2019 monitoring of the program, including their  reviews of menus to ensure compliance with meal pattern requirements,  and conduct onsite reviews at both the state agency and local provider  level. Regional staff told us they review all states at least once every 3  years.", "However, USDA regional officials told us they lack information on how the  program is working at adult day care centers, in part because its onsite  reviews of adult day care providers are generally limited, unlike on the  child care side of the program. According to USDA officials, the majority  of state agencies oversee both child care and adult day care CACFP  providers, and USDA\u2019s criteria for selecting providers for onsite reviews  focus on those providers receiving the highest reimbursement amounts.  According to regional officials, because CACFP serves a significantly  greater number of meals to children than to adults, providers receiving the  highest reimbursement amounts are those serving meals in child care  sites in the majority of states. Thus, federal onsite reviews of providers  serving meals to older adults in adult day care centers generally have  been limited.", "USDA\u2019s regional officials told us that because they have not done onsite  reviews at most adult day care centers recently, they lack information on  how the program is working in those centers. USDA officials in four of the  seven regional offices told us they receive few questions or requests for  technical assistance from state agencies or providers operating the  program in adult day care centers. However, our discussions with  providers in the four selected states suggest that they face challenges  operating the program in these centers and addressing the varying needs  of participants they serve, such as those with physical and mental  impairments, and may benefit from additional information or assistance.  USDA is statutorily required to review state agency and provider  compliance with regulations governing program administration and  operation of certain nutrition assistance programs, including CACFP.  Further, USDA guidance notes that its management evaluations are  critical for monitoring state agency program compliance and improving  program operations by providing a basis for assessing the administration  of the CACFP and developing solutions to challenges in program  operations. Without taking action to ensure on-site reviews of adult day  care centers participating in CACFP are conducted more consistently,  USDA may be missing an opportunity to identify and help address  challenges adult day care centers face in operating the program, such as  challenges meeting varied needs of participants. Such efforts could help  them better assess the extent to which centers are meeting the nutritional  needs of the older adults they serve and to better target technical  assistance.", "For USDA\u2019s CSFP, which provides monthly food packages to older  adults, USDA regional office oversight includes reviews of state agencies\u2019  monitoring of local providers and visits to local providers, covering all  states at least once every 3-5 years.

For example, state officials in one selected state we visited  told us they have large waiting lists in their state for the home-delivered  meal programs due to a higher demand for services. They indicated that,  in the absence of other changes, they will only be able to serve new  people through attrition of current program participants. One provider in  the same state said they have a waiting list of more than 12,000 older  adults for their home-delivered meal program. Another provider told us  they are currently serving about 10 percent of the older adult population in  their area, although the need for these services is greater, and they have  continually had a waiting list for their home-delivered meal program.", "Some providers have leveraged additional funding sources to decrease  waiting lists and expand the reach of their congregate and home- delivered meal programs. Specifically, in two of the four states we visited,  some providers said they have received additional funding to support  nutrition and other services for older adults through a local property tax\u2014 called a millage tax. In one of these states, a local provider told us that  the local millage tax provided $9.8 million for older adult services in 2018.  Officials noted that these funds allowed providers to add new meal routes  and decrease waiting lists for home-delivered meals, as well expand the  capacity of senior centers to serve more older adults through nutrition and  other programs.", "In three of the four selected states, some providers reported partnering  with various entities, including grocery stores, local farmers, and others to  obtain food at low or no cost or serve more older adults, which helped  them to meet the increased demand for the congregate and home- delivered meal programs. For example, in one state, the area agency on  aging that directly provides meals joined a larger consortium of  organizations to purchase food at a lower cost from a food vendor. In  another state we visited, a provider we spoke with reported that the  majority of its food for older adults\u2019 meals came from food donations provided by local grocery stores and food banks and through a program  in which local farmers dedicate some of their produce for donation.

Eight of the 14 congregate  and home-delivered meal providers across the selected states we visited  said they do not tailor meals to meet participants\u2019 special dietary needs\u2014 for example, due in part to limited resources and capacity. For example,  four providers told us it is cost prohibitive to tailor meals. At one site we  visited that does tailor meals, local officials told us that their vendor  charges more for tailored meals because of the additional work involved  to customize meals to meet the needs of participants with specific health  conditions. Another provider said that some chefs lack the skills needed  to prepare such meals. For example, the provider said that although  some older adults need mechanically soft or pureed meals because of  oral health issues, staff may lack the skills to produce those meals.  Federal restrictions on reimbursing liquid meals may make providing such  meals cost-prohibitive, according to officials in selected states. For  example, state and local officials and a provider in two selected states  said that program participants who are unable to chew, swallow, or digest  solid foods due to various health conditions, may need such meals, yet  these meals do not qualify for federal meal reimbursement. According to  HHS officials, while a liquid meal does not qualify for meal replacement,  states may use federal funds dedicated to providing nutrition education,  counseling, and other aging services to purchase these meals.", "Some of these program providers in the selected states used additional  funding sources to help them make meal accommodations for program  participants with special dietary needs, and HHS also funds awards that  can be used for this purpose. For example, an area agency in one  selected state we visited received a grant from a local foundation to  provide some of their home-delivered meal participants with special  dietary meals, including for those with renal conditions and diabetes for  up to 3 months. Similarly, another provider used a grant to provide liquid  meals to home-delivered meal participants who needed them. Since  2017, HHS has also awarded grants to support innovative projects that  enhance the quality, effectiveness, and outcomes of the congregate and  home-delivered meal programs, and some of the projects have focused  on providing meal accommodations for certain program participants. For  example, a grantee in one state used these grant funds to develop and  deliver modified meals appropriate for home-delivered meal participants  with reduced dental function.

For  example, milk is a federally-required component of breakfasts and  lunches served through the program, though officials from three selected  states said that milk can be problematic for older adults because many  are lactose-intolerant or do not like drinking milk. Further, officials in one  state said that the meal pattern includes a significant amount of  carbohydrates, which is inconsistent with the needs of older adults who  have diabetes. Although CACFP requires adult day care centers to serve  meals consistent with federal meal pattern requirements or a participant\u2019s  plan of care, which may include medically-prescribed meal  accommodations, state officials reported some older adults face barriers  to obtaining medical documentation of meal accommodation needs.  Specifically, officials from two selected states said that some participants  may not have access to medical providers, and officials from one of those  states explained that a visit to a medical provider is sometimes cost- prohibitive for those with limited incomes.", "Officials in two of the four selected states said adult day care meal  providers have used available federal options that allow older adults to  tailor their own meals to meet their nutritional needs, though officials also  noted that these options have limitations.

This  option allows adult participants, including older adults, to decline, for  example, up to two of the five meal components required with a  lunch\u2014milk, fruits or vegetables, grains, and meat or meat alternate.  According to USDA guidance, this option may reduce waste and give  adults more choices. However, officials in this state noted that  making choices is sometimes difficult and time-consuming for  program participants with cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer\u2019s  disease or dementia.", "State officials in another state said that the federal family-style meal  service option, which allows older adults to serve themselves from  communal platters of food with assistance from supervising adults, if  needed, also provides older adults with the ability to tailor meals to  meet their needs. However, state officials in this state noted this meal  service approach also creates challenges with feeding certain older  adults appropriately. For example, this approach makes it harder to  meet the needs of those with particular dietary or functional  requirements, such as those who have specific nutritional needs due  to chronic conditions or those with swallowing or chewing issues.", "State officials and adult day care providers across all four selected states  said that federal guidance for providing meals to older adults in adult day  care centers is limited, and providers in two of the states said they lack  information on ways to address some of the challenges associated with  providing meals that meet the nutritional needs of older adults in these  centers. For example, providers noted that information on promising  practices for serving the differing needs of older adults in these centers,  including those with special dietary needs and those with functional  limitations, would assist their efforts to meet participants\u2019 nutritional  needs. State officials or providers in all four selected states said that  FNS\u2019s efforts to provide guidance and trainings are more focused on the  child care component of the CACFP than the adult day care component.  USDA officials confirmed their efforts to provide guidance to meal  providers have been primarily focused on the child care side of the  program in light of the larger number of participants served.", "Although USDA provides some guidance and information to address the  adult component of the CACFP, some CACFP entities serving older  adults may not be aware of these resources, and information on  promising practices or other resources to help providers meet the varying  needs of older adults is more limited. USDA officials said CACFP  guidance and trainings address the implementation of adult meal pattern  requirements and existing flexibilities with these requirements, such as  allowable substitutions for milk. USDA also produced a handbook  specifically for adult day care centers in 2014 to help assist providers in  these centers. However, USDA officials said that awareness of existing  guidance and trainings available may be lacking, in part, because  turnover for CACFP providers is high and new providers may not be  aware of existing resources. Some providers also said that more  information on how to address the special dietary needs and functional  limitations of some participants would be helpful, as USDA\u2019s existing  guidance and trainings focus on standard adult meal pattern  requirements. For example, while the 2014 handbook includes  information on meal patterns and different serving methods to provide  meals, it does not include information specific to meeting the differing  needs of older adults in these centers. In October 2019, USDA officials  told us that they are in the process of updating this handbook to reflect new policies, guidance, and promising practices for addressing the needs  of older adults. USDA officials also stated that they are in the process of  reviewing a promising practice to address meal accommodations for older  adults with varying needs. USDA is responsible for providing training and  technical assistance to states in order to assist state agencies with  program management and facilitate effective operation of the program.

For  example, two food package providers we spoke with said they use other  methods of food delivery along with the food package such as a pantry or  grocery store-style model, which allows participants to come to a site and  choose from a variety of foods that meet the requirements (see fig. 7).  USDA also recently issued updated federal requirements for the type and  quantity of foods provided in the food package, which department officials  said provide more variety to be more useful to older adults.

Four of  the 14 providers of these programs reported that they struggle to offer  competitive wages and benefits, which hinders their ability to hire and  retain staff.", "To help overcome staffing constraints, some providers partnered with  various entities. For example, in all four selected states, providers of the  congregate and home-delivered meal programs established partnerships  with entities such as colleges and local businesses to solicit volunteers to  help with program operations. In one state, a provider partnered with a  local college\u2019s nursing program and students volunteered to assist with  assessments for home-delivered meal participants.

For example,  providers in three selected states said a lack of transportation options  prevents some older adults from visiting congregate meal sites as well as  food package distribution sites, as public transportation is not always  available and many older adult participants do not drive. According to  local officials in one state, transportation is also a challenge for the home- delivered meal program, particularly in rural areas, because the distance  between participants\u2019 homes affects the cost of delivering meals.  Similarly, officials at one local agency on aging said providers in its area  would like to serve more people, but are unable to add additional routes  because of transportation costs.", "To help mitigate transportation challenges and manage associated costs,  some providers in the selected states have adjusted meal services and  found alternative ways to transport clients to meal service sites. For  example, to help control transportation costs, three providers in two  selected states changed from delivering one hot meal daily to delivering  multiple frozen meals once a week to home-delivered meal participants.  In addition, one provider partnered with a local meal delivery service that  used FedEx to deliver 10 home-delivered meals every 2 weeks to  program participants. To help alleviate transportation challenges that  older adults face getting to meal sites, three providers in two states  partnered with private companies to provide participants with rides to and  from meal sites for a minimal fee. Another provider used grant funds they  received from their state to purchase vans they then used to provide older  adults with transportation to and from the meal sites.", "Some providers also reported challenges accommodating the varied  dietary preferences of different groups of older adults, as preferences  sometimes vary by age and cultural or ethnic background, and being  responsive to these preferences can increase the likelihood that meals  will help older adults meet their nutritional needs. For example, HHS  officials, as well as local providers in three out of the four selected states  said the dietary preferences of adults in their 60s sometimes vary greatly  from the preferences of adults in their 90s. Local officials in two states  said that providers of congregate and home-delivered meal programs in  their states noted that \u201colder old\u201d adults may prefer meals that include  meat and potatoes, while \u201cyounger old\u201d adults may prefer lighter meals,  such as those consisting of soups and salads.

For example, one congregate meal site we visited offered a lunch entree  choice of either meat and potatoes or a sandwich wrap with vegetables.  Another congregate meal site offered a hot lunch, plus a soup and salad  bar, in a restaurant-like setting. Providers also tried to incorporate certain  foods on their menus that reflect the cultural or ethnic preferences of  participants.

We conducted detailed reviews of these  studies to assess the soundness of the reported methods and the  credibility and reliability of the conclusions drawn by the authors, and  deemed them to be sufficiently credible, reliable, and methodologically  sound for the purposes of our report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Site Visits", "paragraphs": ["To help inform all of our research objectives and gather information about  nutrition assistance programs that provide meals and food packages to  older adults at the local level, we conducted visits to 25 local meal and  food distribution sites in four states: Arizona (5 sites), Louisiana (10 sites),  Michigan (6 sites), and Vermont (4 sites) between December 2018 and  March 2019. We interviewed officials from a variety of entities involved in  administering these programs in each of the states, including 20 state and  area agencies on aging and 20 local providers; observed meal services  and food distribution; and held conversations with older adult program  participants.", "We selected states and local sites within those states based on a high  percentage of adults 60 or older, and to ensure variation across the sites  in geographic location, urban and rural location, percentage of older  adults in poverty, and program provider and site type. We visited a wide  variety of site locations including, but not limited to, senior centers,  community centers, adult day care centers, and senior housing. Because  we relied on a nongeneralizable sample of sites and states, the views of  the entities we interviewed do not represent the views of all providers of  federal nutrition assistance programs providing meals and food packages  to older adults or participants in those programs.", "Prior to each selected state visit, we gathered information from state and  area agencies on aging responsible for administering these programs  using semi-structured interview questions. We collected information on  state and area agency on aging roles in administering nutrition assistance  programs for older adults, federal nutrition requirements in these  programs, oversight and monitoring of programs, partnerships to help  meet the nutritional needs of older adults, outreach efforts, assistance  from federal agencies, and challenges in administering the programs and  meeting the nutritional needs of the older adult populations served.", "At each site, we gathered information from local providers and  participants using semi-structured interview questions. We collected  information on program provider operations; characteristics of the  population served; efforts to meet the nutritional needs of the population  served, other nutrition-related services; challenges with meeting the  nutritional needs of the population and efforts to address them; outreach  efforts; and assistance received from regional, state, and federal  agencies.

In addition, we reviewed relevant studies conducted on behalf  of HHS that evaluated the impact of its nutrition assistance programs on  older adults\u2019 nutrition.
