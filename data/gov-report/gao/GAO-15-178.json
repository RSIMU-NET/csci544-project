Prior to the act, FEMA paid up to 90 percent of the mitigation  costs for severe repetitive loss properties, up to 100 percent for repetitive  loss properties, and up to 75 percent for all other mitigation projects.", "FEMA has since incorporated parts of the SRL and RFC programs into its  Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Program and updated its cost-sharing  guidance. FEMA officials told us that the elimination of the repetitive and  severe repetitive loss programs as independent programs and the cost- sharing changes were positive improvements to NFIP under the Biggert- Waters Act. FEMA officials stated that combining the programs simplified the application process and program administration and the  new cost-sharing structure further encourages mitigation for properties.  Given that severe repetitive loss properties are the most burdensome in  terms of expenses for NFIP, this updated cost-sharing structure is  expected to help reduce outlays.", "FEMA still needs to institute an important mitigation assistance  requirement under the Biggert-Waters Act. Specifically, FEMA has not yet  developed a process or guidance for providing mitigation assistance  grants directly to policyholders, as now allowed under Biggert-Waters Act  Section 225(a)(3). Under this section, if FEMA determines that a state or  community cannot manage a grant, it can provide the grant directly to  policyholders. The act did not establish a time frame for completing this  requirement. According to FEMA, it needs to establish criteria for  determining when a state or community cannot manage a grant, and such  criteria need to go through a rulemaking process, which can take some  time. FEMA officials noted that FEMA has never provided mitigation  assistance grants directly to policyholders. According to FEMA officials,  by providing mitigation assistance grants directly to policyholders,  individuals who live in a state that does not participate in NFIP will now  have the opportunity to participate in NFIP\u2019s grant programs.", "FEMA, along with representatives from almost all of the organizations (9  out of 10) we interviewed, emphasized the importance of mitigation in  terms of its potential to reduce flood risk and NFIP\u2019s financial exposure.  Representatives from seven of these organizations noted that mitigation  was expensive and that it needed to be made more attractive for  policyholders and communities. However, as we previously reported,  demand for mitigation assistance funding has exceeded available funding  levels. As shown in table 2, since the enactment of the Biggert-Waters  Act funding has increased for the FMA program, due in part to the  incorporation of the SRL and RFC programs into FMA. However, funding  has been reduced for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, which funds  pre-disaster mitigation programs intended to reduce flood risks to  populations and structures.", "HFIAA contains additional requirements that pertain to FEMA\u2019s mitigation  activities. HFIAA Section 14 requires FEMA to take into account flood  mitigation activities when estimating premiums. FEMA estimated that this  section was 10 percent complete as of December 2014 (see fig. 4).  FEMA officials said that they were at the beginning stages of considering  a process for accounting for such activities. The implementation of this  requirement should make mitigation activities more attractive to  policyholders because rates would be adjusted based upon mitigation  measures. HFIAA did not establish a due date for completing this  requirement. As of December 2014, FEMA anticipated completing this  requirement in fiscal year 2015 or later.", "HFIAA Section 26 requires that FEMA establish guidelines for alternative  methods of mitigation (other than building elevation) to reduce flood risk  to residential buildings that cannot be elevated due to their structural  characteristics. HFIAA requires that the guidance be established by  March 2015. FEMA estimated that this section was 30 percent complete  as of December 2014. According to FEMA officials, FEMA has created an  internal working group to start developing related guidelines and hired a  contractor in August 2014 to assist. FEMA\u2019s working group and the  contractor are in the process of creating guidelines for alternative  methods of mitigation. Some options they are considering for alternative  methods of mitigation are elevating infrastructure critical to the property  when the property itself cannot be elevated (for example, heating and air  conditioning systems), constructing small barriers, and using flood- resistant materials in construction. The contractor is also analyzing the  effectiveness of each type of alternative mitigation measure. After the  analysis is completed, FEMA actuaries will adjust rates based upon  alternative mitigation methods, and guidelines on the methods will be  released to the public, as required by HFIAA.", "FEMA officials stated that they faced challenges determining the long- term effects of alternative mitigation, as well as the appropriate discount  to apply to premiums for such activities. According to FEMA officials, it is  possible to determine if an alternative mitigation method is designed and  installed appropriately; however, it is more challenging to ensure that the  system is maintained over time to warrant a continued discount in flood  insurance premiums.

HFIAA describes the advocate\u2019s duties as educating  policyholders about various issues and assisting them in understanding  procedural requirements, as well as coordinating outreach and education  with local communities, among other things. HFIAA did not establish a  due date for completing this requirement. FEMA estimated that this  requirement was 55 percent complete as of December 2014 (see fig. 5).  FEMA and representatives from three of the 10 organizations we  interviewed said that the establishment of the advocate was one of the  key changes made by HFIAA and emphasized its importance.", "In mid-December 2014, FEMA established an interim Office of the Flood  Insurance Advocate, which is led by an acting flood insurance advocate  (effective Dec. 22, 2014). FEMA officials said that until funding is  available to establish a permanent office, the interim office would  leverage existing resources, and a number of FEMA employees would be  detailed to the interim office. The interim office is to begin work on  providing specialized assistance to citizens and policyholders on NFIP  issues, as well as regional mapping outreach and education support. The  acting advocate and staff will address specific public inquiries or concerns  regarding NFIP processes. In addition, the acting advocate will also  develop a long-term regional mapping outreach and education strategy  with the goal of maximizing public support for NFIP activities. FEMA  officials stated that the flood insurance advocate will be an independent  office within FEMA and have direct access to the FEMA administrator on  an advisory basis.", "FEMA spent several months developing options to implement this  requirement. FEMA detailed one of FIMA\u2019s executive officers to take the  lead on producing the concept of operations. FEMA officials told us that  they also had held discussions with internal and external stakeholders to gain input  on the position\u2019s proposed structure and duties, analyzed data from FEMA call centers to identify important topics for engaged with congressional leaders to identify issues from  constituents about NFIP, and benchmarked with other federal agencies with advocacy offices to  determine best practices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Notifications", "paragraphs": ["HFIAA enacted requirements intended to improve the way FEMA  communicates NFIP insurance rates and flood risks to policyholders and  others.

It also requires FEMA to report to  Congress, no later than June 2014, on the feasibility of releasing  property-level policy and claims data and how the release of these data  may assist policyholders and insurers in understanding how FEMA  determines actuarial premium rates and assesses flood risk. In response  to HFIAA Section 31, FEMA had begun issuing rate change notifications.  FEMA officials told us that the 6-month notification requirement did not  pose challenges, as they had taken similar actions in the past and had a  similar informal agreement with WYOs prior to HFIAA. For example, in  October 2014, FEMA publicly issued guidance implementing certain  HFIAA rate changes that would take effect 6 months later in April 2015.", "In September 2014, about 2 months after the deadline established by  HFIAA, FEMA issued the required report to Congress on the feasibility of  releasing property-level policy and claims data and establishing  guidelines for releasing these data required by Section 31. FEMA  reported that NFIP collects and maintains property-level policy and claims  data containing some information that is governed by privacy law.  FEMA also noted that its current guidelines for releasing this information  satisfy the HFIAA requirement. However, FEMA officials stated that  releasing individual policy and claims data would not help policyholders  and insurers understand how FEMA determines actuarial premium rates  and assesses flood risk. FEMA explained that full-risk premiums were not  based on loss experience due to the large variability of flood losses.  Rather NFIP rate setting is based on several components, including a risk  component that varies based on the flood risk profile of an entire risk  class, and not specific properties.", "HFIAA Section 28 requires FEMA to clearly communicate full flood risk  determinations to individual property owners regardless of whether their  premiums are full actuarial rates, and FEMA has begun evaluating how to  implement this provision but cited challenges. FEMA officials noted that in  order to give a property owner a specific full-risk rate, for example, FEMA  would need an elevation certification, which can be expensive. FEMA  officials estimate that obtaining elevation certificates can cost  policyholders from about $500 to $2,000 or more. As discussed earlier,  FEMA does not have elevation data for many properties as it does not  require certain policyholders to obtain elevation certificates. We have  previously recommended that FEMA develop and implement a plan to  obtain flood risk information needed to determine full-risk rates for  subsidized properties.multiyear process of determining how to collect elevation data and  whether available BFE databases could serve as a proxy for elevation  certificates at the individual property level, for the limited geographies  where such data are available.

FEMA officials said that they did not have sufficient time or  funding to complete the study and noted that the legislation had also  asked them to determine the economic impact of removing all premium  discounts from NFIP, something they had thus far been unable to do.  FEMA officials cited their lack of elevation data for structures affected by  grandfathering and subsidization. The lack of these data means that full- risk rates for many properties cannot be calculated, and thus, the  economic impact of removing premium discounts for subsidized and  grandfathered policies cannot be determined. In addition, FEMA cited  data challenges related to understanding how much a policyholder could  afford\u2014for instance, FEMA does not have direct access to information on  policyholders\u2019 incomes.", "HFIAA Section 16 amended the Biggert-Waters Act Section 236 study to  permit additional funding ($2.5 million) for the draft affordability study and  extended the time for completing it until September 2015, and HFIAA  Section 9 permitted FEMA to contract with another federal agency to  complete the study. HFIAA Section 9 also required FEMA to prepare a  draft affordability framework to be provided to Congress no later than 18  months after the study was completed.

Second, in September 2015 NAS  will deliver a report on approaches that could be used in conducting an  affordability study, taking into consideration the lack of data. The study  will also include results from a pilot affordability study for the state of  North Carolina, which has readily available elevation data on structures.

We compared FEMA\u2019s processes for managing its  implementation of Biggert-Waters Act and HFIAA requirements to  relevant federal internal control standards. There are five internal control  standards\u2014control environment, risk assessment, control activities,  information and communications, and monitoring\u2014that are used to  assess federal agencies and programs. Given the smaller scope of the  activity being reviewed\u2014i.e., a specific process within a program rather  than the federal program itself\u2014we limited our comparison to the three  federal internal controls standards that we determined to be most  appropriate\u2014risk assessment, control activities, and information and  communications.
