The federal judiciary\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget is about $3.3 billion, and on September 30, 1995, it employed about 28,000 persons. For fiscal year 1997, the federal judiciary has requested congressional approval of a budget of about $3.6 billion, including a staff of about 31,000.", "Governance of the federal judiciary is substantially decentralized. The Judicial Conference of the United States, a body of 27 judges over which the Chief Justice of the United States presides, is the federal judiciary\u2019s principal policymaking body. The Conference\u2019s statutory responsibilities include considering administrative problems of the courts and making recommendations to the various courts to promote uniformity of management procedures and the expeditious conduct of court business. The Conference conducts its work principally through about 25 committees. In September 1993, the Judicial Conference established within its Budget Committee an Economy Subcommittee and charged it with reviewing judiciary operations to achieve greater fiscal responsibility, accountability, and efficiency.", "Created by Congress in 1939, AOUSC provides a wide range of administrative, legal, and program support services to the federal courts, including budgeting, space and facilities, automation, statistical analysis and reports, financial audit, and program and management evaluation. The AOUSC Director serves as the administrative officer for the courts under the supervision and direction of the Judicial Conference. AOUSC\u2019s staff supports the work of the Conference and its committees, including the Economy Subcommittee. AOUSC provides analyses and recommendations on resource allocations to the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference, which has final authority for resource allocations.", "Authorized by the same statute that created AOUSC, each of the 12 geographic judicial circuits has a judicial council with the authority to issue all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice within their circuits. Within each circuit, the Circuit Executive, whose duties vary by circuit, may have responsibility for conducting studies of the business and administration of the courts within the circuit. Neither Congress nor the Judicial Conference has formally charged chief judges with overall responsibility for the administration of their courts. Nevertheless, according to AOUSC, the chief judges of the appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts are generally expected to exercise whatever administrative authority is necessary for the effective and efficient operation of their individual courts.", "AOUSC program reviews, including on-site reviews of local court operations, are only one means by which the federal judiciary may assess its highly decentralized operations. The Judicial Conference of the United States, the circuit judicial councils, the chief judge of each court, and court unit executives, such as Chief Probation Officers or clerks of court, may all request AOUSC studies and support or initiate their own reviews and assessments. Such studies may be undertaken by AOUSC staff alone, in conjunction with staff from local courts, or by outside experts and consultants, such as the National Academy of Public Administration. Our work focused on AOUSC\u2019s reviews and assessments, principally on-site reviews of local court operations.", "The organization of this oversight function within AOUSC has varied since responsibility for court audits and disbursement of judicial funds was transferred from the Department of Justice to AOUSC in 1975. After this transfer, AOUSC created an audit unit to perform routine, cyclical financial audits and management reviews of the courts. Before 1985, this unit reviewed the finances and programs of the courts. Several AOUSC auditors, management analysts, and attorneys conducted the reviews, visiting a district for about 2 to 3 weeks interviewing court personnel and reviewing records. Following an exit conference, the review team prepared a report that usually included recommendations. In 1985, AOUSC placed the financial and program review functions on different review cycles. Soon after the current AOUSC Director\u2019s appointment in July 1985, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger established a committee of four judges to study AOUSC and provide advice on improving the agency. According to the AOUSC Director, judges and court officials whom the committee surveyed said AOUSC was too bureaucratic and controlling in its relationship with the courts. At about the same time, judges were telling the AOUSC Director that AOUSC\u2019s management review process should be more sensitive to matters that are \u201cexclusively the concern of the courts.\u201d", "In 1988, the AOUSC Director discontinued the Office of Audit and Review, created an Office of Audit to conduct court financial reviews; delegated program review responsibilities to the program units; and established an evaluation unit, now known as the Office of Program Assessment (OPA), to oversee and coordinate program review efforts and to carry out special reviews and investigations. AOUSC\u2019s Office of Audit is to conduct routine, cyclical financial reviews and oversee the work of contract financial auditors. Virtually all AOUSC offices have conducted reviews, special studies, evaluations, and surveys, which varied considerably by functional area. These reviews, often undertaken at the request of individual courts, have covered such issues as costs, budgets, spending, workload, outputs, and program implementation results. Some reviews have resulted in recommendations for improvements in such areas as processes and practices and the use of resources or technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In responding to your request, our objective was to review AOUSC\u2019s program assessment and efficiency promotion efforts regarding federal court operations. These operations include such court functions as the clerks of court offices, probation and pretrial services, judicial chambers management support, and statistical reporting. Generally, our review focused on AOUSC oversight activities conducted during fiscal years 1992 through 1994.", "Our approach was threefold. First, we met with top-level AOUSC officials and were briefed on AOUSC\u2019s oversight and management assistance activities. We also met with managers from AOUSC program divisions that conducted program reviews and provided assistance to local courts to discuss oversight and management assistance functions and activities. Senior AOUSC management officials attended most of our meetings with managers from AOUSC\u2019s program divisions. We reviewed manuals and other documentation on the operations and responsibilities of AOUSC\u2019s management and program offices and divisions and AOUSC\u2019s assessment and efficiency promotion activities.", "Second, using data maintained by the OPA, we identified 376 on-site reviews (excluding financial audits, judgeship surveys, and other nonprogrammatic reviews) conducted by selected program divisionsduring fiscal years 1992 through 1994 and requested reports on all of them. However, 244 of the reviews listed either did not result in written reports, were erroneous entries, had reports that AOUSC could not locate, were duplicate entries in OPA\u2019s data, were never completed, or had reports that were still in draft form when we requested them. In the end, we reviewed 93 of the 132 written reports available to determine how the process followed in these reviews compared to generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We used a data collection instrument to systematically collect information from the program review reports, including the office that conducted the review, the person or persons who initiated the review and why, issues addressed, problems noted, efficient and effective practices identified, recommendations made, information available on the implementation of any recommendations, and standards and guidelines used for identifying problems and/or efficient and effective practices.", "Finally, we interviewed judges and court officials from a selection of appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts plus probation offices in a judgmentally selected cross-section of courts of different sizes in three regions of the country\u2014the Northeast, Midwest, and South. We determined court unit size on the basis of fiscal year 1993 workload. For appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts, we used cases filed (rounded to the nearest hundred) as our measure of workload. For probation offices we used the total number of persons under supervision in each probation office (rounded to the nearest hundred). We also interviewed the chairs of four Judicial Conference committees: the Committee on the AOUSC (current and former chairs), the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management, the Committee on Judicial Resources, and the Budget Committee\u2019s Economy Subcommittee (one of the co-chairs).", "We did our work primarily in Washington, D.C., between October 1994 and March 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. One or more senior AOUSC officials monitored our discussions with Judicial Conference Committee chairs and most of our meetings with the assistant directors of AOUSC\u2019s program offices; however, we believe we were able to independently obtain needed information from the chairs and assistant directors. We obtained written comments from AOUSC on a draft of this report.

Program and financial reviews are one means of providing judges and managers information on the efficiency and effectiveness of court operations. To ensure that the information from these reviews is reliable, it is important that those conducting the reviews follow generally accepted government auditing standards. From 1988 until 1995, AOUSC\u2019s program review process was decentralized and unstructured and did not always follow these standards. In November 1995, OPA issued written standards for conducting program assessments that, with two exceptions relating to reviewer independence and preparation of reports, track the generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards", "paragraphs": ["Certain laws, regulations, and contracts require auditors who audit federal organizations, programs, activities, and functions to follow the generally accepted government auditing standards promulgated by the Comptroller General.

However, prior to November 1995, AOUSC had not prescribed uniform standards for its nonfinancial review activities.", "The generally accepted government auditing standards are broad statements of auditors\u2019 responsibilities. They relate to both financial and performance audits and include general standards, which relate to the qualifications of the staff, the audit organization\u2019s and the individual auditor\u2019s independence, the exercise of due professional care in conducting the audit and in preparing related reports, and the presence of quality controls; fieldwork standards, which relate to the planning and supervision of the actual work, examination of compliance with laws and regulations, an understanding of management controls in place, and the quality of the evidence gathered during the audit; and reporting standards, which relate to the requirement for written reports and recommendations, the timeliness and contents of reports, the way in which reports are presented, and the distribution of reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Until 1995, AOUSC\u2019s Decentralized Oversight Activities Lacked Structure", "paragraphs": ["Although the judiciary is not specifically required by statute to follow the generally accepted government auditing standards, AOUSC has followed these standards for its financial audits. AOUSC officials told us they believed the standards were generally appropriate for nonfinancial reviews as well.", "AOUSC\u2019s financial audit responsibilities are assigned by statute and follow the generally accepted government auditing standards. Until November 1995, however, AOUSC did not require its program offices and divisions to follow standards similar to the generally accepted government auditing standards in conducting program reviews. Each office and division had wide latitude to determine how it would review local court operations, the standards it would use during a review, and whether it would produce a written report. Program units adopted a variety of review approaches, ranging from conducting regular program reviews to having no identifiable review functions. The basic approach for most divisions and offices was one of consultation, with most reviews done at the request of the local court.", "The generally accepted government auditing standards require that a written report be prepared to communicate the results of the review to all who could act on the report\u2019s recommendations. According to OPA data, 376 program reviews were conducted during fiscal years 1992 through 1994. However, according to OPA officials, only 132 of these resulted in written reports. Of these 132 written reports, 90 (68 percent) were prepared by the Federal Corrections and Supervision Division. One unit, the Contract and Services Division, did not produce reports as a matter of policy. According to OPA data, this division undertook 104 reviews during the 3-year period we reviewed, and it neither required nor produced written reports on the results of its reviews. A 1993 OPA assessment of the Division\u2019s review process noted that its lack of written review results deprived current and successor division management and staff of valuable information about court practices that could help them identify trends, evaluate the success of program changes, and propose new initiatives. In contrast, the Federal Corrections and Supervision Division scheduled routine reviews of probation and pretrial offices, compared their performance to written policies and standards, and produced written reports of the reviews about 90 percent of the time.", "During the period of our review, AOUSC had no requirement that program units follow up on the implementation of any recommendations made to local courts. We found that follow-up on recommendations was inconsistent. Although the Federal Corrections and Supervision Division generally tracked the implementation of recommendations, most other divisions did not. AOUSC cannot compel a local court to comply with its recommendations. One court resisted upgrading its telephone system for 10 years because it preferred to acquire its system from a specific vendor in a sole-source procurement. AOUSC would not approve a noncompetitive procurement but neither did it require the court to upgrade its costly system, with the court remaining on an expensive lease. The court has only recently replaced its telephone system through a competitive procurement. AOUSC estimated that the new system would save about $133,000 per year. If the new system\u2019s future annual savings had been achieved during the 10 years of the disagreement, the local court and, thus, the judiciary, could have avoided about $1 million in costs. AOUSC officials said such an impasse is unlikely to recur in today\u2019s budget environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent AOUSC Initiatives to Improve Program Review Process", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that its decentralized review process had resulted in reviews of uneven coverage and quality, AOUSC, through OPA, issued standards in November 1995 for conducting program assessments that, with two exceptions, track the generally accepted government auditing standards. The new standards require some type of written record of the results of any review and require follow-up of any reported significant findings and recommendations. OPA also issued a study guide to help AOUSC program unit staff select court units for review and conduct the reviews, and OPA plans to provide training on the new standards to AOUSC personnel in 1996. Finally, AOUSC has directed each program division to develop and share with OPA an internal assessment plan and to provide OPA with a copy of all assessment reports. However, the new OPA standards do not appear to adequately cover two issues in the generally accepted government auditing standards issued by the Comptroller General: independence of the reviewer and preparation of formal reports.", "Concerning organizational independence, the generally accepted standards state that program reviewers should be organizationally located outside the staff or line management function of the unit being reviewed. OPA\u2019s standards call for review team members to be organizationally independent only \u201cto the extent feasible.\u201d In commenting on the standard, OPA adds that in cases where a review team is not organizationally independent, consideration should be given by management to having a peer review team evaluate the report prior to its issuance.", "Concerning preparation of formal reports, the generally accepted standard is that reviewers are to prepare written reports communicating the results of each review. The standard points out that written reports (1) communicate the results of reviews to officials at all levels of government, (2) make the results less susceptible to misunderstanding, (3) make the results available for public inspection, and (4) facilitate follow-up to determine whether appropriate corrective actions have been taken. OPA\u2019s standards, however, allow for formal and informal reports, such as trip reports or memoranda to the files. The OPA standards state that management should require formal reports only when the reviewed organization requests one, significant findings are discovered during the review, or follow-up is required on any of the significant findings and recommendations. Copies of each completed report are to be sent to OPA, which is to summarize them for the Administrative Office Committee of the Judicial Conference and as appropriate for senior management of AOUSC.", "AOUSC has begun to coordinate its review activities. OPA has established a network of 35 program review officers within AOUSC, which is to meet every 1 to 3 months to discuss assessment issues. These officers are also to serve as focal points for reviews within their respective AOUSC program areas. During fiscal year 1996, AOUSC\u2019s automated travel software is to be modified to permit OPA to monitor on-site visits by AOUSC program units, including information on the purpose of the trips and the locations to be visited.", "OPA has also initiated a series of \u201ctriage\u201d visits to local courts in which a team visits for 2 to 3 days to discuss local operations and AOUSC\u2019s relationship to the local court. The goal is to provide broad coverage of court operations and to ensure that program and administrative division reviews are complemented by broader based surveys and reviews. Selection criteria include (1) locations having comparatively low recent review activity by the key program areas; (2) statistical indicators, such as the presence of unusually high- or low-cost operations, unusual workload patterns or case mix, or case dispositions substantially different from national averages; (3) change of chief judge; (4) change of court clerk; (5) geographical factors; and (6) special request and others. Prior to these visits, OPA is to develop a profile of the court by collecting a variety of workload and budgetary data on the local court, plus copies of prior reviews by AOUSC units. From these triage reports, OPA plans to develop a catalogue of common issues. As of May 1, 1996, OPA had completed triage reviews of six district courts and had two reviews under way.", "These actions, if consistently implemented, should help address many of the weaknesses in the previous program review process. However, AOUSC standards fall short of the generally accepted auditing standards in that they do not require (1) program assessors to be independent of the unit they are assessing or (2) that assessment reports be distributed to all officials who can act on the findings and recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Promote Efficient Practices", "paragraphs": ["As an effort to reduce spending, in fiscal year 1996 the federal judiciary requested funding for only 86 percent of the staff it estimated would be needed to handle the expected workload. AOUSC officials estimated that the judiciary\u2019s appropriation for salaries and expenses request of about $2.6 billion would have been $139 million higher if the judiciary had requested funds to staff expected workload at 100 percent of staff needed, as determined by staffing formulas. To assist the various courts and administrative units in operating within this constrained budget, the judiciary has established two complementary focal points for identifying, disseminating, and incorporating more efficient ways of doing business.", "First, in 1993 the Judicial Conference established an Economy Subcommittee within its Budget Committee to (1) review the judiciary\u2019s budget submission, (2) initiate and pursue studies about ways to economize while continuing to provide a consistently high quality of justice, and (3) be an \u201chonest broker\u201d of ideas relative to economy and efficiency.

In 1992, at the request of the Judicial Resources Committee, AOUSC established the task force when it identified wide variations in the work processes and use of staff in district court clerks\u2019 offices. In April 1993, the task force, composed of judges and court unit executives, developed a list of potentially efficient practices that were circulated to all district court chief judges for consideration and possible adoption. This list addressed such areas as jury and personnel management, and space and facilities.", "In coordination with the Judicial Conference\u2019s various program committees, the Economy Subcommittee has sponsored studies to identify better practices. AOUSC created a support office for the Subcommittee, which has compiled a database of better practices, such as cost containment ideas, including those identified by the District Court Efficiencies Task Force.  However, the database can be accessed only by the support office staff. Thus, to use the database to identify ideas about how to operate more efficiently, local courts must make a specific request. The Economy Subcommittee is also to serve as a critical reviewer of the budget requests of the program areas represented by each Judicial Conference committee, such as Defender Services or Automation and Technology. Although the Subcommittee can use these reviews as an opportunity to encourage the adoption of more efficient practice, it cannot require their adoption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work Measurement", "paragraphs": ["The Judicial Resources Committee, in conjunction with the Economy Subcommittee, directed AOUSC to undertake a comprehensive program to ensure that greater efficiencies are incorporated in the staffing formulas, which are based on a work measurement methodology. In response, in 1994, a group of court unit executives, working with AOUSC, undertook a study that resulted in the creation of the methods analysis program (MAP).Managed by the Analytical Services Office (ASO), the program analyzes workload flows, processes, and methods in order to identify better, more efficient practices.", "For each organization reviewed (such as the clerk of court or probation office), ASO is to develop an overall analysis of the functions performed (such as case intake in the clerk of court office) and a detailed documentation and analysis of the work processes used to accomplish that function. The goal is to identify tasks that can be eliminated, transferred, or done more efficiently. The program includes incentives for local court units to adopt the better practices identified by the analysis. After a better practice has been identified and approved, courts will be encouraged, but not required, to adopt it. After several years, the staffing formula used to allocate staff to local courts is to be revised to reflect the effect of the better practices. To encourage immediate adoption of any practices that reduce costs, local courts may keep a portion of any savings they achieve through adoption of the practices. ASO began applying the program with probation offices and plans to review all the major functions of appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts. It recently completed a study of the case opening function in district and bankruptcy clerks\u2019 offices.", "According to AOUSC officials, there are a variety of other ways in which information on better practices may be shared within the judiciary. For example, judges and other court personnel may share information on better practices in national and regional meetings, such as the meetings of AOUSC advisory groups, which include personnel from local courts.

OPA\u2019s standards allow AOUSC program and court staff to review programs they are responsible for administering. This is inconsistent with the generally accepted standard.
