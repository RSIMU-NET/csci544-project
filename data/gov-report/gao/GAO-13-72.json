Most coal produced in the United States is used to generate electricity. In 2011, 1,387 coal-fueled electricity generating units produced about 42 percent of the nation's electricity. After decades of growth, U.S. coal production and consumption have fallen, primarily due to declines in the use of coal to generate electricity.", "According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), using coal to generate electricity is associated with health and environmental concerns such as emissions of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to respiratory illnesses, and carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to climate change. In response to recent environmental regulations and changing market conditions, such as the recent decrease in the price of natural gas, power companies may retire some units, which could affect the coal fleet's generating capacity--the ability to generate electricity--and the amount of electricity generated from coal. Power companies may also retrofit some units by installing controls to reduce pollutants.", "GAO was asked to examine (1) how the fleet of coal-fueled electricity generating units may change in the future in terms of its generating capacity and other aspects and (2) the future use of coal to generate electricity in the United States and key factors that could affect it. GAO conducted a statistical analysis of plans for retiring coal-fueled units, interviewed stakeholders, and reviewed information on industry plans and long-term forecasts by EIA and others. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Retirements of older units, retrofits of existing units with pollution controls, and the construction of some new coal-fueled units are expected to significantly change the coal-fueled electricity generating fleet, making it capable of emitting lower levels of pollutants than the current fleet but reducing its future electricity generating capacity. Two broad trends are affecting power companies' decisions related to coal-fueled generating units--recent environmental regulations and changing market conditions, such as the recent decrease in the price of natural gas. Regarding retirements, forecasts GAO reviewed based on current policies project that power companies may retire 15 to 24 percent of coal-fueled generating capacity by 2035--an amount consistent with GAO's analysis. GAO's statistical analysis, examining data on power companies that have announced plans to retire coal-fueled units, found that these power companies are more likely to retire units that are older, smaller, and more polluting. For example, the units companies plan to retire emitted an average of twice as much sulfur dioxide per unit of fuel used in 2011 as units that companies do not plan to retire. Based on the characteristics of the units companies plan to retire, GAO estimated additional capacity that may retire. In total, GAO identified 15 to 18 percent of coal-fueled capacity that power companies either plan to retire or that GAO estimated may retire--an amount consistent with the forecasts GAO reviewed. Regarding retrofits, the coal-fueled generating fleet may also become less polluting in the future as power companies install controls on many remaining units. Regarding new coal-fueled units, these are likely to be less polluting as they must incorporate advanced technologies to reduce emissions of regulated pollutants. Coal-fueled capacity may decline in the future as less capacity is expected to be built than is expected to retire.", "According to stakeholders and three long-term forecasts GAO reviewed, coal is generally expected to remain a key fuel source for U.S. electricity generation in the future, but coal's share as a source of electricity may continue to decline. For example, in its forecast based on current policies, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the amount of electricity generated using coal is expected to remain relatively constant through 2035, but it forecasts that the share of coal-fueled electricity generation will decline from 42 percent in 2011 to 38 percent in 2035. Available information suggests that the future U.S. use of coal may be determined by several key factors, including the price of natural gas and environmental regulations. For example, available information suggests that the price of coal compared with other fuel sources will influence how economically attractive it is to use coal to generate electricity. EIA assessed several scenarios of future fuel prices and forecasts that coal's share of U.S. electricity generation will fall to 30 percent in 2035 if natural gas prices are low or 40 percent if natural gas prices are high. In addition, some stakeholders told GAO that the future use of coal could be significantly affected if existing environmental regulations become more stringent or if additional environmental regulations are issued. For example, EIA forecasts that two hypothetical future policies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector by 46 percent and 76 percent would result in coal's share of U.S. electricity generation falling to 16 and 4 percent in 2035, respectively.", "EPA provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Coal is a key domestic fuel source and an important contributor to the  U.S. economy.

For example, according to EPA data,  coal-fueled electricity generating units are among the largest emitters of  sulfur dioxide (SO) and nitrogen oxides (NO), which have been linked to  respiratory illnesses and acid rain. EPA recently proposed or finalized  several regulations, as required or authorized, that aim to address certain  health or environmental impacts associated with coal-fueled electricity  generating units. In response to these regulations, power companies  might retrofit some units by installing controls to reduce pollutants or by  taking other steps to reduce adverse impacts. When it is not economic to  take these actions, power companies may retire some units, which could  affect coal-fueled generating capacity and the amount of electricity  actually generated from coal. We recently reported on the price and  reliability implications of key recent EPA regulations.

Our objectives for this report were to examine what available information  indicates about: (1) how the nation\u2019s fleet of coal-fueled electricity  generating units may change in the future in terms of its generating  capacity and other aspects and (2) the use of coal to generate electricity  in the United States in the future and key factors that could affect it.", "To examine how the coal-fueled generating fleet may change, we used  data from Ventyx Velocity Suite, a proprietary database containing  consolidated energy and emissions data from EIA, EPA, and other  sources. We used data as of July 27, 2012, to describe characteristics of  coal-fueled electricity generating units and to provide information on  power companies\u2019 plans to retire coal-fueled units and build new ones.  Such information reflects publicly reported plans as identified by Ventyx.  As plans may change, the actual number and characteristics of future  retirements and new construction of coal-fueled units may differ from  what is represented in Ventyx as of July 2012. To assess the types of  units that may be retired, we carried out a statistical analysis of units  owned by power companies that have announced plans to retire coal- fueled units. We analyzed various characteristics including characteristics  of the unit (i.e., size and age) and the characteristics of the power  company that owns the unit (i.e., whether it is traditionally regulated or  operates in a restructured market). We then examined units owned by  companies that have not announced any planned retirements in order to  estimate how many of those units companies may consider retiring. Our  statistical analysis did not examine the amount of electricity that may be  generated at coal-fueled units in the future. Appendix I provides further  information about our statistical analysis.

Appendix II  summarizes the scenarios we examined. While long-term forecasts are  subject to inherent uncertainties, we found the EIA, IEA and IHS Global  Insight forecasts to be reasonable for describing what is known about the  potential future use of coal to generate electricity. To respond to both  objectives, we reviewed available literature, including studies by federal  agencies and research organizations, and summarized the results of  semistructured interviews with a nonprobability sample of 36  stakeholders. Stakeholders included representatives from power  companies, a coal company, and nongovernmental organizations, and  officials from federal and state agencies. We selected these stakeholders  to be broadly representative of differing perspectives on these issues  based on recommendations from agencies and industry associations,  along with other information. Because we used a nonprobability sample,  the views of these stakeholders are not generalizable to all potential  stakeholders, but they provide illustrative examples of views. To provide  information on recent electricity industry trends, we summarized historical  data from EIA. To assess the reliability of Ventyx and EIA historical data,  we reviewed existing documentation, interviewed Ventyx and EIA staff,  consulted with agency officials and other knowledgeable parties,  conducted some electronic testing, and compared data in Ventyx to  information obtained from several power companies and regional  transmission organizations.

U.S. coal production generally increased  since 1960 and reached its highest level in 2008. Advancements in  mining technology and a shift to using surface mines to a greater extent  than underground mines has boosted coal\u2019s overall productivity and  enabled production to increase even as the number of workers  decreased. In 2011, half as many workers produced 24 percent more coal  than in 1985, as shown in figure 1. Data from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics indicate that about 86,200 people were employed in coal mining  in the United States in 2011.", "In the United States, coal is primarily used to generate electricity\u2014over  90 percent of coal was used to generate about 42 percent of electricity in  2011. The amount of electricity generated using coal has generally  increased since the 1960s, but decreased recently due to a combination  of a decline in overall electricity demand, shifts in the relative prices of  fuels, and other reasons. (See fig. 2.) Meanwhile, coal\u2019s share of total  electricity generation has fluctuated over time. EIA has stated that several  factors, including low oil prices during the late 1960s\u2014which served to  increase electricity generation from oil\u2014and the oil price shocks of the  1970s have influenced the mix of fuel sources used to produce electricity.", "Two broad trends\u2014recent environmental regulations and changing  market conditions\u2014are affecting power companies\u2019 decisions related to  coal-fueled electricity generating units.

One of the most significant regulations in terms of EPA\u2019s estimated  benefits and costs, EPA\u2019s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, establishes  emissions limitations on mercury and other toxic pollutants. Mercury is a  toxic element, and human intake of mercury, for example, through  consumption of fish that ingested the mercury, has been linked to a wide  range of health ailments. In particular, mercury can harm fetuses and  cause neurological disorders in children, resulting in, among other things,  impaired cognitive abilities. Other toxic metals emitted from power plants,  such as arsenic, chromium, and nickel can cause cancer.

Key among these has been the recent decrease in the price of natural  gas, which has made it more attractive for power companies to build new  gas-fueled electricity generating units and to utilize existing units more. In  addition, slow expected growth in demand for electricity in some areas  has decreased the need for new generating units. Power companies may  weigh the costs of any needed investments compared with the benefits of  continuing to generate electricity at a particular unit. When the costs  outweigh the benefits, a power company may decide to retire a unit rather  than continue to operate the unit or install new pollution control  equipment.", "The majority of coal produced in the United States is used domestically,  though exports represent a small but recently growing fraction of U.S.  coal production. In 2010, the United States exported 82 million tons of  coal, which accounted for 8 percent of total production. As shown in figure  3, coal exports to European and Asian markets represented 76 percent of  total U.S. coal exports in 2011. In 2011, total coal exports were up 31  percent compared with 2010, reaching 107 million tons, due largely to  rising exports to Europe and Asia. This was the highest level of exports  since 1991. In 2011, 35 percent of U.S. coal exports were of the types of  coal typically used to produce electricity, the remainder were of  metallurgical coals used in industrial processes, such as steelmaking.", "To better understand the potential future of the coal and electricity  industries, the federal government, private companies, and others use  models to project future industry conditions, including the future use of  coal.

Because  the future depends on a multitude of factors that are difficult to predict,  EIA assesses various scenarios with different assumptions about future  conditions to better understand the range of potential future outcomes.  For example, EIA\u2019s primary scenario, called its \u201creference\u201d scenario, is a  business-as-usual estimate based on existing policies, known technology,  and current technological and demographic trends. Additional scenarios  make different assumptions about fuel prices, economic conditions, and  government policies, among other things.

Size can be important when  assessing the economics of additional investments needed to  continue to operate coal-fueled units, as smaller units can be more  expensive to retrofit, maintain, and operate on a per-MW basis. For  example, some power companies may choose to install flue gas  desulfurization units\u2014known as scrubbers\u2014to control SO and other  air emissions.

Stakeholders and studies mentioned the  following characteristics as likely unit-level determinants of power  companies\u2019 plans to retire a coal-fueled unit or keep it in operation: age; generating capacity; fuel efficiency (i.e., how efficiently a unit converts fuel to electricity) operating cost and profitability; pollution emission rates and whether a unit already has various types  of emissions control equipment; and  regulatory status.", "As a general matter, the larger, newer, more efficient, and less polluting a  generating unit is, the more likely it is that a power company may to want  to keep it in service and invest in retrofits that may be needed for it to  comply with environmental laws or regulations. For example, if a large,  new generating unit that a power company uses to meet a significant  portion of customer demand is not in compliance with environmental  regulations, retiring it would likely require replacing it with another unit of  similar size. Doing so may be very costly, and retrofitting it with the  requisite pollution control equipment may be a more economical choice.", "It is also reasonable to expect regulatory status to have some impact on  power companies\u2019 retirement plans because such plans could involve  significant investments. For companies that are traditionally regulated,  state public utility commissions review power companies\u2019 plans for major  investments in pollution control equipment in the case of a retrofit, or in  replacement power generation capacity if it is needed after a unit is  retired. Decisions by power companies in restructured markets are not  subject to the same state public utility oversight. Furthermore, once state  public utility commissions approve a traditionally regulated company\u2019s  plan to invest in major retrofits or replacement units, they allow it to  charge rates to recover its investment costs. Companies operating in  restructured markets have no such cost-recovery provisions, so their  investments in retrofits or replacement units may be riskier.", "Our model does not include all the characteristics that stakeholders and  studies identified as possible characteristics that power companies  consider in deciding which coal-fueled units to retire. First, economic  theory and our analysis of data on coal-fueled units indicate that there are  interrelationships among some of these characteristics; for example,  newer, larger electric generating units tend to be more fuel efficient, and  this fuel efficiency contributes to lower operating costs.

For example, we did not take into  account that planned unit retirements might make otherwise marginal  units in some regions more valuable and less likely to retire.

For example, we tried specifications that included a measure of  a unit\u2019s fuel efficiency, and another representing whether a unit is  planning to install pollution control equipment. We also tried a version  with unit average capacity factors in recent years, a measure of how  intensively a unit is utilized. Based on our results, none of these variables  significantly improved the model. Below, we discuss two other alternative  specifications in more detail.", "In one alternative specification, we used clustered standard errors. Our  model assumes that each individual coal-fueled unit has a unique error  term that is independent of every other unit. In this specification, we allow  for the possibility that units owned by the same power companies may be  related in unobserved ways and, therefore, the error terms may be  correlated. As shown in table 6, the estimated coefficients in this  alternative specification are very similar to our model, but the standard  errors are generally bigger, and the estimated coefficients are generally  less statistically significant. This is especially true for net summer  capacity, which is no longer statistically significant at the commonly  accepted 10 percent level.", "In a second alternative specification, we used adjusted marginal cost as a  proxy for the profitability of a unit. Based on economic logic and what we  heard from stakeholders, we expected some indicator of the cost and  profitability of electricity generation to contribute significantly to the  retirement decision. Table 7 shows a version with marginal cost adjusted  for regional wholesale prices and an interaction term with marginal cost  and regulatory status. We adjusted marginal cost by dividing it by the  regional wholesale price to account for the fact that units are more or less  valuable depending on regional wholesale electricity prices. The  interaction term allows us to effectively estimate two coefficients for  adjusted marginal cost, one for power companies in traditionally regulated  markets, and one for power companies in restructured markets. We  included an interaction term to account for the possibility that power  companies in traditionally regulated and restructured markets view costs   Indeed, as shown in table 7, the estimated adjusted marginal  differently.cost coefficients differ\u2014for power companies in restructured markets, the  adjusted marginal cost coefficient is about 5.8, while the estimated  coefficient for power companies in traditionally regulated markets is the  adjusted marginal cost coefficient plus the interaction term (or 5.8 plus - 8.2 = -2.4). These results suggest that while higher adjusted marginal  costs increase the probability of retirement of units owned by power  companies in restructured markets, they decrease the probability for units  owned by traditionally regulated power companies. The interpretation of  these results is unclear.", "Regarding the costs of producing electricity, our findings differed for  companies in restructured markets and companies that are traditionally  regulated. Specifically, our results suggest that companies in restructured  markets are more likely to retire units with higher adjusted marginal costs.  In contrast, our results suggest that companies operating in regulated  markets are less likely to retire units with higher adjusted marginal costs.  A number of characteristics, not considered in our model, could provide  alternative explanations for this difference. For example, it could be the  case that the units in our sample have unique characteristics. One such  potential case could be that units owned by power companies in  traditionally regulated markets may be located in areas where concerns  about the reliability of the electricity system are significant, and the costs  of retrofitting an older generating unit are less costly than retiring it.  Similarly, it could be that our sample contains a number of units located in  areas with lower cost alternative suppliers or where prices are low\u2014 diminishing the attractiveness of even a relatively low-cost unit."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Description of Selected Scenarios and Forecasts", "paragraphs": ["Table 8 describes key scenarios and assumptions in the EIA, IEA, and  IHS Global Insight forecasts discussed in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jon Ludwigson (Assistant  Director), Mike Armes, Patrick Dudley, Philip Farah, Quindi Franco, Cindy  Gilbert, Paige Gilbreath, Alison O\u2019Neill, Kendal Robinson, Jeanette  Soares, and Kiki Theodoropolous made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["EPA Regulations and Electricity: Better Monitoring by Agencies Could  Strengthen Efforts to Address Potential Challenges.
