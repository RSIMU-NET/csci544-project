Applications for proposed transactions that are substantially similar to certain other transactions previously granted exemptions may follow an expedited process.", "As shown in the figure, GAO found that roughly half (56) of the IRA prohibited transaction exemption applications it reviewed were withdrawn by the applicant before the review process was completed. In reviewing processed applications, GAO found that most of the prohibited transactions for which an exemption was sought involved the sale of IRA assets. With regard to DOL's application review process, GAO found that DOL has not sufficiently documented internal policies and procedures to help ensure effective internal control of its process. Documenting procedures could increase transparency about how applications are handled, reduce the risk of DOL employees carrying out their duties inconsistently, and provide a means to retain organizational knowledge should key personnel leave unexpectedly.", "Although DOL and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) share some information as part of their oversight responsibility for prohibited IRA transactions, no formal mechanism exists to help guide collaboration between the agencies. Of the 124 IRA applications GAO reviewed, only eight reflected DOL contact with IRS. GAO found that DOL has information about requested exemptions to prohibited IRA transaction rules that could be useful to IRS in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. For example, DOL does not share information on denials\u2014information that could be useful as prohibited transaction examples for IRS examiner training and educational outreach to IRA owners. In prior work on interagency collaboration, GAO has found that formal agreements, such as a memorandum of understanding, can help agencies monitor, evaluate, and update interagency collaboration. Formalizing the sharing of information between DOL and IRS regarding IRA prohibited transaction exemptions could help the agencies better support their current coordination efforts and identify additional opportunities for greater collaboration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOL and IRS establish a formal means\u2014such as a memorandum of understanding or other mechanism\u2014to collaborate on oversight of prohibited IRA transaction exemptions.

While contributions to IRAs  are subject to annual dollar limits, there are few restrictions on the types  of investments allowable in an IRA. Many IRA owners invest in publicly  traded assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. But as we have  previously reported, some IRA owners choose to invest in less  conventional or nonpublicly traded assets such as real estate, virtual  currency, or private equity. We have also reported that IRA owners who  have accumulated unusually large IRA balances likely have invested in  unconventional assets like nonpublicly traded shares of stock and  partnership interests.", "IRA owners who invest in unconventional assets can assume greater  responsibility for managing their accounts and, as a result, can be  exposed to heightened risks of noncompliance with complex rules  governing tax-favored retirement accounts. For example, although IRA  owners are able to invest in a wide variety of types of assets, they are not  permitted to engage in certain transactions involving those assets. These  transactions are prohibited to prevent misuse of the IRA to benefit the  owner in a way other than as a vehicle to save for retirement, such as  using an IRA to purchase a personal residence. IRA owners who engage  in prohibited transactions may incur increased income tax liability,  additional taxes, and the loss of the tax-advantaged status of their  account.", "The Department of Labor (DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  within the Department of the Treasury each have responsibilities for  overseeing prohibited transactions relating to IRAs. DOL has primary  responsibility for interpretive guidance and exclusive authority to grant  exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules for retirement plans and  IRAs. Whereas IRS and DOL share oversight responsibilities for  employer-sponsored retirement plans such as 401(k) plans, IRS is  responsible for enforcing tax laws relating to IRAs and, among other  things, assessing additional taxes for early distributions for IRA owners  that engage in prohibited transactions.", "You asked us to examine the challenges associated with enforcing rules  governing IRAs invested in unconventional assets. This report examines:  (1) the DOL process for granting exemptions for prohibited IRA  transactions and outcomes of that process, and (2) the extent to which  IRS and DOL collaborate on oversight for prohibited transaction rules for  IRAs. This report is part of a larger body of work on retirement security\u2014a  key issue we have identified facing the nation.", "To describe the process for granting exemptions for prohibited IRA  transactions, we examined relevant federal laws and regulations. We  reviewed DOL procedures and guidance for granting administrative  exemptions for certain prohibited transactions. We interviewed DOL  officials from the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA)  about their prohibited transaction exemption process and procedures.  Specifically, we asked officials within EBSA\u2019s Office of Exemption  Determinations about IRA exemption application submissions; steps and  criteria for the application approval process; and communication with  applicants and IRA owners, as well as with IRS, regarding application  decisions.", "To describe the outcomes of the DOL exemption process, we reviewed  DOL\u2019s internal Case Tracking System data on 124 IRA applications  processed over an 11-year period from January 1, 2006, to   May 16, 2017. To report on the types of exemptions granted, denied, or  withdrawn by applicants, we reviewed the system reference guide and  DOL\u2019s definitions of subject codes used to categorize the IRA  transactions. We reviewed the subject codes DOL assigned to each  application and summarized the types of transactions and assets for  which applicants most often requested an exemption. To assess the  reliability of the data, we compared selected key data points to  documentation in the supporting case files, which we had requested from  DOL for this purpose. We interviewed DOL officials about the reliability of  the data and discussed suspected anomalies we found. Based on our  analysis and discussions with DOL officials, we determined that the DOL  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our descriptive analysis  for the period we reviewed.", "To determine the extent to which IRS and DOL collaborate on oversight  for prohibited transaction rules for IRAs, we reviewed the 124 applications  for documentation of DOL coordination with IRS about the application  review or decision. We interviewed DOL officials responsible for the  exemption process about their interactions with IRS regarding prohibited  IRA transactions. We interviewed IRS officials responsible for  enforcement of prohibited transactions rules on IRAs about their use of  DOL exemption information. We assessed coordination using the relevant  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and our prior  work on interagency collaboration that identifies key practices and  considerations for implementing collaborative mechanisms.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2016 to June 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

An IRA owner who is a fiduciary  is prohibited from engaging in a transaction with the IRA where the  IRA owner personally benefits (other than through the receipt of a  distribution).", "We previously reported that prohibited transactions are more likely to  arise when IRA owners make unconventional IRA investments. Unlike  conventional IRA investments in publicly traded stocks, bonds, and  mutual funds, unconventional investments in real estate, virtual currency,  or private equity are more likely to involve the IRA owner, disqualified  family members, or other disqualified persons. For example, an IRA  invested in rental real estate can leave IRA owners susceptible to a  number of prohibited transactions, such as renting to family or paying for  repairs with personal funds.", "IRA owners may face adverse and potentially severe tax consequences if  they are found to have engaged in a prohibited transaction. Specifically,  the IRA could lose its tax-favored status. The account would then be  treated as distributing all its assets to the IRA owner at the fair market  value on the first day of the year in which the prohibited transaction  occurred. The IRA owner may be subject to additional income taxes  because of any early distribution from an IRA. The prohibited  transaction may also be subject to excise taxes.", "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which  established IRAs and rules prohibiting certain IRA transactions, assigned  IRA oversight roles to both DOL and IRS. To avoid confusion over dual  jurisdiction, a 1978 Executive Order further clarified the agencies\u2019 roles  and responsibilities regarding prohibited transactions. As a result, the  authority to interpret the prohibited transaction rules and grant  exemptions to those rules was transferred to DOL. The transfer did not  affect IRS\u2019 ability to enforce the excise tax provisions or the tax  consequences for IRA owners who are found to have engaged in a  prohibited transaction. However, in enforcing such tax consequences,  IRS is bound by the regulations, rulings, opinions, and exemptions issued  by DOL.", "DOL has the authority to grant administrative exemptions to the prohibited  transaction rules on either an individual or a class basis.

Applicants can  research information about past exemptions granted by the agency on  EBSA\u2019s website. As explained in the DOL booklet describing the  application requirements, applicants have the burden of demonstrating  that they should be granted an exemption.", "If DOL tentatively denies an application, applicants have options for  requesting that the denial be reconsidered. Within 20 days of the tentative  denial, applicants can request a conference with DOL, or notify DOL of  their intent to submit additional information. If, after a conference has  been convened, DOL issues a final denial of the application, DOL will  entertain one request for reconsideration if the applicant presents  significant new facts or arguments, which, for good reason, could not  have been submitted earlier.", "After DOL publishes a notice of proposed exemption in the Federal  Register that describes the pending application, the applicant must notify  interested persons of the pending exemption. Often, the contents of the  information sent to all interested persons, the manner in which it is sent,  and any associated deadlines will have previously been agreed to by  DOL and the applicant. DOL may also hold public hearings during the  comment period. For example, if the transaction involves potential  fiduciary self-dealing or conflicts of interest, any individual potentially  adversely affected by the exemption may submit a request for a public  hearing to DOL. If granted, DOL publishes information about the  exemption in the Federal Register and on its website. Figure 1 provides  an overview of the exemption application process.", "The regulations describe circumstances in which DOL will ordinarily not  consider an application. For example, DOL generally will not consider  an individual application if DOL already has under consideration a class  exemption relating to the same type of transaction. DOL will also not  consider an application for transactions subject to DOL or IRS  investigations. DOL requires applicants to disclose in their applications  whether exemption transactions are, or have been, subject to an  investigation or enforcement action by DOL or IRS. In addition, if the  applicant or any other party in interest becomes the subject of an  investigation or enforcement action, the applicant is required to promptly  notify DOL.", "If applicants find that their prospective transaction is substantially similar  to other transactions for which the agency has previously granted  exemptions, they can follow an expedited process by submitting an  \u201cEXPRO\u201d application. EXPRO applications are required to cite prior  exemptions granted by DOL to demonstrate that the proposed IRA  transaction is substantially similar to other IRA transactions for which  DOL has previously provided an exemption. Specifically, EXPRO  applicants must cite as substantially similar, either (1) two individual  exemptions granted by DOL within the previous 5 years, or (2) one  individual exemption granted within the past 10 years, and one  transaction authorized pursuant to the EXPRO class exemption within the  past 5 years. The applicant must give notice to all interested persons, and  the applicant must resolve all substantive adverse comments provided by  interested persons before DOL will grant final approval.", "The time to complete the exemption process can range from a few  months to more than a year. DOL officials told us that the process  generally takes about 1 year for an individual IRA application that is  relatively simple or routine. EXPRO applications have been processed in  as few as 78 days. According to DOL officials, the process can start  before an applicant submits a formal application because applicants can,  and do, request informal consultations and conferences with DOL. DOL  officials explained that sometimes potential applicants decide not to file  an application after an informal conference because applicants realize  that their application would likely be denied.", "DOL officials explained that during the review process, they first confirm  their understanding and characterization of the proposed exemption  through correspondence with the applicants. Then, in response, DOL  often sets conditions under which relief from the prohibited transaction  rules is contingent, such as on the applicant taking additional actions and  remaining in compliance with those conditions. For example, if an  applicant wants to sell or purchase an asset in what would be an  otherwise prohibited IRA transaction, DOL may stipulate that the  applicant first obtain an independent appraisal or valuation assessment to  determine a fair-market value of that asset.", "After applications are formally submitted, many IRA applicants withdraw  during DOL\u2019s review process. Over an 11-year period, we found that of  the 124 IRA applications, applicants withdrew roughly half (56) before the  review process was completed (see table 1). Of the remaining 68  applications that continued with the review process, DOL granted 48,  denied 16, and closed four application cases for administrative or other  reasons. DOL officials did not dispute the results of our analysis, but  they said that it would be misleading to conclude that DOL is more likely  to grant than deny applications. Rather, they said that their practice of  encouraging applicants to consult with DOL in advance leads some  potential applicants to decide not to pursue an exemption.", "In our review of processed applications, we found that most of the  applications involved the sale of IRA assets. We found that 88 of the 124  applications were for transactions involving the sale of IRA assets. Most  of these were sales of securities or real property (see appendix I for  additional information).

When an application is received by DOL, the division  chief of EBSA\u2019s Office of Exemption Determinations (OED) reviews the  application and assigns it to an OED supervisor. Either the division chief  or the supervisor enters preliminary information from the application into  the system, and classifies the transaction by applying one or multiple  subject matter codes. The supervisor then reviews the information in the  applicant\u2019s case file and assigns the case to an OED analyst. DOL  officials told us that any interim data, such as the publication date for a  proposed exemption, is entered by the supervisor in the system. If an  application is withdrawn by an applicant, denied, or granted, the  supervisor records this information in the system, including the dates of  these actions. When a case is closed, the analyst completes a close-out  index form and submits it to the supervisor for review, and the supervisor  enters a closing code in the system.

A system reference guide included instructions to system users for how to  input and modify case records, generate reports, and add or modify  users. The reference guide also included screen prints indicating which  fields are required by the system to process a case. However, the  reference guide did not contain information about responsibilities and  duties for these data entry activities, and how those duties are assigned.

Such documentation can  appear, for example, in management directives or operating manuals,  and it should be readily available for examination. Policies and  procedures can also help document internal control responsibilities within  the agency.", "DOL officials told us that OED is a small and compact organization, and  as such, its policies and procedures can easily be communicated \u201cperson  to person\u201d and through onsite training. DOL officials also said that the  process for entering data is not difficult, and there are few opportunities  for error because nearly all data on applications is prepopulated.", "The principles of internal control, however, apply to both large and small  organizations. The level and nature of documentation may vary based on  the size of the organization and the complexity of the processes the  organization performs, but documentation is still necessary. By  documenting policies and procedures, management will be better  positioned to monitor whether the organization\u2019s activities are aligned with  those policies and procedures, and assess whether the organization is  achieving its objectives. Documenting procedures also would provide  greater transparency about how applications are handled, and can reduce  the risk of employees carrying out their duties inconsistently.
