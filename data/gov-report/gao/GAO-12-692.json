GAO was asked to assess the extent to which HHS and EPA have (1) used authority under sections 209(f) and (g) to appoint and compensate employees since 2006, and (2) followed applicable agency policy, guidance, and internal controls for appointments and compensation. GAO analyzed agency Title 42 data, interviewed agency officials, and conducted file reviews."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services\u0092 (HHS) use of special hiring authorities under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 209(f) and (g) has increased in recent years. Nearly all HHS Title 42 employees work in one of three HHS operating divisions: the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Title 42 employees at HHS serve in a variety of areas, including scientific and medical research support and in senior, director-level leadership positions. At NIH, one-quarter of all employees, and 44 percent of its researchers and clinical practitioners, were Title 42 appointees. HHS reported that Title 42 enables the agency to quickly fill knowledge gaps so medical research can progress and to respond to medical emergencies. HHS further reported Title 42 provides the compensation flexibility to compete with the private sector. In 2010, 1,461 HHS Title 42 employees earned salaries over Executive Level IV ($155,500 in 2010). HHS does not have reliable data to manage and provide oversight of its use of Title 42 because the section authority used to hire Title 42 employees is not consistently recorded into personnel systems. Moreover, HHS did not consistently adhere to certain sections of its 209(f) policy. For example, the policy states that 209(f) appointments may only be made after non-Title 42 authorities have failed to yield a qualified candidate, but GAO found few instances where such efforts were documented. HHS has recently issued updated 209(f) policy that addresses most of these issues. HHS is developing agencywide policy for appointing and compensating fellows under 209(g), but it is not clear the policy will address important issues such as documenting the basis for compensation. Since 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has used section 209(g) to appoint 17 employees. Title 42 employees lead scientific research initiatives and some manage or direct a division or office. According to EPA officials, Title 42 provides the flexibility to be competitive in recruiting top experts who are also sought by private industry, academia, and others. Also, Title 42 provides the appointment flexibility needed to align experts with specific skills to changing scientific priorities. Fifteen of EPA\u0092s 17 Title 42 employees earned salaries over Executive Level IV in 2010. EPA appointment and compensation practices were generally consistent with its guidance; however, EPA does not have postappointment procedures in place to ensure Title 42 employees meet ethics requirements to which they have previously agreed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends HHS (1) ensuresection authority\u0097209(f) or 209(g)\u0097be consistently entered in appropriatepersonnel systems, (2) systematically document how policy requirements were fulfilled when hiring or converting 209(f) employees, and (3) ensure agencywide 209(g) policy currently in development provides guidance for documenting the basis for employee compensation. GAO recommends EPA develop and document a systematic approach for ensuring Title 42 employees are compliant with ethics requirements after appointment. HHS agreed with GAO\u0092s recommendations, while EPA disagreed, citing certain actions already taken. GAO acknowledges EPA\u0092s plans to address these issues, but maintains the recommendation is needed to ensure implementation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are among the agencies that  have cited difficulties in recruiting and retaining individuals in medicine,  science, engineering, and other related fields in support of their missions.  One reason for these difficulties, according to agency officials, is salaries  available under typical federal government hiring authorities are  sometimes not competitive with those in the private sector for individuals  in these highly specialized and competitive fields. Since 2001, we have  designated strategic human capital management a government-wide  high-risk area in part because of the need to address current and  emerging critical skills gaps that are undermining agencies\u2019 abilities to  meet their missions.", "Effective use of various human capital flexibilities is one way agencies  can improve their efforts to recruit, hire, and manage their workforces.  Such flexibilities, provided under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7209(f) and 209(g)\u2014referred  to in this report generally as Title 42 or specifically as sections 209(f) or  (g)\u2014are available only to HHS and EPA. Section 209(f) authorizes the  employment of special consultants to assist and advise in the operation of  the Public Health Service (PHS), while section 209(g) authorizes  fellowships in the PHS for scientists who may be assigned to studies and  investigations for the term of their fellowships. HHS has used sections  209(f) and (g) and EPA has used section 209(g) to appoint individuals  from the private sector and academia as well as to convert federal  government employees under other pay systems\u2014such as the General  Schedule\u2014to Title 42.", "In implementing Title 42, the agencies have set higher pay limits than   Per HHS  those provided under typical civil service hiring authorities. policy, the annual base salary for many appointments under Title 42 at  HHS cannot exceed $250,000 per calendar year, with total compensation  not to exceed $275,000 unless approved by the Secretary.effort to this audit, we are issuing a legal opinion on whether there are  any statutory caps on pay for consultants and fellows appointed under  sections 209(f) and (g). Similarly, EPA policy caps annual base salary for  Title 42 employees at $250,000, with total compensation that may not  exceed $275,000. According to HHS and EPA officials, the pay setting  flexibility is needed to compete with the private sector and academia to  recruit and retain critical personnel. Because agencies exercise broad  discretion in their use of Title 42 authority, it is important that they have  robust policies and internal control mechanisms in place to implement  and monitor use of the authority. To obtain a better understanding of the  appointment and compensation practices under sections 209(f) and  209(g), you asked us to assess the extent to which HHS and EPA (1)  have used authority under sections 209(f) and (g) to appoint and set pay   In a related  for employees since January 2006, and (2) have followed applicable  agency policy, guidance, and internal controls for appointments and  compensation.", "To assess the extent to which HHS and EPA have used authority under  sections 209(f) and (g) to appoint and set pay for employees, we obtained  agency personnel data that we analyzed to describe: (1) appointment and  compensation trends at HHS and EPA since 2006, including the number  of Title 42 employees; (2) the types of occupations and positions held by  Title 42 employees; (3) compensation rates, including the number of Title  42 employees earning more than certain federal salary levels; (4) the  number of Title 42 employees receiving nonsalary payments; and (5) the  number of civil servants that have been converted to Title 42  appointments and the compensation changes associated with those  conversions. We conducted a variety of data tests and interviews with  agency officials to correct and refine HHS Title 42 data and were able to  develop a data set that was reliable for our purposes. For EPA, we  performed data testing, interviewed agency officials, and compared data  to information found in official agency documents and determined that  EPA\u2019s data were reliable for our purposes. To determine the extent to  which HHS and EPA have followed applicable policy, guidance, and  internal controls, we reviewed the policies and guidance at HHS and EPA  to understand the conditions under which Title 42 employees are to be  recruited, appointed, compensated, and managed. We conducted 63  case file reviews at HHS and 10 at EPA to document appointment and  compensation practices and compared those practices to agency policies  and guidance. Those cases were chosen based on a random selection of  cases that had characteristics related to various areas of HHS\u2019s and  EPA\u2019s Title 42 policy and guidance. We determined the number of case  file reviews was sufficient to identify incidences where practices were or  were not consistent with policies and guidance, but our findings are not  generalizable to the entire population of Title 42 employees at HHS or  EPA.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The authority to appoint and set pay for special consultants and fellows  was provided as part of the Public Health Service Act in 1944. Section  209(f) authorizes the employment of special consultants to assist and  advise in the operation of the PHS. The PHS is comprised of most  operating divisions within HHS\u2014including the National Institutes of Health  (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2014as well as some staff divisions  within the Office of the Secretary. See figure 1 for HHS\u2019s organizational  structure, including those operating divisions and main staff divisions  considered to be within the PHS. Section 209(g) authorizes fellowships in  the PHS for individual scientists who may be assigned for studies and  investigations either in the United States or abroad. Sections 209(f) and  (g) both authorize the establishment of regulations to further implement  these authorities. HHS Office of the Secretary develops agencywide  policy and guidance and operating divisions may set additional or  supplemental policy as necessary. In 2005, Congress provided EPA with  the authority to use section 209 to make a limited number of  appointments in its Office of Research and Development (ORD).Congress initially granted this authority to EPA for fiscal years 2006  through 2011, but Congress amended the authority twice and currently  EPA is permitted to employ up to 30 persons at any one time through  fiscal year 2015. EPA issued regulations in 2006 implementing this  authority, which closely follow HHS regulations.", "HHS regulations for section 209(f) provide that special consultants may  only be appointed when the PHS cannot obtain services through regular  civil service appointments or under the compensation provisions of the  Classification Act of 1949. The regulations further provide that rates of  compensation for special consultants are to be set in accordance with  criteria established by the Surgeon General. The Surgeon General is part  of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. HHS has used this  authority, for example, to appoint doctors and others with expertise in  specialty fields to initiate or provide assistance in conducting medical  research and set pay for those individuals at rates above those allowed  under other federal government pay systems.", "HHS regulations covering section 209(g) provide that fellowships may be  provided to secure the services of talented scientists for limited duration    (up to 5 years) for health-related research, studies, and investigations. The regulations further provide that the Secretary may authorize  procedures to extend the term of fellowships, may authorize stipends for  the fellows, and is responsible for establishing appointment procedures  beyond those set forth in the regulations.", "Some Title 42 employees earn pay within or exceeding pay levels found  in the Executive Schedule. The Executive Schedule is a five-level, basic  pay schedule applicable to the highest-ranking executive appointments in  the federal government.

By  contrast, regular hiring authorities such as those under title 5 of the U.S.  Code\u2014commonly referred to as Title 5\u2014may be used by any federal  agency. Pursuant to HHS and EPA policy, employees at HHS and EPA  originally hired under Title 5 or other authorities may be converted to Title  42 in some circumstances. Under these policies, employees hired under  Title 42 are eligible for performance bonuses, incentives, and other  nonsalary payments made available to federal employees compensated  under Title 5.", "Title 42 employees most frequently work within one of three operating  divisions:", "NIH is the nation\u2019s medical research agency and is comprised of the  Office of the Director and 27 institutes and centers, including the  National Cancer Institute; National Institute on Aging; National Heart,  Lung, and Blood Institute; and the National Center for Complementary  and Alternative Medicine. Each institute and center has its own  specific research agenda, often focused on a particular disease or  body system. As the central office at NIH, the Office of the Director  establishes NIH-specific policy and oversees the institutes and  centers to ensure they operate in accordance with said policy.

For example, according  to HHS officials, the agency used Title 42 authority to quickly hire experts  needed to develop a vaccine in response to the H1N1 flu pandemic of  2009. Appointment agility is also important because many research  projects, particularly those at NIH, are not meant to be long-term and Title  42 appointments can align with project time frames better than hiring full- time permanent staff under regular hiring authorities. In some cases, the  temporary appointment of a researcher with highly-specialized skills to  assist with a limited-scope, limited-duration study may be more  appropriate than a permanent position.", "According to officials, compensation flexibility helps HHS compete with  the private sector and academia to hire and retain highly qualified  employees with rare and critical skill sets, such as neuroscientists,  applied researchers in dietary intakes, and engineers that can operate  particle accelerators. HHS human resource officials stated the salaries  HHS can offer to its top researchers are often not commensurate with  private sector salaries. However, they said the higher compensation limits  under Title 42 combined with other benefits\u2014such as name recognition  and access to advanced research equipment and technology not often  available in the private sector or academia\u2014can help offset  compensation disparities and make HHS attractive to researchers,  doctors, and scientists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Does Not Have Reliable Data on the Use of Its Title 42 Authority", "paragraphs": ["Because HHS does not consistently electronically record the authority  under which many of its Title 42 employees were appointed, the number  of employees hired under either section 209(f) or (g) could not be  determined.

Although some guidance exists at the  operating division level for setting compensation targets, in 11 of the 20  case studies we conducted of section 209(g) fellows, we found either no  or insufficient documentation to support the basis for compensation.  Without an agencywide policy, an agency cannot be assured that it is  allocating its resources most appropriately.

First, EPA reported that Title 42 provides  the flexibility to be competitive in recruiting top experts who are also  sought after by other federal agencies, private industry, and academia.  Prior to using Title 42, EPA had difficulty recruiting and retaining scientists  in certain highly specialized disciplines under regular hiring authorities.  We reported in 2001 that EPA faced significant challenges in recruiting  and maintaining a workforce with mission-critical skills in key technical  areas such as environmental protection, environmental engineering,  toxicology, and ecology. EPA officials told us Title 42 has helped the  agency recruit individuals in cases where, because of the specialization of  expertise needed, authority to set pay over the limits of other hiring  authorities was needed to be competitive in the labor market. As such,  the minimum base salary for Title 42 employees at EPA is equal to the  highest base pay level for employees paid under the General Schedule,  and the maximum base salary is $250,000.", "EPA officials also stated Title 42 provides the appointment flexibility  needed to align experts with specific skills to changing scientific priorities.  One specific program where EPA cited the importance of using Title 42 in  that way was in the development of the NCCT. There are four Title 42  fellows at NCCT, including its director. The fellows assist in the  development of NCCT initiatives, such as the Computational Toxicology  Research Program, a program that is developing alternatives to traditional  animal testing. A 2010 review by the National Academy of Sciences  National Research Council reported \u201cthe use of Title 42 appointments to  develop NCCT is an excellent example of how such appointments can be  used to build new capacity and advance the state of science.\u201d EPA  officials stated it is not the agency\u2019s intention to hire a fellow long-term  under Title 42, but rather employ the individual as long as a priority  remains high. For the three fellows hired in 2006, EPA renewed the terms  for another 5-year appointment.", "Annual salaries range from approximately $153,000 to $216,000, with an  average salary of about $176,000 and a median salary of about  $171,000.

EPA\u2019s Title 42 employees are  subject to the same laws and regulations that govern the ethical conduct  of other federal employees. For example, covered Title 42 employees are  required to submit a public financial disclosure report (SF-278) as part of  the appointment process and annually thereafter. Title 42 employees are  also covered under the criminal conflict of interest law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208.  Section 208 prohibits a federal employee from participating personally  and substantially in a particular matter in which he or she has a personal  financial interest. The statute is intended to prevent an employee from  allowing personal interests to affect his or her official actions and to  protect governmental processes from actual or apparent conflicts of  interest. The application of the statute can be waived so that an employee  need not divest his or her financial interest or recuse themselves from the  particular matter, where the nature and size of the financial interest and  the nature of the matter in which the employee would participate are  unlikely to affect an employee\u2019s official actions.", "EPA\u2019s Title 42 guidance includes pre-employment ethics clearance  procedures for identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest prior  to appointment. As part of the procedures, an ethics official in EPA\u2019s  Office of General Counsel (OGC/Ethics) works with the candidate to  ensure that all required information is reported on the disclosure form and  to develop an ethics agreement, as necessary, to mitigate or resolve any  identified potential conflicts. A job offer may only be extended after  OGC/Ethics signs the public financial disclosure report. Although EPA has preappointment ethics clearance procedures as noted above, it does  not have postappointment procedures in place to ensure Title 42  employees meet ethics requirements to which they have previously  agreed. In two cases we reviewed, employees had potential conflict of  interest situations arise after appointment resulting, in part, from the  agency\u2019s failure to ensure Title 42 employees followed agreed upon  ethics requirements.", "In one case, EPA general counsel determined stock owned by the  candidate could be a potential conflict of interest and directed the  candidate to either recuse himself from certain duties or divest himself  of the stock as a condition of employment. The candidate agreed to  divest of the stock and was subsequently hired. A year later, during  the routine review of the employee\u2019s annual financial disclosure form,  EPA discovered that the employee still owned the stock. The  employee was ordered to divest of the stock and this time immediately  complied. EPA also reviewed the projects for which the employee was  involved while still owning the stock and determined that the  employee had not participated in any particular matter which would  have constituted a conflict of interest. According to EPA, there was  confusion concerning who, if anyone, was tasked to ensure the  divestiture occurred.  In another case, based on the review of the candidate\u2019s public  financial disclosure form, EPA and the candidate entered into an  ethics agreement, which documented ethical constraints that would  apply to the candidate and to caution the candidate about certain  assets held. The agreement listed entities in which the individual held  stock and advised that, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208, the individual  should not participate in any particular matter that affected any of the  listed entities unless the individual first obtained a written waiver from  EPA/OGC or the value of the asset was low enough to qualify under a  regulatory de minimis exemption. Despite these efforts, a year later,  while responding to the employee\u2019s request for additional time to file  the annual public financial disclosure form, EPA discovered that the  employee was participating in a matter while holding stock in a  company (a listed entity in the ethics agreement) that EPA/OGC  initially believed could be affected by this matter. Concluding that the  employee\u2019s participation was a conflict of interest, EPA/OGC directed  the employee, who had been working on the matter for approximately  3 days, to immediately stop working on the matter. The employee  immediately complied and sold the stock holding in question in order  to resume working on the matter. OGC/Ethics made no inquiry into  the specific activities the employee engaged in during those 3 days.  Almost 2 years later, OGC/Ethics officials now conclude that this  company was not sufficiently affected by the matter to present a  violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208 in light of facts that subsequently  emerged.", "EPA officials acknowledge that beyond these two cases, its efforts to  identify and mitigate potential conflicts of interest after appointment can  be improved and have taken steps to improve ethics oversight. For  example, in order to increase overall awareness of ethics responsibilities,  EPA reported it provided additional training to a senior ethics official and  now copies Deputy Ethics Officials \u2013 officials responsible for assisting  employees in being compliant with ethics requirements \u2013 when cautionary  memoranda are issued. EPA also told us it has plans to develop  mandatory training sessions for ethics officials in its field laboratories and  centers and implement a process where employees hired under the Title  42 and other authorities send EPA OGC confirmation of such actions as  stock divestitures or signed recusals. As details and implementation  timelines for these plans were not available at the time of our review, it is  not clear that these plans fully consider and address ethics issues that  arise after appointment and ensure previously agreed upon ethics  requirements are followed, as was the issue in the two cases above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HHS and EPA have used Title 42 to recruit and retain highly skilled, in- demand personnel to government service. Although HHS relies on Title  42 to fill some of its most critical scientific and medical research positions,  the lack of complete data and guidance may limit the agency\u2019s ability to  strategically manage the use of the authority. HHS erroneously reported  appointments made under sections 209(f) and (g) that would have been  prohibited by law, indicating the agency\u2019s data management practices  may preclude effective oversight of the program and workforce planning.  Effective oversight is particularly important in light of HHS\u2019s increasing  use of Title 42 and the number of employees earning salaries higher than  most federal employees. Inconsistencies between HHS\u2019s policies and  practices related to section 209(f) may result in that authority being used  in ways for which it was not intended. Recent changes to 209(f) policy  issued by HHS should help the agency more consistently follow  requirements. As appointments have been made under 209(g) without  documentation showing the basis for compensation, relying on 209(g)  guidance issued only at the operating division level may not be sufficient  to ensure appointments and compensation under this authority are  appropriate and consistent. HHS has acknowledged the need for  agencywide 209(g) guidance, but has not determined if it will include  requiring documentation showing the basis for compensation. EPA  generally followed its Title 42 policies and has incorporated some  modifications to improve its appointment and compensation practices;  however, EPA\u2019s current ethics guidance does not sufficiently ensure Title  42 employees meet ethics requirements after appointment. EPA  acknowledged it could improve its postappointment ethics oversight and  reported it has plans to ensure that Title 42 employees send OGC  confirmation of stock divestitures and other ethics requirements.  However, at the time of our review, EPA had not provided us with  implementation plans or timeframes.

We  determined 2006 was the most appropriate beginning year for our  analysis because, according to HHS human resource officials, personnel  data prior to 2006 was likely not sufficiently reliable for our analysis.

We conducted a total of 63 case file  reviews out of 1,502 HHS cases within selected strata in two phases. In  the first phase, we conducted 23 case file reviews to address data  reliability concerns.

For EPA, we selected 10 of  the 17 Title 42 employees for case file reviews based on a cross section  of (1) labs and centers within EPA to understand if Title 42 was  implemented uniformly across the agency; (2) Title 42 candidate sources  such as the private sector, academia, and conversions to determine if  differences existed in recruitment and pay setting; (3) length of service as  a Title 42 employee to understand the effect of recent appointment and  compensation guidance; and (4) compensation characteristics.
