Even though aviation accident rates are dropping overall, the number of accidents could go up in future years if the number of passenger flights increases as expected. To minimize the danger that hazardous weather presents to the aviation system, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in conjunction with other federal agencies, collects and analyzes weather information and disseminates this information to the users of the aviation system. However, between 1995 and 1997, one report by the National Research Council (NRC) and two reports by an FAA advisory committee cited problems in FAA\u2019s management of its aviation weather activities, such as inadequate interagency coordination and a lack of clarity about the agency\u2019s role in aviation weather. These reports also recommended steps FAA could take to provide better weather information to aviation users.", "Concerned about FAA\u2019s efforts to reduce weather-related accidents, you asked us to examine the actions FAA has taken to address the recommendations raised by NRC and FAA\u2019s advisory committee. In this report, we discuss FAA\u2019s actions in four areas of concern raised by the three reports: (1) policy and leadership, (2) interagency coordination, (3) meeting different types of users\u2019 needs for weather information, and (4) the level of funding provided for weather activities.", "To assist us in evaluating FAA\u2019s actions, we convened a panel of experts who were members of NRC\u2019s committee or FAA\u2019s advisory committee. These experts were chosen to represent different users of aviation weather information, such as airlines; air traffic controllers; and commercial, military, and private pilots. After discussing FAA\u2019s responses to the recommendations in the four areas of concern, the panel rated FAA\u2019s progress on each recommendation. Our methodology is discussed in more detail in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Aviation weather refers to any type of weather that can affect the operation of an aircraft\u2014anything from a brief delay in departure because of low visibility to a catastrophic accident during flight. For example, in March 1992, a USAir flight crashed during takeoff from La Guardia Airport in New York City, killing 27 people and injuring 21 others. Icing was identified as one of the factors that contributed to that accident. According to data from the National Transportation Safety Board and FAA, about 24 percent of all aviation accidents in fiscal year 1987 through fiscal year 1996 were weather-related. During the same period, about 35 percent of aviation fatalities occurred in weather-related accidents. About 88 percent of these accidents involved small private aircraft. Weather-related aviation accidents were most often caused by winds, poor visibility, or turbulence. Figure 1 shows all the types of weather events cited in aviation accidents over this period.", "Multiple weather factors may be cited in an accident investigation.", "Because of rounding, the sum of percentages exceeds 100.", "Weather need not cause an accident to have an effect on aviation. FAA estimates that 72 percent of all delays over 15 minutes can be attributed to weather. These delays add to the cost of flying, either for passengers whose travel plans are disrupted or for airlines, which can incur additional fuel, servicing, and crew costs. The Air Transport Association estimates that delays cost airlines and passengers about $4 billion in 1996. (App. II provides more detailed information on weather-related accidents and delays.)", "FAA is responsible for maintaining the safety of the national airspace system. Because of the impact of weather on aviation, FAA has spent more than $1.4 billion in facilities and equipment funds since fiscal year 1982 to develop and purchase weather-related systems and equipment. In future years, FAA expects to spend another $440 million on those systems already in development. FAA believes that its purchases of improved weather systems will help it meet the President\u2019s stated goal of reducing fatal aviation accidents by 80 percent within 10 years. For example, FAA has purchased more than 500 automated surface observing system (ASOS) units, which use a series of instruments to automatically measure such meteorological data as wind speed and direction, temperature, and barometric pressure near airports. FAA is also buying systems, like the integrated terminal weather system (ITWS), that will collect and analyze weather data from ASOS, radars, and other systems, and display them for use by air traffic controllers and supervisors. FAA relays the data provided by such systems, as well as information provided by the National Weather Service (NWS) and private vendors, to pilots through automated systems or direct voice communications from air traffic controllers. FAA also uses weather information when deciding how to handle air traffic, such as which runway to use at an airport.", "In addition, since fiscal year 1982, FAA has spent almost $169 million of its total funding of $3.3 billion for research, engineering, and development on research related to aviation weather. FAA\u2019s research has looked into ways to improve radars and other weather sensors, to detect and avoid turbulence, and to support the early development of some of the systems it has purchased or plans to purchase. Much of this research is conducted under contract by several universities and federally funded laboratories, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Flight Systems and National Severe Storms Laboratories, NWS\u2019 Aviation Weather Center and National Center for Environment Prediction, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Lincoln Laboratories.", "Several other federal agencies also collect and disseminate aviation weather information, as well as conduct aviation weather research. NWS, which is part of NOAA in the Department of Commerce, is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating weather information in general and has worked with FAA on joint projects such as ASOS and an advanced national weather radar system. NWS also provides meteorologists for some of FAA\u2019s air traffic control centers. Other agencies with related aviation weather responsibilities include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which conducts basic research on weather-related topics, and the Department of Defense, which provides aviation weather information to military pilots and command officers. The Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology (OFCM), which is also part of NOAA, was created to coordinate the meteorological services and research for all federal agencies. However, the office does not have the authority to direct the weather operations of other federal agencies.", "Over the past 3 years, several reports have raised concerns about the quality of the weather information available to the aviation community. In 1995, NRC, examining the roles and missions of the agencies involved in aviation weather, found that FAA, NWS, and the other agencies involved did not coordinate their activities. NRC called upon FAA to take the lead in federal aviation weather efforts. At the same time, a subcommittee of FAA\u2019s RE&D Advisory Committee that was examining the adequacy of FAA\u2019s aviation weather research found a number of problems. This subcommittee reported that FAA needed to improve its aviation weather research as well as its delivery of weather information to system users, such as pilots, controllers, and dispatchers. Finally, FAA\u2019s advisory committee released a report in 1997 on research related to the national airspace system. This report found that FAA\u2019s efforts on aviation weather were unfocused and that the agency had not clearly defined its role in providing aviation weather information.", "We contacted the members of the NRC aviation weather committee and the FAA advisory committee that addressed weather issues and asked for their assistance in our efforts to follow up on their recommendations that were specifically addressed to FAA. In obtaining their assistance, we asked all of the committee members, in a survey, to identify the highest-priority recommendations. The highest-rated recommendations address three general topics: policy and leadership, interagency coordination, and efforts to address users\u2019 needs. We chose an expert panel from among those who answered our survey, with members representing the various users of aviation weather information, such as airline representatives, commercial and private pilots, and air traffic controllers. The panel reviewed the information we had gathered on FAA\u2019s actions to implement the eight recommendations and rated FAA\u2019s general progress on each recommendation on a 5-point scale, from very poor to excellent. The panelists were also asked to indicate whether FAA\u2019s actions were sufficient to address the recommendation and whether FAA had taken these actions in a timely manner. In discussing the recommendations, the panelists repeatedly raised concerns about FAA\u2019s funding of weather activities, a fourth area of concern that was mentioned in the original reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Found That FAA\u2019s Efforts to Exercise Leadership in Aviation Weather Fell Short", "paragraphs": ["NRC and FAA\u2019s RE&D Advisory Committee found that FAA did not exercise leadership for aviation weather services, partly because it lacked a clear policy on weather and partly because of organizational inefficiencies. FAA has attempted to address these criticisms by creating an aviation weather directorate and issuing a policy on weather. However, members of our expert panel did not think these actions went far enough to address the previously identified weaknesses, generally rating FAA\u2019s progress in this area as poor."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reports Criticized FAA\u2019s Lack of Leadership and Internal Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Reports by NRC and FAA\u2019s RE&D Advisory Committee criticized FAA for failing to exercise leadership on aviation weather issues. For example, NRC found that \u201cvigorous leadership within the federal government . . .  needed to build consensus and coordinate the overall effort to optimize aviation weather services and related research.\u201d It concluded that FAA was the agency best able to exercise that leadership because of its aviation expertise and legal authority. All three reports also criticized FAA for not developing a policy to define its role and priorities in aviation weather and recommended that FAA provide a clear policy statement on its role in providing aviation weather services.", "For example, NRC noted that under FAA\u2019s policies, pilots have the primary responsibility for keeping their aircraft away from hazardous weather, while air traffic controllers are principally responsible for separating aircraft from one another, thus avoiding collisions. The report found that FAA\u2019s guidance required controllers to remain aware of current weather conditions and relay information on hazardous weather to pilots, but it did not allow controllers to direct aircraft away from hazardous weather, as they direct aircraft away from other aircraft. NRC concluded that FAA should develop procedures that allow controllers to take a more active role in separating aircraft from hazardous weather, especially when they have more accurate weather information than the pilot. The 1995 advisory committee report reached similar conclusions. The 1997 advisory committee report concluded that even though the definition of hazardous weather is highly dependent upon the capabilities of the individual aircraft and flight crew, FAA\u2019s mission should include the responsibility for transmitting weather information to pilots and dispatchers in order to improve the separation of aircraft from hazardous weather and to increase collaboration between pilots and air traffic controllers.", "NRC and FAA\u2019s advisory committee also cited weaknesses in FAA\u2019s internal organization as a reason for the agency\u2019s not taking a leadership role in weather issues. For example, NRC found that no single office within FAA had the authority and responsibility for setting priorities for aviation weather. The 1997 advisory committee report found that six offices within FAA were responsible for setting priorities for aviation weather research. According to FAA\u2019s Manager for Weather Research, prior to 1995, these offices did not set priorities to ensure that the most important research projects received funding. Instead, this official stated, FAA set its research priorities by reviewing the requests submitted by the national laboratories and contractors to the several offices with responsibility for aviation weather. These offices did not coordinate their efforts internally but submitted their requests separately to FAA\u2019s Office of Research and Acquisitions. As a result, NRC and FAA\u2019s advisory committee found that aviation weather research was hampered by a lack of coordination, funding, and priority setting. To address this problem, NRC recommended that FAA appoint an official to serve as the single focal point with responsibility for providing effective internal and external coordination of aviation weather activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Issued a Weather Policy and Created New Organizations for Weather", "paragraphs": ["FAA took several actions to address concerns about its leadership role in aviation weather. First, in response to concerns about how it organized its aviation weather activities, FAA made several organizational changes to consolidate these activities. In October 1995, FAA created an aviation weather directorate, which is intended to serve as the federal government\u2019s focal point for determining aviation weather requirements, policies, and plans. The directorate was intended to fulfill the aviation weather responsibilities previously carried out by several organizations within FAA. The directorate is responsible for setting requirements for, and developing programs and policies on, aviation weather. In February 1996, FAA created a program to coordinate its research efforts on improving weather observations, warnings, and forecasts. The weather research program is organized into eight product development teams that focus on topics such as turbulence and visibility. According to program officials, the program oversees the research conducted by the national laboratories and universities and sets priorities for requests to conduct research on aviation weather.", "Second, in response to congressional direction, in April 1996, FAA began implementing a new acquisition management system designed to provide for more timely and cost-effective acquisitions for the entire agency. Under this system, FAA operates five integrated product teams, which are responsible for the research, development, acquisition, and installation of all new equipment within their area of expertise. To carry out these tasks, each team includes staff with various areas of expertise, such as systems engineers, lawyers, contract specialists, and representatives of the organizations responsible for the operation and maintenance of the systems acquired. In the past, according to FAA officials, the responsibility for the acquisition of such systems would be carried out sequentially through various FAA offices, depending on whether the systems were being designed, purchased, or deployed. Now, one team is responsible for all three of those activities. Two of these teams deal with weather systems: one with weather processor systems and one with weather sensors. The weather processor team, for example, develops and acquires systems such as ITWS, which takes data from various sensors and displays the data for users.", "In addition, since the NRC and advisory committee reports were issued, FAA has worked with other federal agencies involved in aviation weather to develop the National Aviation Weather Strategic Plan, which was published in April 1997 and is intended to lay out a vision of how to reduce the number of weather-related aviation accidents and delays. According to FAA\u2019s Director of Aviation Weather, plans to implement the interagency strategic plan and FAA\u2019s aviation weather policy are still under development, and to date, no policies or regulations of FAA\u2019s have been amended to reflect the new weather policy.", "Finally, in September 1997, the Administrator of FAA issued an aviation weather policy in which FAA accepted responsibility for taking the lead in aviation weather services. According to this policy statement, FAA will (1) work closely with the federal agencies concerned with aviation weather; (2) take the lead in developing a plan to meet stated national goals concerning aviation weather; and (3) ensure that the needs of FAA and the aviation community are being addressed and that research, development, and acquisition are focused to improve the safety of the air traffic system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Panelists Concluded That FAA Had Made Limited Progress in Defining Policy and Exercising Leadership", "paragraphs": ["Three of the recommendations our January 1998 expert panel reviewed addressed FAA\u2019s lack of leadership on aviation weather issues. These recommendations included two by the RE&D Advisory Committee in 1997. One recommendation called for FAA to see weather as a safety issue, not just a delay issue. The committee also recommended that FAA issue a \u201cclear and cohesive policy statement regarding the agency\u2019s important role\u201d in aviation weather, including the need to separate aircraft from hazardous weather. In the third recommendation, NRC called for FAA to see weather as an important part of all of its operations.", "Several members of our expert panel applauded FAA for issuing a policy on weather, calling the policy \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d One panelist also stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you can take a snapshot right now and evaluate where FAA is because . . .  is a long-term program.\u201d However, panelists also questioned whether the changes cited by FAA demonstrate that it has taken the lead for federal aviation activities.

In rating the recommendations dealing with policy and leadership, most panelists saw FAA\u2019s progress in treating weather as a safety issue as fair. However, most panelists also thought that FAA had made poor progress in establishing a weather policy that addresses the role of controllers in providing weather information and in seeing weather as an important part of its operations.

It also found that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was not included in FAA\u2019s long-range planning for aviation weather. NRC recommended that FAA and NWS establish more formal coordination procedures.

For example, FAA points to its work with OFCM, NWS, and other agencies on the National Aviation Weather Strategic Plan. FAA and the other agencies are continuing to work together to develop procedures to implement the goals outlined in the plan. According to FAA\u2019s Director of Aviation Weather, these procedures will be published in May or June 1998.", "In addition, FAA and NWS have increased the frequency of their meetings to address aviation weather concerns.

In addition, some of the weather information given to pilots covers broad geographic areas, making it hard for them to determine if they will experience hazardous weather during their flight. According to NRC, the needs of various aviation system users were well known, but the federal government had not acted adequately to address these concerns. Similarly, the 1997 advisory committee report found that while the needs of users may vary because of such factors as the capabilities of the pilot or aircraft, \u201cfor safety and efficiency, all participants\u2014controller, pilots, and dispatchers\u2014should have consistent, timely, and common knowledge of the weather situation.\u201d", "NRC cited FAA\u2019s experience with the automated weather observing system known as ASOS to illustrate the impact of inadequately considering user needs in developing a weather system. Although FAA worked with NWS on the development of ASOS, some aviation users complained that the system as deployed did not meet their needs. Specifically, ASOS was designed to replace human weather observers. However, while a human observer can look at weather conditions over a broad area, ASOS can measure weather conditions only directly overhead. As a result, several aviation groups commented that ASOS provided unrepresentative observations when weather conditions were patchy or changing rapidly. Such inaccurate observations could cause pilots to avoid an airport when it is safe to land but ASOS reports unsafe weather or could cause pilots to attempt to land at an airport when unsafe conditions are not reported. Because ASOS\u2019 observations cannot substitute for the completeness of human observations, FAA is still employing human weather observers.

The RE&D Advisory Committee also stated in 1995 that, because of the low priority given to weather activities, \u201cweather-related programs are inconsistently funded, causing less than acceptable performance.\u201d Finally, in 1997, the advisory committee found that \u201cas a result of the present budget environment, the FAA management has decided to give weather programs a lower priority than other system areas, thereby causing cancellations or significant delays to critical weather efforts.\u201d", "The reports discussed several instances that raised questions about FAA\u2019s commitment to funding aviation weather projects that meet users\u2019 needs. For example, FAA eliminated funding for the Advanced Weather Products Generator, a system designed to provide weather information to pilots and other external aviation users. According to NRC, this decision represented a \u201clack of focus on pilots\u2019 needs.\u201d The 1997 advisory committee report called FAA\u2019s plans to consolidate weather data using systems like ITWS logical but questioned FAA\u2019s commitment to fund such projects over the long term.", "Our review of FAA\u2019s budget data confirms the committees\u2019 findings and the panelists\u2019 concerns about the relative importance FAA places on weather funding. FAA has a number of major activity areas linked to its mission and management goals. Although aviation weather is a prominent factor in aviation accidents, FAA\u2019s spending for research and acquisitions related to weather has been lower than spending for most other agency research and acquisition activities. For example, from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 1998, aviation weather research accounted for 4 percent of the funds allocated to all types of FAA research. Spending on weather activities was lower than spending on all but three other areas\u2014airport technology, environment and energy, and research and development partnerships\u2014as figure 2 shows. FAA spent 8 percent of its research funds on weather in fiscal year 1990 but only 1 percent in fiscal years 1994 and 1995. In fiscal year 1998, FAA plans to spend 8 percent of its research funds on weather-related projects.", "Aircraft safety technology ($339)", "System security technology ($320)", "Communications, navigation, and surveillance ($239)", "Similarly, funding for the acquisition of aviation weather systems was lower (eighth out of eight areas) than for all other program areas for fiscal years 1990 through 1998, as figure 3 shows. Over this period, acquisitions for aviation weather accounted for 5 percent of all spending for facilities and equipment, varying from a high of 8 percent in fiscal year 1990 to a low of 4 percent in fiscal years 1993 and 1997. In fiscal year 1998, FAA plans to spend nearly 5 percent of its facilities and equipment funds on weather-related projects.", "Mission support ($3,573)", "Facilities ($3,356)", "Communications ($2,216)", "Finally, during the last 3 fiscal years, FAA has requested less funding for aviation weather than the Congress has provided. Table 2 shows the amount of funding FAA requested for aviation weather research and acquisitions and the amount that the Congress provided.", "Even though FAA\u2019s management has acknowledged the increasing value of weather research, it is still difficult for aviation weather to get funding, according to FAA\u2019s Manager for Aviation Weather Research. In addition, this official stated that neither FAA\u2019s request nor the recent level of appropriations has been enough to support an adequate weather research program. He estimated that FAA\u2019s planned aviation weather research for the next 5 to 7 years would cost $15 million to $18 million per year. Another FAA official pointed out that other competing demands, such as security programs, continue to have a higher priority.", "Several factors may account for the lower funding levels given to aviation weather. First, according to FAA\u2019s Director of Aviation Weather and FAA\u2019s Manager for Weather Research, without a central office, aviation weather did not have a funding advocate when decisions were being made on the allocation of resources. In addition, these officials said, some of the FAA leadership, until recently, did not believe that weather was a contributing factor in safety and in delays and therefore did not consider it a high priority.", "Finally, FAA does not assign weather information a high priority in its architecture plans for the national airspace system. FAA categorizes its information needs according to three classifications: critical, essential, and routine, with critical being the highest priority. Critical information is information that if lost would prevent the national air system from exercising safe separation and control over aircraft. Essential information is information that if lost would reduce the capability of the national air system to exercise safe separation and control over aircraft. Since FAA does not believe most aviation weather systems fall into the critical category, it classifies them as essential. Because weather information is not considered critical, aviation weather systems are often among the first areas cut, FAA officials told us.", "Several panelists commented that the level of funding FAA was providing for research projects was not adequate, potentially jeopardizing multiyear research projects. While some panelists stated that FAA could be reducing its funding requests deliberately because it believed that the Congress would restore funding, others raised the possibility that the low funding requests reflect the fact that FAA continues to make weather issues a lower priority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Owing to the significant impact of hazardous weather on aviation safety and efficiency, improving the weather information available to all users of the aviation system should be one of FAA\u2019s top priorities. However, a panel of experts presented with information on FAA\u2019s actions to improve its management of aviation weather concluded that FAA had done a poor job in addressing the most significant concerns raised by previous reports. While the panelists recognized that FAA had taken certain steps, such as issuing a policy to define its role in aviation weather and increasing coordination with NWS, many questioned FAA\u2019s commitment to implementing permanent changes resulting from these actions.", "On the basis of the panel\u2019s discussion and the information we gathered, we agree that FAA has addressed some of the concerns raised in previous reports. However, FAA\u2019s responses also demonstrate that some of the issues raised by the three reports have not been fully addressed. For example, FAA indicated that issuing a policy defining its staff\u2019s role in separating aircraft from hazardous weather is not necessary\u2014a key function if the weather information it collects is to improve safety. Furthermore, two conditions\u2014weather information\u2019s being classified as a lower priority than other types of air traffic information and the lack of training for FAA staff on how to use weather information\u2014indicate that despite the new policy, weather continues to be a lower priority for FAA than its traditional function of separating aircraft from other aircraft.

One of the recommendations chosen by the respondents addressed coordination of research. To ensure that the panel adequately addressed concerns about coordination raised in the previous reports and the original request, we added the second-highest rated recommendation dealing with coordination, resulting in a final total of eight recommendations. We then asked officials responsible for FAA\u2019s weather activities to provide evidence of the actions FAA had taken to address these eight high-priority recommendations. FAA provided written responses and some supporting material to support its actions to address each of the eight recommendations. The full text of each of the recommendations, FAA\u2019s response, and selected supporting material are presented in appendix IV.", "Finally, we convened an expert panel of individuals who had answered our survey, judgmentally selecting a subset of eight individuals who represented various users and providers of aviation weather information.

For each of the eight high-priority recommendations, we presented the panelists with FAA\u2019s response, supporting material submitted by the agency, and any other information about FAA\u2019s actions that we had identified during our previous work. We asked for their comments on (1) the original intent of the recommendation, (2) any other actions FAA had taken to address the recommendation, and (3) the adequacy of FAA\u2019s response. At the end of each discussion, we asked the panelists to rate, using an anonymous ballot, FAA\u2019s progress in addressing each recommendation.
