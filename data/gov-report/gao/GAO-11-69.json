Having piloted the integrated disability evaluation system (IDES) at 27 military facilities, they are now planning for its expansion military-wide. Part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 required GAO to report on DOD and VA's implementation of policies on disability evaluations. This report examines: (1) the results of the agencies' evaluation of the IDES pilot, (2) challenges in implementing the IDES pilot to date, and (3) whether DOD and VA's plans to expand the IDES adequately address potential future challenges. GAO analyzed data from DOD and VA, conducted site visits at 10 military facilities, and interviewed DOD and VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In their evaluation of the IDES pilot as of February 2010, DOD and VA concluded that it had improved servicemember satisfaction relative to the existing \"legacy\" system and met their established goal of delivering VA benefits to active duty and reserve component servicemembers within 295 and 305 days, respectively, on average. While these results are promising, average case processing times have steadily increased since the February 2010 evaluation. At 296 days for active duty servicemembers, as of August 2010, processing time for the IDES is still an improvement over the 540 days that DOD and VA estimated the legacy process takes to deliver VA benefits to members. However, the full extent of improvement of the IDES over the legacy system is unknown because (1) the 540-day estimate was based on a small, nonrepresentative sample of cases and (2) limitations in legacy case data prevent a comprehensive comparison of timeliness, as well as appeal rates. Piloting of the IDES has revealed several implementation challenges that have contributed to delays in the process, the most significant being insufficient staffing by DOD and VA. Staffing shortages were severe at a few pilot sites that experienced caseload surges. For example, at one of these sites, due to a lack of VA medical staff, it took 140 days on average to complete one of the key features of the pilot--the single exam--compared with the agencies' goal to complete this step of the process in 45 days. The single exam posed other challenges that contributed to process delays, such as exam summaries that did not contain sufficient information for VA to determine the servicemember's benefits and disagreements between DOD and VA medical staff about diagnoses for servicemembers' medical conditions. Cases with these problems were returned for further attention, adding time to the process. Pilot sites also experienced logistical challenges, such as incorporating VA staff at military facilities and housing and managing personnel going through the process. As DOD and VA prepare to expand the IDES worldwide, they have made preparations to address a number of these challenges, but these efforts have yet to be tested, and not all challenges have been addressed. To address staffing shortages and ensure timely processing, VA is developing a contract for additional medical examiners, and DOD and VA are requiring local staff to develop written contingency plans for handling surges in caseloads. However, the agencies lack strategies for meeting some key challenges, such as ensuring enough military physicians to handle anticipated workloads. They also do not have a comprehensive monitoring plan for identifying problems as they occur--such as staffing shortages and insufficiencies in medical exams--in order to take remedial actions as early as possible."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making several recommendations to improve DOD and VA's planning for expansion of the new disability evaluation system, including developing a systematic monitoring process and ensuring that adequate staff is in place.

After receiving medical treatment, many  wounded servicemembers must navigate a complex disability evaluation  system that begins with the Department of Defense (DOD) determining  whether they are medically fit to continue their military service. If they are  found unfit, servicemembers continue through the system to obtain a  determination of their eligibility for military disability benefits. Once  servicemembers are discharged from the military, they may also be eligible  to receive disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA), but they must first undergo an entirely separate VA disability  evaluation process. A series of articles in 2007 by The Washington Post  concerning conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and  subsequent reports from numerous high-level commissions and review  groups, highlighted problems with the DOD and VA disability evaluations  systems.  These included long delays, duplication in DOD and VA  processes, confusion among servicemembers, and distrust of systems  regarded as adversarial by servicemembers and veterans.", "In response to these concerns, DOD and VA jointly designed a new  disability evaluation system that integrates DOD and VA processes, with  the goal of expediting the delivery of benefits to servicemembers. DOD  and VA began pilot testing the integrated disability evaluation system  (IDES) in November 2007 at three Washington, D.C., area military  treatment facilities and, by March 2010, added 24 more facilities to the  pilot.

The NDAA 2008 also required GAO to report on the  progress DOD and VA have made in developing and implementing the  comprehensive policy. In agreement with cognizant congressional staff,  we reviewed DOD and VA\u2019s progress in implementing policies related to  their disability evaluation systems, focusing on the agencies\u2019 joint pilot of  the IDES. Specifically, we examined: (1) the results of DOD and VA\u2019s  evaluation of the pilot, (2) challenges in implementing the piloted system  to date, and (3) DOD and VA plans to expand the piloted system and  whether those plans adequately address potential challenges.", "To examine DOD and VA\u2019s evaluation of the IDES pilot, we identified the  goals that DOD and VA expected the pilot to achieve and reviewed their  assessment of whether those goals were met. As part of this work, we  assessed the reliability of two types of data that DOD and VA planned to  use as the basis of their pilot evaluation\u2014case data from both pilot and  legacy disability evaluation systems, as well as data from surveys DOD  conducted to gauge servicemember satisfaction. We obtained the case  data and survey data as of early 2010, the same cutoff dates that DOD and  VA used for their pilot evaluation. To identify challenges in implementing  the piloted system to date, we visited 10 of the 27 military treatment  facilities participating in the pilot. We selected these 10 facilities to obtain  perspectives from sites in different military services and geographical  regions and with varying caseloads and organizational structures. For all  of the research objectives, we conducted interviews with key officials  involved in the pilot at DOD, VA, and each of the military services.  Furthermore, we analyzed pilot case data and reviewed reports, guidance,  plans, and other documents. We also reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations. We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 to  December 2010, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Each of the  services conducts this process for its servicemembers. The Army has three  PEBs, which are located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas; Walter Reed Army  Medical Center in Washington, D.C.; and Fort Lewis, Washington. The  Navy and Air Force each have one PEB: the Navy\u2019s is located at the  Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., and the Air Force\u2019s is located  in San Antonio, Texas. The PEB process begins with an \u201cinformal\u201d PEB\u2014 an administrative review of the case file by PEB adjudicators without the  presence of the servicemember. If the servicemember is found to be unfit  due to medical conditions incurred in the line of duty, the informal PEB  assigns the servicemember a combined percentage rating for those unfit  conditions, and the servicemember is discharged from duty. Disability  ratings range from 0 (least severe) to 100 percent (most severe) in  increments of 10 percent. Depending on the overall disability rating and  number of years of active duty or equivalent service, the servicemember  found unfit with compensable conditions is entitled to either monthly  disability retirement benefits or lump sum disability severance pay.", "Servicemembers have opportunities to appeal the results of their disability  evaluations. If servicemembers are dissatisfied with the informal PEB\u2019s  decisions, they may request a hearing with a \u201cformal\u201d PEB.

Military physicians involved in the MEB process play a  fundamental role because they are responsible for documenting in the  disability evaluation case file the medical conditions that may limit a  servicemember\u2019s ability to serve in the military. To prepare this  documentation, military physicians may require that servicemembers  obtain additional medical evidence from specialty physicians, such as a  psychiatrist. Throughout the MEB and PEB processes, board liaisons serve  a key role by explaining the process to servicemembers and constructing  the case files. The liaisons inform servicemembers of board results and of  deadlines at key decision points in the process.

The claim lists the  medical conditions that the veteran believes are service-connected. For  each claimed condition, VA must determine if credible evidence is  available to support the veteran\u2019s contention of service connection. A  service representative assists the veteran in gathering the relevant  evidence to evaluate the claim, which may include the veteran\u2019s military  service records and treatment records from VA medical facilities and  private medical service providers. Also, if necessary for reaching a  decision on a claim, VBA arranges for the veteran to receive a medical  examination conducted by clinicians (including physicians, nurse  practitioners, or physician assistants) certified to perform the exams  under VA\u2019s Compensation and Pension program. Once a claim has all of  the necessary evidence, a VA rating specialist evaluates the claim and  determines whether the claimant is eligible for benefits. If so, the rating  specialist assigns a percentage rating. If VA finds that a veteran has one or  more service-connected disabilities with a combined rating of at least 10  percent, the agency will pay monthly compensation.

The IDES merges DOD and VA processes, so that  servicemembers begin their VA disability claim while they undergo their  DOD disability evaluation, rather than sequentially, making it possible for  them to receive VA disability benefits shortly after leaving military service.  Specifically, the IDES    merges DOD and VA\u2019s separate exam processes into a single exam process  conducted to VA standards. This single exam\u2014which may involve more  than one medical examination (for example, by different specialists)\u2014in  conjunction with the servicemembers\u2019 medical records, is used by military  service PEBs to make a determination of servicemembers\u2019 fitness for  continued military service, and by VA as evidence of service-connected  disabilities.

In addition, they also  examined IDES program costs. To determine whether they have achieved  their goals, the agencies surveyed servicemembers in the IDES pilot and  legacy systems and are using a data system\u2014called the Veterans Tracking  Application (VTA)\u2014that enables them to track case processing time and  appeals.

In addition, although DOD officials told us that they  planned to compare average processing times of pilot cases with a broader sample of legacy cases, and to determine whether fewer servicemembers  are appealing the findings of informal PEBs and formal PEBs in the pilot  compared with the legacy, the interim report did not include these  comparisons. In addition, in their planning documents for the IDES pilot,  DOD and VA indicated that they were establishing a goal to deliver VA  benefits to 80 percent of members in the IDES pilot within the 295- and  305-day time frames.

In addition, not all of the service branches are achieving the  same results.", "Servicemember satisfaction: Our review of the survey data that DOD used  for the interim report (as of February 2010), as well as a recent weekly  report, indicate that, on average, servicemembers in the IDES process  have had higher satisfaction levels than those who went through the  legacy process. In addition, a higher percentage of servicemembers who  went through the IDES process felt that the process was fair compared  with those who went through the legacy system. However,  servicemembers in the Air Force who went through the IDES pilot  indicated less satisfaction with the process than those who went through  the legacy system, though Air Force members represented a small  proportion of pilot cases\u2014about 7 percent of those enrolled in the pilot.

As of  August 29, 2010, the agencies missed the goal for active duty  servicemembers by 1 day, while still meeting the 305-day goal for reserve  component members by 7 days. Processing times have increased as  caseload has increased, from about 5,750 active cases in February to about  9,650 cases in August 2010.

Further, none of the four military services have  achieved this goal, although the Army has had the highest rate of cases (66  percent) meeting the goal, while only 42 percent of Air Force cases were  processed within the time frame (see fig. 5 for active duty and app. II for  reserve component)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Improvement Over the Legacy System Is Unknown Due to Gaps in Legacy Data", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA planned to compare the case processing times of  servicemembers in the IDES pilot and servicemembers who, between  fiscal years 2005 and 2009, were enrolled in the legacy system at pilot sites  prior to pilot implementation, but significant gaps in the legacy case data  preclude reliable comparisons. DOD compiled the legacy case data from  each of the military services and the VA, but the military services each had  slightly different disability evaluation processes, used different data  systems, and did not track the same information. As a result, information  needed to conduct a comparison is not available for all services. For  example, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force legacy data do not have  information on when the servicemember was referred into the disability  evaluation system and, as a result, case-processing time for the legacy  system DOD-wide cannot be known. DOD officials said they planned to  estimate legacy case processing time by approximating the dates that  servicemembers in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force were referred  into the disability evaluation process, but their methodology was based on  a limited number of Army cases (see app. I for further information). In  addition, for legacy cases across all military services, VA was not able to  provide data on the date VA benefits were delivered, so total case  processing time from referral to delivery of VA benefits cannot be  measured. However, while legacy case data are not sufficiently reliable for  comparison with the IDES overall, the Army\u2019s legacy data appear to be  reliable on some key processing dates, making some limited comparisons  possible. Our analysis of Army legacy data suggests that, under the legacy  process, active duty Army cases took 369 days to complete the DOD  legacy process and reach the VA rating phase\u2014though this figure does not  include time to complete the VA rating and provide the benefits to  servicemembers\u2014compared with 266 days to deliver VA benefits to  servicemembers under the pilot, according to the agencies\u2019 August weekly  report. However, Army comparisons cannot be generalized to the other  services.", "The agencies also planned to compare servicemembers\u2019 appeal rates in the  pilot and legacy systems, but similar gaps in the legacy data preclude a  comparison DOD-wide. For example, the legacy data that DOD compiled  did not contain data on appeals of informal PEB decisions to the formal  PEB in the Navy and Marines, and consequently the rate of appeals across  the military in the legacy system is unknown. While the Army\u2019s appeals  data appear to be more reliable, potentially making some limited  comparisons possible, the agencies\u2019 method for comparing pilot appeals  with legacy has limitations. DOD officials told us they are planning to  compare the proportion of informal PEB decisions that were appealed to a  formal PEB hearing in the pilot and legacy systems. However, this will not  take into account that, under the legacy system, a servicemember could  appeal the informal PEB\u2019s decision for two reasons\u2014because they were  dissatisfied with the fitness decision or the disability rating the PEB  assigned, while in the IDES, they can only appeal the informal PEB  decision to a formal PEB if they are dissatisfied with the fitness decision.  Under the IDES, servicemembers who disagree with the disability rating  can appeal to VA for a rating reconsideration. By not including appeals to  VA for rating reconsiderations, the agencies may overestimate the  decrease in appeals in the IDES pilot. For example, our analysis of data as  of early 2010 for the Army indicates that Army members in the pilot  appealed 7.5 percent of informal PEB decisions. However, when appeals  to VA are factored in, 13 percent of Army members in the pilot filed an  appeal, which is the same proportion as in the legacy system (see fig. 6).", "In addition to evaluating the three goals, DOD and VA initially planned a  cost-benefit analysis of the IDES program but have only completed an  analysis of costs. According to data provided to us in August 2010, DOD  projects that costs directly associated with implementing the IDES will be  $63 million greater per year when compared with the legacy system, after  full expansion of the IDES. In October 2010, VA reported to us total IDES  cost estimates of approximately $50 million for fiscal year 2011\u2014about  $33 million for VBA, which provides VA case managers and rating staff to  the IDES, and $17 million for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),  which provides medical staff to perform the single exams.

At Fort Carson, three VA case managers told us they were  handling about 900 cases when we visited in April 2010, for a caseload  ratio of roughly 1:300. At the time of our visit in June 2010, Fort Stewart  had over 750 active cases with two VA case managers, for a caseload ratio  of approximately 1:375. Although local officials we spoke with at both  sites told us that the numbers of VA case managers were insufficient, an  official at VA\u2019s central office told us that VA bases staffing of case  managers on the number of new (not pending) cases each month, and the  agencies\u2019 data indicates the average number of new cases per VA case  manager has been about 25 at each site. The VA official said that the  reason local case managers felt understaffed was likely due to other  process inefficiencies. In addition, the official told us VA can reassign staff  from other VA programs to assist case managers at IDES pilot sites as  needed. At some of the other pilot sites we visited, local officials also told  us they had concerns at times about the numbers of VA case managers  available to handle the site\u2019s caseload, but VA was able to add staff. VA  case managers at two Air Force sites we visited\u2014Travis and Vance Air  Force Bases\u2014indicated that their caseloads were manageable. We were  unable to independently determine the extent to which VA is meeting its  caseload target because VA does not collect national data on actual  caseloads per case manager.", "DOD board liaisons: At most of the sites we visited, local officials  expressed concerns about insufficient numbers of DOD board liaisons,  who serve as servicemembers\u2019 DOD case managers. DOD guidance has  been inconsistent on the caseload target for DOD board liaisons. While  DOD\u2019s operations manual for the IDES pilot sets a caseload target of at  most 30 cases per board liaison, guidance on the general disability  evaluation system sets the target at a maximum of 20 cases per liaison.  DOD and VA\u2019s documents related to planning for IDES expansion indicate  that DOD is striving for a 1:20 caseload target in the IDES. However, 19 of  the 27 pilot sites did not meet the 1:30 caseload target, and 23 did not meet  the 1:20 target (see fig. 10).", "Local DOD and VA officials attributed staffing shortages to higher than  anticipated caseloads and difficulty finding qualified staff in rural areas. At  several of the pilot sites we visited, officials said that caseloads were  higher than the initial estimates that they had based staffing levels upon.  DOD officials said that they had based caseload estimates on a 1-year  history of caseload at each site. While some sites have added staff as  caseloads increased, others, such as Fort Polk, located in central  Louisiana, have had difficulty finding qualified staff, particularly  physicians, in this rural area.", "Two of the pilot sites we visited\u2014Fort Carson and Fort Stewart\u2014were  particularly challenged to provide staff in response to surges in caseload,  which occurred when Army units were preparing to deploy to combat  zones. Through the Army\u2019s predeployment medical assessment process,  large numbers of servicemembers were determined to be unable to deploy  due to a medical condition and were referred to the IDES within a short  period of time, overwhelming the staff. These two sites were unable to  quickly increase staffing levels, particularly clinicians performing the  single exam. The VA medical center conducting the single medical exams  for Fort Carson experienced turnover among its examiners at the same  time that the caseload surged, while at Fort Stewart, the contractor  performing the single medical exams had difficulties finding qualified  physicians in a rural area of Georgia. To address caseload surges,  examiners were reassigned from other locations to the pilot sites. For  example, VA officials told us they assigned examiners from other VA  medical centers to the Fort Carson IDES and established a contract with a  private-sector provider to complete the exams that VA examiners would  normally have performed for veterans in the area claiming VA disability  compensation. At Fort Stewart, the contractor told us that they had  reassigned examiners from their Atlanta clinic to Fort Stewart."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insufficiency of Exam Summaries and Disagreements about Medical Diagnoses and Ratings Can Prolong Case Processing Time", "paragraphs": ["Issues related to the completeness and clarity of single exam summaries  were an additional cause of delays in the VA rating phase of the IDES  process. Officials from VA rating offices said that some exam summaries  did not contain information necessary to make a rating or fitness decision,  or were unclear as to the examiners\u2019 diagnoses and conclusions. As a  result, VA rating office staff must ask the examiner to clarify the summary  or add information and, in some cases, redo the exam, adding time to the  process. In addition, VA rating staff told us that it is sometimes unclear  who they should contact if they identify insufficiencies in an exam  summary and finding the appropriate person also adds time. However, the  extent to which insufficient exam summaries caused delays in the IDES  process is unknown because DOD and VA\u2019s VTA system does not track  whether an exam summary had to be returned to the examiner or whether  it was resolved. Due to these limitations, VA officials told us that VA rating  staff have created logs of outstanding insufficient exams and sent them to  VA examiners to correct.", "VA officials attributed the problems with exam summaries to several  factors, including the difficulty of conducting exams for IDES pilot cases,  which may entail evaluating many complex medical conditions and may  involve several physicians and specialists. In addition, VA officials  indicated that, at sites with exam backlogs, such as at Fort Carson, it may  be difficult for examiners to ensure quality when are trying to complete  exams quickly. Furthermore, VA staff noted that some errors were  common, such as missing information for musculoskeletal conditions and  traumatic brain injury, suggesting that some examiners may not be aware  of the information required for certain types of medical conditions.  Finally, while examiners are supposed to receive the servicemember\u2019s  complete medical records prior to the date of the exam, some VA  examiners also told us that they did not receive the records in time for the  exam in some cases, or the records were not well-organized. As a result,  they lacked key information, such as the servicemember\u2019s medical history  and results of laboratory tests. According to the agencies\u2019 operations  manual for the IDES pilot, the DOD board liaison should compile the  complete medical records within 10 days of an active duty servicemember  being referred to the IDES, but some DOD officials we spoke with said  that it is sometimes difficult to obtain all of the records, particularly when  servicemembers have received treatment from private-sector physicians.", "In addition, while the single exam in the IDES eliminates duplicative exams  performed by DOD and VA in the legacy system, it raises the potential for  there to be disagreements about diagnoses of servicemembers\u2019 conditions,  with implications for their disability ratings, as well as processing times.  DOD officials we spoke with in our interviews and site visits also said that  their physicians sometimes disagree with VA medical diagnoses, particularly  for mental health conditions, and this has extended processing times for  some cases. In addition, since medical diagnoses are a basis for VA\u2019s  disability ratings, DOD may subsequently disagree with the ratings VA  completed for determining DOD disability benefits. The number of cases  with disagreements about diagnoses and ratings, and the extent to which  they have increased processing time, are unknown because the VTA system  does not track when a case has had such disagreements. However, officials  at 4 of the 10 pilot sites we visited said that military physicians have  disagreed with VA diagnoses in at least some cases. In addition, PEB  officials in two of the three military services\u2014the Army and the Navy\u2014said  that they have sometimes disagreed with the rating VA produced for  determining DOD disability benefits.", "An example can illustrate the implications of differences in diagnoses.  Officials at Army pilot sites informed us about cases in which a military  physician had treated members for a mental condition, such as anxiety or  depressive disorder. However, when the members went to see the VA  examiners for their single exam, the examiners diagnosed them with  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When such cases were sent to the  PEB, it returned them to the MEB because it was unclear to the PEB  which conditions should be the basis of their decision on the  servicemembers\u2019 fitness for duty. The cases then languished because the  military physicians experienced difficulties resolving the discrepancy with  the VA diagnosis.", "To address such processing delays, the Army issued guidance in February  2010 stating that MEB physicians should review all of the medical records  (including the results of the single exam) and determine whether to revise  their diagnoses. If after doing so the MEB physician maintains that their  original diagnosis is accurate, they should write a memorandum  summarizing the basis of their decision, and the PEB should accept the  MEB\u2019s diagnosis. Some Army officials we spoke with believe that this  guidance has been helpful for enabling cases to move forward when there  are differences in diagnoses. The other services do not have written  guidance on how to address differences in diagnoses, though Navy  officials told us that they have provided verbal guidance to their  physicians, and Air Force officials said they have not had cases with  significant disagreements about diagnoses.", "In some cases, due to the differences in diagnoses, DOD has also disagreed  with the rating that VA prepared for DOD disability benefits, particularly in  cases involving servicemembers with mental health conditions. For  example, Army and Navy officials told us about cases in which the PEB  found the servicemember unfit due to a mental condition, such as major  depression, and asked VA to complete a rating for this condition.  However, VA returned a rating for occupational and social impairment  caused by PTSD, since the examiner had diagnosed the member with  PTSD. DOD requires a rating for only the conditions for which the member  was found unfit for duty because it can only provide disability benefits for  those conditions. However, according to VA regulations for rating mental  disorders, VA does not rate each mental health condition individually;  rather, VA bases its rating on the degree to which the combination of  symptoms of mental disorders cause occupational and social  impairment. As such, when rating mental health conditions for IDES  cases, VA officials said that rating specialists would consider both the  symptoms of mental conditions diagnosed by DOD physicians and those  identified by the VA examiner. Both Army and Navy PEB officials said that  they generally accept VA ratings in these cases, even though the rating is  not for the unfitting conditions alone. However, they noted that, if they  feel the VA rating is in error, there is no guidance on how disagreements  about servicemembers\u2019 ratings should be resolved. Army and Navy  officials said that they may return the case to VA and informally requ est  that they reconsider the case, though Navy PEB officials said that they are  hesitant to do so because it may further delay the case.", "DOD and VA officials attributed disagreements about diagnoses to several  factors. They noted that VA examiners may not have received or reviewed  the servicemembers\u2019 medical records prior to the exam, and therefore may  not be aware of the medical conditions for which the members had been  previously diagnosed and treated. In addition, DOD and VA identify  conditions for different purposes in the disability evaluation system. While  DOD identifies conditions that make a servicemember unable to perform  their duties, VA identifies all service-connected conditions. As such, VA  examiners are likely to identify a broader set of conditions than DOD\u2019s  physicians. In addition, local officials we spoke with in some of our site  visits said that servicemembers may be more willing to disclose all of their  medical conditions to VA than to DOD because VA could potentially  compensate them for all of the conditions. Furthermore, VA officials noted  that servicemembers\u2019 health conditions may have changed between the  time DOD physicians identified the conditions and VA performed the  exam. Finally, DOD and VA officials said that differences in opinions about  diagnoses are common among physicians, particularly in the mental health  field. For example, they noted that it be can be difficult to distinguish  PTSD from anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pilot Sites Faced Various Logistical Challenges Integrating VA Staff", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA officials at several pilot sites said that they experienced some  logistical challenges integrating VA staff at the military facilities. At a few  sites, it took time for VA staff to receive common access cards needed to  access the military facilities and to use the facilities\u2019 computer systems.  During the time that VA staff did not have access cards, they were unable  to access VA computer systems, such as those for establishing the VA  claim, requesting exams, and viewing exam results, via DOD\u2019s network.", "In addition, DOD and VA staff noted several difficulties using the agencies\u2019  multiple information technology (IT) systems to process cases. While the  agencies both use the VTA system to manage cases, VA also has IT  systems for completing certain tasks, and the military services also have  their own case tracking systems. This causes DOD and VA staff to have to  enter the same data multiple times into different IT systems. In addition,  some VA staff working on military bases reported that using the military  services\u2019 computer systems to access VA systems has significantly slowed  down computer processing speeds. Finally, DOD and VA staff cannot  directly access each others\u2019 systems, making it more cumbersome for case  managers to determine the status of servicemembers\u2019 cases. For example,  without access to VA\u2019s system for managing exams, DOD board liaisons  cannot readily provide servicemembers with information on when or  where their exams are scheduled and must contact VA case managers to  obtain the information. A few sites we visited were able to address some  IT issues. For example, at Fort Polk, VA officials said they were adding a  new telecommunications line to provide faster computer processing  speeds for their staff.", "In addition, VA physicians working at military facilities need to be  credentialed by DOD before they can begin working on base, which  involves verification of their education, license, and clinical history.

Data on legacy cases are not sufficiently reliable to determine whether this  is the case military-wide, but Army data appear to be sufficiently reliable  to allow for some limited analysis. Our analysis of Army pilot and legacy  data as of early 2010 shows that compared with legacy cases, active duty  cases in the pilot took on average 39 more days to reach the end of the  PEB phase\u2014the last step of the DOD disability evaluation process before  servicemembers begin transitioning from military service or, if found fit,  back to duty. For reserve component cases in the Army, IDES pilot cases  took on average 17 more days to reach the end of the PEB phase,  compared with legacy cases. It was not possible to conduct this analysis  for the other military services because their legacy data lacked  information on when servicemembers were referred into the disability  evaluation system.", "Some DOD officials noted that the increased time that servicemembers are  in the military\u2019s disability evaluation process means that they must be  cared for and managed for a longer period. Officials in our site visits and  interviews said that some pilot sites have had challenges housing  servicemembers in the IDES, in part due to servicemembers being in the  process longer. For some servicemembers in the disability evaluation  system, the military services may move them to temporary medical units  or, for those needing longer-term medical care or complex case  management, to special medical units such as a Warrior Transition Unit in  the Army or Wounded Warrior Regiment in the Marine Corps. However,  these units were full at a few pilot sites we visited, or members in the IDES  did not meet the criteria for entering the special medical units. Where  servicemembers remain with their units while going through the disability  evaluation system, the units cannot replace them with able-bodied  members. Officials at Fort Carson said that this created a challenge for  combat units. Because most servicemembers in the IDES did not meet the  criteria for entering Warrior Transition Units, combat units had to find  another organizational unit to take charge of members in the IDES so they  could replace them with soldiers ready and able to deploy to combat  areas. In addition, officials at Naval Medical Center San Diego and Fort  Carson said that some members are not gainfully employed by their units  and, left idle while waiting to complete their disability evaluation process,  are more likely to engage in negative behavior, potentially resulting in  their being discharged due to misconduct and a forfeiture of disability  benefits. We were unable to assess the extent or cause of this problem  because the VTA system that tracks servicemembers in the IDES does not  capture sufficient detail on reasons for servicemembers dropping out of  the IDES, or which organizational unit(s) the servicemember was assigned  to while in the IDES.

At each site, local DOD and VA officials are expected to work together to  prepare for implementation. This includes completing a site assessment  matrix\u2014a checklist of information DOD and VA officials at each site  should obtain and preparations they should make. While most pilot sites  had used a site assessment matrix to prepare for IDES implementation, the  agencies completed a significant revision of the matrix in August 2010, and  they now request additional information and documentation to address  areas where prior IDES sites had experienced challenges. In addition,  while during the pilot phase local DOD and VA officials were encouraged  to develop written agreements on IDES procedures, the matrix now  requests that a written agreement be completed prior to implementing the  IDES. Finally, senior-level local DOD and VA officials will be expected to  sign the site assessment matrix to certify that a site is ready for IDES  implementation. This differs from the pilot phase where, according to  DOD and VA officials, some sites implemented the IDES without having  been fully prepared. In addition, in September 2010, the military services  and VA held preimplementation training conferences for local DOD and  VA staff. At the time of our review, the first 28 expansion sites were  completing their site assessment matrices.", "Through the new site assessment matrix and other initiatives under way,  DOD and VA are addressing several of the challenges identified in the pilot  phase. These include ensuring sufficient exam and case management staff,  being prepared to deal with surges in caseloads, addressing exam  sufficiency issues, and making adequate logistical arrangements.", "Ensuring sufficient exam resources: The matrix asks whether a site can  complete single exams within the IDES\u2019 45-day time frame and within  DOD\u2019s TRICARE access standards.  The matrix asks for detailed  information, such as who will conduct the exams (VA, VA contractor, or  military providers), where the exams will be conducted, and VA\u2019s  anticipated overall volume of disability compensation and pension exams  in the area. In addition to the matrix, VA has several initiatives under way  to increase resources and expedite exams. VA plans to award a new  contract under which it can acquire examiners for sites that do not have  sufficient staff to perform exams, such as sites located where VA does not  have medical facilities or in rural areas where VA has had difficulty hiring  staff. VA has also recently changed its exam policy so that exams  performed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants certified to  perform disability exams no longer have to be cosigned by a physician,  which is expected to expedite completion of more exam reports.", "Ensuring sufficient VA rating staff: VA officials said that they have hired  new staff to replace those that recently left the Baltimore rating office and  anticipate hiring a small number of additional staff. Based on caseload  projections, they expect that, once the additional staff are hired, the  Baltimore office will be close to having sufficient rating staff. Although VA  officials said that the Baltimore office conducted ratings for a majority of  cases during the IDES pilot phase, they have projected that the workload  will be divided almost evenly between the Baltimore and Seattle offices  once the IDES is fully expanded worldwide.", "Ensuring sufficient DOD PEB adjudicators: Air Force officials informed  us they added adjudicators for the informal PEB and have since eliminated  their case backlog.

In addition, according to DOD  officials, each of the military services is increasing its board liaison  staffing levels to achieve 1:20 caseload ratios.

In addition, the matrix asks sites to anticipate  any surges in caseloads, such as those due to seasonal trends. Sites are  also expected to provide a written contingency plan for dealing with  caseload surges. In addition, the matrix asks sites to develop a system for  communicating updates, such as information on expected caseload surges,  to stakeholders. VA officials also said that the Army has agreed to keep  them better informed of deployments that could result in caseload surges.  Further, VA officials noted that they are developing a plan for addressing  the additional need for examiners during surges, through which VA offices  with lower demand for disability exams would send examiners to an IDES  site experiencing a surge in exam workloads.", "Ensuring the sufficiency of single exams: The site assessment matrix  asks sites whether all staff who will conduct exams are trained to VA  standards and certified by VA to conduct disability compensation and  pension exams. In addition, VA has begun the process of revising its exam  templates, to better ensure that examiners include the information needed  for a VA disability rating decision and enable them to complete their exam  reports in less time. Finally, a VA official stated that VA is examining  whether it can add capabilities to the VTA system that would enable staff  to identify where problems with exams have occurred and track the  progress of their resolution. For sites that choose to have military  physicians perform the single exams, VA officials said that they have  provided materials to DOD from their national training program, and DOD  has made these materials accessible on its Web site.

For example, the matrix asks  whether the military treatment facility will address the needs of VA staff  for access cards, identification badges, and security clearances, and  whether all VA medical providers will be credentialed and privileged to  practice at the DOD facility. In terms of IT, the matrix asks whether DOD  sites will enable VA staff access to VA information systems needed to  perform their duties. The matrix also asks sites to identify IT contacts  from both VA and DOD so that they may work together to resolve IT  problems. Furthermore, DOD and VA are developing a general  memorandum of agreement on IDES information sharing. This agreement  is intended to enable DOD and VA staff access to each other\u2019s IT systems,  for example, to allow DOD staff to track the status of VA exams. DOD  officials also said that they are developing two new IT solutions.  According to officials, one system currently being tested would help  military treatment facilities better manage their cases.

For example, sites are  not asked about the capacity of their medical hold units or special units  for wounded servicemembers, or to identify other options if their existing  units do not have sufficient capacity for their projected IDES caseload.

In  addition, a VA official stated that VA is developing new procedures for  identifying cases with potential for multiple mental health diagnoses and  will ask VA examiners to review the servicemembers\u2019 medical records and  reconcile differing diagnoses. However, since the new guidance and  procedures are still being developed, we cannot determine whether they  will resolve discrepancies or disagreements.

Insufficient staffing  of any one part of the process is likely to lead to bottlenecks, delaying not  only servicemembers\u2019 receipt of disability benefits, but also their  separation from the military and reentry into civilian life. In addition,  DOD\u2019s preparations of sites for the IDES do not ensure that military  facilities have adequate capacity or plans for housing and providing  organizational oversight over servicemembers in the IDES, who potentially  could remain at the locations for extended periods of time.

Specifically, we compared 12 date fields in the VTA  against a random sample of paper files for 54 completed cases: 24 from the  three Army PEBs, 10 from the Air Force PEB, and 20 from the Navy PEB  (10 Navy cases and 10 Marine Corps).

For example, only Army  cases had information on when servicemembers were referred to the MEB  process. In addition, the legacy data did not include the date on when  servicemembers received VA benefits\u2014which is necessary for measuring  the full length of the legacy process. Without sufficient data on the  beginning (when servicemembers were referred into the system) or end of  the process (when they received VA benefits), we concluded that the full  case processing time in the legacy system cannot be known.

Specifically, to  approximate referral dates, they said they would use the average time for  Army cases between when the servicemember was referred and when the  MEB documentation identifying the servicemember\u2019s potentially unfitting  medical conditions (i.e., the narrative summary) was completed, which  they calculated to be 60 days. For Navy and Marine Corps cases, they then  subtracted 60 days from the date of the narrative summary to estimate a  referral date and, for Air Force cases, they did so from the date of the MEB  decision. However, because only 11 percent of Army legacy cases had a  narrative summary date, the estimate of 60 days is based on a small  number of cases (see table 3).
