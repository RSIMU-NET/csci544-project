The Mint spent $67.1 million to promote the new dollar coin from 1998 to 2001, including expenditures for a marketing and advertising program; public relations and publicity programs; 23 partnerships with banking, entertainment retail, grocery and restaurant chains; and promotional events with transit agencies. Most of the $67.1 million was used for a national advertising campaign to build public awareness, generate acceptance, and encourage use of the new dollar coin. The Mint also worked with contractors to stimulate the new dollar coin's use in state and local government operations and used its own staff for marketing activities in federal government facilities, but it did not track the costs for the use of Mint staff. According to the Mint, between January 2000 and December 2001, the new dollar coin had generated $1.1 billion in revenue and $968 million in seigniorage. The Mint faces several barriers in its efforts to increase the new dollar coin. The most substantial barrier is the current widespread use of the dollar bill in everyday transactions and public resistance to begin using the new dollar coin. Other barriers that hinder wider circulation include (1) negative perceptions the public may have of the coin after two failed introductions, (2) lack of public information about the savings to the government from using the new coin, (3) lack of public awareness about the comparative advantages of the dollar coin over the dollar bill, and (4) the idea that the ease of carrying the bill is more beneficial than the durability of the dollar coin. In general, the Mint's marketing plan describes a program that is much smaller in scope than the marketing campaign used to launch the new dollar coin in 2000. The Mint plans to address some, but not all, of the barriers to increasing use and recognizes that successfully achieving widespread use of the new dollar coin will be difficult if the dollar bill cocirculates with the new dollar coin. The Mint's 2001 report to Congress did not fully and accurately describe the costs of the marketing campaign, the results obtained, and problems encountered. The 2002 report gave more details on marketing costs and a fuller description of the problems encountered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["If the public uses the dollar coin rather than the dollar note, the  government could potentially save up to $500 million annually, depending  on the amount of use.

To obtain information on and assess the  barriers the Mint faces in increasing the public\u2019s use of the new dollar coin,  we analyzed Mint documents; interviewed officials from the Mint, its  contractors, and trade associations; and surveyed the Mint\u2019s promotional  partners, asking them about any problems they encountered during their  promotions. We interviewed officials at the Mint, the Federal Reserve  Board, and various trade associations and reviewed Mint documents and  the 2002 new dollar coin marketing plan to obtain information on the Mint\u2019s  plans to overcome barriers to increasing commercial use of the new dollar  coin. To assess the extent that the Mint\u2019s 2001 and 2002 reports to Congress  fully and accurately described the marketing of the new dollar coin, results  obtained, and problems encountered, we analyzed the reports and  compared the information in them with the information we obtained in  addressing our other objectives. We also reviewed information on the  introduction and circulation of the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, including  hearing transcripts and our previous reports on new dollar coin proposals.  Appendix I provides further details about our objectives, scope, and  methodology.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of the  Treasury, the Director of the Mint, and the Chairman of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The comments we received are  discussed near the end of this letter and reproduced in appendixes III and  IV. We did our work in Washington, D.C., between September 2001 and  September 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 authorized the new dollar coin to  replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, which began production in 1979.  Even though the Anthony coin was never widely circulated, it became clear  by 1997 that the government\u2019s supply of Anthony coins would soon be  exhausted. In addition to giving the Mint authority to develop a new dollar  coin, the act also specified that the coin be golden in color and have a  distinctive edge and tactile and visual features to make it easier to  distinguish from the quarter-dollar coin. To ensure that the new dollar coin  would be recognized by vending machines and other coin-operated  equipment designed for the Anthony dollar coin, the new dollar coin is the  same size and has a similar electromagnetic signature that is similar to the  Anthony dollar coin.", "The $1 Coin Act authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation  with Congress, to select the design of the new coin. In May 1998, the  Secretary established a Dollar Coin Advisory Committee to consider  alternatives and recommend a design concept for the obverse (heads) side  of the coin. The final design selected was an artist\u2019s rendition of  Sacagawea, a Shoshone interpreter who assisted the Lewis and Clark  expedition of 1804-06 to the Pacific Ocean.", "The act also required the Secretary to create a marketing program to  promote the use of the new dollar coin by commercial enterprises; mass  transit authorities; and federal, state, and local government agencies. The  Mint marketing program had three major components, including research  to identify market opportunities, a national public awareness and  education program that included a national advertising campaign, and a  business marketing program that was designed to increase commercial use  of the new dollar coin in targeted sectors. According to the Mint, the first  shipments of the new dollars were sent to the Federal Reserve on January  18, 2000, and the Federal Reserve sent shipments to financial institutions  beginning January 26, 2000. The Mint also shipped new dollar coins directly  to Wal-Mart stores to support a large, nationwide promotion of the coin  that began on January 30, 2000.", "While authorizing the production of a new dollar coin, the $1 Coin Act also  provided that the dollar note should not be removed from circulation on  the basis of provisions in the act. In authorizing the circulation of both the  dollar note and dollar coin, the act did not establish a goal for the number  of new dollar coins or establish a level of dollar coin circulation compared  with the dollar note. The act also required the Secretary to conduct a study  on the progress of new dollar coin marketing program and submit a report  to Congress on the results of the study no later than March 31, 2001. The  Mint submitted a March 30, 2001, report to Congress.", "In reports accompanying the 2002 Treasury and General Government  Appropriations Bill, the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations  expressed concern that the Mint\u2019s 2001 report to Congress did not  adequately describe the nature and extent to which the new dollar coin was  being used in commerce. The House report directed the Mint to submit a  new report by March 31, 2002. In addition, the Senate report  accompanying the 2002 Treasury and General Government Appropriations  Bill also expressed concern that it had not received information on the  contracts and agreements secured between the Mint and nongovernment  entities and public relations firms mentioned in the Mint\u2019s March 30, 2001,  report. The Mint submitted its second report on March 29, 2002.", "A Senate committee report and the Conference Report accompanying the  2002 Treasury and General Government Appropriations Bill further  directed the Mint to submit a marketing plan to the Appropriations  Committees and stipulated that the plan must be approved by the  committees before the Mint could draw additional funds from the Mint  Public Enterprise Fund to promote the new dollar coin. The Mint submitted  its plan, the \u201cGolden Dollar Coin Marketing Plan for Congress,\u201d on April 24,  2002.", "In March 2002, coins of all denominations made up 5 percent, or $32.1  billion, of the $642 billion in currency and coins that were in circulation.  The demand for coins from businesses and the general public fluctuates,  and the Mint and the Federal Reserve monitor several factors, such as  economic growth, coin collection activity, and Reserve Bank coin  inventories, to determine the number of coins that will be produced and  shipped to the Federal Reserve. The Mint receives orders for coins from  Federal Reserve Banks on a monthly basis and normally ships coins  directly to Reserve Bank offices. The Federal Reserve provides coins to  over 11,000 of the 20,000 U.S. depository institutions, such as banks,  savings and loans, and credit unions. Smaller banks that do not order their  cash and coins directly from the Federal Reserve obtain cash services  through many of the larger banks. In addition to Federal Reserve offices,  Reserve Banks use over 100 coin terminals generally operated by armored  carriers to store and distribute coins. Besides functioning as Federal  Reserve coin terminal operators, the armored carriers wrap and deliver  coins for a fee to banks and retail customers to meet public demand.  Reserve Banks normally fill coin orders from banks by first paying out  previously circulated coin until this inventory is depleted and then by using  new coin inventories to meet demand.", "To support the introduction and promotion of the new dollar coin, the  Federal Reserve departed from its normal policy and held all previously  circulated Anthony dollar coins received by Reserve Banks and filled  orders only with new dollar coins. However, in January 2002, Reserve  Banks returned to their normal practice of filling orders with previously  circulated coins. Nevertheless, Reserve Banks will continue filling requests  for new dollar coins until their inventories of new dollar coins are depleted.  On the basis of the public demand for the dollar coin, the Federal Reserve  estimated that, at the end of April 2002, it had over a 1-year supply of dollar  coins. Since the older Anthony and new dollar coin have a similar  electronic signature and neither the Reserve Banks nor armored carriers  have equipment to separate them, the supply of circulated coins consists  largely of commingled Anthony and new dollar coins. The Federal Reserve  estimated that, as of April 2002, 70 percent of the dollar coin inventory is  commingled Anthony and new dollar coins and about 30 percent is new  dollar coins. In its response to a March 2002 Treasury Office of Inspector  General report, the Mint said it would temporarily suspend production of  the new dollar coin on March 31, 2002, and reevaluate the need for  producing coins for general circulation in the first quarter of fiscal year  2003.", "In our May 1990 report on proposals to introduce a new dollar coin in the  United States, we noted that the government did not successfully manage  the introduction of the Anthony dollar coin because the dollar note was not  simultaneously eliminated, the coin too closely resembled the quarter, and  the coin was not effectively promoted. We identified several key  ingredients for a successful conversion, including a reasonable transition  period, a well-designed dollar coin, a public awareness campaign, support  from the administration and Congress, and withdrawal of the dollar note  from circulation. We estimated in April 2000 that replacing the dollar note  with a coin would save the government an average of $500 million a year,  because coins last much longer than currency and there are lower  government costs to distribute coins than currency.", "The new dollar coin is profitable on a per unit basis. While it costs the Mint  about $0.12 to produce the coin, the government receives $1.00 of spending  power for each coin, thereby leaving a margin of $0.88 per coin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Dollar Coin Marketing Program Cost $67.1 Million and Generated $968 Million in Seigniorage, but the Coin Is Not Widely Circulated", "paragraphs": ["The Mint spent at least $67.1 million to promote the new dollar coin from  1998 to 2001, including $62.3 million for four contracts involved with  creating the marketing program and advertisements. Of the remaining $4.8  million, the Mint spent $0.4 million to conduct public relations events and  programs to publicize the new dollar coin\u2019s launch that distributed  1,251,000 coins; $4.4 million for 23 promotion partnerships with banking,  entertainment, retail, grocery, and restaurant chains that distributed an  estimated 132 million dollar coins; and $36,000 to conduct promotional  events with transit systems that distributed 36,000 coins. Most of the $62.3  million in contracts for creating the marketing program and advertisements  was used for a $40.5 million national advertising campaign featuring  George Washington that was designed to build public awareness, generate  acceptance, and encourage the new dollar coin\u2019s use. The Mint also worked  with contractors to stimulate the new dollar coin\u2019s use in state and local  government operations and used its own staff for marketing activities in  federal government facilities. However, the Mint did not track the costs for  the use of Mint staff for these efforts.", "Though initial public awareness generated by the advertising was strong,  the new dollar coin, like the Anthony dollar coin, has failed to achieve  widespread use. Federal Reserve data show a net payout of 558 million  new dollar coins in 2000, the year the dollar coin was introduced. But, in  2001, demand and public interest in collecting the new dollar coin dropped,  and the net payout decreased by 65 percent to 194 million coins and  remained at lower levels in the first half of 2002. In May 2002, the Federal  Reserve estimated an annualized figure of $120 million in new dollar coin  net payout for 2002. The Mint has estimated that people use the dollar coin  in 4 percent of dollar transactions, but Mint data from July 2001 show it to  be about 1 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Marketing Contractors Conducted Key Components of the New Dollar Coin Marketing Program", "paragraphs": ["To create and execute the new dollar coin marketing program, the Mint  contracted with outside firms for the three major components of the  program: research, business marketing, and a public awareness campaign.  The research component, designed to help identify target markets for the  new dollar coin before its January 2000 launch, was conducted under a $1.5  million contract with Marketbridge, a marketing services company. To  provide the Mint with the necessary market research data, Marketbridge  first analyzed existing Anthony dollar coin use in various industry sectors.  Marketbridge also analyzed each industry for potential new dollar coin use  by looking at several factors, such as the size of the industry, the average  transaction size, and the current coin equipment capability in that industry.  Using this market analysis, Marketbridge determined that certain industry  sectors, such as food and drink vending, postal machines, transit systems,  and car washes, had the highest potential for new dollar coin use. Table 1  provides information on the Mint\u2019s marketing program contractors.", "The Mint contracted with Double Eagle in April 1999 to perform business  marketing activities that concentrated on outreach to businesses in certain  industry sectors to increase the commercial use of the coin. Double Eagle  focused its marketing efforts on businesses with a high potential for using  the coin. To persuade these businesses, such as food and drink vending,  transit, postal, car wash, and retail industries, to use the new dollar coin,  Double Eagle conducted various business marketing activities, including  personal sales visits and telephone calls to decision-makers, and attended  conventions and meetings. The Double Eagle contract totaled $8 million. In  June 2000, the Mint determined that it was not satisfied with Double Eagle\u2019s  progress and terminated the contract. In October 2000, the Mint contracted  with Fleishman Hillard for $4 million, to take over the responsibilities for  business marketing.", "The Mint also secured the services of the Fleishman Hillard  communications firm in May 1999 to create and implement the public  awareness and education campaign. Fleishman Hillard first conducted  public opinion polls and focus groups before the new dollar coin\u2019s launch  in January 2000 to assess consumer attitudes and create and test the  advertising campaign. In tests of potential advertising campaigns, focus  group participants generally preferred the \u201cGolden Dollar\u201d to the  Sacagawea or Millennium dollar coin. To budget ad dollars and to reach  those more likely to use coin-operated technology, such as vending  machines and public transit, the Mint established the primary target  audience as 18- to 49-year-old adults who live in urban and suburban areas.", "The $40.5 million paid advertising campaign that was developed to  communicate to this target audience included 11 weeks of ads on television  nationwide and print, radio, transit, and Internet ads. The paid advertising  campaign, which began in March 2000, accounted for approximately two- thirds of the contracted new dollar coin marketing program expenditures  between 1998 and 2002. The media plan for the advertising campaign  featuring an image of George Washington was designed to build positive  awareness, generate acceptance, and encourage the coin\u2019s use. The  television ads reached an estimated 92 percent of the target audience an  average of 15 times.", "The ad featured the image of George Washington from the dollar bill;  however, the Mint reported that, according to Treasury officials, it could  not point directly to the advantages of the dollar coin over the dollar bill in  its television advertising campaign. One television ad proposal, for  example, had a scene showing a dollar bill being rejected from a vending  machine. According to Mint officials, that part of the ad was not approved  and was never aired because some Treasury officials thought that it  negatively portrayed the dollar bill. Current Mint officials said that a former  Mint Director participated in the meeting in which the ad was discussed,  and that they do not know which Treasury officials were at the meeting.  Current Mint officials also said the policy to avoid direct comparisons of  the dollar coin to the dollar bill was not a formal written policy. According  to a current Treasury official, the $1 Coin Act authorizing the new dollar  coin called for both the dollar coin and the dollar note to cocirculate and  Treasury interprets that to mean that it should not favor the coin or the  note. The Treasury official said that the Mint and the Bureau of Engraving  and Printing are sister agencies that can create public awareness  campaigns for new coins and notes without directly comparing the  advantages and disadvantages of each.", "As part of the marketing program, the Mint and Fleishman Hillard also  developed a public relations campaign to support the new dollar coin\u2019s  launch, which included a float in the Macy\u2019s Day Parade in November 1999.  The new dollar coin was also featured in promotions with Coinstar, a  company that operates supermarket-based coin-counting machines; the  Wheel of Fortune game show; and General Mills\u2019s Cheerios. These  promotions resulted in the distribution of 1,251,000 coins and cost  $413,500, according to Mint data.", "The Mint also formed a retail partnership with Wal-Mart to distribute the  dollar coin as change at its 2,900 Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club stores  throughout the United States beginning in January 2000. In addition to the  Wal-Mart agreement, between 2000 and 2001, the Mint created a number of  promotion partnerships in many of the targeted industry sectors with  potential dollar coin circulation. As table 2 indicates, the Mint formed 23  promotion partnerships to stimulate use of the new dollar coin. Most of the  estimated 132 million dollar coins distributed during the promotions were  to customers in the retail, banking, entertainment, restaurant, and grocery  industries.", "In general, the Mint said it tried to achieve a ratio of 10 new dollar coins  distributed for every dollar in marketing costs. The Mint reported that the  promotions, on average, distributed 30 dollar coins for every dollar in  marketing cost. However, the actual number of new dollar coins distributed  may have been more or less than the number shown, because the Mint did  not track the actual number of coins distributed by each promotion  partner.", "The Mint also marketed to state, local, and federal governments to increase  the use of the new dollar coin. For example, the Mint and Fleishman Hillard  conducted promotional events to increase the use of the coin in the transit  systems in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Diego. The  promotional events included a giveaway of free new dollar coins to transit  riders for fare card purchases and radio and newspaper coverage of the  promotions. The transit promotions resulted in the distribution of about  36,000 new dollar coins to transit riders. According to the Mint, the transit  promotions cost $36,000 in media and promotional items. In addition, as  part of the Mint marketing effort targeting state and local governments, the  Mint also worked with bridge and road authorities to increase the use of  the new dollar coin in tollbooths and encouraged cities to convert parking  meters to accept the coin. The Mint also conducted marketing events using  its own staff to stimulate use in the federal government facilities\u2019 retail  operations, such as cafeterias. For example, the Mint conducted a new  dollar coin day\u2019s event at the Pentagon during which about 56,000 new  dollar coins were distributed, but the Mint did not track the associated  costs for the use of Mint staff.", "The total cost of the new dollar coin marketing contracts, 23 partnerships,  and launch and transit promotions was $67.1 million, excluding costs  associated with using Mint staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Mint\u2019s Marketing Program Did Not Result in Wide Circulation", "paragraphs": ["The Mint\u2019s new dollar coin marketing program raised public awareness of  the new coin but did not produce long-term increases in circulation.  Regular surveys conducted by Fleishman Hillard to monitor the impact of  the new dollar coin marketing program indicated that the advertising  campaign and other marketing activities considerably increased public  awareness. According to the surveys, about 27 percent of the public was  aware of a new dollar coin in July 1999, shortly after the final dollar coin  design was announced. By July 2000, after the national advertising  campaign, awareness had increased to 91 percent. A December 2001 poll,  which is the latest available public opinion poll on new dollar coin  awareness, showed that public awareness of the dollar coin remained  relatively high, about 83 percent.", "As shown in figure 1, the demand for dollar coins as measured by net  payout to banks from the Federal Reserve peaked during the year that the  new dollar coin was introduced and has since decreased significantly. Net  payout of the Anthony dollar coin from the Federal Reserve was $72 million  in 1999, the year before the new dollar coin\u2019s release. However, with the  introduction of the new dollar coin in 2000, net payout and demand for  dollar coins increased sharply to $558 million. But, in 2001, demand and  public interest in collecting the new dollar coin dropped, and net payout  decreased by 65 percent to $194 million and remained at lower levels in the  first half of 2002. In May 2002, the Federal Reserve estimated an annualized  figure of $120 million in new dollar coin net payout for 2002.", "As of January 2002, the Mint said that it had produced 1.4 billion new dollar  coins and had about 300 million in inventory. According to the Mint, from  January 2000 to December 2001, it released approximately 1.1 billion new  dollar coins into circulation that generated approximately $968 million in  seigniorage after subtracting costs. According to the Federal Reserve, it  received approximately 980 million and paid out 964 million new dollar  coins during this period. The Federal Reserve held about 248 million dollar coins in inventory as of December 2001.

Encouraging people to switch to using the dollar coin is  especially difficult because retailers will not stock the dollar coin until they  see the public using it; the public is unlikely to use the coin until they see  retailers stocking it; and banks and armored carriers are reluctant to invest  in new equipment to handle the coin until there is wide demand for it. This  interdependency of demand, which economists call the \u201cnetwork effect,\u201d  will be difficult to overcome. Other countries, such as Australia, Canada,  and Japan and many European countries, have successfully introduced a  similar denomination coin but only by phasing out the note of the same  value. Other barriers that hinder wider circulation of the new dollar coin by  the public include potentially negative public perceptions of a dollar coin  after two failed introductions, insufficient public understanding of dollar  coin savings to the government and other advantages of the dollar coin\u2019s  use, and the weight and bulk of the coin. For commercial users, additional  barriers limit the coin\u2019s use. Among these are commingling with the  Anthony dollar coin, the coin\u2019s unavailability at some banks, packaging  concerns, and higher delivery fees. Problems unique to individual  promotion partners also created barriers to the new dollar coin\u2019s use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Resistance to Using New Dollar Coin Is the Most Substantial Barrier", "paragraphs": ["Our previous work and the early experience with the new dollar coin have  shown that the most substantial barrier is public resistance to switch to  using the dollar coin rather than the dollar bill in everyday transactions. To  overcome this resistance, the Mint will have to persuade businesses,  consumers, and suppliers to change at the same time. Increasing the coin\u2019s  use is especially difficult because of the network effects previously  discussed, which will be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome with the  dollar bill in circulation.", "Economists have noted that this phenomenon is not limited to dollar bills  and coins. For example, researchers noted in a February 1998 Federal  Reserve paper that network effects may help explain why the public,  despite apparent advantages, was switching so slowly from paper-based  forms of payment to electronic forms of payment. Network effects may  also help explain the country\u2019s slow adoption of high-definition television  (HDTV). Until demand reaches a certain level, television stations are  reluctant to make the investments in the new equipment that is necessary  to transmit HDTV; consumers, in turn, are reluctant to purchase HDTV sets  until more stations are transmitting HDTV signals. Similarly, until a  sufficient number of new dollar coins are in circulation, retailers and other  businesses that handle a lot of coins may not be willing to spend the time  and money needed to carry them.", "We have reported public resistance to new dollar coins in previous studies.  For example, in May 1990, we evaluated the acceptability of the dollar coin  to replace the dollar note by reviewing survey data and interviewing the  public and industry associations. In this study, we found public resistance  to a dollar coin in the United States. Nearly all of the general public and  private-sector respondents indicated that the dollar note would have to be  eliminated for a dollar coin to circulate successfully. These respondents  uniformly believed that if a dollar note and dollar coin were both available  at the same time, the public would choose to use the note.", "For our May 1990 report, we also contacted officials in other industrialized  countries and found that most of the countries that had introduced high- denomination coins faced public resistance to the change. Officials in these  countries said that a high-denomination coin could not be introduced  successfully unless the note of similar value was withdrawn. For example,  officials in the United Kingdom said that as long as the equivalent note  circulates, the public would resist new coins. Similarly, French officials  said the public accepted their new coin only when the note was  demonetized. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and Treasury  officials said, in our 1990 report, that the experience of many of the  European countries in successfully replacing a note with a coin of similar  value might not be a valid indicator of the prospects the United States  would have in mandating a dollar coin. These officials said that because of  basic differences in these countries, such as a parliamentary form of  government that made it easier to impose unpopular changes on the public,  a central banking system with more control over banks, and a smaller scale  of coin and currency, it would be much harder for the United States to  successfully replace a dollar coin with a dollar note.", "More recently, four of the European countries we reviewed in our 1990  report joined eight other European Union countries on January 1, 2002, and  introduced 56 billion new euro coins into circulation, which included 1- euro and 2-euro coins and a 5-euro note. (For more information on the euro  coins, see table 4.)", "In a March 1993 report on the dollar coin, we described Canada\u2019s  experience in introducing a dollar coin in June 1987. Canada stopped  issuing the equivalent dollar note in June 1989. We reported that the public  resisted the coin initially, but 3 years after the note was withdrawn,  according to public opinion survey data, only 18 percent disapproved of the  coin. Similarly, businesses and associations we surveyed in the grocery,  transit, and vending industries said that the majority of public resistance  lasted from 3 months to 2 years. Officials in Canada said that the decision  to withdraw the dollar note from circulation was based on the experiences  of other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as  on the failed introduction of the Anthony dollar coin in the United States.", "More recently, we analyzed the use of coins and notes in countries that  make up the G-7 (see table 4) and found that the United States is unique in  attempting to cocirculate a high-denomination coin and note of the same  value. Consumers in Germany, France, and Italy have the choice of 1-euro  and 2-euro coins, but there is not a note of equal value to compete with the  coins. The lowest value euro note is the 5-euro note.

A  March 2002 Treasury Inspector General report recommending that the Mint  temporarily suspend production of the coin resulted in additional negative  media stories. The Mint said that some of these reports incorrectly  concluded that the Mint had ceased to produce all new dollar coins.", "Another obstacle is that the Mint, in its advertising, did not fully explain to  the public dollar coin savings to the government. A December 2001 survey,  the latest available, showed that the public would more strongly favor the  dollar coin when the savings were explained. When asked if they would  be in favor of replacing the dollar bill with the new dollar coin, 68 percent  of the respondents who opposed such a plan said they would favor the  replacement if doing so would save the government and taxpayers $500  million a year.", "Another barrier, an informal Treasury restriction on the Mint prohibiting it  from comparing the advantages of the dollar coin directly with the dollar  bill in consumer advertisements, hindered the Mint in explaining to  consumers why they should switch to the dollar coin. One television ad  proposal, for example, showed a person at a vending machine reacting to a  dollar bill being rejected. According to Mint officials, that part of the ad was  not approved and was never aired because some Treasury officials thought  that it negatively portrayed the dollar bill. Current Mint officials said that  they did not participate in the meeting in which the ad was discussed, and  that although the policy to avoid direct comparisons to the dollar bill is not  a formal written policy, they believe that the policy is still in effect.  According to a current Treasury official, the $1 Coin Act authorizing the  new dollar coin called for both the dollar coin and the dollar note to  cocirculate, and Treasury interprets that to mean that it should not favor  the coin or the note. A Treasury official said that the Mint and the Bureau of  Engraving and Printing are sister agencies that can create public awareness  campaigns for new coins and notes without directly comparing the  advantages and disadvantages of each.", "The Mint faces another barrier in convincing the public that the durability  and other benefits of the new dollar coin outweigh the ease of carrying the  dollar bill. As we reported in 1990, focus groups recognized the durability  of a dollar coin but cited negative aspects of the coin, such as the bulk in  transporting the coin. We further noted that consumer associations said the  coin would be bulky and would add weight to wallets and pockets. In the  last available public survey conducted by the Mint in July 2001, 1-1/2 years  after the new dollar coin was introduced, respondents said they were much  more likely to use the dollar bill. They also said they were more likely to  keep or save the dollar coin, show it to friends or family, or give it as a gift  than spend it on everyday items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distribution Problems Limit Use and Hinder the Promotion of the New Dollar Coin", "paragraphs": ["In addition to public resistance, the Mint also faces barriers in distributing  the new dollar coin. Promotion partners and other commercial users  reported that supplies of new dollar coins are commingled with Anthony  dollar coins. This commingling of the Anthony and new dollar coin, which  occurred more frequently in 2001 and 2002, adversely affected some  promotions that prominently featured the new dollar coin. For example, in  2001, a national restaurant chain changed all of its menus to feature a menu  item called the \u201cGolden Dollar\u201d pancake, but, in some cities, the restaurant  chain had difficulty obtaining supplies of the coin to support the  promotion. In some cases, the banks had a supply of dollar coins, but half  of the coins were new golden dollar coins and half were silver-colored  Anthony dollar coins. Commingling occurs when Anthony and new dollar  coins are used in commerce and later are processed by Federal Reserve  Banks and armored carriers. Machines used in the coin distribution system  are not able to separate the two coins because they have a similar  electromagnetic signature.", "Businesses also reported difficulty in obtaining a reliable supply of new  dollar coins. For example, in its assessment of a large new dollar coin  promotion with a national grocery chain, Marketbridge noted that the coin  was not always available from armored carriers. Some of the distribution  problems occurred because some armored carriers lack adequate  equipment. According to the Mint, to handle high volumes of new dollar  coins, Brinks, a large armored carrier, would have to invest $40,000 for  coin-rolling machines in many of its 154 branch office locations around the  country. Other armored carriers, according to the Mint, would also likely  need to upgrade equipment to handle high volumes if the dollar coin  became popular.", "Although the Wal-Mart promotion served to distribute over 90 million new  dollar coins, there were also early reports of availability problems related  to the promotion. In their discussions with the Mint in late 1999, banks  asked the Mint to delay the launch of the new dollar coin until March 2000  because expected year 2000 problems would require the banks to  concentrate on these problems in January and February, 2000. The Mint  agreed to delay the launch of the new dollar coin until March. However, in  December 1999, the Mint announced the partnership with Wal-Mart and  began to distribute the coins to Wal-Mart in January 2000. The publicity  surrounding this launch created public demand for the coin at banks  throughout the country. Bank customers who requested the coin could not  always find them, and soon the banks had a significant backlog of orders  for the coin with the Federal Reserve. The Mint and the Federal Reserve,  responding to delays in the new dollar coin\u2019s distribution to banks, such as  community banks, credit unions, and savings and loans, set up a temporary  Direct Shipment Program beginning March 1, 2000. The program gave  banks the ability to place orders on the Internet for up to 2,000 new dollar  coins in rolls and have them shipped directly from the Mint. However,  according to the Mint, only a small percentage of the banks that received a  letter on the direct ship program had ordered coins a month after the  program began. Bank officials said that these initial shortage problems  were limited to the first few months of the new dollar coin\u2019s launch in 2000.", "According to the Mint, some businesses were also reluctant to order dollar  coins because they were charged higher delivery fees by the armored  carriers. The armored carriers generally charge additional amounts to  retailers and other businesses for delivery of dollar coins because they  weigh more than paper dollars. For example, some carriers charged $2 per  $1,000 box to deliver rolled dollar coins compared with $0.25 cents for the  equivalent value in dollar bills.", "A Marketbridge report also noted that some businesses wanted a greater  choice of coin packaging options and quantities. While large-volume coin- operated businesses, such as car washes, might want coins in large bags,  and other businesses might want a full box of 1,000 coins, smaller  businesses attempted to obtain coins wrapped in rolls of 25 dollar coins,  but could not always find them. To make rolls of dollar coins more  available and reduce the cost to businesses for obtaining coins, the Mint,  from August to December, 2000, contracted with outside companies to  have 282,240,000 dollar coins wrapped in rolls at a cost of $927,982. These  Mint-wrapped rolls were to be provided to businesses by armored carriers  and financial institutions without those businesses being charged for  wrapping. Though the coin-wrapping contract increased the supply of new  dollar coins in rolls, the Mint found that some businesses were still subject  to other armored carrier fees such as for moving and storing the coin. Some  Mint officials said that the wrapping of dollar coins in rolls by Mint  contractors might have created more problems because the armored  carriers were not forced to develop a rolling capability. Without proof of  demand for the new dollar coin, armored carriers were reluctant to invest  in new equipment to roll dollar coins, even when demand for the coin was  high in the first half of 2000.", "Many of these distribution barriers were identified in a Marketbridge  promotion progress report in August 2001. As table 5 indicates, of the  distribution problems identified by Marketbridge, commingling and  difficulty in finding coins were the most common by far.", "To evaluate the extent that these barriers affected promotion partners, we  sent surveys to 10 large promotion partners that had agreements with the  Mint to promote the new dollar coin. In our survey of these large promotion  partners, we attempted to obtain information on the extent that barriers  such as commingling hindered the success of their new dollar coin  promotions. Seven promotion partners completed the survey. When asked  the extent that commingling hindered the success of their promotions  while they were in progress, 2 of the partners said to a very great extent, 1  said to a great extent, and 4 said to no extent. When asked if commingling  hindered the use of the new dollar coin in their business after the  promotion, when dollar coin use became less frequent, only 1 said to a very  great extent, 1 said to a great extent, 3 said to no extent, and 2 did not know  or said not applicable because the promotion was still in progress at the  time of the survey. In contrast to public reports, only 2 promotion partners  said that they had difficulty obtaining new dollar coins for their  promotions. In general, when asked the extent that coin-wrapping fees and  shipping costs hindered their promotions, most of the survey respondents  said these problems had little or no effect.", "Our promotion partner survey also indicated that while the promotions  distributed new dollar coins, it is unlikely that they had resulted in a long- term increase in the coin\u2019s use. We asked the 7 firms how frequently  customers used the new dollar coin to make purchases during the  promotion. One of the promotion partners said very frequently, 1 said  frequently, 3 said sometimes, and 2 said very infrequently. The survey  indicated even lower levels of use after the promotion. When asked if  customers were using the coin to make purchases after the promotion, 1  said sometimes, 3 said infrequently, 2 said very infrequently, and 1 did not  know or said not applicable because the promotion was still in progress at  the time of the survey. No promotion partner said customers were using the  coin to make purchases frequently or very frequently after the promotion.  A majority of promotion partners agreed that the dollar bill would need to  be eliminated for the public and businesses to accept and regularly use the  new dollar coin.", "In addition, in its promotion program assessments, Marketbridge found  indications that use of the new dollar coin was not sustained in these  businesses during and after the promotions. For example, in its assessment  of a national grocery chain promotion, Marketbridge noted that the average  number of dollar coins distributed decreased over time from 3,600 per  month at the beginning of the promotion, to 1,400 per month 60 days into  the promotion, to 600 per month toward the end of the promotion. About 8  months after the promotion began, the average number of dollar coins  distributed had dropped to 340 per month."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Marketing Efforts in Government Sector Were Mixed", "paragraphs": ["The Mint promoted the use of the new dollar coin in the government sector,  but the results of these efforts were mixed. For example, the Mint  contacted local transit authorities to increase awareness of the new dollar  coin and increase the number of transit systems using it. As part of this  transit marketing effort, the Mint, working with Fleishman Hillard in  selected cities, created promotional events that included a giveaway of free  new dollar coins to transit riders, radio promotions, media coverage, and  attendance by local officials. For example, the Mint distributed about  12,000 new dollar coins to transit riders in New York; 12,000 coins in  Chicago; 6,000 coins in Philadelphia; and 6,000 coins in San Diego.", "The Mint said that many of the largest transit systems retrofitted or  purchased new equipment and have the capability to use the dollar coin. In  April 2002, the U.S. Federal Transit Administration reported that 19 of the  largest 20 transit system agencies accept the dollar coin in either their bus  or rail systems. The Federal Transit Administration found that buses in  the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the fifth largest transit  system, accepted dollar coins in buses but the subway system did not. The  Federal Transit Administration also found that the Bay Area Rapid Transit  system, the twelfth largest transit system, did not accept the dollar coin in  either bus or rail. Mint officials said that they were not able to make  progress in increasing the use of the dollar coin in these two transit  systems. The Mint also worked with state and local bridge and road  authorities to increase the use of the new dollar coin in tollbooths and  encouraged cities to convert parking meters to accept the coin. (For more  information on the use of the dollar coin in state and local government  transit systems and tollbooths, see app. II.)", "According to Mint officials, the Mint used its own staff to conduct  marketing events to stimulate the new dollar coin\u2019s use in retail operations,  such as cafeterias within federal facilities. For example, the Mint  conducted a new dollar coin event at the Pentagon. According to the Mint,  this promotion distributed about 56,000 new dollar coins. Mint officials also  met with officials on military bases to discuss the dollar coin\u2019s use, but  these meetings did not result in formal promotional programs or increase  new dollar coin circulation.", "As part of its federal government marketing efforts, the Mint also sought to  increase the number of postal vending machines using the new dollar coin  but had limited success. In December 1998, before the coin\u2019s launch, a Mint  contractor study noted that the U.S. Postal Service had approximately  11,000 stamp vending machines that distributed dollar coins. However, in  April 2002, over 2 years since the introduction of the new dollar coin, the  Postal Service still had only 12,000 of its 34,000 vending machines able to  distribute the dollar coin as change. The Postal Service said that it was only  able to upgrade an additional 1,000 vending machines between 1998 and  2002 because it lacked the funds to upgrade or replace the older machines.  Despite the lack of progress, the Mint said that the Postal Service is still the  largest distributor of dollar coins. In general, the Mint did not track the  costs for the use of its own staff for marketing efforts to federal  government agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Mint\u2019s Marketing Plan Identifies but Does Not Provide Details on How It Will Address Barriers to Increased Coin Use", "paragraphs": ["In general, the Mint\u2019s April 24, 2002, marketing plan for fiscal years 2002  and 2003 describes a program that is much smaller in scope than the  marketing campaign used to launch the new dollar coin in 2000. The Mint  plan provides a listing of most of the barriers to increasing new dollar coin  use. In addition, the plan notes the importance of conducting research and  gives a description of planned research regarding consumer resistance,  distribution barriers, and sustaining use of the coin by businesses.  Although the plan estimates that the dollar coin is used in 4 percent of  dollar transactions, the plan does not lay out a specific market share or net  payout goal for fiscal year 2003. As is consistent with previous studies, the  Mint plan also notes that successfully achieving widespread use of the new  dollar coin will be difficult if it cocirculates with the dollar bill. However,  the plan does not discuss specifically how to address interdependent  demand or network effects. The plan also notes that the recent negative  media coverage of the new dollar coin will be a significant challenge for the  Mint\u2019s marketing communications and public relations programs, but the  Mint does not explain in detail how it will counter this challenge. Although  the plan notes potential government savings, it does not provide a strategy  for explaining dollar coin government savings to the public or for directly  comparing the advantages of the dollar coin with those of the dollar bill.", "A key element of the new marketing plan is a description of the barriers  that hinder the distribution and circulation of the new dollar coin. Although  the Mint\u2019s plan identifies the key barriers in the distribution channel, such  as the unavailability of coins, commingling, the lack of availability of new  dollar coins in rolls, and additional fees charged by armored carriers, the  marketing plan does not specifically outline how the Mint will address  those barriers. Instead, the Mint calls for research on barriers in the first  phase of the new plan that would be conducted in collaboration with the  Federal Reserve Bank System, banks, armored carriers, and commercial  users.", "Although the Mint plan notes that cocirculation with the dollar bill is a  barrier, the Mint does not provide much detail on the nature and extent of  the barrier or how it will attempt to overcome public resistance. In  addition, the Mint does not fully describe previous attempts in other  countries to cocirculate a high-denomination note and coin. The plan does  not include any information on network effects or indicate how an  understanding of the network effects in currency and coins and other  payment systems could improve future marketing strategy.", "The Mint plan includes some future programs to market to consumers that  are designed to increase public demand for the coin. However, the plan  does not describe how these programs will help the Mint overcome specific  barriers and increase new dollar coin circulation. For example, included in  the plan section on increasing sustained circulation is a description of a  licensing agreement with The Source International (TSI). The intent of the  agreement is to build brand awareness for the Mint and the new dollar coin  among National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) fans.  Under the TSI agreement, in the 2002 Cadillac Grand Prix in July and in one  race each year from 2003 to 2008, TSI will have one car with an image of the  new dollar coin on the hood and a Web site address for the Mint on the rear  spoiler. The agreement also calls for TSI to sell die cast replica models of  the new dollar coin racing car. The Mint also said the agreement would  require no outlay of funds and the Mint will receive royalty payments from  each new dollar coin model car sold. The Mint said that TSI will also make  an attempt to have new dollar coins dispensed as change to spectators for  cash purchases during each race. While the TSI agreement could increase  new dollar coin brand recognition and awareness at one race each year and  with model car sales, the plan does not describe how the agreement would  contribute to an increase in the coin\u2019s widespread use and circulation.", "The Mint also has an existing product licensing program that encourages  the placement of products related to coin collection into the retail market.  In addition, the Mint plans to work with the Department of the Army\u2019s  Corps of Engineers on new dollar coin promotion activities such as placing  a new dollar coin image on brochures associated with the Lewis and Clark  Bicentennial activities that will occur along the expedition\u2019s route from  2003 to 2006. Although these programs could increase awareness of the  new dollar coin among coin collectors or those visiting Corps of Engineer  facilities, the Mint plan does not provide much detail on how these  marketing programs would increase the public\u2019s use of the coin in everyday  transactions.", "Unlike the earlier new dollar coin marketing program, the new plan does  not envision a large national advertising campaign directed at the public.  The plan calls for research on public resistance to the new dollar coin  before a full marketing program is implemented to stimulate consumer use  of the new dollar coin. The Mint plan requests $0.5 to $1.0 million in fiscal  year 2002 followed by $10 to $15 million in fiscal year 2003 for a program to  maintain the new dollar coin\u2019s presence in the marketplace. The plan calls  for a continuation of ongoing promotions and, following research, the  identification of key target markets before marketing activities are  implemented. Mint officials said that transit and vending, in addition to  governments, are likely markets to target.", "The Mint plan does include some plans for a public relations and a media  outreach program to overcome negative consumer perception. However,  the plan does not provide any specifics on how it will overcome recent  negative media coverage or the public\u2019s impression that the coin may have  been discontinued. The plan does not address the advantages of including a  description of dollar coin savings to the government in its marketing  communications or discuss any restrictions on directly comparing the  advantages of the dollar coin with those of the dollar bill. Mint officials said  that the official policy is for cocirculation of both the dollar coin and note  and that the Mint did not describe dollar coin savings to the government in  its marketing because the savings could only occur if the dollar bill were  withdrawn from circulation. Treasury said that it interprets cocirculation to  mean that marketing programs for the coin or note should not directly  compare the advantages of the dollar coin with those of the dollar note.", "A key element of the plan is an assessment by the Mint of the progress  made in new dollar coin circulation. The Mint plan attempts to first  establish the existing level of dollar coin circulation by comparing the  number of new dollar coins in circulation with the number of dollar bills in  circulation. The Mint marketing plan estimates that people used the dollar coin in about 4 percent of dollar transactions. To arrive at this number, the  Mint took data from a public opinion poll and then estimated that about  one-third of the 850 million coins distributed to the public, or about 300  million coins, were actually used and in circulation. The Mint\u2019s estimate of  300 million coins in \u201ccirculation\u201d was then calculated to be about 4 percent  of the 7.5 billion in dollar bills in circulation.", "Other Mint surveys indicate that the new dollar coin market share as a  percentage of all dollar transactions may be lower. For example, a July  2001 public opinion survey was conducted by the Mint to test the impact of  the new dollar coin marketing program. Among other survey questions,  respondents were asked the number of dollar bills and dollar coins they  received and spent in the last few days. Respondents said that in July 2001,  they received 25 and spent 24 dollar bills. In contrast, respondents said they  received 0.2 new dollar coins and spent 0.3 new dollar coins. This equates  to a new dollar coin share of about 1 percent of all dollar transactions. The  Mint plan does not set goals in market share, net payout, or number of  dollar coins for fiscal year 2003.", "The increase in the number of dollar coins shipped to the Federal Reserve  from 1999 to 2000 did not have a measurable effect on the number of dollar  notes in circulation. The Federal Reserve said that the number of dollar  notes in circulation increased from 1999 to 2000 at the same time that  dollar coin shipments were increasing and that changes in demand for  dollar notes is normally due to fluctuations in economic activity. The  Federal Reserve said that it was unlikely that the slight decrease in the  number of dollar notes in circulation, from 7.65 billion in 2000 to 7.64  billion in 2001, could be attributed to the new dollar coin, and that the  decline was more likely due to a drop in economic activity in 2001.", "The Mint plan includes some actions to promote the use of the new dollar  coin in certain targeted markets. For example, the Mint plan indicates it  will try to increase circulation of the new dollar coin in federal agencies  and on military bases, but the plan does not explain the lack of success in  increasing the use of the new dollar coin in federal agencies or provide  specific objectives or programs for how the Mint will increase circulation.  The plan also states that the Mint intends to honor existing agreements  with several minor league baseball teams. The Mint lists the teams and  notes that the agreements with minor league teams distributed over 1  million coins. Despite the noted potential in dollar coin distribution and  past promotions with baseball teams, beyond honoring several existing  agreements, the Mint does not include additional baseball team marketing  activities in its future marketing plan.", "The Mint plan also states that it will explore opportunities in parking  meters, toll roads, and transit systems but no data are given on how the  Mint chose these as potential markets or how much each of these markets  might yield in increased new dollar coin circulation or at what cost.  Although the Mint through its contractors, previously evaluated and  identified the markets with a high potential for new dollar coin use, the  plan does not fully incorporate this information into its analysis.", "Another key element of the new marketing plan is a description of the  barriers that hinder the distribution of the new dollar coin. The Mint has  identified the key barriers in the distribution channel, which moves the  dollar coin through the Federal Reserve Bank System, banks, and armored  carriers to commercial users, such as retailers. It states that unavailability  of the coins at banks, commingling, and the lack of availability of new  dollar coins in the right mix of bags and rolls are obstacles to stimulating  commercial use of the new dollar coin. In addition, the Mint identifies other  distribution barriers, such as the additional fees charged by armored  carriers for coins compared with fees charged for bills, and other perceived  barriers, such as the lack of room in the cash drawer.", "To address distribution barriers, the plan calls for research. Research on  barriers in the distribution of the new dollar coin would be conducted in  collaboration with the Federal Reserve Bank System, banks, armored  carriers, and commercial users. In addition, the plan calls for a  collaborative study with the Federal Reserve on the feasibility of using  machines to separate the Anthony and new dollar coins that are  commingled. The plan states that the research on distribution barriers is  intended to help the Mint validate its understanding of the barriers and  identify ways to overcome them. However, the plan does not indicate what  effect the removal of barriers would have on circulation. For example, if  the Mint resolved the commingling problem, the plan does not indicate  whether this would lead to an increase in use of the dollar coin.

As previously noted, the Mint has stated that, on the basis of  survey estimates and the number of new dollar coins in circulation, people  use the dollar coin in 4 percent of dollar transactions. This figure is a very  rough estimate, and it does not give a full evaluation of dollar coin use that  can be used to make future decisions on marketing programs.

However, recognizing Congress\u2019s  desire for cocirculation of the dollar coin and the dollar note, it appears  reasonable for the Mint to conduct planned research to further assess  distribution barriers and determine the appropriate steps and costs that are  necessary to resolve these barriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Actions", "paragraphs": ["Because the Mint does not know whether additional marketing is likely to  increase use and past efforts have had limited effects, we recommend that  aside from honoring existing promotion agreements and conducting  planned research on public acceptance and distribution barriers, the  Director of the Mint suspend further expenditures for marketing and  promoting the new dollar coin until research is completed and the Mint can  demonstrate that such efforts are likely to increase long-term coin  circulation and/or are necessary to achieve Congress\u2019s desire for  cocirculation. We further recommend that the Mint revise the marketing  plan it submitted to Congress to reflect such an approach and work with  Congress to reach an agreement on an appropriate amount of funds to use  for these activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of the draft of this report for comment to the Secretary  of the Treasury; the Director of the Mint; and the Chairman, Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

The Secretary did not provide  comments.", "The Director of the Mint said that the Mint generally concurred with the  findings and recommendation in our report. The Mint Director also offered  some additional comments on the barriers that we identified and how the  Mint plans to address them. The Mint Director said the Mint agrees that  there is no available evidence that the elimination of distribution barriers  would have a long-term positive effect on dollar coin use. She said the Mint  would examine several possible research approaches to study the removal  of distribution barriers, but it would not invest substantial funds until it can  support the expenditures. The Mint Director also said the Mint will conduct  research to identify and further assess the barriers to the new dollar coin\u2019s  use in daily commerce. The Director said the Mint would incorporate the  results of that research and an understanding of network effects into a  revised new dollar coin marketing plan, as we recommended.", "The Mint Director also commented on the different approaches our report  discussed that were used to calculate the level of new dollar coin  circulation. The Director noted that the Mint\u2019s 4 percent figure is based on  the number of dollar coins issued as a percentage of the number of dollars  issued and the other measure cited in our report is based on the number of  new dollar coins used in financial transactions as a percentage of the  number of dollars used in financial transactions. We believe that the latter  estimate of 1 percent may be a more representative measure of the coin\u2019s  actual use by the public because it is based on a nationally representative  public poll conducted for the Mint that asked questions specifically about  the number of dollar coins and notes used in transactions in the past few  days. Nevertheless, while we recognize that there are various measures  with which to gauge the public\u2019s use of the new dollar coin, neither  approach cited in the report indicated widespread use.", "In addition, the Director said that a major deficiency of the Anthony dollar  coin was that people avoided using it because they were unable to  distinguish it from a quarter-dollar coin. In our past reports, we cited this as  one barrier, but also reported that the continued circulation of the dollar  bill was the most substantial barrier to the Anthony dollar coin\u2019s use.", "The Director of the Division of Reserve Bank Operations, Federal Reserve  Board, said that the Federal Reserve concurred with our recommendations.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs;  the House Committee on Financial Services; and the Subcommittee on  Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, House Committee on  Appropriations; the Secretary of the Treasury; the Chairman of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System; and other interested parties.

We also collected and reviewed marketing program contracts,  progress reports, plans, promotion agreements, press releases, and other  related documents from the Mint and contractors. In addition, we  requested information from the U.S. Postal Service on dollar coin use in  vending machines and reviewed a Department of Transportation report on  dollar coin use in transit systems and toll roads, but we did not  independently verify the data from those agencies. Although we reviewed  signed promotion agreements to determine the number of promotions the  Mint conducted, the Mint did not provide documentation that would enable  us to verify the actual number of coins distributed during each of the  promotions. Our review did not include a financial audit of the marketing  program. Also, we did not conduct an audit of paid advertising  expenditures or audit the media to determine if all of the ads ran as  planned.

We also sent questionnaires  regarding barriers to increased circulation to 10 promotion partners that  distributed new dollar coins. We focused on these large promotion partners  because these firms represent all of the targeted industry sectors and make  up 99 percent of the total promotion partner distribution goal. Seven of the  10 promotion partners responded to our survey. We did not survey the  other promotion partners because of resource limitations and because  most of the other promotions were with minor league baseball teams in  smaller cities that had coin distribution goals of under 300,000 dollar coins.  In interviewing businesses and associations, we contacted those we  believed were most affected by the introduction of a new dollar coin,  including bank trade associations, a trade association representing coin- operated businesses, and armored carriers. We also reviewed articles on  the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin and interviewed the authors of these  articles. Further, we obtained data on the highest value coins and lowest  value notes used by the G-7 countries as of June 27, 2002.", "To obtain information on the Mint\u2019s plans to overcome the barriers to  increased dollar coin circulation, we interviewed officials from the Mint,  Federal Reserve, Mint contractors, and trade associations and reviewed  Mint documents and the 2002 new dollar coin marketing plan.
