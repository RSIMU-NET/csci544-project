As the program grew more complex, the Federal Highway Administration\u0092s (FHWA) oversight role also expanded, while its resources have not kept pace. As GAO has reported, this growth occurred without a well-defined overall vision of evident national interests and the federal role in achieving them. GAO has recommended Congress consider restructuring federal surface transportation programs, and for this and other reasons, funding surface transportation remains on GAO\u0092s high-risk list.", "FHWA benefits from using recognized partnership practices to advance the federal-aid highway program and conduct program oversight\u0097such as clear delineation of roles and responsibilities between FHWA and its state partners and formal and informal conflict resolution\u0097that are recognized as leading practices. FHWA\u0092s partnership approach allows it to proactively identify issues before they become problems, achieve cost savings, and gain states\u0092 commitment to improve their processes.", "FHWA\u0092s partnership approach also poses risks. We observed cases where FHWA was lax in its oversight or reluctant to take corrective action to bring states back into compliance with federal requirements, potentially resulting in improper or ineffective use of federal funds. For example, while FHWA has made it a national priority to recoup funds from inactive highway projects\u0097projects that have not expended funds for over 1 year\u0097FHWA officials in three states we visited were reluctant to do so because of concerns about harming their partnership with the state. In other cases, FHWA has shown a lack of independence in decisions, putting its partners\u0092 interests above federal interests. For example, FHWA allowed two states to retain unused emergency relief allocations to fund new emergencies, despite FHWA\u0092s policy that these funds are made available to other states with potentially higher-priority emergencies. In some instances, FHWA became actively and closely involved in implementing solutions to state problems\u0097this can create a conflict when FHWA later must approve or review the effectiveness of those solutions.", "If proposals for a performance-based highway program are adopted, FHWA would have to work with states to develop measures and take corrective action if states do not meet them. FHWA\u0092s partnership could help states develop measures, but it would need to mitigate the risks posed by its partnership to ensure corrective action was effective when needed. The fundamental reexamination of surface transportation programs, including the highway program, that GAO previously recommended presents an opportunity to narrow FHWA\u0092s responsibilities so that it is better equipped to transition to a performance-based system. GAO identified areas where national interests may be less evident but where FHWA expends considerable time and resources\u0097areas where devolving responsibilities to the states may be appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider restructuring federal surface transportation programs.

As the highway program grew more complex, the federal  government\u2019s responsibility to oversee the program expanded as well.  The role of the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA) has grown from overseeing the construction of  highway projects to a wide range of activities including overseeing states\u2019  transportation planning processes; assessing environmental impacts; and  monitoring states\u2019 compliance with property acquisition, contracting, civil  rights, and other requirements. As we have reported, FHWA has faced  challenges in ensuring that federal funds are efficiently and effectively  used because the highway program is one in which there is limited  federal control\u2014it is a state-administered, federally assisted program.

FHWA division offices  have 10 to 61 staff each, depending on the size of the state\u2019s highway  program. While there are variations in division office organizational  structures, each typically has teams that cover areas such as planning,  environment, engineering, technical services, finance, and civil rights.

To advance the program, FHWA  engages in a range of activities to encourage the effective and efficient  use of federal-aid highway funding and assist states in progressing  projects through construction to improve the highway system. To  accomplish these tasks, FHWA works with states to identify issues,  develop and advocate solutions, approve and obligate project funding for  eligible activities, and provide technical assistance and training to state  DOTs. To ensure that states comply with federal laws and regulations,  FHWA, through its division offices, conducts oversight of federally funded  projects and reviews state DOT capacity and systems used to administer  approved projects. Actual project-level oversight is divided or shared  between FHWA and the state. FHWA oversees major interstate highway  projects. FHWA division offices and states jointly decide how to divide  oversight responsibility for other National Highway System projects.  States assume oversight responsibility for projects that are not on the  National Highway System. These can include locally administered  projects, which are projects in which a state DOT has given approval to a  local public agency (e.g. a city or county) to administer a project or phase  of a project such design, property acquisition, or construction.", "For those projects where both FHWA and the state make decisions about  oversight responsibilities, the respective responsibilities are generally  mapped out in a \u201cstewardship agreement.\u201d This agreement defines which  projects will receive \u201cfull\u201d oversight, in which FHWA oversees most  aspects of the construction process, or projects in which states assume  oversight responsibility (we refer to these as \u201cdelegated\u201d projects).

A common tool for this type  of oversight is a \u201cprocess review,\u201d which involves an analysis of key  program components and processes employed by the state DOT.  Typically, this includes a file review of a sample of projects, interviews  with relevant state DOT staff, and field reviews when applicable. In  addition, FHWA, in conjunction with the Federal Transit Administration,  performs a federal certification review of Metropolitan Planning  Organizations (MPO), which are responsible for transportation planning in  urban areas with populations larger than 50,000 every 4 years,that periodically FHWA determines if the organization complies with  applicable federal requirements. FHWA division offices have a range of  corrective actions they can use if a state does not comply with federal  requirements.

The  Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 further refined the federal-state  relationship by stating that \u201cthe authorization of the appropriation of  Federal funds\u2026shall in no way infringe on the sovereign rights of the  States to determine which projects shall be federally financed\u201d and  defined the federal-aid highway program as a \u201cfederally assisted State   This and other early highway  program.\u201d This language helped shape FHWA\u2019s interpretation of the  federal-state relationship, leading to an understanding of its role that  anchors FHWA\u2019s approach to oversight in partnership and is cited today  in FHWA\u2019s policy documents. Almost all the division administrators we  surveyed described their work with states as a partnership and in ways  that emphasized the importance of partnership in carrying out FHWA\u2019s  mission to advance the transportation program. In addition, as we  previously reported, both FHWA and state officials believe that over the  years the partnership has helped to build trust and respect between state  transportation agencies and FHWA, ensuring that as partners they can  accomplish tasks such as planning and building projects more efficiently  and effectively.", "The goals and scope of the federal-aid highway program expanded  during much of the 20th century, as did the roles and responsibilities of  FHWA. Initially, the highway program was administered by the  Department of Agriculture through the Bureau of Public Roads, a  predecessor to FHWA. The bureau focused oversight at the project level to ensure that materials and construction methods met federal  standards. The bureau also brought engineering expertise to the states,  many of which either lacked skilled engineers or were not ensuring that  federal dollars were being used to produce quality construction. The  Defense Highway Act of 1941 extended the 1916 act to fund a strategic  network of highways, including secondary and feeder routes. Eligibility  was extended again in 1944 to include an array of other secondary roads,  including rural farm-to-market roads, rural mail and bus routes, county  roads, and others that became eligible for post-war federal aid. In 1950,  Congress made additional roads\u2014including county, township, and urban  roads\u2014eligible for aid. By then, however, the focus of the highway  program was turning increasingly to constructing the Interstate Highway  System. Designated as mandated in 1944, construction of the system  began in earnest with passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956  and establishment of the Highway Trust Fund, a dedicated funding source  deriving revenue primarily from taxes on motor fuels, tires, and trucks to  finance the construction of the Interstate system.", "Construction of the Interstate remained the focus of the federal-aid  highway program in the years that followed, and Congress continued to  expand the types of projects eligible for federal funds. In the 1970s,  Congress expanded the federal role in bridge infrastructure by making  highway bridges located on public roads and longer than 20 feet eligible  for federal funds. Congress also expanded the eligibility of federal aid  beyond initial construction. Under the 1916 Act and Interstate  authorizations, the federal government was to fund the construction of  highways while maintenance was the states\u2019 responsibility. However, as  the Interstate began to age, Congress allowed states to use federal funds  for road maintenance on Interstate highways and all eligible bridges by  redefining certain activities\u2014such as resurfacing, rehabilitation, and  reconstruction\u2014as capital investments rather than maintenance.", "By  1991, as a result of changes over the years, use of highway funds was  authorized to fund a wide range of transportation enhancement activities,  including activities connected with highway beautification, historic  preservation, and the establishment of bicycle and pedestrian trails.", "In addition to expanding the types of projects eligible for federal highway  funds, over time Congress adopted legislation to achieve social goals  such as advancing civil rights and environmental protection, and  enhancing urban planning and economic development, which affected the  federal-aid highway program and FHWA\u2019s role and responsibilities. For  example, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 recipients to comply with federal environmental requirements by  conducting environmental reviews for federally funded transportation  projects. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962 established urban  transportation planning as a matter of national interest and required all  construction projects to be part of a continuing, comprehensive, and  cooperative planning process. Other federal requirements have included  requiring compliance with prevailing wage standards applicable to federal  contracts under the Davis-Bacon Act, a Disadvantaged Business  Enterprise program to enhance participation of women- and minority- owned businesses, and Buy America provisions for acquiring steel and  other materials.

Federal goals and programs are now numerous and sometimes  conflicting, and federal roles are unclear. Furthermore, although DOT and  FHWA establish national goals and priorities, federal highway funding is  apportioned to states without regard to the accomplishment of specific  outcomes or the performance of grantees.

Specifically, 51 of 52 survey  respondents stated that their partnering relationship with their state was  very or somewhat important to their ability to achieve the mission of the  federal-aid highway program. Most division administrators (44 of 52) also  indicated that the partnering relationship produces multiple benefits.  Some of these benefits\u2014such as expedited project time frames and cost  savings\u2014were noted as positive outcomes of partnership in the literature  we reviewed. For example, FHWA officials in a northern state with a short  summer construction season told us they work closely with state DOT  officials to make timely decisions and move projects along to ensure that  construction can be completed during the warmer months. FHWA officials  in this state generally conducted non-construction-related process  reviews in the winter season so that they and state DOT officials could  focus on construction inspections and construction-related process  reviews during the warmer months. Similarly, in another state, FHWA and  state officials told us that by working together to resolve issues  expediently, they were able to complete the environmental review and  approval process for a large-scale project to reduce congestion on an  important regional highway in about half of the time normally required.", "Forty-four of 52 division administrators indicated in response to our  survey that partnering was very helpful in facilitating the transfer of  technical knowledge. In our site visits, FHWA officials explained that  partnering helps FHWA to use technical knowledge transfer to advance  the federal-aid highway program by assisting states in addressing  technical or programmatic concerns, closing skill gaps, enhancing  compliance, and informing decision making. FHWA division officials in  one state told us that they had financed a trip by state DOT officials to  learn about an alternative interchange design. As a result, the state DOT  was able to make interchange improvements without removing and  replacing an existing bridge, reducing costs from estimated $10 to $15  million to $3 million. Similarly, when FHWA officials observed crumbling  materials used for retaining walls and supporting structures, they brought  in the technical expertise of the FHWA Resource Center, which resulted  in the state DOT revising its materials specifications to ensure higher- quality materials are used.", "Forty-nine of 52 division administrators also indicated in response to our  survey that partnering helps the agency to advance federal transportation  priorities. One respondent stated that \u201cpartnering helps us advance more  federal priorities and achieve greater public benefit than simply being  parochial authoritarians that refuse to discuss anything that doesn\u2019t  directly involve a federal dollar or regulation.\u201d For example, officials in one  FHWA division office developed a business case for an approach to  address congestion in a key section of highway as an alternative to the  state\u2019s planned solution. FHWA promoted its alternative to the state DOT  and other stakeholders, and ultimately the state accepted FHWA\u2019s  approach because the data showed it would be more effective and less  costly. In another example, FHWA division officials believed they  influenced the state DOT to improve safety by using higher-quality  barriers and rumble strips on highways to alert drivers straying off the  road. Likewise, to improve safety, officials in another FHWA division office  promoted cable barriers on highway medians as a risk-based, lower-cost  alternative to concrete barriers.", "Similarly, during our site visits, some FHWA officials said that their  partnering relationship creates an opportunity to promote projects of  national or regional significance within a state. For example, FHWA  officials in one division office persuaded the state to address congestion  around a toll plaza on a major interstate route. The state did not consider  the project a high priority, because it did not affect most state residents as  much as out-of-state drivers traveling through the state. However, FHWA  division officials were able to persuade the state to construct the project  when funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act) became available.

In our survey, 50 of 52 FHWA division administrators said that their  division office\u2019s partnering relationship was very or somewhat helpful in  producing more effective oversight. Officials we spoke with during our site  visits offered several illustrations of how partnership improves oversight.  One FHWA division administrator told us that the state DOT proactively  brings problems to FHWA\u2019s attention rather than waiting for FHWA to  discover them. We observed that this open dialogue about risks allows  FHWA to address issues in a timely fashion and adopt a more responsive  and problem-solving attitude. According to one FHWA division official,  FHWA worked collaboratively with the state DOT to determine which  process reviews to conduct during the year and then conducted the  majority of those reviews jointly. According to the FHWA official, this  practice strengthened oversight by helping to gain the state DOT\u2019s buy-in  and commitment to improving its processes, facilitating honest  communication about risk areas, and creating an opportunity for FHWA to  provide on-the-spot training when problems were identified. In another  example, an FHWA division office holds annual meetings with state DOT  officials where the two parties determine which projects should receive  full oversight and which should be assumed by the state. We observed  that this approach can strengthen oversight by allowing FHWA to  incorporate the state\u2019s perception of risk and weaknesses into their  oversight plan by engaging in open dialogue with state officials about  risks. Additionally, for each summer construction season, the two parties  identify one of the state\u2019s regions as a focus for full oversight. This allows  each region and their project managers to receive training while their  projects, primarily related to pavement preservation, are being reviewed  by FHWA.", "FHWA\u2019s partnership with state DOTs also affects its use of corrective  action. FHWA emphasizes working with state DOTs to bring them back  into compliance through less stringent corrective action instead of more  punitive action. Responses to our survey of division administrators  showed that the most frequently used corrective action in the last 3 fiscal  years was withholding approval of a particular request until an issue was  resolved. According to one division administrator, withholding approval  provides the greatest ability to address and resolve a particular issue and  encourages the state to take corrective action in a timely manner.  Additionally, 43 of 52 division administrators reported that in the last 3  fiscal years they have used the threat of a corrective action, which helps  to achieve compliance without actual punitive actions. Reportedly, the  threat of a corrective action is effective because it communicates the  consequences of not complying with federal requirements and helps to  bring about problem resolution. In addition, to address deficiencies, 51 of  52 division administrators reported that they had required state DOTs to  develop a corrective action plan to outline how the state would change a  process or program to comply with federal requirements.", "When FHWA moves toward a more punitive corrective action, it is most  likely to withhold funding from a part of a project. Withholding partial  funding often amounts to not paying for a line item in a project\u2019s budget.  For example, one division administrator explained that when the state  purchases proprietary equipment, such as certain types of light posts or  signs, when a less expensive nonproprietary option is available, FHWA  withholds funds for the purchase. The federal-aid highway program is a  reimbursement program. As a consequence, if FHWA withholds funds,  state DOTs must replace federal funding with state funding. All 52 division  offices indicated they withheld partial federal funding from a project in the  last 3 fiscal years, and withholding partial funding was the second most  frequently used tool for corrective action.", "FHWA division offices reported that they rarely use their most punitive  corrective actions, such as withholding funding for an entire project or  organization. Although 30 division administrators we surveyed reported  that they had withheld federal funding from an entire project during the  past 3 fiscal years, none listed this action as one of their three most  frequently used corrective actions. According to FHWA officials, such  action is damaging to the state\u2019s federal-aid highway program and  provokes tension with state DOTs. FHWA officials stated that they see  this measure as a last resort and try to use their partnership with the  states to elicit compliance. Furthermore, division offices periodically  review MPOs, which can receive federal-aid highway funding and  implement construction projects. If the office declines to certify an MPO,  federal funds for that organization are withheld until the deficiencies  identified are corrected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navigating the \u201cGray Areas\u201d", "paragraphs": ["FHWA division officials use partnering practices, such as open and  regular communication, with state DOT officials as they exercise  administrative discretion in situations where the rules and how to apply  them are not clear\u2014situations we refer to as \u201cgray areas.\u201d In  administering the federal-aid highway program, FHWA often has  discretion to take a less stringent action even when the law permits a  harsher one, if circumstances warrant. Such an approach is embodied in  a stewardship agreement from one division office, which states that the  division office \u201cwill make use of available regulatory flexibility when in the  public interest.\u201d FHWA officials spend time and effort addressing gray  areas, as they seek to make a decision that is not only consistent with  federal regulations but also appropriate to the particular facts and  circumstances of the situation.

Because there are  no specifications on the type of documentation demonstrating a good faith  effort, FHWA and state DOT officials must work through this gray area to  determine how best to demonstrate their efforts.", "In our interviews and observations, we noted that FHWA officials rely on  partnering practices with states when federal regulations and FHWA  policies leave room for interpretation and discretion, creating gray areas  for FHWA officials to resolve. For example, routine roadway maintenance  is not eligible for federal reimbursement, but preventive maintenance can be.is room for interpretation and discretion between the two types of  maintenance. This division administrator told us that in recent years the  state DOT has sought reimbursement from FHWA for roadway  maintenance activities that are typically ineligible for reimbursement\u2014a  situation he attributed to the economic environment affecting state  budgets. This required time and effort by both FHWA and the state DOT  to work through their different interpretations of the regulation. Ultimately,  FHWA and the state agreed to develop asset management systems to  identify and prioritize preventive maintenance needs in a systematic way.  The division administrator explained that this approach would show and  document how the maintenance strategies would extend the roadway life  and prevent deterioration and higher maintenance costs later, which  would make these costs eligible for federal funding.", "According to an FHWA division administrator in one state, there  We also observed FHWA using partnering practices to negotiate the gray  areas that may arise when the rules are clear, but practical considerations  complicate implementing the rule. When implementing a rule, public  officials may need to consider cost-benefit implications, time frames, local  economic conditions, or other local circumstances that are not necessarily  dealt with explicitly in rules or regulations. For example, FHWA officials in  one division office explained that FHWA\u2019s regulations require roadside  guardrails on National Highway System routes to be a minimum height of  27 \u00be inches from the top of the guardrail to the top of the pavement. The  height of a guardrail governs its effectiveness. However, as states overlay  pavement with new asphalt to address road deterioration, the height of  the guardrail relative to the road surface decreases and the guardrail  becomes less effective. This creates practical trade-offs with regard to the  costs of guardrail replacement and safety, raising questions regarding  whether to use funds to improve the pavement condition of, for example,  20 miles of road without replacing guardrails or to pave fewer miles of  road but replace the guardrails to ensure they are at the full height  prescribed in the regulation. Both approaches offer safety benefits.  Determining the best course of action requires navigating a gray area and  requires FHWA to understand the state\u2019s priorities, weigh the safety  outcomes, and use its partnership with the state to agree on an approach  that meets transportation needs and federal responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 Perspectives on Partnering and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["While FHWA officials largely viewed their partnering relationship with  state DOTs in positive terms, state officials offered a more tempered  response. Specifically, our interviews and discussion groups with officials  from 38 state DOTs revealed that while states acknowledged having good  working relationships with their FHWA division counterparts, they also  expressed some frustrations. On the positive side, state DOT officials  appreciated regular and ongoing communication with FHWA officials and  characterized FHWA staff as accessible, responsive, and solution- oriented. State DOT officials told us that stewardship agreements were  helpful in clarifying roles and expectations and that they consider risk- based oversight to be a strength of the FHWA-state relationship. Officials  also appreciated FHWA\u2019s help in navigating federal requirements and  sharing technical expertise and industry best practices.

State DOT officials  participating in our discussion groups asserted that they do not want a  \u201cone size fits all\u201d FHWA.", "However, state DOT officials\u2019 positive feedback about FHWA was  tempered with other perspectives on partnering and FHWA decision  making. We noted three themes among the comments of state DOT  officials when voicing perspectives different from FHWA.  1.  State officials viewed partnership less favorably than FHWA. Many  state DOT officials characterized FHWA\u2019s role as providing oversight  and enforcing regulations rather than acting as a partner. Some  officials indicated FHWA began emphasizing enforcement over  partnership around the time of the completion of the Interstate  Highway System, as FHWA responded to legislative changes,  adopting what many state officials viewed as an audit-focused  approach to oversight. According to some state DOT officials, the  sense of camaraderie between state DOT and FHWA officials that  existed during the building of the Interstate is no longer there, and  currently there is \u201cless partnership and more regulation.\u201d Reflecting  the states\u2019 more tempered perspective, one state DOT official  characterized the relationship with FHWA as \u201ca partnership within an  arranged marriage.\u201d  2.  State officials viewed FHWA as imposing personal preferences. Many  state DOT officials told us that FHWA officials routinely imposed  personal preferences\u2014for example, questioning particular design  solutions\u2014and would threaten to withhold federal funds or approval  even though, in the states\u2019 view, the approach the state had  developed complied with federal standards and regulations. State  DOT officials pointed out that these preferences are not covered in  the regulations but rather involve professional judgment regarding  such factors as cost, appearance, and durability that are not  prescribed in regulation and are often unique to a particular  construction project. For example, according to officials at one state  DOT, FHWA had a preference for sequencing construction activities  in a particular way rather than leaving the decision up to the state  DOT, and on this particular project FHWA made its preference a  requirement. Some states also said that FHWA gives too much focus  to smaller issues and is overly involved in routine matters.  3.  State officials were frustrated by inconsistencies in FHWA\u2019s decision  making across states. Many state DOT officials expressed frustration  about the inconsistencies they perceived in FHWA\u2019s decisions across  states. Specifically, several noted that FHWA division offices in other  states had been more permissive of certain solutions or requirements  compared to the FHWA division office in their state and stated that  FHWA does not always use the maximum flexibility it has at its  disposal in interpreting federal rules. For example, a state DOT official  told us that the division office in his state did not approve a certain  material for markings on the state\u2019s highways, but he learned that the  same material had been approved in 17 other states.", "The inconsistencies experienced by state DOTs may not be  unreasonable and could stem from the decentralized nature of the  federal-aid highway program and the fundamental challenge FHWA and  the states face in navigating gray areas on complex projects with unique  political, financial, engineering, and other challenges. These complexities  likely contribute to FHWA and state DOTs\u2019 differing perspectives. For  example, we previously reported a case in which a state DOT planned to  construct new soundwalls on an existing highway. FHWA noted that the  state was planning to widen the road a few years later and that the walls  would likely have to be destroyed and rebuilt. FHWA recommended that  the state construct the walls at the location envisioned for the widening  project, but state DOT officials resisted because of the additional costs to  acquire property. FHWA then informed the state that it would only fund  construction of the walls once\u2014either at the location along the existing  highway as the state had planned or at the location needed once the road  was widened. This example illustrates a case in which state officials  may have viewed FHWA as imposing its personal preferences and may  have been aware of similar situations in other states in which FHWA  officials made different decisions inconsistent with this approach. FHWA,  on the other hand, may have viewed its decision as exercising  professional judgment to promote the most long-term cost-effective  solution, consistent with its role as a steward of federal funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FHWA\u2019s Partnership with States Poses Risks in FHWA\u2019s Oversight", "paragraphs": ["While successful partnering relationships offer benefits, they also present  potential risks, according to the literature we reviewed.

Instead, FHWA alerts the relevant  construction sites and offices of an inspection ahead of time. Officials  from one FHWA division office explained that they rely primarily on  announced visits because they do not want to create a \u201cgotcha\u201d  environment, which might hurt their relationship with the state.  Division officials from another office explained that announcing  inspections gives state DOT staff time to do things like assemble the  appropriate records or personnel for FHWA\u2019s inspection or allows  FHWA to observe specific activities, such as materials testing, on the  day that particular activity is occurring. While there are some  advantages to announced inspections, the Institute of Internal  Auditors includes unannounced visits as a common practice used by  firms to mitigate risks associated with partnering. By not conducting  unannounced inspections, FHWA is essentially trusting the state and  its contractors to put compliance with federal requirements over  meeting competing demands like cost and schedule. In doing so, it  may be missing the opportunity to more accurately verify compliance  with federal requirements, observe normal operations, and create an  environment conducive to compliance.", "The partnering relationship between FHWA and state DOTs at times may  have also resulted in FHWA being reluctant to require corrective action to  bring a state back into compliance with program requirements.  Specifically, FHWA staff acknowledged that, in their daily decision  making, they have to think about how to preserve their relationship with  their state counterpart and that they view taking corrective action as  potentially damaging to that relationship. For example:", "We and the DOT Office of Inspector General have reported multiple  times on the problem of funds committed to inactive federal-aid  highway projects. FHWA has made it a priority to decrease nationally  the number of outstanding inactive projects to ensure that federal funds  are being used in a timely and effective way. For example, FHWA had  reduced the percent of funds obligated to inactive projects to about 3.4  percent of all obligations by March of 2012\u2014this percentage had stood  at around 8 percent as recently as September 2010. In 2008, it  established a Financial Integrity Review and Evaluation program  requiring division offices to conduct a quarterly review of inactive  projects and determine the validity of the amount obligated for each  project. FHWA division offices have the authority to de-obligate funds  from inactive projects. However, FHWA division officials with oversight  responsibility for three states we visited expressed reluctance to use  this authority because of concerns that it would negatively affect their  working relationship with the state. Instead, these division offices  negotiated with state officials to get them to explicitly agree to allow  FHWA to de-obligate funds. FHWA officials acknowledged that this is a  long, time-intensive process. For example, over the course of 6 months,  one FHWA division office sent reminder letters with specific deadlines  for the state to provide a rationale for allowing inactive funds to remain  obligated. Yet at the end of this process there were still outstanding  inactive projects that had not been resolved. In another state, FHWA  finance personnel described having ongoing conversations with their  state counterparts, asking them the status of inactive projects and  negotiating to de-obligate those funds. The FHWA division office  described the process as \u201cwalking the tightrope\u201d with the states when  making decisions to de-obligate. The amount of time officials we spoke  with devoted to addressing inactive funds raises questions about  whether, on the whole, division offices could have moved more quickly  to make these funds available to other needed projects had officials not  had to consider the impact of withdrawing funds on their partnership  with the state.", "One state identified serious compliance issues with one of its major  cities dating as far back as 2003, including federal construction  specifications not being followed, insufficient field equipment, and lack  of appropriate construction supervision.

However, nearly 2 years later, as of August 2011, there were  still points in the plan that had not been addressed.

One state DOT lacked FHWA-approved written procedures for how it  selects consultants, which are necessary to comply with federal  regulations. The FHWA division office had given the state an  extended opportunity\u2014about 5 years\u2014to address the compliance  issue, allowing it to use interim procedures as long as the state DOT  was developing final procedures and planning to have them approved  by FHWA. After 5 years, due to the failure of the state to develop final  procedures, the FHWA division office suspended all state DOT  contract approvals and temporarily re-assumed the responsibility of  approving consultant contracts to ensure compliance with federal  procurement regulations. Once the state DOT developed written  procedures and they were approved, FHWA restored consultant  contract approval authority to the state DOT.", "As discussed earlier, FHWA division administrators reported that they  rarely use their most punitive corrective action tools such as cutting off  funding for a program or organization. While FHWA, in cooperation with  the Federal Transit Administration, is responsible for certifying that MPOs  meet federal requirements, as we reported in September 2009, FTA and  FHWA officials were unaware of any instance in which an MPO was not  certified due to noncompliance in the previous 10 years. In our survey of  division administrators, for fiscal years 2009 through 2012, one FHWA  division administrator reported that he withheld certification of an MPO  due to issues in its congestion mitigation plan. However, FHWA still  allowed project approvals to move forward. The FHWA division office put  together a corrective action plan with the MPO, identifying action steps,  deadlines, and people responsible. According to the FHWA division  administrator, as long as the state is making progress toward resolving  the issue, FHWA will not prevent the MPO from obtaining project  approvals and moving construction forward. He noted that MPOs have a  4-year window to become recertified, and if an MPO reached the end of  its window but still had not taken sufficient action for FHWA to certify it,  FHWA would likely provide an extension and grant the MPO \u201cconditional\u201d  certification, rather than decertify it.", "Similarly, none of the 52 FHWA division administrators stated they had  not approved their state\u2019s bridge program any time in the past 3 fiscal  years.

For example, one  FHWA bridge engineer judged a state to be substantially compliant  despite reporting that the state failed to close 96 bridges, as required. A  bridge engineer in another state reported that 47 bridges were not closed  as required, but concluded that the state was substantially compliant.

According to division office officials,  the state was struggling to meet the 20 percent funding match  required of states in order to receive the 80 percent federal-aid  highway funding, due to the economic recession and poor fiscal  situation of the state. Division office officials further explained that had  it not met the match, the state could have lost about $200 million in  federal funds in fiscal year 2012.

In an effort to meet its  match, officials explained that the state identified a private toll bridge  that it repaired and improved using toll revenue, but had never  claimed the revenues as federal toll credits. The FHWA division office  committed staff, including their financial manager, to work with the  state DOT, the private bridge company, and an outside auditing firm  to determine the eligibility of the toll credits. Together they identified  more than $50 million in eligible toll expenditures, finding individual  line item expenditures in areas such as preventative maintenance and  capital improvements related to tolling equipment and real estate  acquisition.

In particular, by targeting areas of risk at both the state  and national level, FHWA can focus on specific program areas of  concern and better utilize limited resources. Division offices conduct  annual assessments of their states to identify the greatest risks and  vulnerabilities, and FHWA headquarters uses this information to  identify common risk areas across the nation. FHWA officials in  several division offices we spoke with stated that they use the risk  assessment to inform their oversight activities throughout the year and  take specific steps, when applicable, to address the risks.

For example, we found that  FHWA\u2019s oversight of statewide planning focuses on process, rather than  specific transportation outcomes. As such, FHWA cannot assess  whether states\u2019 investment decisions are improving the condition and  performance of the nation\u2019s transportation system. Similarly, pursuant to  federal law, federal oversight of metropolitan planning is process-oriented  rather than outcome-oriented, making it difficult to determine whether this  oversight was improving transportation planning. Specifically, FHWA\u2019s  oversight is geared toward determining whether MPOs are in compliance  with federal laws and regulations, and this procedural focus, coupled with  the fact that FHWA rarely withholds certification of MPOs, makes it  difficult to use the certification process as a performance indicator for  MPOs. In addition, we found that while FHWA identifies corrective actions  to bring MPOs into compliance, it does not routinely assess the progress  MPOs are making toward completing those corrective actions.", "We recommended to Congress that FHWA more closely review states\u2019  transportation improvement programs to assess whether states\u2019  investments are achieving intended outcomes, rather than limiting its  evaluation to whether the state complied with federal processes for  developing the plan. We also recommended that Congress make the  metropolitan planning processes more performance-based in order for  FHWA to better assess the MPOs\u2019 progress in achieving results and  better understand whether federal funds are being used to achieve  national goals. approved a multi-year surface transportation reauthorization measure,  which could potentially address these recommendations.", "GAO-09-868. the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires  agencies to measure performance toward the achievement of program  goals and objectives, we have stated previously that the federal  government is not equipped to implement a performance-based approach  to transportation funding because it lacks comprehensive data. For  example, during the administration of the Recovery Act we recommended  that DOT assess the long-term benefits of Recovery Act investments in  transportation infrastructure. In its response, DOT said it expected to be  able to report on Recovery Act outputs, such as the miles of road paved,  but not on outcomes, such as reductions in travel times. We have found  other areas in which the lack of comprehensive, national- level data would  hinder any move toward a performance-based system. For example, in  administering the on-the-job training program, FHWA does not collect  consistent national-level data on the number and demographics of  program participants, the trades involved, and status of trainees. As a  result, FHWA is not able to assess program results and hold states  accountable. In another example, our review of statewide transportation  planning found that while FHWA division offices were collecting data on  progress made by states to advance projects on their statewide  transportation improvement programs to their construction phase, the  data were unreliable to the point of being unusable because they were  collected inconsistently across states and could not be used to compare  states\u2019 progress.

A performance-based  program represents new responsibilities at a time when the growth in the  number and complexity of its responsibilities and the lack of well-defined  federal goals and roles leave FHWA, to a large extent, with a broad  mandate in an increasingly constrained budget environment. As we have  reported previously, a performance-based system is one part of the  broader need to reexamine and restructure the program. A clearer  definition of the federal role and, in turn, FHWA\u2019s responsibilities is under  Congress\u2019s purview, and therefore beyond FHWA\u2019s or its partners\u2019 ability  to address.", "In 2008, we recommended that Congress consider a fundamental  reexamination and reform of surface transportation programs that would  potentially result in a more clearly defined federal role in relation to other  levels of government and thus a more targeted federal role focused  around evident national interests. For issues in which there is a strong  national interest, ongoing federal financial support and direct federal  involvement could help meet federal goals. Where national interests are  less evident, other stakeholders could assume more responsibility, and  some programs and activities may better be devolved to other levels of  government.

These projects can either receive full  oversight from FHWA or that responsibility can be assumed by the state.  During our review, FHWA did not have national-level information on the  number of projects or amount of federal funds spent on locally  administered projects. However, it began requiring division offices to  collect this information for newly authorized projects on March 12, 2012,  so such data will be available in the future. Nevertheless, locally  administered projects are ranked by FHWA\u2019s risk assessments as among  the highest-risk areas in FHWA\u2019s oversight portfolio at both the state and  national levels. For example, at least 33 division offices included risks  related to locally administered projects as their most pressing risk areas  in 2010. These risks included a lack of understanding of federal-aid  construction contract requirements and use of innovative or nontraditional  construction techniques by inexperienced local agencies. Likewise,  FHWA headquarters identified locally administered projects as high risk.  According to FHWA division and state officials, local agencies struggle to  meet federal regulations that accompany federal-aid funding because of  high staff turnover at the local level and the infrequency with which local  agencies receive federal funding.", "These challenges were reiterated throughout the discussion groups we  conducted, as well as at the site visits to FHWA division offices that we  conducted across the country. FHWA officials from two states described a  wide range of risks posed by locally administered projects, including use  of outdated design standards, lack of quality control and assurance, lack  of standard documentation and recordkeeping, and insufficient knowledge  of the right-of-way acquisition requirements. One FHWA division office  provided examples of locally administered projects in their state that did  not conduct construction inspections or materials testing or bought  supplies from foreign countries, actions that are out of compliance with  federal regulations. According to officials in three of the FWHA division  offices we visited, locally administered projects require considerable time,  attention, and resources. For example, according to officials in three  division offices, FHWA staff expend a good deal of time and effort  providing technical assistance and capacity-building to enhance the ability  of local agencies to successfully administer federal-aid projects.", "Further, our analysis of the 2010 state Single Audits showed that  insufficient monitoring of subrecipients, such as on locally administered  projects, was one of the most common findings and that 18 of 47  reporting states had findings related to monitoring of subrecipients. Our  analysis also showed that state DOTs did not properly communicate  federal requirements in their awards to or contracts with subrecipients  and that their monitoring of subrecipients during the award was  inadequate. Specifically, state DOTs\u2019 monitoring of subrecipients for  compliance with federal and state requirements lacked procedures for or  had poor compliance with existing procedures for regular site visits, risk  assessments, and performance reporting.", "As we have reported, devolving parts of the federal-aid highway program  would have many implications and would require careful decisions to be  made at the federal, state, and local levels. Since the federal-aid highway  program has a dedicated source of funding (in that it is funded from fuel  taxes and other fees deposited into the Highway Trust Fund), devolving  parts of the highway program could entail reducing revenues into the  Highway Trust Fund. The decision to reduce revenues at this time would  be difficult because the Congressional Budget Office estimates, as of  March 2012, that to maintain current spending levels plus inflation  between 2013 and 2022, the Highway Trust Fund will require over $125  billion more than it is expected to take in over that period. At the federal level, it would need to be determined what functions would remain and  how federal agencies would be structured and staffed to deliver those  programs. At the state and local levels, it would need to be determined  whether to replace federal revenues with state taxes and what types of  programs to finance.

Because of the nature of their partnership with the states, FHWA\u2019s  division offices may not be in the best position to mitigate partnership  risks.

Specifically, a nationally focused, independent oversight entity  modeled on the NRTs could be an effective vehicle to mitigate risks  associated with partnering between FHWA division offices and state  DOTs by conducting periodic evaluations of selected activities and  making recommendations for improvement. This could be particularly  helpful in instances in which the division offices have been reluctant to  take corrective action because of concerns about damaging the  partnering relationship. In addition, if Congress directed FHWA to move to  a performance-based system, an entity modeled on the NRTs could  assess states\u2019 progress toward performance measures and hold states  accountable for meeting them.

The  information we gathered during the course of this review and the pending  transition to a more performance based federal-aid highway program  reinforces the need to act. First, FHWA\u2019s responsibilities have expanded  over the years while its resources have not, and the addition of a  performance-based system to its already broad mandate would further  expand FHWA\u2019s responsibilities. Reexamining and refocusing surface  transportation programs presents an opportunity to narrow the scope of  FHWA\u2019s responsibilities so that it is better equipped to transition to a  performance-based system.
