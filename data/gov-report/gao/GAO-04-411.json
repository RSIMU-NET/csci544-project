GAO also found agency guidance and procedures for counting arrests to be generally consistent among all six agencies. In addition, the agencies required supervisory review of the justifications for the arrests before they were entered into the agencies' data tracking systems and officially counted. In general, agencies use investigation and arrest statistics as indicators of agency work and as output measures in performance plans, budget justifications, and testimonies. In some cases, these data are considered in making promotion, bonus, and award determinations. However, investigation and arrest statistics are not emphasized in any of these activities, but are one of many factors that are considered. ll of the agencies GAO reviewed counted the same investigations and arrests when more than one of them participated in the investigative and arresting activities. This practice seems appropriate because many investigations and arrests would not have occurred without the involvement and cooperation of all the agencies that participated. If agencies were not allowed to count investigations and arrests in which they participated, agencies would be less likely to work together, cases would be much smaller, and the desired disruption of high-level criminal organizations would be hampered.

The agencies selected were the  Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the  U.S. Marshals Service, all from the Department of Justice (Justice); the  U.S. Customs Service (Customs), from the Department of the Treasury;  and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). We selected DEA, FBI,  Customs, INS, and the Marshals Service because these agencies reported  the highest number of federal arrests, according to the Bureau of Justice  Statistics (BJS) Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, 2000, the  most recent published report available at the time of our selection. We  selected USPIS because it reported the highest number of federal arrests  from non-Justice or non-Treasury agencies.

Detailed  information about the three investigations can be found in appendixes VIII  through X."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Investigations and arrests are core functions of all federal law  enforcement agencies. According to BJS, as of June 2000 (the latest  available information), 69 federal agencies employed 88,000 full-time law  enforcement officers. Of these, Justice employed more than half (58  percent) and the Department of the Treasury employed 21 percent. During  fiscal year 2001, according to BJS, these two agencies accounted for the  highest percentage of arrests for federal offenses, with 71 percent made by  Justice components and 12 percent by Treasury components. In addition,  state and local agencies made 4 percent of the arrests, and 7 percent of the  arrests were made after the suspects voluntarily reported to the Marshals  Service following a summons. The remaining 6 percent of the arrests were  made by other agencies or were undesignated in the statistics.", "Suspects arrested by federal agencies for federal crimes are transferred to  the custody of the Marshals Service for processing, transportation,and  detention. According to BJS, in 2001 the Marshals Service received 118,896  suspects from federal law enforcement agencies, including those the  Marshals arrested themselves. Of these arrests, 28 percent were for drug  offenses; 21 percent for immigration offenses, 16 percent for supervision  violations; 14 percent for property offenses (such as embezzlement,  forgery, burglary, and motor vehicle theft); 8 percent were for public-order  offenses; 5 percent for weapons offenses; 4 percent for violent offenses;  and 3 percent to secure and safeguard a material witness.", "Figure 1 shows the number of suspects arrested only for federal offenses  for the agencies we reviewed. Some suspects arrested by federal agents  are transferred to state and local jurisdictions for prosecution for  nonfederal crimes. For example, according to BJS, in fiscal year 2001 DEA  arrested 11,778 suspects for federal offenses who were booked by the  Marshals Service. However, DEA\u2019s statistical reporting system recorded  over 35,000 arrests that same year; the additional suspects were turned  over to state and local authorities and were not booked through the  Marshals Service, according to BJS.  Similarly, BJS reported that USPIS  arrested 1,226 suspects for federal offenses who were booked by the  Marshals Service in fiscal year 2001, while USPIS told us that they had  made 4,698 federal arrests that same year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Guidance and Procedures for Counting Investigations and Arrests Are Generally Consistent among Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The guidance and procedures for counting investigations, or \u201ccases\u201d as  they are sometimes referred to, are generally consistent among the six  agencies we reviewed. Agencies pursue investigations into crimes that  have a nexus to their respective missions, such as drug trafficking for  DEA, mail theft for USPIS, and illegal aliens for INS. Generally, according  to their guidance and procedures, agencies open cases that result from tips  or leads received from confidential informants or other sources, they may  be invited to help in other agencies\u2019 cases, or they may participate in task  force investigations.

That is, agents must be  directly involved in the arrest, assist other law enforcement personnel in  making the arrest, or provide information that leads to an arrest. For  example, according to DEA\u2019s Agents Manual, agents are to count drug- related arrests only when DEA is directly involved in the arrest. Similarly,  USPIS inspectors are to count arrests when physically present or  providing assistance. According to USPIS\u2019s Inspection Service Manual,  inspectors are to count an arrest when    an inspector participated personally in making an arrest or contributed  significantly to an investigation resulting in an arrest made by another law  enforcement agency;   an inspector\u2019s investigative efforts with another law enforcement agency  motivate and materially contribute to the identity and arrest of a person  for a postal crime event though the inspector was not present at the time;  or   an inspector\u2019s investigation of a postal offense develops additional,  significant evidence that is brought to the prosecutor\u2019s attention that leads  to prosecution for an additional offense.", "The determination of material contribution, as used in the Inspection  Service Manual, is left to the judgment of a supervisor. For example,  according to USPIS officials, if a postal inspector alerted the highway  patrol to an individual suspected of mail theft, or if the inspector was  conducting an ongoing investigation on the suspect and the highway patrol  made the arrest, the arrest would be claimed by USPIS even though the  postal inspectors did not make the physical arrest.", "The other agencies in our review used similar criteria for counting arrests.  In addition, the agencies required supervisory review of the justifications  for the arrests before they were entered into the agencies\u2019 data tracking  systems and officially counted.", "In addition to their guidance and procedures for counting investigations  and arrests, three of the agencies in our review\u2014DEA, FBI, and USPIS\u2014 have an inspection process to, among other things, review the  appropriateness of investigations and arrests that are made. DEA, for  example, told us that its Inspections Division periodically validates a  sample of arrests and screens them for any type of questionable activity,  such as \u201cpiggy backing\u201d arrests. According to a DEA official, piggy backing  is when state and local law enforcement agencies perform the  investigative work and a DEA agent goes along for the arrest, writes it up,  and claims credit for the arrest. The official said that the Inspections  Division has consistently found a very low percentage of questionable  arrests, but that a database of questionable arrests has not been  accumulated. The official gave one example from DEA\u2019s New York Field  Office, where 2 or 3 questionable arrests out of over 8,000 were found. The  official indicated that questionable arrests are mostly isolated incidents  and are not part of any systemic problems. The official concluded that if  questionable arrests were found, those arrest statistics would be removed  from the agency database.

DEA\u2019s  budget requests to Congress also included investigation and arrest  statistics. For example, in its fiscal year 2003 budget request, DEA  reported on an operation that resulted in 38 arrests, and a table in DEA\u2019s  fiscal year 2004 budget request entitled \u201cDomestic Enforcement\u201d showed  the number of national/local investigations, investigations completed, and  total investigations.", "Conversely, INS did not cite investigation and arrest statistics in its budget  justification documents. Investigation and arrest activities were discussed,  however, in the very broadest terms. For example, in its 2003 budget  justification documentation, INS indicated that it would initiate high- priority investigations, conduct asset seizures, and present individuals for  prosecution for alien smuggling-related violations to disrupt the means  and methods that facilitate alien smuggling. And, in its 2002  documentation, INS noted that, as a result of its efforts, many alien  smugglers, fraud organizations, and facilitators were arrested and  presented for prosecution; assets were seized; and aliens with a nexus to  organized crime, violent gangs, drug trafficking gangs, or who have  terrorist-related affiliations, were apprehended.", "Concerning inclusion of arrest statistics in congressional testimony, DEA\u2019s  Administrator\u2019s testimonies to Congress on the agency\u2019s budget requests  often contained references to successful cases that resulted in arrests. For  example, in the fiscal year 2003 budget request, the Administrator said that  an operation resulted in 14 arrests. The Administrator\u2019s testimony for  fiscal year 2004 also included similar examples, such as DEA disrupting 30  drug trafficking organizations and dismantling 15 others. In addition, in  congressional testimony on the fiscal year 2002 budget request, the FBI  Director said that overall, during fiscal year 2000, FBI investigations  contributed to the indictment of over 19,000 individuals, the conviction of  over 21,000 individuals, and the arrest of more than 36,000 individuals.", "As an example of using investigation statistics in public documents, on  September 2, 2003, DEA listed on its Web site 37 major operations that it  had been involved in from 1992 to 2003. Many of these listings detailed  major investigations involving joint operations with other federal, state,  and local law enforcement agencies that resulted in disruptions and  dismantlement of narcotics trafficking operations and in numerous  arrests. In addition, many of the listings gave credit to the other  participating agencies for their work on the same cases.", "Agency officials said, however, that the investigation and arrest statistics  are only one of many factors used as indicators of agency workload and  productivity and are not emphasized in reporting results of agencies\u2019  workload performance. For example, DEA officials told us that instead of  pursuing numbers of investigations and arrests, their focus is on  targeting, disrupting, and dismantling major drug trafficking organizations;   working cooperatively and closely with other federal, state, and local law    making an impact on reducing the flow of narcotics and dangerous drugs  into the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Numbers of Investigations and Arrests Are Used as Workload Indicators and, to a Limited Extent, Used in Promotion, Bonus, and Award Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials with whom we spoke told us that investigation and arrest  statistics are used as measures of productivity and indicators of workload  activity, but only to a limited extent in personnel management activities  such as promotions, bonuses, and awards.

An inspector or team, for example, that makes a large number of  arrests as culmination of an investigation could receive an award,  according to the officials.", "The other agencies we reviewed generally followed similar criteria on the  use of investigation and arrest statistics in performance management  decisions as that described earlier by the USPIS officials.
