It also assesses whether OPM acted in an independent and objective manner in choosing to review DEA and its background investigations. This latter objective came about because OPM would be contractually obligated to use its own contractor to do DEA\u2019s background investigations if DEA relinquished authority. This contracting firm was established in 1996, when OPM privatized much of its background investigation function. Most of the firm\u2019s employees were former OPM employees.", "A series of evaluations in the 1990s critical of DEA\u2019s background investigations and personnel security program caused DEA to consider relinquishing its background investigation authority. The findings of OPM\u2019s assessments over much of the 1990s, an assessment by DOJ in 1998, and its own assessment in 1999 triggered DEA\u2019s consideration of this issue.

The deficiencies included, for example, a failure to conduct searches related to foreign travel and searches of law enforcement records. In addition, in 1992 and again in 1998, OPM reviewed DEA\u2019s personnel security program.

Ultimately, a deficiency\u2019s seriousness depends on what type of activity might have been found if the appropriate search had been conducted or if a particular investigative technique had been used.

From what DEA officials told us, it was considering retaining the authority to investigate individuals who apply for DEA Special Agent positions but relinquishing the authority to do all other background investigations, including periodic reinvestigations of Special Agents. In his October 1998 memorandum, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration said that he believed that DEA should relinquish all authority, including the authority to investigate the backgrounds of Special Agent applicants.", "According to DEA, relinquishing all other background investigation authority would allow DEA to redirect resources into the investigative process for Special Agent applicants.

During that period, two private investigative firms sued OPM. According to OPM, these firms believed that OPM was going to take work away from them to support its privatized contractor. The suits were settled when OPM agreed, among other things, that it would not rescind delegations of authority, such as the DEA delegation, except for unsatisfactory performance. Also during this period, a former director of OPM testified before Congress on its privatization plans and emphasized that OPM did not intend to rescind any delegated authorities in order to give new business to the privatized company.
