These findings are generally consistent with prior GAO work, which used national survey data to compare CHIP enrollees' access and service use with children who were uninsured or privately insured. When comparing CHIP enrollees with privately insured children, the mandated evaluation and prior GAO work differed regarding the utilization of certain services, such as emergency room use and dental services, which may be due to differences in when the data were collected and the particular measures that were used.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also publishes data on quality measures that states voluntarily report annually. These Child Core Set measures show mixed results regarding service utilization among CHIP and Medicaid enrollees. For example, states reported that nearly all children aged 12 to 24 months enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid had at least one primary care physician visit during fiscal year 2013. However, states reported that far fewer children obtained dental prevention or treatment services, with a mean of 46 percent of children receiving a preventive dental service, and a mean of 25 percent receiving dental treatment services. HHS officials said that they use these data to help identify areas for improvement in the care provided in CHIP and Medicaid.", "GAO's prior work has identified important issues related to cost, coverage, and access that Congress may wish to consider when determining the ongoing need for CHIP, many of which were similar to issues raised by officials from the 10 states GAO reviewed.", "With regard to cost, GAO's prior work found that costs\u2014defined as deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and premiums\u2014were almost always less for selected CHIP plans when compared with states' benchmark health plans, which were the models for health plans available in health insurance exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Officials in five states expressed concerns about the higher cost of exchange plans compared with CHIP and the implications for families' finances.", "With regard to coverage, GAO previously reported that selected CHIP and state benchmark plans were generally similar in terms of their coverage of selected services and the services on which they imposed limits. However, officials from several of the 10 states pointed out that for many services needed by children with special health care needs, CHIP coverage was more comprehensive than exchange plans.", "With regard to access, several states raised concerns about negative implications for children's coverage if CHIP funding is not reauthorized, including concerns that their states would lose gains made in covering children, who would also lose access to providers and dental care."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a joint federal- state program that was established by Congress in 1997, finances health  insurance for over 8 million children whose household incomes are above  the threshold for Medicaid eligibility. Prior to CHIP, private health  insurance coverage for children had been declining every year since  1987\u2014reaching its lowest level of about 66 percent of children in 1994.  While Medicaid helped to cushion the effect of this decline, many of the  children losing coverage were ineligible for Medicaid coverage. Since the  inception of CHIP, the percentage of uninsured children nationwide has  decreased by half, from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 6.6 percent in the first   3 months of 2014. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  oversees CHIP, with states designing, managing, and administering the  operations of their individual programs. States administer CHIP under  broad federal requirements, and the programs vary, for example, in the  services covered, costs to individuals and families, and eligibility  requirements.", "Over the course of the program, Congress has enacted legislation at  various times authorizing continued funding for CHIP. Most recently, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) appropriated federal  CHIP funding through fiscal year 2015. PPACA requires that beginning  in October 2015, if a state\u2019s CHIP funding is insufficient to cover all CHIP- eligible children, the state must establish procedures to ensure that the  children who are not covered by CHIP are screened for Medicaid. If such  children are determined to be ineligible for Medicaid, the children may be  enrolled in a qualified health plan (QHP)\u2014which are plans offered by  private issuers through health insurance exchanges in that state\u2014that  has been certified as comparable to CHIP by the Secretary of HHS, if  such a QHP is available. Over the longer term, PPACA requires states to  maintain eligibility levels for children in CHIP and Medicaid until fiscal  year 2019. Thus, under current law, some states could choose to  eliminate or scale back their programs beginning in fiscal year 2020, even  if federal funds are available.", "Given that the Congress will decide whether to extend CHIP funding  beyond 2015, you asked us to provide information about the effect that  CHIP has had on children\u2019s health care, and what key issues may be  considered in determining the ongoing need for the CHIP program. In this  report, we examine (1) what assessments of CHIP suggest about the  effect of the program on children\u2019s health care coverage and access  across states; and (2) what key issues the Congress may wish to  consider in determining whether to extend CHIP funding.", "To examine what assessments of CHIP suggest about the program\u2019s  effect, we synthesized information from HHS reports on CHIP, including a  mandated national evaluation on the evolution of the program (referred to  as the mandated evaluation) and its role in providing health coverage to  low-income children. We also reviewed HHS\u2019s annual CHIP and  Medicaid reports on quality for fiscal years 2011 through 2014, relying  primarily on the 2014 report (referred to as the annual quality report),  which use state-reported data to assess the quality of care provided to  children enrolled in CHIP and Medicaid for the applicable fiscal year, and  a series of issue briefs on state practices to improve the quality of care for  children enrolled in these programs.

For example, states may operate CHIP as a separate program,  include CHIP-eligible children in their Medicaid programs, or use a  combination of the two approaches. States with separate CHIP  programs may modify certain aspects of their programs, such as  coverage and cost-sharing requirements.regulations require states\u2019 separate CHIP programs to include coverage   However, federal laws and  for routine check-ups, immunizations, inpatient and outpatient hospital  services, and dental services defined as \u201cnecessary to prevent disease  and promote oral health, restore oral structures to health and function,  and treat emergency conditions.\u201d In addition, CHIP premiums and cost- sharing may not exceed maximum amounts as defined by law. Similarly,  PPACA provides states with flexibility in how they opt to implement  certain coverage options included in the law. For example, PPACA allows  states to expand eligibility for Medicaid to most non-elderly, non-pregnant  adults who are not eligible for Medicare and whose income is at or below  133 percent of the FPL. As of January 2015, 29 states have  implemented this expansion. PPACA required the establishment of  health insurance exchanges by January 1, 2014, to allow consumers to  compare individual health insurance options available in each state and  enroll in coverage. In states electing not to operate their own exchange,  PPACA required the federal government to establish and operate an  exchange in the state, referred to as a federally facilitated exchange.  States with federally facilitated exchanges may enter into a partnership  with HHS to assist with the operation of certain exchange functions. As  such, a state could establish the exchange (referred to as a state-based  exchange), cede the responsibility entirely to HHS (referred to as a  federally facilitated exchange), or enter into a partnership with HHS  (referred to as a partnership exchange). As of January 2015, 17 states  established state-based exchanges, 27 states were using the federally  facilitated exchange, and 7 states established partnership exchanges.See fig. 1 for information on the variation in children\u2019s uninsured rates,  CHIP characteristics, and coverage approaches under PPACA by state;  and see appendix I for the information in tabular form.", "The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009  (CHIPRA) included provisions aimed at improving the information  available from states on the quality of health care furnished to children in  both CHIP and Medicaid. Specifically, CHIPRA required the Secretary  of HHS to conduct an independent evaluation of CHIP and to submit the  results to Congress. The mandated evaluation, for which the final report  was issued in August 2014, documents what is known about CHIP;  explores the program\u2019s evolution since inception; and examines the role  CHIP has played in covering low-income children. In addition, CHIPRA  required HHS to identify quality measures, known as the Child Core Set  measures, to serve as a tool for states to use to monitor and improve the  quality of health care provided to children enrolled in CHIP and Medicaid.  CHIPRA also required HHS to develop a standardized format for states to  voluntarily report these measures. These measures assess the quality of  care provided through CHIP and Medicaid, and include a range of health  conditions, such as asthma, obesity, attention deficit hyperactivity  disorder, and perinatal care. (See table 1.)", "In 2013, as required by CHIPRA, HHS began annually publishing  recommended changes to the Child Core Set measures in an effort to  improve upon the measures and align them with national quality  measurement activities, which can result in changes to the number of  measures. With the use of state reported data on the Child Core Set,  HHS conducts an annual assessment and publishes its findings in its  annual quality report, as required under CHIPRA. States report CHIP  service utilization and other measures through systems developed by  HHS; specifically, the CHIP Annual Reporting Template System  (CARTS), a web-based data submission tool, and through the Form  CMS-416, an annual report submitted by states on the Medicaid Early  and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit  provided for enrolled children. States that use managed care plans to  deliver CHIP benefits are also required to report outcomes and  performance measures from External Quality Review Organizations and  performance improvement projects.", "In February 2010, CMS awarded 10 grants\u2014which funded 18 states to implement  projects that include using quality measures to improve child health.

For  example, based on an analysis of data from the Current Population  Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC), the  evaluation reported that Medicaid and CHIP contributed to the decline in  the national rate of uninsured children between 1997 and 2012, with  coverage rates improving for all ethnic and income groups.notably, coverage rates for Hispanic children increased dramatically,  rising from 42 percent to 65 percent during this time. Changes to state  CHIP programs also contributed to the decline in the national uninsured  rates among children. For example, many states expanded CHIP  coverage by raising upper income eligibility limits and covering newly  eligible groups, such as immigrant children who have resided legally in  the United States for less than 5 years, which was newly permitted under   Most  federal law. In addition, state outreach and enrollment activities also  reduced the number of children eligible for\u2014but not enrolled in\u2014Medicaid  or CHIP by about 1.2 million from 2008 to 2012.", "To determine whether factors other than insurance coverage may affect differences in  responses about obtaining care or utilization of health care services, the mandated  evaluation controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity and language groups, more than three  children in the household, highest education of any parent, parents\u2019 employment status,  parent citizenship, and local area or county.", "CHIP enrollees were an estimated 38 percentage points more likely   to have a usual source of dental care, and were an estimated   39 percentage points more likely to have had a dental check-up in the  past year;", "CHIP enrollees were an estimated 25 percentage points more likely to  have an annual well-child checkup visit, and were more likely to  receive a range of health services, including mental health visits,  specialty care, and prescription drugs;", "CHIP enrollees were more likely to receive most preventive care  measures, including flu vaccinations, vision screenings, and height  and weight measurements; and parents of CHIP enrollees were less likely to report having trouble  paying their child\u2019s medical bills, and were substantially more  confident in their ability to get needed health care for their child.", "Based on our assessment of HHS\u2019s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey  from 2007 through 2010, we also found that children enrolled in CHIP  have better access to care and service use than children who are  uninsured. In particular, when compared with uninsured children, we  found that CHIP enrollees fared better, and the differences we identified  were statistically significant in most cases. For example, a higher proportion of CHIP respondents reported having a usual source of care; ease in getting a person the care,  tests, or treatment that the parent or a doctor believed necessary; and  ease in seeing a specialist; and using certain health care services, including office-based provider  visits, outpatient department provider visits, and dental care visits.", "When the mandated evaluation compared CHIP enrollees with the  privately-insured group, it also found that CHIP enrollees experienced  comparable access and service use for many, but not all, measures, and  that parents of children enrolled in CHIP experienced less financial  burden in paying their children\u2019s medical bills.", "CHIP enrollees used a similar level of preventive care and other  health care services; however, CHIP enrollees had higher usage of  prescription medication and lower levels of emergency department  visits and hospital stays.", "CHIP enrollees had similar rates of health and development  screenings, but were 9 percentage points less likely to receive a flu  vaccination.", "CHIP enrollees had higher rates of dental access and utilization of  certain services. For example, 92 percent of CHIP enrollees reported  having access to dental coverage in 2012, compared with 77 percent  of privately insured children.

For  example, when asked about their use of certain medical and dental  services, we found that access to care for CHIP enrollees was lower than  that of the privately-insured for several services, and these differences  were often statistically significant. Specifically, we previously reported that a lower proportion of CHIP enrollees reported visiting dentists   (42.4 percent compared with 50.9 percent) and orthodontists   (4.9 percent compared with 11.2 percent) within the past 12 months  than did those who were privately insured; and a higher proportion of CHIP enrollees reported having an emergency  room visit (14.1 percent compared with 10.4 percent).", "Differences between our findings and those included in the national  evaluation may be related to the timeframes of the data and the  measures used. For example, some of the data used in our analyses  predate the CHIPRA requirement that CHIP programs offer  comprehensive dental benefits coverage beginning in 2009. The  timeframes for both bodies of work also predate the implementation of the  PPACA requirement that most individual and small group market health  plans provide pediatric dental coverage.", "Finally, while the mandated evaluation noted that, overall, CHIP programs  were meeting the health care needs of most enrollees, it identified areas  for program improvement. Specifically, many CHIP enrollees did not  receive recommended preventive care or reported an unmet health care  need. For example, slightly less than half of CHIP enrollees received a flu  vaccination, and only about one-third received a developmental screening  for children under age 6. In addition, one in four CHIP enrollees had an  unmet health care need, with the highest unmet need being for dental  care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Ongoing Efforts to Enhance State Reporting of Quality Measures and Identify Areas for Improvement to Care Provided in CHIP", "paragraphs": ["HHS publishes data that states report on the Child Core Set measures in  its annual quality report. While reporting on the Child Core Set measures  is voluntary for states, the number of states reporting these quality  measures and the median number of measures each state reports has  increased steadily since reporting of the measures began in 2010. For  example, beginning in fiscal year 2012, all 51 states have reported at  least two or more measures, a notable increase from the 43 states that  reported at least one measure for fiscal year 2010. Similarly, the median  number of Child Core Set measures that states report has increased from  about 7 measures in fiscal year 2010 to 16 measures in fiscal year 2013.

For example,  HHS suggests that medical record reviews be used to calculate a  perinatal measure related to the performance of caesarean sections  and none of these states reported this measure in fiscal year 2013.", "Rhode Island officials noted that it can be difficult to collect data for  measures that are not nationally endorsed\u2014and as a result, they may  not report them. For example, in fiscal year 2013, Rhode Island did  not report the Child Core Set measure of a developmental screening  in the first 3 years of a child\u2019s life, which had not been endorsed by  the National Committee for Quality Assurance, but developed by a  university in Oregon.", "Noting that the state does not have a department dedicated to  measuring quality, Alaska cited a lack of internal expertise needed to  collect and report reliable data for the measures. As such, an official  cited the need to leverage resources and work with other agencies  within the state that have the expertise to analyze measures and set  targets for quality improvement.", "In light of difficulties cited by states in reporting on the Child Core Set  measures, HHS reported ongoing efforts to assist states with reporting  the measures. For example, to streamline state reporting, HHS began  calculating three Child Core Set measures on behalf of states in fiscal  year 2012. Specifically, HHS began calculating the preventive dental and  dental treatment measures from the Form CMS-416. At this time, HHS  also began using data available from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention to calculate the neonatal central-line associated blood stream  infection measure. In addition, HHS assists states by allowing states to  report Child Core Set measures for the Medicaid population, CHIP  population, or combined Medicaid and CHIP populations.", "Additionally, HHS reported efforts to assist states in improving their  reporting of the Child Core Set measures through the Quality  Demonstration Grant Program. Through this program, HHS awarded   10 grants providing funding to 18 states to implement various projects to  improve the information available on the quality of care provided to  children enrolled in CHIP, including undertaking efforts to improve their  reporting of the Child Core Set measures. For example, in one such  project, Pennsylvania is testing the use of financial rewards to encourage  certain health systems\u2014which include hospitals, primary care practice  sites, and other facilities\u2014to use the Child Core Set measures to drive   Pennsylvania also reported that it is  quality improvement projects.recruiting health systems to determine the extent to which electronic  health records can provide data for the Child Core Set measures for  children.", "From the measures submitted by states, HHS reports states\u2019 performance  to assess the quality of care for children enrolled in CHIP and Medicaid,  and the results of this assessment are mixed.

Based on this assessment,  HHS determined that states had high performance rates for some  measures, such as young children\u2019s access to primary care. For example,  a mean of 96 percent of children aged 12 to 24 months enrolled in CHIP  or Medicaid had at least one primary care physician visit during fiscal year  2013.

This price difference does not account for differences  in co-pays, which the state does not charge under CHIP. The extent  to which QHPs in the state apply co-pays to covered services could  increase this price differential further. As such, Nevada officials were  concerned that absent CHIP, families would not purchase QHP plans  due to their higher cost.", "Due to the additional premiums and cost-sharing associated with  SADPs, New Hampshire officials expressed concern that families will  forego dental care if they must purchase a SADP.

Nevada officials stated that these children could lose CHIP  coverage since a significant portion of them have parents who may not  file federal income tax returns that would expose them to tax penalties for  failing to enroll their children in alternative health coverage. In addition, an  Alaska official noted the need for further work on the comparability of  benefits between QHPs and CHIP to ensure that the former could be an  adequate substitute, and that children moving to QHPs would not  experience decreased access to health care. The official noted that  comparability across benefit packages is particularly important for  children in households whose income changes would result in movement  between CHIP and QHPs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.
