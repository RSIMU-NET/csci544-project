Currently, EOUSA manages an IT  environment consisting of central and distributed computing and  communication resources in Washington, D.C., and 93 USAOs, respectively.  Connectivity among these offices, Justice headquarters, and Justice\u2019s Data  Center in Rockville, MD, is through a virtual private network (VPN)  connection on the Justice Consolidated Network (JCN), with such security safeguards as firewalls between USAO local area networks and JCN.

An  organization with this foundation (stage 2 maturity) has attained  repeatable, successful investment control processes and basic selection  processes at the project level. Successful management at this level allows  an organization to measure the progress of existing IT projects and to  identify variances in cost, schedule, and performance expectations by  following established, disciplined processes. The organization should also  be able to take corrective action, if appropriate, and should possess basic  capabilities for selecting new project proposals. To accomplish this level of  basic control, an organization should establish an investment board,  identify the business needs and opportunities to be addressed by each  project, and use this knowledge in the selection of new proposals.", "The office has satisfied two of the critical processes for stage 2, but it has  not satisfied the other three. Specifically, it has established an investment  governing board, known as the Investment Review Board (IRB) and  developed a guide to direct its operations.

Federal  and Justice guidance also advocate establishing these policies and  controls.", "While EOUSA is guided by many Justice security policies, it has not yet  implemented key security controls that are needed to satisfy them. For  example, CIO officials told us that the existing firewall/VPN system, which,  as of May 9, 2003, was operating at 75 sites, is not based on explicit firewall  rules. Moreover, according to these officials, no intrusion detection devices  monitor the wide-area network (WAN) routers, firewalls, and VPN  devices. Rather, the intrusion detection devices that are currently  implemented are located only within the local area network environment  (i.e., within a USAO). Also, the contingency plan developed for the  replacement firewall/VPN system was not prepared according to federal  guidelines. For example, the contingency plan does not specify procedures  for notifying recovery personnel or assessing damage to systems. CIO  officials told us that they had not implemented these security controls  because, as previously noted, they believe the risks inherent in the network  are minimal given that it resides on Justice\u2019s JCN, for which they said they  assumed Justice had performed risk assessments. However, as previously  stated, EOUSA provided no evidence to support this assumption, and  Justice has had longstanding security weaknesses.", "Until EOUSA implements security controls, it may be unaware of  vulnerabilities, increasing the risk that intruders may take control of  network devices or that data passing through its firewalls can be read or  manipulated.

However, Justice officials  told us that, although they had evaluated the contractor\u2019s management of  the WAN\u2019s circuits, they had not performed any tests to determine the  effectiveness of technical and other controls associated with the WAN. The  lack of testing heightens the risk that individuals both within and outside  Justice could compromise EOUSA\u2019s external and internal security controls  to gain extensive unauthorized access to its networks and to networks to  which it is connected.", "EOUSA officials also told us that, contrary to Justice\u2019s policy, they do not  maintain summary records of security incidents.

It also noted, among other things, that it had added 10  field security positions and 2 headquarters positions, and that its data are  monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and have never been  compromised. We do not question these statements concerning the office\u2019s  information security program and associated activities because (1) the  purpose and scope of our review was not to compare EOUSA to other  Justice component organizations or other federal agencies, and thus  EOUSA\u2019s relative standing is not relevant to the findings in our report and  (2) the message of our report is not that EOUSA has not taken steps to  improve its information security posture, but rather that the office\u2019s  information security management efforts, including ongoing and complete  improvement steps, are weak in a number of areas relative to information  security management best practices. Accordingly, we make  recommendations aimed at addressing identified weaknesses, including a  recommendation to implement network intrusion detection devices and  other security controls. While EOUSA\u2019s comments cited plans that are  consistent with many of our security-related recommendations, it  disagreed with the recommendation relative to its wide area network on  the grounds that this network is managed, secured, and monitored by  Justice and Sprint. We understand that the WAN is not managed by EOUSA,  and accordingly our recommendation was aimed at actively monitoring the  network routers, firewalls, and VPN devices, which are managed by  EOUSA. To avoid any confusion about this recommendation, we have  clarified its wording to better reflect our intentions. Similarly, in light of the  recent progress that EOUSA has made replacing its VPN system, we have  adjusted our finding and recommendation concerning the office\u2019s exposure  to risk from its old VPN system.", "Second, with respect to our statements that EOUSA has not treated  institutionalization of each of the four IT management disciplines\u2014 enterprise architecture management, IT investment management, system  acquisition management, and information security management\u2014as  agency priorities, the office stated that these statements were unfair and  that it did not agree with them. To support its position, EOUSA made the  following two points: (1) it has made tremendous progress, as evidenced by  our report recognizing those best practices that it is satisfying, and (2) it  has received the highest level of support from Justice, as evidenced by the  establishment of the EOUSA CIO position in 2001, the progress that has  been made in the last 2 years compared to other Justice component  organizations, and EOUSA\u2019s being viewed by Justice senior management as  a leader in IT management. We do not challenge EOUSA\u2019s two points  because they are not relevant to our position regarding treating  institutionalization of each of the four IT management disciplines as agency  priorities. Our position is based on two facts that EOUSA did not dispute:  (1) plans for addressing the weaknesses cited in our report do not exist and  (2) limitations in resources to address these weaknesses were cited by  EOUSA officials as the reason why the weaknesses exist. In our view, if  each of these areas were an agency priority, then plans would be in place to  address the weaknesses, and resources to execute the plans would be  committed.", "Third, with respect to our conclusion that EOUSA is currently limited in its  ability to meet Justice\u2019s strategic goal of improving its IT systems, and that  the USAOs are thereby challenged in their ability to effectively and  efficiently meet their mission goals and objectives, the office disagreed but  did not offer any comments to counter our conclusion beyond those cited  above. Given that any organization\u2019s ability to effectively leverage  technology is determined in large part by its institutionalized capabilities in  these four IT disciplines, we have not modified our conclusion.", "EOUSA provided additional comments that have been incorporated in the  report as appropriate. EOUSA\u2019s written comments are reproduced in  appendix III, along with our detailed evaluation of each comment.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the  date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to  interested congressional committees. We will also send copies to the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Attorney General of  the United States, the EOUSA Director, and the EOUSA CIO. We will also  send copies to others upon request.

To meet this objective, we focused on whether EOUSA had  institutionalized four key IT management disciplines: enterprise  architecture management, IT investment management, information  security management, and system acquisition management.", "To evaluate EOUSA\u2019s enterprise architecture (EA) management, we first  solicited responses to an EA management questionnaire, reviewed EA  plans and products, and interviewed officials to verify their responses.  Next, we compared the information that we had collected with GAO\u2019s  February 2002 EA management maturity framework to determine the  extent to which EOUSA was employing effective EA management  practices. This framework is based on the Practical Guide to Federal  Enterprise Architecture, published by the Chief Information Officers\u2019  (CIO) Council. We did not use the revised framework issued in April  2003 because, by then, we had already completed our work.", "To evaluate EOUSA\u2019s IT investment management (ITIM), we used GAO\u2019s  ITIM framework and assessed the extent to which EOUSA had satisfied  the critical processes associated with stage 2 of the five-stage  framework\u2014building the investment foundation. We focused on stage 2  processes because officials told us that they had only recently begun  defining and implementing the specific practices that are associated  with this stage. To conduct our assessment, we reviewed relevant  EOUSA and Justice policies, procedures, guidance, and  documentation\u2014including the office\u2019s investment management guide  and associated memorandums, project proposals, and budget  documents. We also interviewed the CIO and the senior official who is  responsible for implementing IT investment management. We then  compared this information with our maturity framework to determine  the extent to which the office was employing effective IT investment  management practices.", "To evaluate EOUSA\u2019s information security management, we used our  executive guide for information security management, as well as  Justice policy and guidance and relevant EOUSA U.S. Attorney  Procedures.We reviewed internal Justice and other reports identifying  security weaknesses at Justice and EOUSA and information on how  these weaknesses will be addressed. We also reviewed the certification  and accreditation package and the deployment schedule for the virtual  private networkthat the office is currently deploying, because EOUSA  and the USAOs rely on this network to carry out its mission. We  interviewed Justice officials and EOUSA officials within the Office of  the CIO about the office\u2019s security management.", "To evaluate EOUSA\u2019s system acquisition management, we used the  Software Engineering Institute\u2019s Software Acquisition Capability  Maturity Model, focusing on six of the seven key process areas that are  defined for level 2 of the model\u2019s five-level maturity scale. We focused  on level 2 processes because they represent the minimum level of  maturity needed to effectively manage system acquisition projects. We  used the office\u2019s acquisition of the Enterprise Case Management System  as a case study because officials stated that it is representative of how  they intend to acquire systems. In addition, this system will be critical in  providing fundamental support to the U.S. Attorneys as they work to  achieve mission goals. We reviewed key project documentation, such as  the concept of operations, project plan, and requirements traceability  matrix, and we interviewed system acquisition officials. We also  reviewed the Justice guidance used to manage the project. We then  compared this information to the Software Acquisition Capability  Maturity Model to determine the extent to which the office was  employing effective system acquisition management practices.", "We performed our work at EOUSA headquarters in Washington, D.C., from  November 2002 to May 2003, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Justice", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Justice\u2019s letter  dated June 16, 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We disagree. Our position that institutionalization has not been a  priority is based on two facts that EOUSA did not dispute: (1) plans for  addressing the weaknesses cited in our report do not exist and (2)  limitations in resources to address these weaknesses were cited by  EOUSA officials as the reason why the weaknesses exist. If each of  these areas were an agency priority, then plans would be in place to  address the weaknesses, and resources to execute the plans would be  committed. 2. We do not question EOUSA\u2019s statement that it has made \u201ctremendous  progress.\u201d Our work focused on determining the extent to which  EOUSA currently satisfies key practices in the four IT management  disciplines. It did not include developing a baseline from which to  measure progress. To EOUSA\u2019s credit, our review showed that the  office has satisfied many key practices in each discipline, and we have  noted this in our report.  3. We agree and include both of these facts in our report. 4. We disagree. EOUSA\u2019s comments did not include any information to  refute our conclusion. Given that it did not have a plan for fully  implementing best practices for each discipline, and had not allocated  adequate resources to support such a plan, we have not modified our  conclusion.  5. We do not question these statements about the position of EOUSA and  the USAOs relative to other Justice components. Such a comparison  was not part of the scope of our work.  6. We disagree. EOUSA has not gained this maturity level. Rather,  according to EOUSA, the contractor that maintains its LIONS  application is certified as a level 3 software developer. In contrast, our  work focused on EOUSA\u2019s capabilities as a software acquirer, and thus  addresses a different organization, discipline, and maturity model.  7. See comment 1. 8. We do not question this statement because the position of EOUSA and  the USAOs relative to other Justice components or other law  enforcement entities was not part of the scope of our work. 9. As noted in our report, EOUSA satisfied about 80 percent of the  elements of just stage 2 of the EA management framework. It has  satisfied about 60 percent of the elements (12 out of 19) of the entire  framework.  10. We have modified the report to reflect this comment. 11. We agree. However, according to GAO\u2019s IT Investment Management  Framework, to satisfy the proposal selection critical process, EOUSA  would need to demonstrate the use of the criteria it has defined.  Because it has not yet done so, it is not satisfying the critical process  and thus has met two out of five elements of stage 2 of the framework. 12. We disagree. Our assessment is based on EOUSA\u2019s satisfaction of key  practices laid out in our executive guide for information security  management. This assessment showed that EOUSA has not fully  satisfied any of these key practices. For example, EOUSA does not  (1) have a central security focal point with appropriate resources,  (2) adequately promote user awareness, and (3) regularly monitor the  effectiveness of security controls. Until EOUSA addresses these and  other security weaknesses we identify in our report, it will not have  implemented effective security practices. 13. See comment 8. 14. We do not question this statement because determining whether the  data of the United States Attorneys have never been compromised and  are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week was not within the scope  of our work and EOUSA did not provide any evidence supporting its  assertions. 15. See comment 1. Additionally, our finding is that the  institutionalization of information security management has not been  an agency priority.  16. We do not question these security initiatives. Additionally, we  emphasize that our message is not that EOUSA has not taken steps to  improve its information security posture, but rather that the office\u2019s  information security management efforts, including ongoing and  completed improvement steps, are weak in a number of areas relative  to information security management best practices. 17. We agree, but would add that our recommendation could be addressed  by actively monitoring activity at the routers, firewalls, and wide area  network devices, which we understand are remotely managed by  EOUSA. To avoid any potential confusion on this point, we have  clarified our recommendation. Implementing an intrusion detection  system to monitor activity at the routers, firewalls, and other network  devices would enable EOUSA to detect hostile attempts to manage  those devices. 18. We do not question EOUSA\u2019s statement that it has been working to  resolve vulnerabilities identified during a security audit conducted by  the Justice Inspector General. The scope of the Inspector General\u2019s  audit, however, was narrower than ours in that it focused on EOUSA\u2019s  local area network environment.  19. We agree that given EOUSA\u2019s recent progress in deploying the  replacement network its exposure to risk is currently limited. We have  modified the security risk assessment section of the report and the  associated recommendation to reflect this change in circumstances. 20. We agree and thus do not conclude that EOUSA\u2019s risk assessment  program is inadequate. Rather, based on the fact that a risk assessment  was not performed on the network that EOUSA has operated since  1996 and, until recently, relied exclusively on, we conclude that EOUSA  has not always performed risk assessments. Additionally, to recognize  the recent change in circumstances we have modified our  recommendation concerning risk assessments.  21. We do not question these statements. We support the use of automated  tools to review audit logs, particularly because these logs were not  being reviewed, and EOUSA attributed this to a lack of resources. We  also support EOUSA\u2019s plan to conduct regular tests to determine  compliance with policies and procedures. Both of these planned  actions are consistent with our recommendations. 22. We do not question this statement. However, as noted in our report, the  office did not have a plan to address the issues that are discussed in our  report.  23. We do not question these statements because our review did not  address contingency plans for all certified and accredited systems. As  stated in the report, while a contingency plan was developed for the  replacement network, it was not prepared in accordance with federal  guidelines. For example, the plan did not specify procedures for  notifying recovery personnel. To clarify our position, we have added  examples to the report of this plan\u2019s noncompliance with federal  guidelines. 24. We support EOUSA\u2019s stated commitment to establish a centralized  security training program. Establishing such a program is consistent  with our recommendations. 25. We have modified the report to reflect that the Enterprise Case  Management System is the first acquisition to follow the Justice life- cycle methodology from its inception.  26. See comment 6.  27. We have modified the report to reflect that EOUSA\u2019s acquisitions are  processed through the department and must comply with all  departmental policies and procedures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Nabajyoti Barkakati, Jamey  Collins, Joanne Fiorino, Anh Q.
