For example, in a 1995 poll, 27 percent of the respondents listed crime and violence as the most important problems facing the country. Polls also have suggested that tougher anticrime legislation is a top priority for the public. For instance, 80 percent of the respondents to a 1996 Gallup Poll supported life sentences for drug dealers. Congress has authorized grants to the states that support tougher sentencing policies for criminals and expanded prison construction to house the growing number of inmates. For example, in the Department of Justice\u2019s 1996 appropriations, Congress authorized about $10.3 billion in grants to states for fiscal years 1996 through 2000 for, among other things, building or expanding correctional facilities to house persons convicted of violent crimes.", "According to BJS\u2019 National Crime Victimization Survey (April 1996), there were 51 violent victimizations per 1,000 U.S. residents in 1994, which was the latest year that complete data were available. Since its inception in 1973, the survey has determined that crime rates and levels have fluctuated over extended periods. Specifically, violent crime rates leveled off between 1992 and 1994, compared with a 20-percent decline between 1981 and 1986 and a 15-percent rise between 1986 and 1991. Property crime continued a general 15-year decline. The survey did not provide any reasons for the fluctuations in crime rates and levels. Even though crime rates have fluctuated, overall crime rates in the 1990s remain substantially higher than those in the 1960s. For example, according to Uniform Crime Reports data compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the nation\u2019s overall crime rate was about 2,000 crimes per 100,000 residents in the early 1960s compared with 5,374 crimes per 100,000 residents in 1994.", "Against the backdrop of these higher crime rates, there is a continuing debate over the use of incarceration as a means of addressing increasing crime. Both proponents and opponents of increasing the use of incarceration as a solution to the crime problem can cite research to support their positions. For example, proponents of increased incarceration assert that investing in new prisons will have long-term benefits of crime reduction. On the other hand, critics of increased incarceration argue that continued prison-building is wasteful and unaffordable and is unlikely to affect crime rates.", "In 1994, RAND issued a study of California\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, which mandates sentences ranging from 25 years to life for certain three-time felony offenders. The study, which weighed crime reduction and cost, concluded that the California law, if fully implemented, will reduce serious felonies committed by adults in the state by between 22 and 34 percent below what may have occurred. The study also concluded that the reduction in crime would be achieved at an additional cost of between $4.5 billion and $6.5 billion in current dollars annually. According to the study, most of the cost increase would result from the need to build and operate additional prisons to house the inmate population, which could be expected to double as a result of sentencing under the law. A more recent RAND study indicates that some preventative measures, such as parent training and graduation incentives, could potentially reduce crime rates more cost effectively than incarceration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trends in Federal and State Prison Inmate Populations and Costs", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state prison inmate populations have been growing since 1980, reaching about 1.1 million inmates in 1995.

For example, according to BJS, during the 1980s, an increasing number of probation and parole violators returned to prison, while in the 1990s, declining rates of release have sustained the growth in inmate populations.", "More specifically, regarding federal offenders, under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, parole was abolished, and good-time credits (time off sentence for good behavior) were limited to 54 days per year. In 1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act established mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses. In 1988 and 1990, Congress passed additional sentencing legislation, which increased mandatory minimum sentences for drug and weapons offenses. As a result of these statutory changes, the use of probation has been reduced and the length of prison stays has increased. According to BJS data, after 1986, the average time served in federal prisons increased from 15 months to 24 months. For violent offenses, the time served increased from 50 months to 56 months, and the time served for drug offenses increased from 22 months to 33 months.", "Particularly noteworthy has been the trend regarding drug offenders as a percentage of the total inmate population. According to a 1991 study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, drug offenders constituted about 91 percent of all federal defendants sentenced under mandatory minimum provisions. According to BJS, in 1993, which was the latest year that complete data were available, drug offenders constituted 26 percent of all federal and state inmates, whereas these offenders constituted 8 percent of all inmates in 1980. Also, BJS has reported that the increase in drug offenders accounts for nearly three-fourths of the total growth in federal prison inmates since 1980.", "The state prison inmate populations have grown as a result of, among other things, the increased number of arrests, higher probabilities of incarceration, and more severe sanctions. Specifically, according to BJS, the number of arrests increased by 41 percent between 1980 and 1993, the latest year that complete data were available. The rate of sending offenders to prison also increased. For example, the likelihood of incarceration increased 5-fold for drug violations and 4-fold for weapons offenses. According to the California Department of Corrections, the prison population in that state has grown because of court decisions, voter initiatives, and legislation, all of which have resulted in stronger law enforcement and more severe criminal sanctions. For example, a California law prohibits the use of good-time allowances to reduce the sentences of repeat offenders convicted of certain violent felonies. State corrections officials expected that the law may result in inmates\u2019 serving additional time, which could lead to an increase in the state\u2019s prison population in future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prison Population Projections for 2000", "paragraphs": ["While sources differed somewhat in their projected growth for federal and state prison inmate populations, they all showed substantial anticipated increases for these populations in 2000 and beyond.

NCCD also projected that, if all states were to adopt truth-in-sentencing statutes, which would require inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, the states\u2019 prison population could grow by an additional 190,000 inmates and total about 1.6 million inmates by 2000, which would be an increase of about 42 percent over the 1995 level.", "The April 1996 issue of the Corrections Compendium presented a compilation of inmate population projections that were based on a survey of federal and state corrections agencies.

However, the survey summary in the Compendium indicated that this total may be understated. According to the summary, if the historical growth rate (8.7 percent per year from 1980 through 1994) continues in future years, the prison population could actually increase by 95 percent over the 1994 level, essentially doubling to about 2 million inmates by 2002.", "In July 1995, NCCD projected that the inmate population in California could reach about 210,000 by 2000, which would be an increase of 55 percent over the 1995 level.
