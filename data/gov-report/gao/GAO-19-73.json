This report evaluates (1) how accurately and completely RPAD reflects DOD's real property assets, (2) DOD's processes to ensure accuracy and completeness in recording and reporting real property data, and (3) DOD's actions to ensure it has addressed risks that may affect the use of real property information for managing its assets. GAO analyzed the RPAD and military services' data for fiscal years 2014-2016; reviewed documentation; conducted site visits; and interviewed DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Department of Defense's (DOD) Real Property Assets Database (RPAD) contained inaccurate data and lacked completeness, although certain data that GAO reviewed had improved their accuracy since fiscal year 2014. RPAD is a department-wide database of real property data annually compiled by the Office of the Secretary of Defense from the inventories of the military services and DOD's Washington Headquarters Services, which manages real property in the National Capital region. DOD uses RPAD to report on DOD's real property to Congress and other federal agencies, such as the Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration to assist in managing federal real property.", "DOD has weaknesses in its processes for recording and reporting real property data that have led to inaccurate and incomplete information. GAO and others found military services have not consistently recorded real property transactions (i.e., acquisition of, change to, and disposal of a real property asset) and physical inventories of assets. GAO also found that the military services have not corrected identified discrepancies in their data systems, such as missing entries for utilization and facility condition and overdue asset reviews. GAO reviewed records of 120 facilities with identified discrepancies in fiscal year 2015 RPAD data and compared them to the records in the respective data system in 2017 and found that 61 discrepancies remained. The military services had corrected the data in the remaining 59 reviewed facilities in their data systems. DOD's efforts to prepare for an upcoming financial audit have helped identify issues and improve accuracy of some data. However, if DOD does not require the military services to fully monitor recording processes and implement corrective actions to resolve data discrepancies, the department will continue to have incomplete and inaccurate real property data and unreliable RPAD information.", "DOD has not addressed three risks that can adversely affect its ability to use its information to manage its real property. Specifically, DOD (1) has unfilled real property positions limiting its capacity to manage its data, (2) lacks a department-wide approach to improving its data quality, and (3) has not identified how it will complete implementation of an effort to improve access to data. These risks exist, in part, because DOD has not developed a strategy that identifies and addresses risks with accompanying time frames and performance metrics. If DOD does not develop a strategy that identifies and addresses risks to data quality and information accessibility, DOD may miss the opportunity to reasonably ensure that the information needed for effective decision making by DOD, Congress, and other federal agencies is available to meet real property accountability and reporting objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to improve DOD's real property data, including fully monitoring recording processes; developing and implementing corrective actions for identified data discrepancies; and developing a strategy to address risks associated with data quality and information accessibility. DOD concurred or partially concurred with all draft recommendations. In response, GAO agreed to combine two recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) manages a portfolio of real property  assets that reportedly included about 568,000 facilities with a combined  plant replacement value of about $1 trillion and nearly 27.2 million acres  of land in fiscal year 2016. In January 2018, the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) testified that reform efforts within DOD, such as  those occurring in real property management, were dependent upon  accurate data and that not having accurate data complicates those  efforts. Each of the military services and DOD\u2019s Washington  Headquarters Services (WHS) maintains its own data systems that  include information about each of the real property assets. The information collected and maintained in these systems includes whether  an asset is owned or leased, its size, and for certain types, the asset\u2019s  value, percentage of space utilized, and condition, among other  characteristics.", "DOD annually compiles this information into a consolidated database,  called the Real Property Assets Database (RPAD), which represents the  data at the end of the fiscal year. DOD uses RPAD to report to the  General Services Administration\u2019s Federal Real Property Profile  Management System, which is a database of real property under the  custody and control of executive branch agencies. The military services  and WHS are to collect and maintain information on each of their real  property assets to report in annual financial statements. Furthermore, the  military services and WHS must manage their portfolios of real property  assets in part to identify their needs for sustainment, restoration, and  modernization of their facilities.", "For more than 20 years, we have identified opportunities for DOD to  improve the quality of the information that it collects on its real property to  better inform decision making about these assets. For example, in 1997,  we added DOD\u2019s defense support infrastructure to our list of high-risk  areas in the federal government\u2014due in part to long standing challenges  it faces in managing its infrastructure\u2014to include the need to improve the  quality of its information in its inventory data systems. In our most recent  High Risk Update in February 2017, we reported that DOD had shown  some improvement in the accuracy and completeness of real property  data, but needed to fully implement its planned actions to help the  department assess its goals and efforts, among other things. Further, we  identified the collection of reliable real property data to support decision  making as a long-standing challenge that federal agencies, including  DOD, continue to face.", "Further, our prior work on DOD\u2019s real property information on RPAD  reported accuracy and completeness issues with the data compiled from  the military services\u2019 data systems. DOD has begun to implement actions  in response to our recommendations but has not fully completed the  corrective actions. For example, in June 2016 we reported that the  military services had not yet fully implemented a department-wide  process to standardize facility condition assessments and rates. The  Navy and the Air Force have since adopted a standardized process, and  Army installation management officials stated they sought funding  through 2021 to implement the standardized process at all Army  installations. In addition, in September 2011, we reported that DOD\u2019s  RPAD for fiscal year 2010 reported data on the percentage of space  utilized for fewer than half of DOD\u2019s total inventory of facilities, and that  much of the data were outdated and did not reflect the true usage of the  structures. Since then, DOD provided guidance for measuring,  maintaining, and reporting utilization consistently throughout DOD, as we  recommended. As the guidance is implemented, DOD will fully address  our recommendation and officials expect improvement in the accuracy  and completeness of utilization data.", "In May 2017, the House Armed Services Committee, Subcommittee on  Readiness, requested that we evaluate the progress that the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military services have made toward  maintaining complete and accurate inventories of their real property  assets and toward using real property inventory data to make sound  decisions regarding defense support infrastructure management. For this  report, we evaluated the extent to which (1) RPAD accurately and  completely reflects DOD\u2019s real property assets; (2) DOD has processes to  help ensure the accuracy and completeness in recording and reporting  real property data; and (3) DOD has addressed the risks that may affect  use of real property information for managing its assets.", "For all objectives, we reviewed DOD\u2019s policies, procedures, and other  documents related to real property management and accountability. We  also conducted site visits to 12 installations (3 from each military  service). We selected the non-generalizable sample of installations  based on criteria that considered (1) four U.S. geographic regions, (2)  geographic distance between each installation, and (3) variation in the  range of tests of the fiscal year 2015 RPAD data in a number of data  elements for entries that did not comply with DOD\u2019s requirements for  inventory information. In this report, we use discrepancies to refer to data  entries that do not comply with DOD\u2019s requirements for inventory  information as well as entries in two or more data sets that should match  but do not. During these visits, we interviewed real property officials at  each location and obtained documentary and testimonial evidence related  to differences in existing and inventoried real property and processes to  ensure accuracy and completeness in real property data. We also  observed and collected data on specific facilities to compare to  information recorded in the data system of the military services and  RPAD. We selected a non-generalizable sample of 120 facilities (10 at  each site) for current record review in the military services\u2019 data systems.  The selections were based on variation of discrepancies among five data  elements within RPAD and variation in facility type (building, structure,  and linear structure). We also observed some of these facilities to  compare to the information that was recorded in the data systems. These data only represent the facilities selected and are not representative of all  facilities at all installations. We also interviewed officials from the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and  Environment, Washington Headquarters Services, the Air Force, the  Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps.", "For objective one, we obtained end-of-year data sets of real property  information from three sources: (1) OSD\u2019s compiled RPAD, (2)  submissions to OSD from the military services and WHS, and (3) military  services\u2019 inventories, which we refer to as the three types of data sets.  We obtained the most recently available full year data for 3 years\u2014fiscal  years 2014 through 2016. We used RPAD data to conduct tests related  to accuracy among five data elements for facilities for fiscal years 2014  through 2016 to identify the extent to which entries comply with DOD\u2019s  inventory requirements, such as entries that were missing, out of range,  or overdue, and compared each year\u2019s results to identify changes in the  magnitude of those discrepancies. We selected these five data  elements because they are among the most frequently used by decision  makers. These tests of compliance with the inventory requirements  identify a number of discrepancies that may exist in the five data  elements. Because our tests were limited to five data elements, our  results are not generalizable. Additional testing would be necessary to  determine the full extent that discrepancies and other inaccuracies exist  in all of the data elements.", "Next, we assessed documentary evidence and obtained testimonial  statements about completeness issues with RPAD and we compared the  number of facilities and their reported total plant replacement value in  each of the three data sets for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 to describe  any differences between the data sets that should have been identical.", "We assessed the reliability of the data from the three types of data sets  through interviews, review of related documentation, and data testing,  and found those data sufficiently reliable to describe issues related to the  accuracy and completeness of the RPAD.", "For objective two, we reviewed relevant DOD documents and conducted  interviews with officials at OSD, WHS, and the military services to obtain  information and identify any challenges that DOD had identified with the  processes. We also obtained documentary evidence related to inventory  testing, data monitoring through testing, and reporting of real property  since fiscal year 2014. We compared this testimonial and documentary  evidence to DOD and military services\u2019 policies and procedures and  federal internal control standards.", "For our third objective, we evaluated actions taken by DOD to enhance  how it uses real property data since fiscal year 2014 and to identify any  risks that may affect how DOD can use this information. We reviewed  documentation including OSD and military service actions to improve data  quality, workforce plans for real property, and data requests from various  users across the department. This included reviewing documents related  to OSD\u2019s planned expansion of a business information platform to include  required real property inventory information. Additionally, we conducted  interviews with officials from OSD to determine what actions they have  taken to enhance how they use department-wide information on real  property and risks to the department\u2019s ability to use real property data.  We interviewed military service officials at installation management  offices and real property offices during our site visits at 12 installations to  identify specific actions they have taken to help ensure they can use real  property information and any risks related to using that information. We  assessed the information collected in documentation and interviews  against guidance on risk management from DOD and the Office of  Management and Budget.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to November 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
