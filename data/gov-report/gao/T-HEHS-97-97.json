In fiscal year 1996, VA\u2019s approximately 222,000 workers\u2014nearly 1 for every 120 veterans\u2014delivered a wide array of medical, disability compensation, pension, housing, insurance, education, and burial services in more than 1,000 facilities at a cost of over $38.1 billion.", "Two years ago, we testified before this Subcommittee that VA was at a crossroad in the evolution of its health care system. The average daily workload in its hospitals had dropped almost 56 percent during the preceding 25 years, and further declines appeared likely. At the same time, demand for outpatient care, nursing home care, and certain specialized services was expanding, taxing VA\u2019s ability to meet veterans\u2019 needs in those areas. We noted at that time that decisions made over the next few years about VA\u2019s role in health care would have significant implications for veterans, taxpayers, and private health care providers.", "Today, I would like to discuss some of actions taken to increase the efficiency of the VA health care system and VA\u2019s progress in addressing the challenges discussed 2 years ago. In addition, I will discuss challenges facing the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) in administering compensation and pension benefits,", "VA\u2019s efforts to implement the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and other recent legislation designed to improve the management of government programs, and changes that could be made in veterans\u2019 benefits and in the operation of VA programs to help reduce the budget deficit.", "My comments are based primarily on the results of reviews conducted during the past several years by this and other divisions of the General Accounting Office.", "Subcommittee. VA\u2019s new management and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) structure clearly values efficiency and customer service. In addition, legislation was enacted (1) expanding eligibility for VA health care (P.L. 104-262), (2) making it easier for VA to contract for and sell services to the private sector (P.L. 104-262), and (3) requiring VA to develop a plan for more equitably allocating resources to its VISNs (P.L. 104-204). These decisions bring with them both solutions to old problems and significant new challenges, such as developing an enrollment process consistent with the priorities established under the eligibility reform legislation and determining when to buy services from the private sector rather than provide them in VA facilities.", "VBA also faces multiple challenges. For example, the disability rating schedule has not been updated for over 45 years, meaning that ratings may no longer accurately reflect the loss in earning capacity resulting from service-connected disabilities;", "VA faces the prospect of late or inaccurate compensation and pension payments to millions of veterans if it is unable to resolve the \u201cyear 2000\u201d computer problem; veterans often wait over 2 years for resolution of compensation and pension claims by the time the appeals process has been completed; and", "VA could avoid millions of dollars in overpayments of compensation and pension benefits by strengthening its ability to prevent such payments.", "Recent legislation, including GPRA, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act, provides a basis for addressing long-standing management challenges. VA has begun to use the legislation to improve its mission performance and results, its financial reporting, and its information resources management. For example, it included strategic plans for its health and benefits programs in its fiscal year 1998 budget submission. VA has been preparing audited financial statements since 1986, well in advance of the requirements imposed by the CFO Act.", "Finally, multiple options exist for supporting deficit reduction through changes in VA benefits and programs. Although some of the changes could be achieved through administrative action, others would require legislation. The options include (1) redefining compensation benefits to eliminate compensation for diseases that are not related to military service, (2) imposing higher cost sharing for nursing home and other long-term care services, (3) limiting enrollment in the VA health care system, and (4) closing underused hospitals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States has a long tradition of providing benefits to those injured in military service, but the role of the federal government in providing for the health care needs of other veterans has evolved and expanded over time.", "In the nation\u2019s early years, the federal role was limited to direct financial payments to veterans injured during combat; direct medical and hospital care was provided by the individual colonies, states, and communities. The Continental Congress, seeking to encourage enlistments during the Revolutionary War, provided federal compensation for veterans injured during the war and their dependents. Similarly, the first U.S. Congress passed a veterans\u2019 compensation law.", "The federal role in veterans\u2019 health care significantly expanded during and following the Civil War. During the war, the government operated temporary hospitals and domiciliaries in various parts of the country for disabled soldiers until they were physically able to return to their homes. Following the war, the number of disabled veterans unable to cope with the economic struggle of civilian life became so great that the government built a number of \u201chomes\u201d to provide domiciliary care. Incidental medical and hospital care was provided to residents for all diseases and injuries.", "The modern era of veterans\u2019 benefits began with the onset of World War I. During World War I, a series of new veterans\u2019 benefits was added: voluntary life insurance, allotments to take care of the family during military service, reeducation of those disabled, disability compensation, and medical and hospital care for those suffering from wounds or diseases incurred in the service.", "During World War I, Public Health Service (PHS) hospitals treated returning veterans, and, at the end of the war, several military hospitals were transferred to PHS to enable it to continue serving the growing veteran population. In 1921, those PHS hospitals primarily serving veterans were transferred to the then newly formed Veterans\u2019 Bureau.", "During the 1920s, three federal agencies\u2014the Veterans\u2019 Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions in the Interior Department, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers\u2014administered various benefits for veterans. With the establishment of the Veterans Administration in 1930, previously fragmented services for veterans were consolidated under one agency.", "The responsibilities and programs of the Veterans Administration grew significantly during the ensuing decades. For example, the VA health care system grew from 54 hospitals in 1930 to include 173 hospitals, more than 375 outpatient clinics, 130 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries in 1996; the World War II GI Bill is said to have affected the American way of life more than any other law since the Homestead Act almost a century before, and further educational assistance acts were passed for the benefit of veterans of the Korean conflict, the Vietnam era, the Persian Gulf War, and the current all-volunteer force; and in 1973, the Veterans Administration assumed responsibility for the National Cemetery System, and VA is now charged with the operation of all national cemeteries, except for Arlington National Cemetery.", "In 1989, the Department of Veterans Affairs was established as a cabinet-level agency. VA\u2019s major benefits programs are divided among the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), headed by the Under Secretary for Health; the Veterans Benefits Administration, headed by the Under Secretary for Benefits, which administers compensation for service-connected disabilities, pensions for low-income war veterans, education loans, life insurance, and home loans; and the National Cemetery System, headed by a Director.", "Figure 1 shows the organizational structure of VA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Made Significant Progress in Improving the Efficiency of Its Health Care System", "paragraphs": ["In our testimony 2 years ago, we pointed out that VA lagged far behind the private sector in improving the efficiency of its health care system. Specifically, we said that the VA system lacked oversight procedures to effectively assess the operations of its medical systems to shift significant resources among medical centers to provide consistent access to VA care, information systems capable of effectively coordinating patient care among VA facilities, and a corporate culture that valued economy and efficiency.", "VA has made significant progress in improving the efficiency of its health care system. For example, it has consolidated management of nearby hospitals to reduce administrative costs, increased the use of ambulatory surgery, and reduced average lengths of stay. Under the leadership of the Under Secretary for Health, VA has a new emphasis on both economy and efficiency and customer service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance Measures Developed to Hold Managers Accountable", "paragraphs": ["Two years ago, we told you that VA\u2019s central office lacked much of the systemwide information it needed to effectively (1) monitor the performance of its medical centers, (2) ensure that corrective actions are taken when problems are identified, and (3) identify and disseminate information on innovative programs. Since then, VA has established a new decentralized management structure and established performance measures to hold managers accountable for improving efficiency and ensuring the quality of services.", "VA reorganized its health care facilities into 22 VISNs. This reorganization contains several elements that hold promise for providing the management framework needed to realize the system\u2019s full potential for efficiency improvements. First, VA plans to hold network directors accountable for VISNs\u2019 performance by using, among other things, cost-effectiveness goals and measures that establish accountability for operating efficiently to contain or reduce costs. Second, the Under Secretary for Health (1) distributed criteria that could guide VISN directors in developing the types of efficiency initiatives capable of yielding large savings and (2) gave VISN and facility directors authority to realign medical centers to achieve efficiencies. Finally, VHA developed a new method for allocating funds to its VISNs with the intent of creating additional incentives to improve efficiency.", "Consistent with the requirements of GPRA, VHA established five basic goals for its health care system. These goals are to provide excellence in health care value, provide excellence in service as defined by customers, provide excellence in education and research, be an organization that is characterized by exceptional accountability, and be an employer of choice.", "Under each goal, VHA established objectives and performance measures for gauging progress toward meeting both the specific objectives and overall program goals. For example, VHA\u2019s performance measures include goals to decrease the number of bed-days of care provided per 1,000 unique users by 20 percent from the 1996 level, increase the percentage of patients reporting their care as \u201cvery good to excellent\u201d by 5 percent annually, enroll 80 percent of patients in primary care, and increase the number of medical care residents trained in primary care.", "Contracts with individual VISN directors reflect these goals and performance measures. In addition, each VISN has developed a business/strategic plan. The plans are generally organized around the five broad goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Plans to Implement a New Method for Allocating Resources", "paragraphs": ["Two years ago, we testified that VA could reduce inconsistencies in veterans\u2019 access to care by better matching medical centers\u2019 resources to the volume and demographic makeup of eligible veterans requesting services at each medical center. Although VA had developed a new resource allocation system, the Resource Planning and Management (RPM) system, we pointed out that the system had shifted few resources among medical centers and allocated resources on the basis of prior workload without any consideration of the incomes or service-connected status of veterans who make up that workload.", "VA plans to begin shifting resources among VISNs using the new system. The system is based on calculations of the cost per veteran-user in each VISN. VISNs that have the highest costs per veteran-user will lose funds, while VISNs with the lowest costs per veteran-user will get additional funds. Adjustments are included for the higher labor costs in some VISNs and for differences in the costs of medical education, research, equipment, and nonrecurring maintenance.", "We applaud VA\u2019s efforts to develop a simple, straightforward method for allocating resources. However, we have the same basic concern about VERA that we had about RPM. That is, VA has not determined the \u201cright\u201d amount of dollars that need to be shifted to ensure equity of access. Our concern is based on the fact that VA has not adequately determined the reasons for differences between VISNs in costs per veteran-user. Without a better understanding of why the costs vary, VA cannot, with any certainty, determine the appropriate amount of resources to shift among VISNs.", "VA data can give starkly different pictures of the comparability of veterans\u2019 access to VA care depending on the basis used for the comparison. For example, basing a comparison of equity of access on the percentage of the total veteran population in a VISN that is provided VA services would suggest that veterans in the Sunbelt generally have better access to VA care than do veterans from the Midwest and Northeast. Over 17 percent of veterans in VISN 18 (Phoenix) received VA services in fiscal year 1995, compared with about 8 percent of veterans in VISN 4 (Pittsburgh). Similarly, about 14 percent of veterans in VISN 9 (Nashville) received VA health care services in fiscal year 1995, compared with about 8 percent of those in VISN 11 (Ann Arbor). Such data could suggest the need to shift resources from VISNs where VA has a high market share of the veteran population to VISNs where VA has lower market shares. attempting to develop data on the demographics of the veteran population by VISN to better understand the basis for differing market shares.", "Other VA data suggest that VISNs in the Northeast and Midwest may receive more than their fair share of VA resources. For example, VISN 18 received $3,197 per veteran served in fiscal year 1996, compared with $4,829 per veteran served in VISN 4. Similarly, VISN 9 received $4,071, compared with $4,360 in VISN 11.", "Both VERA data and data from prior allocation models suggest that differences in efficiency are a major factor in the variation in spending per veteran-user. Veteran-users in VISN 3 (the Bronx) are hospitalized over three times as often as are veterans in VISN 18. In addition, VA found that VISNs that have higher costs per veteran-user also tend to have more doctors and nurses per patient, and provide more bed-days of care per patient than the VISNs with lower costs per veteran-user. sector providers rather than rely on VA for comprehensive care. For example, we found that only about half of the Medicare-eligible veterans using VA health care relied on VA for all of their care. As a result, VISNs serving higher percentages of Medicare-eligible and privately insured veterans could expect to have lower costs per veteran.", "Finally, differences in the extent of incidental use of VA services could affect cost per veteran-user. Incidental use could artificially decrease the VISN\u2019s average cost of care for veterans who regularly use VA and overstate the VISN market share of the veteran population.", "VA also has not developed data showing that the VISNs with lower than average expenditures per veteran-user need additional funds. In other words, it has not determined how much an efficient and well-managed VISN should be spending on each veteran-user. VISNs\u2019 draft business/strategic plans generally discuss how they will use the additional funds. Those plans have not, however, been reviewed and approved by central office.", "Some VISN plans indicate that the additional funds will be used to reduce waiting times or increase the number of staff per patient. Others, however, indicate that the funds will be used to attract additional users. Giving additional funds to a VISN with no strings attached appears to enable VISNs with the largest market shares of the veteran population to further expand their market share. This does not appear to be consistent with the efficient use of resources that was one of the objectives of Public Law 104-204. increases in waiting times, and changes in customer satisfaction.", "One way to develop a resource allocation system that would be consistent with the provisions of Public Law 104-204, easy to administer, and less subject to gaming would be to base the allocation on the veteran population in each VISN, with adjustments based on the numbers of veterans in each of the priority categories for enrollment in the VA health care system. To lessen the incentive for VISNs to target enrollment toward younger, healthier veterans with private insurance, separate rates could be established for various categories of veterans, on the basis of VA\u2019s historical cost and utilization data. We are currently developing data to more fully explore this option.", "VA recognizes that VERA is not a perfect system and is continuing to explore options for improving its resource allocation methods. For example, VA, like GAO, is developing data to more fully explore the potential effects of population-based allocations. It plans, however, to go forward with allocations using VERA through fiscal year 1998 in order to provide needed financial incentives for certain VISNs to focus on efficiency improvements. Otherwise, allocations tied to historic budgets might delay needed efficiency improvements until another allocation method could be developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Continues to Implement Its Decision Support System but Concerns Continue", "paragraphs": ["Without accurate and complete cost and utilization data, VA managers cannot effectively decide when to contract for services rather than provide them directly, how to set prices for services it sells to other providers, or how to bill insurers for care provided to privately insured veterans. Accurate utilization data are also essential to help ensure quality and to prevent abuse.", "Since February 1994, VA has been phasing in at its facilities a new Decision Support System (DSS) that uses commercially available software to help provide managers data on patterns of care and patient outcomes as well as their resource and cost implications. While DSS has the potential to significantly improve VA\u2019s ability to manage its health care operations, the ultimate usefulness of the system will depend not on the software but on the completeness and accuracy of the data going into the system. If DSS is not able to provide reliable information, VA facilities and VISNs will either continue to make decisions on the basis of unreliable information or spend valuable time and resources developing their own data systems.", "Two years ago, we recommended that VA identify data that are needed to support decision-making and ensure that these data are complete, accurate, consistent, and reconciled monthly. VA plans to begin implementing DSS at the final group of VA facilities this month. VA still, however, has not adequately focused on improving the completeness and reliability of data entered into the feeder systems. It has, however, started to reconcile DSS data on a monthly basis.", "Although the draft business/strategic plans developed by the 22 VISNs generally discuss goals and timetables for implementing DSS throughout the network, they identify no plans for improving the completeness and accuracy of the data feeding into DSS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The VA Health Care System Continues to Face Major Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In our testimony 2 years ago, we focused on four major challenges facing VA because of a rapidly changing health care marketplace. Specifically, VA was faced with unequal access to health care services because of complex VA eligibility requirements, limited outpatient facilities, and uneven distribution of resources; a continuing decline in the number of hospital patients that threatened the economic viability of its hospitals; unmet needs, including the acute care needs of uninsured veterans not living close to a VA hospital, and the needs of special care populations such as those who are blind, paralyzed, or suffering from post traumatic stress disorder; and the growing long-term care needs of an aging veteran population.", "Significant progress has been made in addressing the first challenge\u2014improving veterans\u2019 access to VA outpatient care. The remaining challenges, however, remain largely unchanged. In fact, VA\u2019s progress in improving the efficiency of its hospitals has accelerated the decline in hospital workload, heightening the need to address the future of VA hospitals. In addition, VA\u2019s plans to attract new users focus primarily on attracting insured and higher-income veterans with other health care options rather than on addressing the unmet needs of veterans with service-connected conditions and low-income veterans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress Has Been Made in Improving Access to Outpatient Care", "paragraphs": ["The first major challenge facing VA health care 2 years ago was the uneven access to health care caused by complex VA eligibility requirements, limited outpatient facilities, and uneven distribution of resources.

All veterans are now eligible for comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care subject to the availability of resources.", "VA established community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC) to improve veterans\u2019 access to outpatient care. Until 1995, VA required its hospitals to meet rigid criteria to establish outpatient clinics apart from the hospitals. These criteria included a minimum number of veterans to be served in a clinic and a minimum distance that clinics had to be from the VA hospitals. In encouraging its hospitals to consider establishing CBOCs, previously known as \u201caccess points,\u201d VA eliminated many of its restrictions concerning the workload and location of proposed clinics. In addition, VA policy now encourages hospitals to provide care not only in VA-operated facilities, but also by contracting with other providers. Although only 12 CBOCs were operational by September 1996, plans had been developed to establish hundreds of additional clinics.", "VA\u2019s contracting authority was revised to make it easier for VA to buy services from private providers and to sell services to the private sector. Previously, VA\u2019s authority was restricted primarily to purchasing services from and selling services to other government health care facilities and VA\u2019s medical school affiliates. Using its expanded contracting authority, VA is moving quickly to establish additional CBOCs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efficiency Improvements Accelerate Decline in Hospital Use", "paragraphs": ["The second major challenge facing VA health care 2 years ago was the declining use of VA hospitals. Between 1969 and 1994, the average daily workload in VA hospitals declined by about 56 percent. VA reduced its operating beds by about 50 percent, closing or converting to other uses about 50,000 hospital beds.", "VA now finds itself increasingly a victim of its own success and faced with what to do with so much unused inpatient infrastructure. As VA\u2019s efforts to increase the efficiency of its health care system gained momentum during the past 2 years, the decline in VA hospital use accelerated. Between fiscal years 1994 and 1996, the average daily workload in VA hospitals dropped over 20 percent (from 39,953 patients in 1994 to 31,679 in 1996). Operating beds dropped from 53,093 in 1994 to 45,798 in 1996.", "Hospital use in the VA system varies dramatically. Last year, we reported that the Northern California Health Care System, a part of VISN 21, was supporting the hospital care needs of its users with about 2 beds per 1,000 users. Some VISNs, however, have over 20 hospital beds per 1,000 veteran-users. As a result, further significant declines in operating beds are likely as the variation in hospital use is reduced. For example, VISN 5 (Baltimore) estimates that its acute hospital beds will have decreased by 58 percent by fiscal year 2002 (from 1,087 in fiscal year 1995 to 460 in 2002).", "Recent VA actions to establish preadmission reviews for all scheduled hospital admissions and continuing stay reviews for those admitted\u2014actions we have advocated for over 10 years\u2014should further reduce hospital use. VA may not realize the full potential from these reviews, however, unless physicians\u2019 incentives to minimize inappropriate inpatient care are increased. VISN 5 (Baltimore), for example, uses its reviews primarily for data collection, evaluation, and monitoring. The program does not act as a gatekeeper, and inpatient care is not denied on the basis of results of the preadmission reviews. Reviews at the VISN 5 hospitals in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C., show that over 50 percent of patients admitted since the program was initiated did not need acute hospital care.", "As workload continues to decline at VA hospitals, VA\u2019s investment in its hospital infrastructure increasingly detracts from its ability to shift resources to other needs, such as expanding access for veterans living long distances from VA facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Veterans More Likely to Have Unmet Needs for Specialized Care Services Than Acute Care Services", "paragraphs": ["The third major challenge that faced VA health care 2 years ago was identifying and addressing the unmet health care needs of veterans. With the growth of public and private health benefits programs, more than 9 out of 10 veterans now have alternate health insurance coverage. Still, about 2.6 million veterans had neither public nor private health insurance in 1990 to help pay for needed health care services. Without a demonstrated ability to pay for care, individuals\u2019 access to health care is restricted, increasing their vulnerability to the consequences of poor health. Lacking insurance, people often postpone obtaining care until their conditions become more serious and require more costly medical services.", "Most veterans who lack insurance coverage, however, are able to obtain needed hospital care through public programs and VA. Still, VA\u2019s 1992 National Survey of Veterans estimated that about 159,000 veterans were unable to get needed hospital care in 1992 and about 288,000 were unable to obtain needed outpatient services. By far the most common reason veterans cited for not obtaining needed care was that they could not afford to pay for it.", "While the cost of care may have prevented veterans from obtaining care from private sector hospitals, it appears to be an unlikely reason for not seeking care from VA. All veterans are currently eligible for hospital care, and about 9 to 11 million are eligible for free care. Other veterans are required to make only nominal copayments.", "Many of the problems veterans face in obtaining health care services appear to relate to distance from a VA facility. For example, our analysis of 1992 National Survey of Veterans data estimates that fewer than half of the 159,000 veterans who did not obtain needed hospital care lived within 25 miles of a VA hospital. By comparison, we estimate that over 90 percent lived within 25 miles of a private sector hospital.", "Of the estimated 288,000 veterans unable to obtain needed outpatient care during 1992, almost 70 percent lived within 5 miles of a non-VA doctor\u2019s office or outpatient facility. As was the case with veterans unable to obtain needed hospital care, those unable to obtain needed outpatient care generally indicated that they could not afford to obtain needed care from private providers. Only 13 percent of the veterans unable to obtain needed outpatient services reported that they lived within 5 miles of a VA facility, where they could generally have received free care.", "Veterans\u2019 needs for specialized services cannot always be met through other public or private sector programs. Frequently, such services are either unavailable in the private sector, or are not extensively covered under other public and private insurance. Space and resource limits in VA specialized treatment programs can result in unmet needs, as in the following cases.", "Specialized VA post-traumatic stress disorder programs are operating at or beyond capacity, and waiting lists exist, particularly for inpatient treatment. Although private insurance generally includes mental health benefits, private sector providers generally lack the expertise in treating war-related stress that exists in the VA system. Inadequate numbers of beds are available in the VA system to care for homeless veterans. For example, VA had only 11 beds available in the San Francisco area to meet the needs of an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 homeless veterans.", "Public and private insurance do not provide extensive coverage of long-term psychiatric care. Veterans needing such services must either rely on state programs or the VA system to meet their needs.", "VA is a national leader both in research on and treatment and rehabilitation of people with spinal cord injuries. Similarly, it is a leader in programs to treat and rehabilitate the blind. Although such services are available in the private sector, the costs of such services can be catastrophic.", "Legislation enacted last year that expanded VA\u2019s ability to contract with private sector facilities and providers gives VA an opportunity to better meet the health care needs of low-income veterans and those with service-connected conditions who previously were unable to obtain needed care because VA facilities were geographically inaccessible.", "Two years ago, we suggested that the VA health care system retarget resources used to provide care for higher-income veterans with nonservice-connected conditions toward lower-income veterans and those with service-connected conditions whose health care needs were not being met. VA, however, through its current legislative proposals, appears to be focusing its marketing efforts on attracting higher-income veterans with other health care options rather than using its expanded contracting authority to target its available resources toward meeting the needs of service-connected and uninsured veterans who lack other health care options.", "Data from VA\u2019s Income Eligibility Verification System show that about 15 percent of the veterans using VA facilities who have no service-connected disabilities have incomes of $20,000 or more. VA could use the resources spent to provide services to such higher-income nonservice-connected veterans to strengthen its ability to fulfill its safety net mission. For example, the resources could be used to expand outreach to medically underserved populations, such as homeless expand programs that address special care needs; or contract for hospital and other service for lower-income, uninsured veterans who do not live near VA facilities.", "Our review of the draft strategic plans developed by the 22 VISNs, however, found little mention of plans to conduct outreach to veterans with limited health care options or special care needs. Nor did these plans specifically address expanding services for low-income uninsured veterans.", "The establishment of additional community-based outpatient clinics will address the unmet needs of some uninsured veterans. Most of the resources spent on CBOCs, however, will likely be spent on veterans who have other health care options. This reduces the resources available to provide services to uninsured veterans.", "The legislative proposals contained in VA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget request would target veterans with other health care options. VA claims that it will be able to cut its per-user costs by 30 percent only if it is given funds to expand the number of veterans it serves by 20 percent and allowed to keep all of the funds it recovers from private health insurance and Medicare. The new users VA anticipates attracting either have private health insurance or are higher-income Medicare beneficiaries.
