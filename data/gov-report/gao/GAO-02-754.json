Blood suppliers received a high volume of blood donations immediately after the September 11 attacks.

The nation's blood supply can compensate for donors lost because of new donor restrictions designed to further reduce the risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease transmission.

Every year, about 8 million individuals donate roughly 14 million pints of  blood, and approximately 4.5 million patients receive life-saving blood  transfusions, according to the American Association of Blood Banks  (AABB). Efforts to understand supply and demand trends have coincided  with renewed debate about ensuring the safety and availability of blood.   Such concerns are evidenced in new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  guidance for organizations that collect, process, and distribute blood,  which is aimed at reducing the possible risk of transmitting variant  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form of bovine spongiform  encephalopathy (BSE), or \u201cmad cow\u201d disease, through transfusion.  These  \u201cdonor deferrals,\u201d or exclusions, prevent individuals from giving blood if  they have traveled extensively in the United Kingdom or Europe, thereby  reducing the supply of donors.  Adding to safety and availability concerns is  the sharp rise in the cost of blood in recent years, partly the result of new  measures for testing and processing donated blood to identify viruses and  reduce adverse transfusion reactions.  These issues, coupled with a  historically sporadic monitoring of the blood supply, have led to questions  about U.S. blood suppliers\u2019 ability to respond to emergencies.", "You asked us to address the following objectives regarding the availability  and safety of the U.S. blood supply:  determine the adequacy of the current blood supply and describe recent  trends in supply and demand,   describe blood suppliers\u2019 response to the September 11 terrorist attacks  and their planning for future emergencies,   evaluate the potential impact of the new vCJD donor restrictions on the  U.S. blood supply, and   describe recent changes in the price of blood.", "To address these objectives, we measured supply and demand trends  before and after September 11 by obtaining national data on the collection  and distribution of blood from the National Blood Data Resource Center  (NBDRC), a nonprofit research group, and the two major national blood  suppliers\u2014the American National Red Cross and America\u2019s Blood Centers  (ABC).  We attended FDA and Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) blood advisory committee meetings that reviewed blood suppliers\u2019  response to the September 11 terrorist attacks and interviewed  management at the Red Cross and ABC to determine how much blood was  collected and distributed in response to the attacks.  In addition, we  reviewed current scientific literature, FDA advisory committee  recommendations, FDA guidelines, and blood supplier forecasts regarding  the development and potential impact of the vCJD deferral policies.  To  analyze recent changes in the price of blood, we reviewed data from ABC  and the Red Cross as well other studies of these price changes.  To address  the four objectives, we interviewed officials at HHS\u2019 Office of Public Health  Science (OPHS); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  National Center of Infectious Disease; the National Institutes of Health  (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; FDA\u2019s Office of Blood  Research and Review; and the Department of Defense (DOD), Armed  Services Blood Program Office.

Although past monitoring efforts by industry  and nonprofit groups have examined supply and demand trends for blood,  current efforts are focused on providing daily monitoring of hospitals\u2019  blood inventories."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Blood Collection and Use in the United States", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, about 8 million volunteers donate approximately 14  million units of whole blood each year.  Sixty percent of the population is  eligible to donate blood, but in any given year only about 5 percent of those  who are eligible actually do so. Eighty percent of donors are repeat  donors.  A typical donor gives blood approximately 1.6 times a year, but  donors may give 6 times a year, or every 8 weeks, which is the period the  body needs to replenish red blood cells.  The Red Cross and ABC each  collect about 45 percent each of the nation\u2019s blood supply, and roughly 10  percent is supplied by other independent blood centers, DOD, and  hospitals that have their own blood banks.", "Most hospital transfusion services purchase blood and blood components  under a contract with a local supplier which describes the price and  quantity of blood to be delivered.  Blood suppliers use resource-sharing  programs to help suppliers in high-demand areas buy blood that is not  needed by the supplier that collected it.  Taken together, the Red Cross,  ABC, and AABB\u2019s National Blood Exchange moved about 1.4 million units  of blood\u2014over 10 percent of the nation\u2019s supply\u2014among suppliers in 2000.   In addition, the Red Cross has a nationwide inventory control system to  facilitate the movement of its surplus blood.", "Donated blood is tested for blood type (A, B, AB, and O) and Rh type  (positive or negative). Donors with type O Rh negative blood are known as  \u201cuniversal donors,\u201d since it can be given to patients of any blood type in an  emergency. Donated blood is also screened for a number of diseases and  other elements that could prevent its use.  For example, blood is tested for  red blood cell antibodies that may cause an adverse reaction in recipients  and screened for hepatitis viruses B and C, human immunodeficiency  viruses (HIV) 1 and 2, other viruses, and syphilis.  Most U.S. blood products  are now filtered to remove a class of cells known as leukocytes (white  blood cells), which have been implicated in adverse transfusion reactions.   Each unit of whole blood is separated into specialized components, or  \u201cproducts,\u201d consisting of various types of blood cells, plasma, and special  preparations of plasma.  Health care facilities transfuse the resulting 26.5  million components into about 4.5 million patients per year.", "Red blood cells may be stored as a liquid for up to 42 days.  Blood banks  maintain a supply cushion to meet the uncertain demand for blood.  This  means that some blood is discarded; for example, from January through  August 2001, about 2 percent of the blood supply expired without being  transfused.  Red blood cells can also be frozen and stored for later use.   The military makes extensive use of frozen blood inventories to meet  wartime contingencies, maintaining stocks of frozen type O units that can  be transferred into most patients regardless of their blood types.  However,  because freezing and thawing blood is expensive and labor intensive,  civilian blood centers maintain relatively small inventories of frozen blood,  primarily of rare blood types.  A new device approved by FDA in May 2001  may make frozen blood more useful in the future\u2014it can extend the shelf  life of thawed, previously frozen blood from 24 hours to 14 days.", "There are several ways for hospitals to reduce the amount of blood they  use.  For example, one large hospital we contacted was able to save $1 million and 10,000 units of blood over 8 years by promoting awareness  of blood use among physicians and by improving how blood is ordered and  used during surgeries.  A recent study of blood use during neurosurgery at  a large teaching hospital found that, because the hospital\u2019s system for  ordering blood had not kept pace with advancements in surgical  techniques, physicians ordered 5.5 times more blood than was transfused  during surgery. One multifaceted approach to blood conservation is  known as bloodless surgery.  This practice involves the use of  pharmaceuticals that stimulate the production of red blood cells, surgical  equipment that cleans and returns lost blood to the patient, and  intravenous solutions that maintain blood volume. During a pilot study of  bloodless surgery techniques, one hospital successfully used these  techniques instead of blood transfusions for several hundred surgical  patients.", "Federal Regulation of Blood The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the Federal Food Drug and  Cosmetic Act form the basis of the Public Health Service\u2019s authority, as  enforced by FDA, to ensure the safety of blood that is collected and  transfused in the United States.  PHSA requires that all blood and blood  components distributed in interstate commerce be licensed by FDA in  order to ensure that the products are safe and effective.  Under PHSA,  FDA can recall blood and blood components that present an imminent or  substantial hazard to public health.  The licensing and regulatory standards  set by FDA attempt to maintain a blood supply that is both adequate and  safe.  Blood suppliers routinely take safety precautions beyond those  required by FDA.  For example, although FDA has not required nucleic acid  testing (NAT), a sophisticated test to detect HIV and hepatitis C virus  (HCV), virtually all blood centers perform it. Similarly, FDA has not  mandated universal leukoreduction, but most blood centers have adopted  the practice.", "When suppliers violate regulations, FDA takes legal action to prevent  further violations.  These legal actions can result in the parties entering into  consent decrees of permanent injunction to comply with all applicable  blood safety rules.  Several blood and plasma suppliers as well as  manufacturers of blood testing supplies are currently under consent  decrees for various violations.  One of the most significant of these  agreements now in force is with the Red Cross, which entered into a  consent decree in 1993, after FDA discovered that the Red Cross had  failed to follow its own standard operating procedures, had deficiencies in  its quality control processes, and had committed other violations.", "FDA has no authority to determine the amount of blood that should be  collected or to compel suppliers to make products available.  However,  FDA recognizes that an insufficient blood supply is a public health risk, and  it can make certain recommendations within its authority under PHSA and  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, related to the  availability of blood during public health emergencies.  In an emergency,  FDA and other HHS agencies can give advice to blood banks on prioritizing  the use of blood and facilitating the shipment of existing inventory to the  areas affected. For example, after the September 11 attacks, FDA issued  emergency guidelines to speed the delivery of blood to areas affected by  the attacks.  The guidelines allowed donated blood to be shipped to crisis  areas before NAT was completed and to allow clinical staff who were not  trained in all procedures to collect blood, in order to supplement the fully  trained staff. FDA\u2019s emergency guidelines were rescinded on September 14, 2001, upon recognition that blood supplies were more than  adequate to address current needs.  HHS also can purchase blood and  blood components and make other arrangements to respond to threats to  the safety and sufficiency of the blood supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring the Blood Supply", "paragraphs": ["While periodic surveys of the blood supply have been conducted for years,  no data on daily, weekly, or monthly national and regional blood collections  or usages were readily available to federal officials or blood suppliers until  2000.  NBDRC has conducted a biennial retrospective survey of blood  suppliers since 1997, and others conducted similar periodic surveys before  that.  NBDRC\u2019s latest comprehensive biennial survey of blood supply and  usage measured all units collected and transfused in 1999.  In periods  between these biennial surveys, NBDRC conducts interim retrospective  studies that measure the pace and number of collections.  In addition, both  the Red Cross and ABC have reported their annual collections from 1996  through 2001.", "Both the Red Cross and ABC have taken steps recently to improve the  measurement of blood collections and inventories in their own centers.   For example, the Red Cross recently introduced a large-scale, centralized  inventory tracking system.  This system monitors blood inventories and  distribution daily across all Red Cross blood centers, enabling projections  of demand and potential shortages using both daily data and historic blood  usage patterns.  Since March 2002, the independent blood centers affiliated  with ABC have participated in a less comprehensive daily inventory  reporting system.", "In November 1999, HHS made a commitment to improve the monitoring of  the blood supply as part of its Blood Action Plan announced in 1998.  As a  first step, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and NHLBI  contracted with NBDRC to provide monthly data on supply and demand  trends using a statistically representative sample of 26 blood suppliers that  account for about one-third of U.S. blood collections.  Data from this  survey in 2000 indicated that the blood inventory was stable and that blood  banks were absorbing the impact of the first vCJD donor deferral better  than initially expected.  NHLBI terminated the NBDRC contract, and OPHS  assumed support for the NBDRC data collection effort through the end of  2001.  NBDRC has continued this data collection effort without public  funding.", "Partly to compensate for the loss of the NBDRC data, OPHS introduced its  own early warning, or sentinel, system in August 2001.  The system is  designed to detect blood shortages that may adversely affect patient care  and analyze demand trends at transfusion centers and hospitals  nationwide.  OPHS collects daily blood inventory and use data from 26  hospitals and three transfusion centers that account for about 10 percent of  the national blood inventory.  Although the hospital sample is not  statistically representative, it includes both small and large hospitals in  different geographic regions of the United States meant to serve as  indicators of impending blood shortages.  To obtain supply data, OPHS has  also begun negotiations with ABC and the Red Cross to make available  daily supply data from their collection centers, although neither ABC nor  the Red Cross has yet agreed to do so.", "First reported in 1996, vCJD is a progressive and invariably fatal  neurodegenerative disease, part of broader class of diseases known as  transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).  As of June 2002, there  were 130 individuals with confirmed or probable cases of vCJD: 122 in the  United Kingdom, 6 in France, 1 in the Republic of Ireland, and 1 in Italy. It is  suspected that these individuals contracted the disease from eating meat  from cattle infected with BSE (mad cow disease) in the United Kingdom  before 1990.  Cattle herds in the United Kingdom suffered an epidemic of  BSE that peaked in 1992 and subsequently declined as a result of  government actions to change the composition of cattle feed.  The  incubation period for vCJD is long, but its precise length is not known.   This makes it difficult to project how many people will ultimately become  ill.  The United States has one likely case of vCJD, a 22-year-old citizen of  the United Kingdom living in Florida who is thought to have acquired vCJD  in the United Kingdom.  There have been no confirmed cases of BSE in U.S.  cattle.", "In response to the possibility that vCJD could be transmitted through blood  transfusions, in November 1999, FDA recommended deferring by April  2000 blood collections from individuals who had resided or traveled in the  United Kingdom for a total of 6 months or more from 1980 through 1996.

This shift was  prompted by the realization that a surge in blood collections following a  disaster does not help victims because disaster victims rarely require many  units of blood and because newly collected blood cannot be used  immediately.  For example, as with September 11, only a small percentage  of the additional blood collected after the Oklahoma City bombing was  transfused into victims (131 units of more than 9,000 units collected).   Moreover, the units used to treat victims in the hours after a disaster are  those already on hand at the treating hospital or local blood bank.

First, as we noted earlier, the  long-term trends in blood collections are positive, and collections have  increased substantially over the last 5 years.  For example, prior to  September 11, NBDRC had estimated that the nation\u2019s blood collections for  2001 would exceed the number of units transfused in 2000 by more than 7  percent.  Second, the Red Cross was able to increase its blood collections  in early 2001\u2014collections were 2 percent higher in the first 7 months of  2001 compared with 2000\u2014despite the April 2000 implementation of FDA\u2019s  initial deferral guidance and Red Cross\u2019s adoption of a new techinique to  measure red blood cell levels that disqualified 6 percent of potential donors  at its centers.  Red Cross reported collections in July 2001 that were 8  percent higher than for the same period in 2000.  Finally, before September  11, NYBC was able to increase its collections at a 12 percent annual rate  over the last few years.  We believe that this large and sustained increase in  collections for an individual blood bank that was previously known for a  chronic shortfall in collections indicates that blood centers will be able to  increase collections in response to the new vCJD donor policy.", "Despite the adequacy of the nation\u2019s blood supply, individual blood  collection centers with a relatively large proportion of donors who have  traveled to Europe will be more severely affected than others by the new  exclusion policies.  If these centers cannot find ways to increase local  blood collections, they, or the hospitals they serve, will need to purchase  blood from suppliers with an adequate inventory.  The Red Cross donor  survey found that its most affected regions would lose 5 percent of their  donors, compared with 2 percent for the regions least affected.  Blood  centers in coastal urban areas that have a greater number  of donors who  have traveled overseas could experience deferral rates greater than 5  percent.  Some other centers serving areas with many people who have  lived overseas, such as DOD-affiliated personnel, will also be  disproportionately affected.  NYBC will probably be affected the most  under FDA\u2019s new deferral policy.  NYBC currently imports about 25 percent  of its supply from three European blood centers that collect blood under  NYBC\u2019s FDA license.  NYBC will be unable to import blood from these  centers when the second phase of FDA\u2019s new deferral policy takes effect on  October 31, 2002.  Prior to September 11, NYBC was confident that it could  compensate for the loss of supply from its European centers because it had  substantially increased domestic collections during the last few years.   However, NYBC now claims that its local donor base has decreased by  about 25 percent since September 11 because many of the companies that  participated in its blood drives were directly affected by the terrorist  attacks and have reduced employment levels in the city.  To compensate for  the loss of blood from its European centers, NYBC has contracted to  purchase blood from many other domestic blood suppliers, including the  Red Cross and blood banks affiliated with ABC."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Blood Price Increases are Partly the Result of New Measures to Improve Blood Safety", "paragraphs": ["Although blood is collected primarily from unpaid volunteers, blood banks  incur costs from collecting, processing, and testing donated blood.

However, FDA\u2019s new deferral policy for 5 years exposure elsewhere in Europe  does not apply to source plasma. In part, this reflects FDA\u2019s belief that, on the basis of the results of  experiments conducted by plasma product manufacturers, the manufacturing process for plasma- derivative products minimizes the risk of transmission of vCJD through plasma.  In addition, FDA is  concerned that disqualifying plasma donors by extending the deferral policy to them may threaten the  sufficiency of the plasma supply.  The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) conducted a  donor travel survey in 30 plasma collection centers and found that donor losses could range from 0 to  13 percent, with the greatest losses occurring at centers located near military bases.  The overall  donor loss was estimated to be about 3.5 percent.  A survey conducted by one of PPTA\u2019s member  companies suggested that overall donor loss would be closer to 5 percent.  PPTA also expected that a  ban on the use of plasma in the United States from European donors, as would occur if the vCJD  deferral policy was applied to plasma, would adversely affect an already tight supply of plasma-derived  therapeutics, causing some countries to reject European plasma and thus putting extreme pressure on  other sources of plasma, such as the United States, to meet global demand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk of vCJD Infection through Blood Transfusion Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Transmission of vCJD by human blood or plasma has not been  demonstrated, and no laboratory or epidemiological studies have shown  that blood from donors infected with vCJD carries the disease.

Although  relatively little time has passed, none of the recipients of the blood have  developed vCJD.  Studies of patients with vCJD and a prior history of  receiving blood transfusions have not revealed any cases of vCJD among  the donors involved.", "Nonetheless, laboratory experiments point to a theoretical risk of  transmission of vCJD through blood.  For example, tissue samples from  vCJD patients have found the agents that cause vCJD, protein molecules  known as prions, in human lymph tissue, such as the tonsils and the spleen.   Since white blood cells known as B lymphocytes also circulate through  these tissues and are potentially involved in the pathology of vCJD,  researchers suggest that these circulating lymphocytes may carry  infectivity in blood.  Experiments with animals have shown that blood  infected with vCJD-like agents contain low-levels of infectivity.  In addition,  one group of researchers has recently demonstrated that BSE can be  experimentally transmitted between sheep by blood transfusion.   However, results from this experiment may not be representative of the  human manifestation of vCJD.", "Epidemiological Predictions  Researchers are limited in the conclusions they can make concerning vCJD  and blood safety, and in predicting the future number of vCJD cases.  Important variables in determining the probability of BSE transmission to  humans, such as route of exposure, genetic susceptibility, and dose, remain  unproven.  Further, the incubation period for vCJD is unknown but is  probably many years.  Citing the current modest number of additional  deaths in the United Kingdom caused by vCJD (there were 28 confirmed or  probable vCJD deaths in the United Kingdom in 2000 and 20 in 2001), some  researchers suggest that the epidemic will not reach the hundreds of  thousands once thought possible.  As a result, the projected number of total  cases has been revised downward to just a few hundred or few thousand  cases, with fewer than 100 new cases occurring per year. Such revised  estimates are based on varying assumptions regarding the average  incubation period and when individuals were infected.", "The ambiguity of the scientific evidence regarding vCJD transmission  through blood is reflected in the divided vote of FDA\u2019s advisory committee  (the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee, or  TSEAC) in favor of the expanded donor deferral.

Tests do exist to detect vCJD prions in some human tissues, such as brain  tissue, tonsils, and appendixes, but no suitable tests are available to detect  vCJD infections in blood.  Prions are different than viral and bacterial  pathogens, which contain nucleic acids.  Some pathogens and viruses  trigger the human body to release specific antibodies, which may be  detected in the blood.  For example, both HIV and hepatitis elicit antibodies  in the blood that can be detected in a blood test.  At this point, most  scientists believe that prions, such as those involved in vCJD, do not  contain nucleic acids and do not elicit the production of antibodies.  This  poses a challenge in designing a blood test, which must be 100,000 times as  sensitive as assays that already exist for detecting prions in tissues.
