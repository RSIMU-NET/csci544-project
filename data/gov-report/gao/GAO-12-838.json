This report addresses (1) the number of declarations requested and approved from fiscal years 2004-2011 and associated DRF obligations; (2) the criteria FEMA used to recommend a declaration for PA, and the extent that FEMA assessed whether an effective response to a disaster was beyond the capabilities of state and local governments; (3) how FEMA determined whether to recommend cost share adjustments, and their costs; and (4) FEMA's administrative cost percentages for declarations.

For these 539 declarations, FEMA obligated $80.3 billion, or an average of about $10 billion a year, from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), as of January 31, 2012. Almost half of the obligations were for Hurricane Katrina; excluding obligations for Hurricane Katrina, FEMA obligated $40.6 billion, or an average of about $5 billion a year. As of January 31, 2012, FEMA anticipated that when all 539 declarations are closed, total DRF obligations will be about $91.5 billion. GAO's analysis shows that FEMA primarily relied on a single criterion, the per capita damage indicator, to determine whether to recommend to the President that a jurisdiction receive public assistance (PA) funding. However, because FEMA's current per capita indicator, set at $1 in 1986, does not reflect the rise in (1) per capita personal income since it was created in 1986 or (2) inflation from 1986 to 1999, the indicator is artificially low. The indicator would be $3.57 in 2011 had it been adjusted for increases in per capita income and $2.07 in 2012 had it been adjusted for inflation from 1986 to 1999, rather than its current $1.35. GAO's analysis of FEMA's anticipated obligations for 508 declarations with PA during fiscal years 2004-2011 shows that 44 percent and 25 percent would not have met the indicator if it had been adjusted for increases in personal income and inflation, respectively, since 1986. Further, the per capita indicator does not accurately reflect a jurisdiction's capability to respond to or recover from a disaster without federal assistance. GAO identified other measures of fiscal capacity, such as total taxable resources, that could be more useful in determining a jurisdiction's ability to pay for damages to public structures. Developing a methodology to more comprehensively assess state capabilities and reexamining the basis for the indicator could help FEMA more accurately determine a jurisdiction's capacity to respond without federal assistance. FEMA recommends raising the usual 75 percent federal share for PA to 90 percent when federal obligations, excluding FEMA administrative costs, meet a qualifying threshold. However, FEMA has no specific criteria for assessing requests to raise the federal share for emergency work to 100 percent, but relies on its professional judgment. For the 539 disaster declarations during fiscal years 2004-2011, governors made 150 requests to adjust the federal cost share to 90 or 100 percent; 109, or 73 percent, were approved or statutorily mandated, mostly for hurricanes. Without specific criteria for 100 percent cost share, FEMA risks making inconsistent or inequitable recommendations to the President. GAO's analysis of administrative costs for 539 disaster declarations during fiscal years 2004-2011 shows that administrative cost percentages frequently exceeded FEMA's targets, although FEMA does not require that they be met. GAO's analysis of 1,221 disaster declarations shows that average administrative costs doubled from 9 to 18 percent during fiscal years 1989-2011, the time period for which FEMA has data available. FEMA is working on short- and long-term actions to improve efficiencies in delivering disaster assistance, but the agency does not plan to set goals or track performance for administrative costs. Until this happens, it will be difficult for FEMA to ensure assistance is being delivered in an efficient manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that FEMA develop a methodology to more accurately assess a jurisdiction's capability to respond to and recover from a disaster without federal assistance, develop criteria for 100 percent cost adjustments, and implement goals for and track administrative costs.

The Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), a component of the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), leads the federal effort to mitigate, respond to,  and recover from disasters, both natural and man-made. Disaster  declarations can trigger a variety of federal response and recovery  assistance for government and nongovernmental entities, households,  and individuals. FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance programs include Individual  Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA), which provide financial  assistance to individuals and jurisdictions, respectively. Typically, FEMA  pays 75 percent of the PA costs for disaster declarations, and state and  local governments pay the other 25 percent.

While the proposed rule was not  codified in 1986, FEMA began to use the $1.00 per capita indicator  informally as part of its preliminary damage assessment efforts and did  not adjust the indicator annually for either inflation or increases in national  per capita income.

Figure 6 shows the actual increases in  the per capita indicator for PA from 1986 to 2010 compared with the  increases that would have occurred if FEMA had adjusted the indicator  for inflation or the increase in per capita personal income during this  period.", "FEMA officials stated that the rise in construction and other costs to  respond to and recover from disasters have outpaced the rise in the per  capita indicator. In jurisdictions with smaller populations, damage to a  single building or facility, such as a water treatment facility, could result in  a damage estimate sufficient to meet the per capita damage threshold  and warrant a disaster declaration. For example, the damage from  Hurricane Katrina to a single water treatment facility in Carrollton,  Louisiana, exceeded Louisiana\u2019s 2005 per capita threshold. In addition,  the Washington National Cathedral incurred approximately $15 million of  damage during the August 23, 2011, earthquake in Washington, D.C.,  which has a per capita damage indicator threshold of less than $1  million.", "The Stafford Act requires that conditions due to a disaster be beyond a  jurisdiction\u2019s (state and local) capability to respond effectively before  disaster assistance from the federal government is warranted. however, prohibits FEMA from denying federal assistance solely by virtue  of an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population.  According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  activities should be established to monitor indicators and controls should  be aimed at validating the propriety and integrity of such indicators. Had  the indicator been adjusted for inflation beginning when FEMA started  using it in 1986, the indicator would have risen more than 100 percent,  from $1.00 to $2.07 in 2012.

We analyzed obligations instead of PDA damage estimates for PA because FEMA  officials stated that estimating the damage from a disaster is sometimes stopped when the  estimate equals or exceeds the PA per capita indicator. Therefore, we concluded that  conducting the analysis using projected obligations would be more accurate than using  incomplete PDA damage estimates for PA. of the 508 disaster declarations would not have met the PA per capita  indicator if adjusted for inflation since 1986.

The current annual inflation adjustment generally increases  the damage indicator incrementally. However, were the \u201ccatch-up\u201d  inflation adjustment (from $1.35 to $2.07) implemented in a single year,  the increase would be considerably more than the annual inflation  adjustments since 1999. For example, for a jurisdiction with a population  of 5 million, fully implementing the catch-up adjustment for inflation would  raise the damage indicator from $6.75 million to $10.35 million.

Further, a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity is  an important component of the jurisdiction\u2019s overall response and  recovery capability.", "In 1999, when the rule was codified to set the per capita indicator at  $1.00, FEMA stated that it recognized that a straight per capita figure may  not be the best measurement of a state\u2019s capability, but that it provided a  simple, clear, consistent, and long-standing means of measuring the  severity, magnitude, and impact of a disaster while at the same time  ensuring that the President can respond quickly and effectively to a  governor\u2019s request for assistance. As we reported in 2001, per capita  personal income is a relatively poor indicator of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal  capacity because it does not comprehensively measure all income  potentially subject to jurisdiction taxation and is not necessarily indicative  of jurisdiction or local capability to respond effectively without federal  assistance. For example, it does not include income produced in a  jurisdiction unless it is received as income by a jurisdiction resident. Thus,  profits retained by corporations for business investment, though  potentially subject to jurisdiction taxation, are not included in a jurisdiction  per capita income measure because they do not represent income  received by jurisdiction residents. In 2001, we recommended that FEMA  consider alternative criteria. FEMA\u2019s response noted that we provided  valuable input for the FEMA team that was reviewing the disaster  declaration process and the criteria used to assess jurisdiction damages.  According to FEMA, in 2001, the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2002  included a provision for the development of improved guidelines for  disaster assistance that provided jurisdictions with meaningful criteria that  must be met to become eligible for federal disaster assistance.

Recovery refers to efforts aimed at restoring an area to its prior  status, including the reconstruction of damaged structures, including its  housing stock, business establishments, public facilities, and the  environment.

FEMA  has specific criteria to evaluate a request to adjust the federal share from  75 percent to 90 percent, but does not have specific criteria to evaluate a  request to adjust the federal share to 100 percent. Adjusting the federal  share to 100 percent is typically done for emergency work such as life-  saving activities and debris removal projects through FEMA\u2019s PA  program.

FEMA generally follows the same process to evaluate a request from a governor for a cost  share adjustment as it follows to evaluate a request for a disaster  declaration, according to FEMA officials. FEMA makes a recommendation  to the President as to whether the request for a cost share adjustment  should be approved or denied and the President makes the decision.", "For the 539 disaster declarations during fiscal years 2004 through 2011,  governors requested that the President adjust the usual federal/nonfederal  (that is, state and local government) cost share 150 times. As shown in  table 6, 109 of the 150 requests, or 73 percent, were approved during this  period. However, 23 of the 109 cost share adjustments were required by  provisions in law; therefore, FEMA\u2019s recommendation was not a factor in  whether these cost share adjustment requests were approved or denied.  For example, 10 of the 23 cost share adjustments required by law were for  Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita.", "Our analysis shows that 64 of the 109 cost share adjustments during  fiscal years 2004 through 2011 were for the following six disasters: 23 for  Hurricane Katrina, 11 for Hurricane Rita, 9 for Hurricane Ike, 8 for  Hurricane Ivan, 7 for midwest flooding in fiscal year 2008, and 6 for  Hurricane Dennis. Furthermore, 34 of the 109 cost share adjustments  involved a single adjustment, whereas 23 cost share adjustments  involved multiple adjustments. FEMA officials explained this by stating  that a 100 percent cost share adjustment could be approved for a 72-hour  period and the governor could subsequently request another 100 percent  cost share adjustment for another 72-hour period, which the President  could approve. For example, the disaster declaration in Louisiana in fiscal  year 2005 for Hurricane Katrina had 8 cost share adjustments and the  disaster declaration in Mississippi in fiscal year 2005 for Hurricane Katrina  had 9 cost share adjustments.", "According to FEMA officials, although the process is similar, the agency  uses different criteria to evaluate a request from a governor to increase  the federal government share for PA up to 90 percent than it does for  requests up to 100 percent. Specifically, FEMA may recommend to the  President that the federal cost share be increased up to 90 percent when  a disaster is so extraordinary that actual federal obligations, excluding  FEMA administrative costs, meet or exceed a qualifying threshold. To  determine the threshold, the jurisdiction population is multiplied by a per  capita amount, which is $135 for calendar year 2012 (or 100 times the  2012 per capita damage indicator of $1.35). Forty-one of the 109 cost  share adjustments increased the federal cost share to 90 percent and  reduced the nonfederal share to 10 percent.

FEMA officials stated that a recommendation to the President for up to a  100 percent cost share adjustment is based on a subjective assessment  of the jurisdiction\u2019s needs and that it is usually pretty obvious when a  jurisdiction needs debris removal and emergency protective measures,  although the officials acknowledged that FEMA\u2019s recommendation is a  judgment call. According to FEMA, it does not use the same criteria to  evaluate a request for a 100 percent cost share adjustment as it uses for  a 90 percent cost share adjustment because the criteria for the 90  percent adjustment are based on actual federal obligations. FEMA  officials explained that they would not be able to apply those criteria for  the 100 percent adjustment in the initial days of a disaster because there  would not be much, if any, funding obligated at that point. However,  criteria for assessing a request for a 100 percent cost share adjustment  for PA (that is, emergency work) do not have to be the same criteria  FEMA uses to assess requests for 90 percent cost share adjustments.  For example, FEMA\u2019s IA grant program uses multiple factors to determine  whether to recommend to the President that a jurisdiction be granted IA.", "We have previously reported that clear criteria are important for  controlling federal costs and helping to ensure consistent and equitable  eligibility determinations. For example, if a 100 percent cost share  adjustment is approved, the federal government could pay millions of  dollars more than it ordinarily would for a single disaster declaration.  Furthermore, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  state that internal control activities help ensure that management\u2019s  directives are carried out and that actions are taken to address risks.", "Moreover, internal control standards state that control activities should be  an integral part of an entity\u2019s accountability for stewardship of government  resources. Without such activities, FEMA is at risk that its  recommendations related to 100 percent cost share adjustments may not  be justified.

The officials stated that they have not routinely  tracked the additional costs associated with cost share adjustments  because they did not see a need for this information. According to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, program  managers need financial data to determine whether they are meeting  their goals for accountability for effective and efficient use of resources.  Financial information is needed for both external and internal uses, and  on a day-to-day basis to make operating decisions, monitor performance,  and allocate resources. Pertinent information should be identified,  captured, and distributed in a form and time frame that permits people to  perform their duties efficiently.

Thus, on average, small disaster declarations were within the upper limit of  FEMA\u2019s target range. However, 12 small declarations had administrative  cost percentages greater than 50 percent, which means that FEMA  obligated more for administrative costs than for disaster assistance. For example, if FEMA required $6 million to deliver $4 million in disaster  assistance to a jurisdiction, then the related administrative cost percentage  would be 60 percent of the total DRF obligations of $10 million. For medium  declarations that we analyzed, administrative cost percentages averaged  12 percent and were, therefore, in the middle of the target range. However,  administrative cost percentages for medium declarations ranged from less  than 1 percent to 55 percent and, for 1 medium declaration, FEMA  obligated more for administrative costs than for disaster assistance. For  large declarations that we analyzed, administrative cost percentages  averaged 13 percent\u2014slightly above the upper limit of the target range\u2014 and ranged from 3 percent to 25 percent; therefore, none of the large  declarations we analyzed had obligations for administrative costs higher  than disaster assistance.", "FEMA\u2019s administrative cost percentages also differed significantly  depending on the type of assistance delivered to a jurisdiction.

The PA per capita indicator is artificially low  because it does not reflect the rise in per capita personal income since  1986 or 13 years of inflation from 1986, when the indicator was set at  $1.00 and adopted for use, to 1999. By primarily relying on an artificially  low indicator, FEMA\u2019s recommendations to the President are based on  damage estimates and do not comprehensively assess a jurisdiction\u2019s  capability to respond to and recover from a disaster on its own. For  example, on the basis of FEMA\u2019s actual and estimated disaster  assistance obligations, more than one-third of the 539 major disasters  declared during fiscal years 2004 through 2011 are expected to have total  DRF obligations of less than $10 million, and more than 60 percent are  expected to have total obligations of less than $25 million. Therefore,  many of these declarations were for relatively small disasters. At a  minimum, adjusting the existing PA per capita indicator fully for changes  in per capita income or inflation could ensure that the per capita indicator  more accurately reflects changes in U.S. economic conditions since 1986,  when the indicator was adopted. Making the appropriate inflation  adjustment to the indicator would raise it from $1.35 to $2.07. A change of  this size in 1 year could present challenges for jurisdictions, which could  find that disasters with PA damage estimates that would now qualify for  PA would no longer qualify. Thus, phasing in the adjustment over several  years could provide jurisdictions time to take actions, such as increasing  any rainy day funds, to adjust to the effects of higher qualifying indicators.", "A more comprehensive approach to determine a jurisdiction\u2019s capabilities  to respond to a disaster would be to replace or supplement the current  indicator with more complete data on a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal resources,  such as TTR, and would be informed by data on a jurisdiction\u2019s response  and recovery assets and capabilities. Because FEMA\u2019s current approach  of comparing the amount of disaster damage with the PA per capita  indicator does not accurately reflect whether a jurisdiction has the  capabilities to respond to and recover from a disaster without federal  assistance, developing a methodology that provides a more  comprehensive assessment of jurisdictions\u2019 response and recovery  capabilities, including a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity, could provide FEMA  with data that are more specific to the jurisdiction requesting assistance.  For example, developing preparedness metrics in response to the Post- Katrina Act and Presidential Policy Directive-8 could provide FEMA with  readily available information on jurisdictions\u2019 response and recovery  capabilities. Without an accurate assessment of jurisdictions\u2019 capabilities  to respond to and recover from a disaster, FEMA runs the risk of  recommending to the President that federal disaster assistance be  awarded without considering a jurisdiction\u2019s response and recovery  capabilities or its fiscal capacity. As we recommended in 2001, we  continue to believe that FEMA should develop more objective and specific  criteria to assess the capabilities of jurisdictions to respond to a disaster.  Given the legislative and policy changes over the past decade, we believe  that including fiscal and nonfiscal capabilities, including available  preparedness metrics in its assessment, would allow FEMA to make  more informed recommendations to the President when determining a  jurisdiction\u2019s capacity to respond without federal assistance.", "Making informed recommendations to the President about whether cost  share adjustments should be granted is important for FEMA and the  requesting jurisdictions because every cost share adjustment has  financial implications for both entities. A specific set of criteria or factors to  use when considering requests for 100 percent cost share adjustments  would provide FEMA a decision-making framework and enable more  consistent and objectively based recommendations to the President. Also,  when FEMA recommends that a cost share adjustment be approved and  the President approves it, the federal government assumes the financial  burden of paying 15 percent or 25 percent more in PA, which could total  millions of dollars. Tracking the additional costs to the federal government  because of cost share adjustments would allow FEMA to better  understand the financial implications of its recommendations to the  President.", "FEMA\u2019s average administrative costs as a percentage of total DRF  disaster assistance obligations have risen for disasters of all sizes. The  agency recognized that delivering assistance in an efficient manner is  important and published guidance to be used throughout the agency to  help rein in administrative costs.

However, DHS stated that it plans to conduct a review to  better understand and describe its current measures. DHS stated that a  number of factors affect administrative costs, which can present  difficulties when trying to implement a simple measure of percentage of  administrative costs to total costs. For example, DHS noted that the types  of assistance provided and the location of the JFO would affect the  percentage of administrative costs. DHS also stated that establishing  meaningful administrative cost percentage goals will be challenging  because of the many factors involved and that a suite of measures to  track administrative cost percentages could help ensure more effective  and efficient operations. Thus, DHS is pursuing development of such a  suite of measures. We agree that a number of factors affect the  percentage of administrative costs and that establishing meaningful  administrative cost percentage goals can be challenging. In developing a  suite of measures, it is important that FEMA\u2019s leadership be able to use  them to effectively monitor a disaster declaration\u2019s overall administrative  costs in addition to the factors that affect administrative costs.

We  focused on this time frame because it contains the most current data for  disaster declarations. It also comprises the time period after FEMA was  merged into the newly created DHS, on March 1, 2003, and predates  Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We focused primarily on fiscal years 2004  through 2011; however, to provide historical context and to compare  results across similar periods, we also reviewed obligations data from  fiscal years 1989 through 2011. In addition, to provide further historical  perspective, we include information on the number of disaster  declarations by jurisdiction from the first presidential disaster declaration  in fiscal year 1953 through fiscal year 2011 in appendix I. FEMA provided  data to us from its National Emergency Management Information System  (NEMIS) and Integrated Financial Management Information System  (IFMIS).

To determine the probability of a disaster  declaration request being approved for PA if the Preliminary Damage  Assessments (PDA) met or exceeded the PA per capita indicator, we  obtained and analyzed data on FEMA\u2019s PDAs from fiscal years 2008  through 2011. For this analysis, we used 4 years of data (fiscal years  2008 through 2011) instead of 8 years of data (fiscal years 2004 through  2011) that we used for other analyses because FEMA did not have data  for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 in an electronic format. We believe that  our analysis of 4 years of data is sufficient for purposes of this report.  Specifically, we analyzed 246 disaster declarations during fiscal years  2008 through 2011, and excluded 293 declarations during fiscal years  2004 through 2007 because FEMA had readily available data only for  PDAs for fiscal years 2008 through 2011. For each of the 246 disaster  declarations, we reviewed the PDAs to determine whether a state  requested PA, whether the President approved it, and the extent to which  the PA damage estimate exceeded the PA per capita indicator.", "In addition, we conducted an analysis to determine whether disaster  declarations from 2004 through 2011 would have met the PA per capita  indicator if adjusted for the change in per capita personal income since  1986. Our analysis included FEMA\u2019s projected obligations as of April 30,  2012, for only those 508 disaster declarations that had received PA and  had been declared during fiscal years 2004 through 2011. We did not  analyze the 31 disaster declarations that only received IA. We analyzed  obligations instead of PDA damage estimates for PA because FEMA  officials stated that estimating the damage from a disaster is sometimes  stopped when the estimate equals or exceeds the PA per capita indicator.  Therefore, we concluded that conducting the analysis using projected  obligations would be more accurate than using incomplete PDA damage  estimates for PA. In addition, we separately analyzed actual obligations  for 144 closed disaster declarations because closed declarations would  be either complete or very close to being complete.

We also obtained and analyzed the cost share  adjustments and types requested, approved, and denied during fiscal  years 2004 through 2011. In addition, we interviewed FEMA officials who  process cost share adjustment requests and participate in making  recommendations to the President as to whether the requests should be  approved or denied. We also reviewed internal control standards for the  federal government related to ensuring management directives are  carried out and that actions are taken to address risks.

While the focus of our objective was fiscal years 2004  through 2011, we obtained obligations data back to fiscal year 1989 to  assess potential trends over time because FEMA only maintains  obligations data since then. To assess FEMA\u2019s current practices, we  compared FEMA\u2019s administrative cost percentages for disaster  declarations during fiscal years 2004 through 2011 with FEMA\u2019s target  ranges for administrative cost percentages. To identify potential trends  over time, we compared FEMA\u2019s administrative cost percentages during  fiscal years 1989 through 2003 with FEMA\u2019s administrative cost  percentages during fiscal years 2004 through 2011 and with FEMA\u2019s  target ranges. According to FEMA officials, administrative costs are  typically higher in the early months of a declaration, typically decreasing  as the declaration matures (that is, as labor-intensive response activities  decline). In order to ensure the results of both analyses were not skewed  by declarations that had not yet matured and whose administrative costs  were high, we analyzed actual administrative costs for disaster  declarations that were closed as of April 30, 2012. For declarations that  were still open as of April 30, 2012, we analyzed actual obligations as of  April 30, 2012, plus the amount that FEMA projected to obligate in the  future until the declarations are eventually closed.

In the wake of a  disaster, FEMA prepares dollar estimates of the damage to public  infrastructure incurred in an area that would be eligible for federal  assistance under a federal major disaster declaration. Currently the key  metric for determining eligibility for federal disaster assistance is a \u201cper  capita indicator,\u201d which, since 1999, has been adjusted annually for  inflation. For 2012, the indicator is $1.35 per capita (that is, total  estimated damages eligible for federal PA divided by the jurisdiction\u2019s  population equals $1.35 or more). Damage estimates in excess of this  number typically result in FEMA recommending that the President issue a  major disaster declaration, which makes jurisdictions eligible for federal  reimbursement of at least 75 percent of certain repair and replacement  costs. The per capita indicator FEMA currently uses is not a measure of a  jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity to address the damages caused by a disaster.  Rather, there is an assumption that generally jurisdictions are unable  without federal major disaster assistance to rectify damages that equal or  exceed $1.35 per capita.", "Jurisdictions\u2019 abilities to finance their own disaster relief and recovery  vary with their fiscal capacity, among other factors. A jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal  capacity is defined as the ability of a government to raise revenue from its  own sources, by taxes, license fees, user charges, and public enterprises,  among other devices. Fiscal capacity is usually expressed as a  percentage of the national average for the 50 states plus the District of  Columbia, in the form of an index number. For example, if a jurisdiction\u2019s  capacity is equal to 100 percent or 90 percent of the national average, its  index number would be 100 or 90, respectively. In general, the ability of  jurisdictions to pay for public services increases with the size of their  economies. The simplest application of fiscal capacity criteria to disaster  assistance is an adjustment of the per capita indicator for every  jurisdiction. \u201cRicher\u201d jurisdictions\u2014those above the national average\u2014 would have a higher level, reflecting their greater ability to pay, while  \u201cpoorer\u201d jurisdictions would have a lower level. The fiscal capacity index  could be converted into a percentage (for instance, 110 = 110 percent or  90 = 90 percent) and applied to each jurisdiction\u2019s per capita indicator  ($1.35 times the population) to get an adjusted indicator. For example, a  jurisdiction with a population of 10 million would have a per capita  indicator of $13.5 million dollars ($1.35 times its 10 million population). If  the jurisdiction\u2019s capacity index was 100 percent, its capacity threshold  would be the same as the current indicator\u2014$13.5 million. However, if the  jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity index was 110 (indicating a fiscal capacity  index 10 percent above the national average), its damage threshold  would be $14.85 million\u2014$13.5 million plus 10 percent of $13.5 million.  The variation in the results could be narrowed, if desired, by setting upper  and lower limits to the adjustments, among other possible methods.  However, adjusting the per capita indicator according to a jurisdiction\u2019s  fiscal capacity would not necessarily reduce total federal spending. It is  possible that disaster assistance adjusted by fiscal capacity, and focused  on jurisdictions with below-average fiscal capacity, could increase total  federal spending. How total annual spending is affected would depend on  the specific disasters taking place for that year, as well as the affected  jurisdictions.", "In addition to the theoretical aspects of comparing and contrasting various  measurements of fiscal capacity, there are other matters to consider.  Specifically, there are certain attributes that are desirable in a fiscal  capacity measure. These attributes could help FEMA determine the  extent to which the agency could use measurements of jurisdiction fiscal  capacity when determining a jurisdiction\u2019s eligibility for federal assistance.  These attributes include the following:  Simple and easy to calculate: For political acceptance and analytical  ease, the methodology of measurement should be as simple as possible.  For practicality and transparency, a measure should be easy and  inexpensive to calculate.", "Convenient, available, and timely: Ideally the data for a measure would  be routinely collected, checked, and published by a government agency  on a timely basis. For example, the measurement should be possible on  an annual basis with as little a time lag as possible, in order to provide the  most timely indicator of jurisdictions\u2019 capacities.", "Comprehensive: A measure should be comprehensive with respect to the  implementation of its approach. Incompleteness could bias results.", "Analytically sound: The principal analytical choice in capacity  measurement is between economic measures that aim for  comprehensive measurement free of double-counting, and tax base  measures that in some way take account of governments\u2019 choices in how  to tax. There is debate among economists as to which type of  measurement (economic or tax base) is more analytically sound.", "Does not affect or is not affected by any individual jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal  choices: Capacity measures should not be affected by or affect a  jurisdiction\u2019s actual fiscal choices, in terms of what to tax, how to tax, or  how much to tax. In principle a government\u2019s fiscal behavior could affect  its own tax bases. No capacity measure makes any adjustments based  on the impact of taxes on a state\u2019s economy because of the extreme  difficulty of arriving at a simple method of making such adjustment that  would earn political consensus."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal Capacity Measurements", "paragraphs": ["The three fiscal capacity measures discussed below provide various  methods that can be used to determine a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity.

The  personal income of all residents of a jurisdiction consists of labor  earnings, proprietors\u2019 and partnership income, rent, interest, dividends,  and transfers (public cash benefits). It is the most commonly used  measure in the United States for federal grants. PCI is simple and familiar  to most people, and it is routinely calculated and published by the federal  government on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. More local measures of  personal income are less comprehensive, for lack of data. Some  jurisdictions may choose to tax only part of income, or not to tax it at all.", "PCI aims to be a comprehensive measure of residents\u2019 personal income,  without regard to how they are taxed.", "PCI is not a comprehensive measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity and  is affected by a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal choices. The principal shortcoming of  PCI is its failure to reflect a jurisdiction\u2019s ability to raise tax revenue from  nonresidents, also known as tax exporting. For example, a jurisdiction  government may tax nonresident commuters, property owners, shoppers,  and tourists. The ability to export taxes varies sharply across jurisdictions.  Also, data on one component of personal income, accrued capital gains,  is not available. More generally, changes in asset values are not captured  in any fiscal capacity measures, because of lack of data. Another missing  element in PCI is the net income of a jurisdiction\u2019s government  enterprises. An example is state-owned liquor stores, whose profits never  pass through private hands. Another example is royalties paid to  governments by extractive industries, such as oil, gas, and uranium.  These scenarios amount to income received by a jurisdiction\u2019s residents,  through their government. In one state (Alaska), a share of such  revenue\u2014a \u201cbonus\u201d payment\u2014is paid directly to state residents, which  would appear as part of PCI. To a limited extent, PCI is biased to the  extent to which a jurisdiction government finances transfer payments with  taxes on income, since this income is counted twice, once by source and  the second time by receipt.", "Gross state product (GSP): As a measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal  capacity, GSP is simple, available, timely, and not affected by a  jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal choices. Also called gross domestic product by state,  GSP consists of all income \u201cproduced\u201d in a state. It includes labor  earnings of those who work in a jurisdiction, irrespective of their  residence, the net income of business firms operating in a jurisdiction,  indirect business taxes paid to the governments of the jurisdiction, and  the output of the public sector (in national income accounting,  government output is valued at cost). GSP partially captures the ability of  a jurisdiction to export taxes, since it includes income received by  nonresidents and by the residents\u2019 own governments directly. As with  PCI, with the benefit of government publication, the data are available on  a timely basis and are easily converted into a fiscal capacity index. It is  less affected by a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal choices than PCI because it does  not double-count income.", "Similar to PCI, GSP is not a comprehensive measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s  fiscal capacity. More specifically, PCI includes income received by a  jurisdiction\u2019s residents, but not income generated in a jurisdiction but  received by nonresidents. GSP does not include income received by a  jurisdiction\u2019s residents that originates elsewhere.", "Total taxable resources (TTR): As a measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal  capacity, TTR is comprehensive, available, and not affected by  jurisdictions\u2019 fiscal choices. According to the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury), the object of TTR is to capture the unduplicated sum of PCI  and GSP that is susceptible to taxation by a jurisdiction\u2019s government.  By this means the entirety of income potentially exposed to taxation is  measured. In practice the calculation is relatively simple. A jurisdiction\u2019s  GSP is supplemented with income received by jurisdiction residents that  originated in other jurisdictions. This would include the labor earnings of  residents who commute to jobs in other jurisdictions, and the capital  income (mainly interest, dividends, rent, and capital gains) of all  jurisdiction residents due to asset holdings in other jurisdictions. It  excludes indirect business taxes paid to the federal government (such as  the payroll tax and federal excises). TTR is used in two grant programs\u2014 the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s block grant program and  Community Mental Health Service\u2014and is calculated by Treasury.", "TTR is a complex measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity and is not as  timely as other measures. A crude measure of TTR is obtained by simply  averaging a jurisdiction\u2019s PCI and GSP. This was done for official TTR  estimates between 1992 and 1997. Subsequently the calculations were  based more closely on the original conceptual framework for TTR. At  present there is a 2-year lag in the publication of TTR estimates by  Treasury. As of May of 2012, the most recent year available is 2009. The  primary reason for the delay in publishing TTR estimates is the need to  wait for federal excise tax revenues and nontax liabilities, and federal  civilian enterprise surpluses, to become available. These data are  provided to Treasury in August or September for the year ending 20  months prior. According to the Chief of the Regional Product Branch,  Regional Product Division, at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, it could  be possible to speed up the availability of TTR by 2 or 3 months. In  addition, TTR is less transparent than PCI or GSP. It relies on  approximations of capital income (dividends, interest, and rent), since  such quantities are not reported by place of origination. It does not  discriminate among income flows according to the degree of susceptibility  to taxation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Fiscal Measures Applied to the Per Capita Indicator", "paragraphs": ["Each of these three measures of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity to respond  to and recover from a disaster without federal assistance has its  limitations and can affect each jurisdiction somewhat differently,  compared with using the current $1.35 per capita damage estimate  indicator. FEMA\u2019s current per capita indicator is simple and easy to  understand, but it is not a measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity. Nor  does FEMA have a useful measure of a jurisdiction\u2019s response  capabilities. All current measures of those capabilities are jurisdictions\u2019  self-reported data without reference to common metrics for assessing  capability. Because FEMA\u2019s per capita indicator does not  comprehensively assess a jurisdiction\u2019s response and recovery  capabilities, including a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity, some combination of  these measures could provide a more robust and useful assessment of a  jurisdiction\u2019s capability to respond to and recover from a disaster without  federal assistance, or with minimal federal assistance. This could include  exploring the usefulness of supplementing the current damage indicator  (which does not fully reflect changes in inflation since its adoption in  1986) with other measures of a jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacity and response  capability.", "For example, one potential alternative methodology could involve  adjusting the per capita indicator for each jurisdiction based on a measure  of jurisdiction fiscal capacity. If FEMA were to adjust the PA indicator for  inflation, the adjusted PA indicator for fiscal year 2011 would be $2.07.  Beginning with the adjusted PA indicator of $2.07, each jurisdiction\u2019s PA  indicator could then be adjusted based on that jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal  capacity. For example, if the $2.07 base were adjusted for \u201cjurisdiction A,\u201d  which has a 2009 TTR index of 71.8, jurisdiction A\u2019s PA indicator would  be $1.49. If the $2.07 base were adjusted for \u201cjurisdiction B\u2019s\u201d 2009 TTR  index of 149, jurisdiction B\u2019s PA indicator would be $3.08 (see table16).  The variation in jurisdiction A\u2019s $1.49 indicator and jurisdiction B\u2019s $3.08  indicator represents the difference in the two jurisdiction\u2019s fiscal capacities  in accordance with each jurisdiction\u2019s TTR.
