To make this adjustment, CMS calculates a risk score, a relative measure of expected health care for each beneficiary. Risk scores should be the same among all beneficiaries with the same health conditions and demographic characteristics. Differences in diagnostic coding between MA plans and Medicare FFS led to inappropriately high MA risk scores and payments to MA plans, and CMS adjusted for coding differences in 2010. In January 2012, GAO reported that CMS's adjustments to risk scores did not sufficiently correct for coding differences, resulting in excess payments to MA plans. Since completing the analysis for the January 2012 report, risk score data for two additional years have become available. GAO (1) determined the extent to which differences, if any, in diagnostic coding between MA plans and Medicare FFS affected MA risk scores and payments to MA plans in 2010, 2011, and 2012; and (2) identified what changes, if any, CMS made to its risk score adjustment methodology for 2013 and intends to make for future years. To do this, GAO compared risk score growth for MA beneficiaries with an estimate of what risk score growth would have been for those beneficiaries if they were in Medicare FFS for 2010 and projected the growth to 2011 and 2012, and determined if there were changes to CMS's methodology by reviewing agency documentation and interviewing agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the cumulative impact of coding differences on risk scores increased from 2010 through 2012 and was greater than the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) risk score adjustment of 3.4 percent for each of the 3 years.

For 2011, GAO estimated that differences in diagnostic coding resulted in risk scores that were 4.6 to 5.3 percent higher than they likely would have been if the same beneficiaries had been continuously enrolled in FFS. This upward trend continued for 2012, with estimated risk scores 4.9 to 6.4 percent higher.", "CMS's adjustment to risk scores for 2010 through 2012 to account for diagnostic coding differences was too low, resulting in estimated excess payments to MA plans of at least $3.2 billion. CMS's annual 3.4 percent reduction in risk scores is equivalent to $2.8 billion in 2010, $3.0 billion in 2011 and $3.2 billion in 2012. According to GAO's estimates, the amount of the excess payments to MA plans after accounting for CMS's adjustments was $0.6 billion in 2010, between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion in 2011, and between $1.5 billion and $2.9 billion in 2012. Cumulatively across the 3 years, this equals excess payments of between $3.2 billion and $5.1 billion.", "For 2013, CMS continues to use the risk score adjustment of 3.4 percent it used in 2010, 2011, and 2012. To conduct its data-based analysis, CMS officials reported that they used the same methodology used in 2010, but they incorporated more recent data. CMS officials told us that, in addition to the results of the data analysis, they incorporated additional factors such as recent payment changes made to the MA program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the maintenance of benefits for seniors. The Social Security Act does not prescribe CMS's methodology for adjusting for differences in diagnostic coding. However, the express purpose of the requirements to conduct and incorporate into the risk scores a data-based analysis of coding differences is to ensure payment accuracy. The act does not provide for factors other than the results of the analysis to be incorporated into the adjustment, suggesting that accuracy would be ensured solely through the incorporation of analytical results. CMS officials stated that they believed there was policy discretion with respect to the most appropriate adjustment factor but did not identify the specific source of their authority to consider factors other than the required data analysis when determining the adjustment amount.

The Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers  Medicare, pays private plans a monthly amount per beneficiary to provide  health care services for each beneficiary enrolled in these plans. CMS  adjusts this payment to account for a beneficiary\u2019s health status, a  process known as risk adjustment, and assigns to each MA beneficiary a  risk score\u2014a relative measure of expected health care costs.", "Risk scores for beneficiaries with the same diagnoses and characteristics  should be identical, regardless of whether the beneficiaries are in an MA  plan or Medicare FFS. However, MA plans have a greater incentive than  FFS providers to make sure that all medical diagnoses are  comprehensively coded, as this can increase beneficiaries\u2019 risk scores  and ultimately the payments plans receive. This is not the case for FFS  providers, who are generally paid for the services they provided and  whose payments do not vary based on the diagnoses of the beneficiaries   Consequently, risk scores for beneficiaries in  who received the services.MA plans may tend to be higher relative to the risk scores of beneficiaries  in FFS who are in similar health and have identical characteristics. To  ensure that MA plans are not overpaid as a result of these differences in  diagnostic coding patterns, CMS makes a separate adjustment to MA  plan payments.", "In January 2012, we reported that CMS\u2019s adjustments to account for  differences in diagnostic coding were inadequate and resulted in excess  payments to MA plans. In 2010, CMS estimated that 3.4 percent of MA  beneficiary risk scores were attributable to diagnostic coding differences  between MA plans and Medicare FFS providers. CMS reduced MA  beneficiaries\u2019 2010 risk scores by 3.4 percent, which resulted in the  agency saving $2.7 billion in excess payments to MA plans. However, on  the basis of the information available when we did our study, we  estimated that the difference in diagnostic coding between MA plans and  Medicare FFS providers was greater\u20144.8 percent to 7.1 percent\u2014 depending on the assumptions made about trends in risk score growth.  Our estimate differed from CMS\u2019s because we used more recent data,  incorporated the trend of coding differences over time, and accounted for  additional beneficiary characteristics.", "We also found that the impact of coding differences increased over time  and noted that this trend suggested that the cumulative impact of coding  differences in 2011 and 2012 could be larger than in 2010. However,  CMS applied the same 3.4 percent adjustment to risk scores it used in  2010 to risk scores in 2011 and 2012.

We first compared actual risk score growth for beneficiaries in MA  plans with the estimated risk score growth MA beneficiaries would have  had if they were enrolled in Medicare FFS. To do this, we calculated  changes in disease scores\u2014the portion of the risk score that is based on  a beneficiary\u2019s coded diagnoses\u2014for MA beneficiaries and used  regression analysis to estimate what changes in disease scores would  have been if those beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare FFS. We  attributed differences between actual and estimated disease score growth  to differences in coding practices between MA plans and Medicare FFS.  We estimated the extent to which differences in diagnostic coding  between MA plans and Medicare FFS affected 2010, 2011, and 2012 risk  scores by estimating the cumulative impact of coding differences starting  with 2007 risk scores.", "Because 2010 risk scores were the most recent available at the time of  our analysis for this report, we projected the estimated impact of coding  differences to 2012 using different assumptions of trends: the lower  projection assumed that the impact of coding differences on risk score  growth for 2010 to 2012 was the same as it was for 2009 to 2010, while  the higher projection assumed that the trend in the impacts of diagnostic  coding differences on risk score growth from 2005 through 2010  continued through 2012. To calculate the cumulative impact of coding  differences on 2010, 2011, and 2012 MA risk scores, we summed the  impacts over the previous periods, weighted by the proportion of the MA  population that could have experienced risk score growth due to coding  differences during that period.", "We made two enhancements to the methodology used for our January  2012 report. First, we altered our assumption about which beneficiaries  had risk score growth that could be affected by differences in coding  practices between MA plans and Medicare FFS. Specifically, for our  January 2012 report, we assumed that beneficiaries who were recently  enrolled in MA without any prior Medicare FFS enrollment experienced  the same risk score growth due to diagnostic coding differences as  beneficiaries who were enrolled in Medicare FFS or MA the previous  year. However, enrollees who are new to the Medicare program tend to  be healthier than other beneficiaries and may have less contact with their  health plan physicians and less information in their medical records that  plans could use to adjust risk scores. Therefore, for this report, we  instead made the more conservative assumption that beneficiaries new to  Medicare and enrolled in MA did not have risk score growth that could be  affected by differences in coding practices between MA plans and  Medicare FFS. Second, we adjusted both our lower and higher  cumulative estimates to account for the effect of beneficiaries who died  after June 30, 2010, or otherwise left MA since 2010. For our January  2012 report, we did not make this adjustment. We determined this  adjustment was needed for the current report after observing that the  beneficiaries who left MA or died had, on average, a greater difference  between their actual and estimated disease scores than those  beneficiaries who remained in MA.", "To quantify the cumulative impact of both our and CMS\u2019s estimates of  coding differences on payments to MA plans, we estimated the risk score  growth attributable to coding differences, as described above. We then  used data on MA plan bids\u2014plans\u2019 proposed reimbursement rates for the  average beneficiary\u2014to calculate total risk-adjusted payments for each  MA plan before and after applying a coding adjustment. Finally, we  calculated the difference between the two payment amounts.", "We analyzed data from CMS on Medicare beneficiaries, including data  collected from Medicare providers and MA plans.

CMS is required  to continue adjusting risk scores for coding differences until the time it is  able to implement risk adjustment using MA diagnostic, cost, and use  data. Beginning with 2014, the diagnostic coding adjustments are subject  to a statutory minimum, which was recently amended by the American  Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

To convert the  cumulative impact of coding differences on 2010 MA risk scores into a  percentage, we divided by the average MA risk score in 2010. To  calculate the cumulative impact of coding differences on 2011 and 2012  MA risk scores, we used a similar methodology, except that we had to  estimate the risk score growth due to coding differences for 2010 to 2011  and 2011 to 2012.", "To estimate the risk score growth due to coding differences for 2010 to  2011 and 2011 to 2012, we used the estimates based on our 2010  retrospective cohorts for five time periods\u20142005 to 2006, 2006 to 2007,  2007 to 2008, 2008 to 2009, and 2009 to 2010\u2014and made two different  projection assumptions.

First, we altered our  methodology to make a more conservative assumption of the risk score  growth due to coding differences for beneficiaries that recently enrolled in  MA without any prior Medicare FFS enrollment. These beneficiaries are  new to the Medicare program and tend to be healthier than other  beneficiaries. Therefore, they may have less contact with their health plan  physicians and less information in their medical records that plans could  use to adjust risk scores. As a result, for MA beneficiaries that had a risk  score based on MA coding for the second year of the period but did not  have a risk score based on either MA or FFS coding for the first year of  the period, we altered our methodology to assume that these  beneficiaries had zero risk score growth due to coding differences during  the period.

We attributed these differences  to beneficiaries who were in our 2008 cohort but not our 2010 cohort as  having, on average, greater differences between their actual and  estimated disease scores than those beneficiaries who remained in MA. It  is possible this is due to sicker beneficiaries with greater coding  differences relative to Medicare FFS leaving the study cohort as they  aged, either because of death or to rejoin Medicare FFS. We expect that  beneficiaries who leave MA or die after 2010 would have a similar effect  on our 2011 and 2012 projections. To address this, we adjusted our  estimates of the impact of coding differences on the basis of the  magnitude of differences in the impact of coding differences for our 2008  and 2010 retrospective cohorts during each period. We applied these  adjustments relative to the projection year (i.e., half of the differences  between the 2008 and 2010 cohorts for periods 2005-2010 were applied  to 2006-2011 for our 2011 projection and the full difference between the  cohorts was applied to 2007-2012 for our 2012 projection)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Impact on Payments to MA Plans in 2010, 2011, and 2012", "paragraphs": ["To quantify the impact of both our and CMS\u2019s estimates of coding  differences on payments to MA plans in 2010, 2011, and 2012, we used  data on MA plan bids\u2014plans\u2019 proposed reimbursement rates for the  average beneficiary\u2014which are used to determine payments to MA plans  and information on MA plan enrollment. We analyzed monthly MA  enrollment for 2010 and 2011, and because enrollment data for 2012 was  incomplete, we used the annual trend for these 2 years in conjunction  with actual enrollment for the first 9 months of 2012 to estimate total 2012  MA enrollment. We used these data to calculate total risk-adjusted  payments for each MA plan before and after applying a coding  adjustment, and then used the differences between these payment levels  to estimate the percentage reduction in total projected payments to MA  plans resulting from adjustments for coding differences in 2010, 2011,  and 2012.associated with each adjustment to the estimated total payments to MA  plans\u2014$114.8 billion in 2010, $122.9 billion in 2011, and $133.5 billion in  2012\u2014and accounted for reduced Medicare Part B premium payments   Then we applied the percentage reduction in payments  received by CMS, which offset the reduction in MA payments (see   table 1).", "We analyzed data from CMS on Medicare beneficiaries, including data  collected from Medicare providers and MA plans. We assessed the  reliability of the CMS data we used by interviewing officials responsible  for using these data to determine MA payments, reviewing relevant  documentation, and examining the data for obvious errors. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  study."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Christine Brudevold, Assistant  Director; Alison Binkowski; William A.
