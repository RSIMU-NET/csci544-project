For example, they do not address geographic areas such as Syria and Libya, where DOD has begun military operations; DOD's deterrence and counterterrorism initiatives; or requests for OCO funding to support requirements not related to ongoing contingency operations. Further, the amount of OCO appropriations DOD considers as non-war increased from about 4 percent in fiscal year 2010 to 12 percent in fiscal year 2015. DOD officials agree that updated guidance is needed but note that the Office of Management and Budget has deferred the decision to update the criteria until a new administration is in place in 2017.

In May and July 2016, OMB and DOD officials said the estimate of enduring costs was between $20 billion and $30 billion\u2014as much as 46 percent of DOD's total OCO budget request for fiscal year 2017\u2014and indicated that DOD continues to evaluate and revise this estimate, which might be closer to the higher end of that range. GAO recommended in 2014 that DOD develop guidance for transitioning enduring costs funded by OCO appropriations to DOD's base budget. According to DOD officials, DOD has not finalized and reported its estimate of enduring costs because current statutory spending caps limit its ability to increase base budget funding.

DOD defines contingency operations as  small, medium, or large-scale military operations, including support for  peacekeeping operations, major humanitarian assistance efforts,  noncombatant evacuation operations, and international disaster relief  efforts. Since fiscal year 2010, DOD has submitted requests for both  base and OCO funding as part of its annual budget request to  Congress. While the OCO budget request has included amounts for  contingency operations primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan, more recently  the OCO budget request has included a number of other operations and  activities such as the European Reassurance Initiative, which is intended  to deter Russia and reassure U.S. allies and partners.", "In our body of work since 2007, we have reported on multiple issues  associated with OCO funds, including the level of transparency in DOD\u2019s  OCO funding requests, the accuracy and reliability of DOD\u2019s OCO cost  reporting, and efforts to transition enduring OCO costs to DOD\u2019s base  budget. For example, in November 2007, we found that changes in  DOD\u2019s then Global War on Terror (GWOT) funding guidance had resulted  in billions of dollars being added to GWOT funding requests for what  DOD called the \u201clonger war against terror,\u201d making it difficult to distinguish  between incremental costs to support specific contingency operations  and base costs. We recommended that DOD issue specific guidance  defining what constituted \u201cthe longer war against terror,\u201d identify what  costs were related to that category, and build such costs into the base  defense budget rather than into OCO. Responding to our  recommendations, OMB, in collaboration with DOD, issued criteria in  early 2009 to use as a guide for deciding whether funding properly  belongs in the base budget or in the budget for OCO requirements. In  March 2009, we found that limitations in DOD\u2019s approach for identifying  the costs associated with specific contingency operations may have  resulted in an overstatement of those costs and could have led to their  being included in DOD\u2019s contingency funding requests rather than in the  base budget. We recommended that DOD develop a plan and timetable  for evaluating whether expenses not directly attributable to specific  GWOT contingency operations were instead incremental costs that  should continue to be funded outside of the base budget. DOD partially  concurred with this recommendation and indicated that it collaborated  with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to refine the criteria  used for determining where costs would be categorized, either in base or  OCO budgets. The criteria were subsequently updated in September  2010, but they have not been updated since that time. In June 2014, we  found that U.S. Central Command primarily used OCO appropriations to  operate its headquarters, although some of the costs were determined to  be enduring and were expected to continue after the end of contingency  operations. We recommended that DOD develop guidance for  transitioning enduring costs funded with OCO appropriations to DOD\u2019s  base budget. DOD partially agreed, stating that while the timeline for  transitioning enduring costs to the base budget was critical, the process  could not be accomplished as a one-time event due to the evolution of  threats and the impact of budget laws.", "You asked us to examine several issues related to OCO funds. For this  report, we assessed (1) the extent to which the OMB\u2019s 2010 criteria  address the activities included in DOD\u2019s OCO budget request; and (2)  whether DOD has developed and reported an estimate of the costs being  funded with OCO appropriations that are likely to endure beyond current  contingency operations.

In building their budget requests the military services  and defense agencies use guidance issued by the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) as well as guidance issued within  their own organizations, including criteria for determining whether  requirements belong in the base or in the OCO budget requests.  Specifically, the military services and defense agencies use guidance in  the September 2007 Financial Management Regulation, DOD 7000.14-R,  volume 12, chapter 23, and OMB\u2019s September 2010 Criteria for  War/Overseas Contingency Operations Funding Requests for  determining whether requests for funding should be included in the base  or in the OCO funding requests.", "The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is responsible for  conducting and coordinating DOD\u2019s budget review activities, which  include preparation of annual budget request submissions.

The criteria were subsequently updated in  September 2010 to build on prior experience by clarifying language,  eliminating areas of confusion, and providing guidance for activities  previously unanticipated. OMB\u2019s criteria were issued when military  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were the principal contingency  operations supported by DOD. Since 2010 the scope of activities funded  through the OCO has evolved and, as a result, the criteria do not  specifically address activities included in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2017 OCO  budget request. Specifically, the criteria do not address operations in new  geographic areas such as Syria and Libya, the department\u2019s deterrence  and counterterrorism initiatives, or requests for OCO amounts to fund  base budget requirements, such as readiness.", "Operations in New Geographic Areas  Since the criteria were issued in 2010, DOD has begun military  operations in several countries, such as Syria and Libya, to fight the  spread of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Neither Syria nor  Libya is specifically included in the 2010 criteria as designated  geographic areas covered for purposes of OCO funding, although the  criteria allow for the addition of other areas on a case-by-case basis.  In October 2014, DOD designated military operations against ISIS as  Operation Inherent Resolve. As part of the operation, DOD has  conducted airstrikes against ISIS forces and provided training,  equipment, advice, and assistance to forces on the ground that are  partnered with the United States. For fiscal year 2017, DOD  requested $9.9 billion in OCO funds for Operation Inherent Resolve  and other related missions against ISIS. In August 2016, DOD began  Operation Odyssey Lightning, which includes precision airstrikes  against ISIS in Libya. For fiscal year 2017, DOD requested $20 million  for Operation Odyssey Lightning.

For example, DOD\u2019s  fiscal year 2017 OCO budget request seeks $3.4 billion for the  European Reassurance Initiative, intended to deter Russia and  reassure U.S. allies and partners, particularly within Central and  Eastern Europe. Specifically, the requested amount would enhance  training and exercises, support improvements to key infrastructure,  and fund three continuous brigade-sized rotations to train with allies.  In addition, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2017 OCO budget request includes $1  billion for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, intended to provide  direct counterterrorism support to partner nations and augment U.S.  capability to support partners in counterterrorism operations. As  described in appendix II to this report, the obligation of appropriations  for these initiatives was not included in required monthly reporting on  the costs of war.

DOD identified  activities supported by the $5.2 billion as including readiness,  readiness support requirements, increased counterterrorism activities  in Africa, and preferred munitions. These activities are not specifically  included in the OMB\u2019s 2010 OCO criteria. GAO has previously  reported that Congress made additional OCO funding available for  base programs and activities in fiscal years 2009 through 2016.

DOD is required  to report operations costs associated with specific contingency  operations. The reports, referred to as Cost of War Reports, are  produced monthly. Our analysis of past reports found that, while overall  OCO appropriations have been trending down since 2010, the proportion  of OCO appropriations not associated with specific operations identified in  the statutory Cost of War reporting requirement has trended upward over  the period. In fiscal year 2010, the Cost of War Report excluded about  $6.4 billion of OCO appropriations, or about 4 percent of the overall OCO  appropriation. By 2015, the amount excluded was about $7.4 billion, but  this represented 12 percent of DOD\u2019s OCO appropriations in fiscal year  2015.

Moreover,  activities such as deterrence and counterterrorism initiatives, which are  not directly related to ongoing military operations, are also being funded  with OCO amounts. Continued reliance on outdated criteria that do not  reflect the current policy for how OCO funds are to be used will only  further reduce budget clarity and erode the credibility of DOD\u2019s OCO  budget request.

The department commented that developing reliable  estimates of enduring OCO costs is an important first step to any future  effort to transition enduring OCO costs to the base budget and  commented that in the context of such an effort, it would consider  developing and reporting formal estimates of those costs. However, DOD  stated that until there is relief from the budgetary caps established by the  Budget Control Act of 2011, DOD will need OCO to finance  counterterrorism operations such as Operation Freedom Sentinel and  Operation Inherent Resolve. While DOD concurs that developing reliable  estimates of enduring OCO costs is an important first step in any future  effort to transition these costs to the base budget, DOD offered no plans  to take action to address this recommendation. We continue to believe  that developing and reporting formal estimates of enduring costs,  particularly costs that are not specifically addressed by OMB\u2019s 2010  criteria, such as OCO funding used to support base requirements, and  funding for the European Reassurance Initiative and Counterterrorism  Partnership Fund is important to provide Congress with a complete  picture of DOD\u2019s long term budget needs for use in future budget  formulation.

According to the Fiscal Year  2016 Instructions for Reporting on the Cost of War issued by the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Cost of War report is  intended to provide stakeholders, such as Congress, visibility into the  ways in which war-related OCO appropriations are obligated. DOD  produces the Cost of War reports to address a congressional requirement  to report on obligations and disbursements related to select operations  identified by Congress, such as Operation Freedom\u2019s Sentinel (primarily  in Afghanistan) and Operation Inherent Resolve (primarily in Iraq and  Syria). DOD also reports on additional operations based on annual  guidance from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  that instructs the components on which contingency operations they are  to report against. In addition to Operations Freedom\u2019s Sentinel and  Inherent Resolve, the instructions for fiscal year 2016 also included  Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, and post- Operation New Dawn Iraq activities. DOD reports on obligations  associated with these operations based on guidance within DOD  7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, volume 12, chapter 23,  (Sept. 2007) which generally defines what is considered a contingency  cost and establishes requirements for how the department is to report on  those costs.", "According to DOD\u2019s September 2015 Cost of War report , of the $1.56  trillion in OCO funds appropriated from fiscal years 2001 through 2015,  DOD considers about $1.41 trillion as war funds, with the remainder  deemed as either unrelated to ongoing contingency operations\u2014a  category that DOD refers to as \u201cnon-war\u201d\u2014or for classified purposes. For  fiscal years 2010 through 2015, DOD\u2019s Cost of War reports have included  data on about 94 percent of its OCO appropriations.", "In addition to obligations associated with OCO-designated appropriations,  the Cost of War report includes obligations of base funds if they are  considered to be war-related, as well as war-related obligations of funds  that are transferred into OCO accounts, according to DOD officials and  guidance. Obligations associated with non-war OCO appropriations are  not included in DOD\u2019s Cost of War reporting. For example, for fiscal year  2015, $7.4 billion in non-war OCO appropriations were not included in the  Cost of War reports. The appropriations excluded include the following: $5.1 billion in funds requested by DOD for base needs and provided  for in DOD\u2019s OCO appropriation, as well as other baseline programs  funded in OCO by Congress; $1.3 billion for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund; and $984 million for the European Reassurance Initiative.", "While obligations associated with these non-war appropriations are not  included in the Cost of War report, DOD does report these obligations in  response to congressional mandates and requests. For example, for  fiscal year 2015, DOD separately reported obligations associated with  about $3.3 billion in OCO appropriations\u2014including obligations  associated with the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, European  Reassurance Initiative, and military readiness funding included in DOD\u2019s  OCO appropriation. DOD did not separately report on obligations  associated with about $4.2 billion in OCO appropriations (see table 3).", "In addition, officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) said that DOD includes all OCO obligations in several  reports on budget execution, including DOD\u2019s internal reports, reports to  the OMB, and budget justification materials prepared for Congress. In our  August 2016 report on DOD\u2019s operation and maintenance appropriations  and September 2016 report on its bulk fuel spending, we found that DOD  reported a combination of base and OCO obligations in its budget  justification materials and execution reports, but did not separately report  its base and OCO obligations. We recommended that DOD separately  report base and OCO obligations in its budget justification materials and  execution reports or in another reporting mechanism. DOD did not concur  with the recommendations. In its comments on our reports, DOD stated  that many legacy financial systems currently cannot distinguish between  base and OCO obligations easily, though DOD would be able to  separately report base and OCO obligations across all appropriations  once all DOD components have converted from their legacy financial  systems.", "We have previously found DOD Cost of War data to be of limited  reliability and have made recommendations that DOD improve the  reliability of financial information in its Cost of War reports. While DOD  has taken steps to improve its cost of war reporting, challenges remain in  ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the reported costs. For example,  in June 2016, the DOD Inspector General found that the Air Force had  underreported $237.9 million in obligations associated with Operation  Inherent Resolve because the service did not have adequate controls  over the processing and reporting of its costs. The obligations  underreported included those associated with flying hours; command,  control, communications, computer, and intelligence; and general support  and administrative equipment. The DOD Inspector General  recommended that the Air Force develop and implement standard  operating procedures, including operation-specific guidance, to ensure  that personnel enter necessary costs into the system used to produce the  Cost of War report. The DOD Inspector General further recommended  that the Defense Financial Accounting Service and the Air Force update  business rules to ensure that Operation Inherent Resolve costs are  accurately reported. DOD concurred with these recommendations. In  October 2016, DOD officials stated that the Defense Financial Accounting  Service and the Air Force had taken steps to address these  recommendations. Specifically, DOD stated that formal documentation of  new standard operating procedures will be completed by January 2017,  and that the business rules for reporting the costs of Operation Inherent  Resolve have been updated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess the extent to which the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) 2010 criteria address the activities included in DOD\u2019s OCO budget  request, we discussed with each of the military services the processes  used for building their budget requests, including any guidance used in  determining what should be included in each respective OCO budget  request.
