The system is being developed incrementally over several years, with the first two pieces providing an initial set of functions and additional capabilities to be added in future increments. NARA plans to deploy full system functionality by 2012 at an estimated life-cycle cost of about $550 million. NARA originally planned to complete the first segment of ERA in September 2007. However, software and contracting problems led the agency and its contractor Lockheed Martin to revise the development approach. The revised plan called for parallel development of two different increments: a \"base\" ERA system with limited functionality and an Executive Office of the President (EOP) system to support the ingestion and search of records from the outgoing Bush Administration. GAO was asked to summarize NARA's progress in developing the ERA system and the ongoing risks the agency faces in completing it. In preparing this testimony, GAO relied on its prior work and conducted a preliminary review of NARA's fiscal year 2010 ERA expenditure plan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NARA has completed two of five planned increments of ERA, but has experienced schedule delays and cost overruns, and several functions planned for the system's initial release were deferred. Although NARA initially planned for the system to be capable of ingesting federal and presidential records in September 2007, the two system increments to support those records did not achieve initial operating capability until June 2008 and December 2008, respectively. In addition, NARA reportedly spent about $80 million on the base increment, compared to its planned cost of about $60 million. Finally, a number of functions originally planned for the base increment were deferred to later increments, including the ability to delete records and to ingest redacted records. In fiscal year 2010, NARA plans to complete the third increment, which is to include new systems for Congressional records and public access, and begin work on the fourth. GAO's previous work on ERA identified significant risks to the program and recommended actions to mitigate them. Specifically, GAO reported that NARA's plans for ERA lacked sufficient detail to, for example, clearly show what functions had been delivered to date or were to be included in future increments and at what cost. Second, NARA had been inconsistent in its use of earned value management (EVM), a project management approach that can provide objective reports of project status and early warning signs of cost and schedule overruns. Specifically, GAO found that NARA fully employed only 5 of 13 best practices for cost estimation that address EVM. Further, NARA lacked a contingency plan for ERA to ensure system continuity in the event that normal operations were disrupted. For example, NARA did not have a fully functional backup and restore process for the ERA system, a key component of contingency planning for system availability. To help mitigate these risks, GAO recommended that NARA: (1) include details in future ERA expenditure plans on the functions and costs of completed and planned increments; (2) strengthen its earned value management process following best practices; and (3) develop and implement a system contingency plan for ERA. NARA reported in its most recent expenditure plan that it had taken actions to address these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  National Archives\u2019 (NARA) Electronic Records Archive system  (ERA). Since 2001, NARA has been working to develop this system  which is intended to preserve and provide access to massive  volumes of all types and formats of electronic records by  automating NARA\u2019s records management and archiving life cycle.  The system is to consist of  infrastructure elements, such as hardware and operating systems;  \u25cf  business applications that will support the transfer, preservation,  dissemination, and management of all types of records and the  preservation of and online access to electronic records; and  \u25cf  a means for public access via the Internet.", "In view of its complexity, the system is being developed  incrementally over several years; the first two pieces (or  increments) of the ERA system provided an initial set of functions  for managing federal and presidential records. NARA plans to add  additional capabilities in future increments.", "As agreed, my testimony today will summarize NARA\u2019s progress in  developing the ERA system and the ongoing risks NARA faces in  successfully completing it. My comments today are based on our  prior work in this area, as well as a preliminary review of NARA\u2019s  fiscal year 2010 ERA expenditure plan. Our work was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis  for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The ability to find, organize, use, share, appropriately dispose of,  and save records\u2014the essence of records management\u2014is vital for  the effective functioning of the federal government. In the wake of  the transition from paper-based to electronic processes, records are  increasingly electronic, and the volumes of electronic records  produced by federal agencies are vast and rapidly growing,  providing challenges to NARA as the nation\u2019s recordkeeper and  archivist.", "Besides sheer volume, other factors contributing to the challenge of  electronic records include their complexity and their dependence on  software and hardware. Electronic records come in many forms:  text documents, e-mails, Web pages, digital images, videotapes,  maps, spreadsheets, presentations, audio files, charts, drawings,  databases, satellite imagery, geographic information systems, and  more. They may be complex digital objects that contain embedded  images (still and moving), drawings, sounds, hyperlinks, or  spreadsheets with computational formulas. Some portions of  electronic records, such as the content of dynamic Web pages, are  created on the fly from databases and exist only during the viewing  session. Others, such as e-mail, may contain multiple attachments,  and they may be threaded (that is, related e-mail messages are  linked into send\u2013reply chains).", "In addition, the computer operating systems and the hardware and  software that are used to create electronic documents can become  obsolete. If they do, they may leave behind records that cannot be  read without the original hardware and software. Further, the  storage media for these records are affected by both obsolescence  and decay. Media may be fragile, have limited shelf life, and become  obsolete in a few years. For example, few computers today have  disk drives that can read information stored on 8- or 5\u00bc-inch  diskettes, even if the diskettes themselves remain readable.", "Another challenge is the growth in electronic presidential records.  The Presidential Records Act gives the Archivist of the United  States responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of  presidential records upon the conclusion of a President\u2019s term of  office. The act states that the Archivist has an affirmative duty to  make such records available to the public as rapidly and completely  as possible consistent with the provisions of the act.", "In response to these widely recognized challenges, the Archives  began a research and development program to develop a modern  archive for electronic records. In 2001, NARA hired a contractor to  develop policies and plans to guide the overall acquisition of an  electronic records system. In December 2003, the agency released a  request for proposals for the design of ERA. In August 2004, NARA  awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts for the design phase  totaling about $20 million\u2014one to Harris Corporation and the other  to Lockheed Martin Corporation. On September 8, 2005, NARA  announced the selection of Lockheed Martin Corporation to build  the ERA system. The contract with Lockheed is a cost-plus-award- fee contract with a total value through 2012 of about $317 million.  As of April 2009, the life-cycle cost for ERA through March 2012 was  estimated at $551.4 million; the total life-cycle cost includes not only  the development contract costs, but also program management,  research and development, and program office support, among  other things. Through fiscal year 2008, NARA had spent about $237  million on ERA, including about $112 million in payments to  Lockheed Martin.", "The purpose of ERA is to ensure that the records of the federal  government are preserved for as long as needed, independent of the  original hardware or software that created them. ERA is to provide  the technology to ensure that NARA\u2019s electronic records holdings  can be widely accessed with the technology currently in use.", "The system is to enable the general public, federal agencies, and  NARA staff to search and access information about all types of  federal records, whether in NARA custody or not, as well as to  search for and access electronic records stored in the system. Using  various search engines, the system is to provide the ability to create  and execute searches, view search results, and select assets for  output or presentation.", "NARA currently plans to deliver ERA in five separate increments:  \u25cf  Increment 1, also known as the ERA base, included functions  focused on the transfer of electronic records into the system.  \u25cf  Increment 2 includes the Executive Office of the President (EOP)  system, which was designed to handle electronic records from the  White House at the end of the previous administration. The EOP  system uses an architecture based on a commercial off-the-shelf  product that supplies basic requirements, including rapid ingest of  records and immediate and flexible search of content. Increment 2  also includes basic case management for special access requests.  \u25cf  According to NARA\u2019s 2010 ERA expenditure plan, Increment 3 is to  include new Congressional and Public Access systems. It is also to  augment the base system with commercial off-the-shelf technology  to increase flexibility and scalability. NARA plans to complete this  increment by June 2010.  \u25cf  Increments 4 and 5 are to provide additional ERA functionality, such  as backup and restore functions and wider search capabilities, and  provide full system functionality by 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NARA Has Completed Two of Five ERA Increments, but Also Experienced Schedule Delays and Cost Overruns While Deferring Functionality", "paragraphs": ["NARA\u2019s progress in developing ERA includes achieving initial  operating capability for the first two of its five planned increments.  However this progress came after NARA had experienced  significant project delays and increased costs. NARA also deferred  functions planned for Increment 1 to later increments.", "As we reported in 2007, the initial operating capability for  Increment 1 was originally scheduled to be achieved by September  2007. However, the project experienced delays due to factors such  as low productivity of contractor software programmers, difficulties  in securing an acceptable contract to prepare the site that was to  house the system, and problems with software integration.  These  delays put NARA\u2019s initial plan to use ERA to receive the electronic  presidential records of the Bush Administration in January 2009 at  risk.", "In response, NARA and Lockheed Martin agreed to a revised  schedule and strategy that called for the concurrent development of  two separate systems, which could later be reintegrated into a single  system:  \u25cf  First, they agreed to continue development of the original system  but focused the first increment on the transfer of electronic records  into the system. Other initially planned capabilities were deferred to  later increments, including deleting records from storage, searching  item descriptions, and ingesting records redacted outside of the  system. NARA now refers to this as the \u201cbase\u201d ERA system. Initial  operating capability for this increment was delayed to June 2008.  \u25cf  Second, NARA conducted parallel development of a separate  increment dedicated initially to receiving electronic records from  the outgoing Bush Administration in January 2009. This system,  referred to as the Executive Office of the President (EOP) system,  uses a different architecture from that of the ERA base: it was built  on a commercial product that was to provide the basic requirements  for processing presidential electronic records, such as rapid  ingestion of records and the ability to search content. NARA  believed that if it could not ingest the Bush records in a way that  supported search and retrieval immediately after the transition, it  risked not being able to effectively respond to requests from  Congress, the new administration, and the courts for these  records\u2014a critical agency  mission.", "As we reported earlier this year, NARA certified that it achieved  initial operating capability for Increment 1 in June 2008, following  its revised plan. According to NARA\u2019s 2010 expenditure plan, this  increment cost $80.45 million to deliver, compared to a planned cost  of $60.62 million.", "NARA also reported that it completed Increment 2 on time in  December 2008 at a cost of $10.4 million (compared to a planned  cost of $11.1 million). However, it was not functioning as intended  because of delays in ingesting records into the system. Specifically,  before the transition, NARA had estimated that the Bush electronic  records would be fully ingested into EOP, where they would be  available for search and retrieval, by May 2009. However, as of April  27, only 2.3 terabytes of data were fully ingested into the EOP  system. This constituted about 3 percent of all Bush Administration  unclassified electronic records. NARA later estimated that ingest of  all 78.4 terabytes of unclassified records would not be complete  until October 2009. In its recently released 2010 expenditure plan,  NARA reported that the Bush records were fully ingested into EOP  by September 2009.", "NARA officials attributed EOP ingest delays, in part, to unexpected  difficulties. For example, according to NARA officials, once they  started using the EOP system, they discovered that records from  certain White House systems were not being extracted in the  expected format. As a result, the agency had to develop additional  software tools to facilitate the full extraction of data from White  House systems prior to ingest into EOP. In addition, in April 2009,  NARA discovered that 31 terabytes of priority data that had been  partially ingested between December 2008 and January 2009 were  neither complete nor accurate because they were taken from an  incomplete copy of the source system.", "Because the records had not been ingested into the EOP system,  NARA had to use other systems to respond to requests for  presidential records early in 2009. As of April 24, 2009, NARA had  received 43 special access requests for information on the Bush  Administration. Only one of these requests used EOP for search, and  no responsive records were found. To respond to 24 of these  requests, NARA used replicated systems based on the software and  related hardware used by the White House for records and image  management. NARA\u2019s current expenditure plan reports that after  completing ingest of the Bush electronic records in September 2009,  it retired the replicated systems.", "In fiscal 2010, NARA plans to complete Increment 3 and begin work  on Increment 4. According to its 2010 expenditure plan, Increment 3  will cost $42.2 million and be completed in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2010. It is to provide new systems for congressional  records and public access, as well as improvements to the existing  base system and the incorporation of several deferred functions,  such as the ability to delete records and search and view their  descriptions. Fiscal year 2010 work on Increment 4 is to consist  primarily of early planning, analysis, and design."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NARA Faces Several Significant Risks to the Successful Completion of ERA", "paragraphs": ["Despite the recent completion of the first two ERA increments,  NARA faces several risks that could limit its ability to successfully  complete the remaining three increments by 2012. These risks  include the lack of specific plans describing the functions to be  delivered in future increments, inconsistent application of earned  value management (a key management technique), and the lack of a  tested contingency plan for the ERA system.", "First, NARA\u2019s plans for ERA have lacked sufficient detail. For  several years, NARA\u2019s appropriations statute has required it to  submit an expenditure plan to congressional appropriations  committees before obligating multi-year funds for the ERA program,  and to, among other conditions, have the plan reviewed by GAO.  These plans are to include a sufficient level and scope of  information for Congress to understand what system capabilities  and benefits are to be delivered, by when and at what costs, and  what progress is being made against the commitments that were  made in prior expenditure plans. However, several of our reviews  have found that NARA\u2019s plans lacked sufficient detail. Most  recently, we reported in July that NARA\u2019s 2009 plan did not clearly  show what functions had been delivered to date or what functions  were to be included in future increments and at what cost.", "For example, the fiscal year 2009 plan did not specifically identify  the functions provided in the two completed increments. In  addition, while the plan discussed the functions deferred to later  increments, it did not specify the cost of adding those functions at a  later time. Additionally, NARA\u2019s 2009 plan lacked specifics about the  scope of improvements planned for Increment 3. For example, it  described one of the improvements as extend storage capacity but  did not specify the amount of extended storage to be provided. Also,  NARA\u2019s plan did not specify when these functions will be completed  or how much they would cost. NARA officials attributed the plan\u2019s  lack of specificity to ongoing negotiations with Lockheed Martin.", "Another risk is NARA\u2019s inconsistent use of earned value  management (EVM). NARA\u2019s 2009 expenditure plan stated that, in  managing ERA, the agency used EVM tools and required the same of  its contractors. EVM, if implemented appropriately, can provide  objective reports of project status, produce early warning signs of  impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and provide unbiased  estimates of a program\u2019s total costs. We recently published a set of  best practices on cost estimation that addresses the use of EVM.  Comparing NARA\u2019s EVM data to those practices, we determined  that NARA fully addressed only 5 of the 13 practices. For example,  we found weaknesses within the EVM performance reports,  including contractor reports of funds spent without work scheduled  or completed, and work completed and funds spent where no work  was planned. In addition, the program had not recently performed  an integrated cost-schedule risk analysis. This type of analysis  provides an estimate of the how much the program will cost upon  completion and can be compared to the estimate derived from EVM  data to determine if it is likely to be sound. NARA officials attributed  these weaknesses, in part, to documentation that did not accurately  reflect the program\u2019s current status.", "Another significant risk is the lack of a contingency plan for ERA.  Contingency planning is a critical component of information  protection. If normal operations are interrupted, network managers  must be able to detect, mitigate, and recover from service  disruptions while preserving access to vital information. Therefore,  a contingency plan details emergency response, backup operations,  and disaster recovery for information systems. Federal guidance  recommends 10 security control activities related to contingency  planning, including developing a formal contingency plan, training  employees on their contingency roles and responsibilities, and  identifying a geographically separate alternative processing site to  support critical business functions in the event of a system failure or  disruption.", "An internal NARA review found weaknesses in all 10 of the required  contingency planning control activities for ERA. As of April 2009,  NARA had plans to address each weakness, but had not yet  addressed 10 of the 11 weaknesses. In addition, NARA reported that  the backup and restore functions for the commercial off-the-shelf  archiving product used at the ERA facility in West Virginia tested  successfully, but there were concerns about the amount of time  required to execute the process. In lab tests, the restore process  took about 56 hours for 11 million files.  This is significant because,  while the backup is being performed, the replication of data must be  stopped; otherwise it could bring the system to a halt. Subsequently,  NARA officials stated that they have conducted two successful  backups, but the restore process had not been fully tested to ensure  that the combined backup and restore capability can be successfully  implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of GAO\u2019s Recommendations Could Reduce Risks", "paragraphs": ["To help mitigate the risks facing the ERA program, we previously  recommended that NARA, among other things:  include more details in future ERA expenditure plans on the  functions and costs of completed and planned increments;  \u25cf  strengthen its earned value management process following best  \u25cf  develop and implement a system contingency plan for ERA.", "In its 2010 expenditure plan, NARA reported that it had taken action  to address our recommendations. For example, NARA reported that  a test of the ERA contingency plan was completed on August 5,  2009, and the plan itself finalized on September 16, 2009. We have  not yet fully reviewed this plan or the results of the reported test.  However, if NARA fully implements our recommendations, we  believe the risks can be significantly reduced.", "In summary, despite earlier delays, NARA has made progress in  developing the ERA system, including the transfer of Bush  administration electronic records. However, future progress could  be at risk without more specific plans describing the functions to be  delivered and the cost of developing those functions, which is  critical for the effective monitoring of the cost, schedule, and  performance of the ERA system.  Similarly, inconsistent use of key  project management disciplines like earned value management  would limit NARA\u2019s ability to effectively manage this project and  accurately report on its progress.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony today.
