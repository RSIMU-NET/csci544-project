Since 2006, metal prices have risen to where the unit costs of a penny and nickel exceed their face value. The U.S. Mint was directed by statute to develop and evaluate the use of new metals that would reduce the costs of coin production while minimizing the impact on coin accepting equipment. Treasury is authorized to recommend coin changes to Congress based on the U.S. Mint's analysis and has not yet done so. GAO was asked to examine the U.S. Mint's efforts.", "This report examines (1) what is known about potential government savings from changes to the metal composition of coins; (2) what is known about potential industry costs from changes to the metal composition of coins; and (3) how potential coin composition options could affect government savings and industry costs. GAO reviewed legislative provisions and U.S. Mint estimates of government savings; compared the U.S. Mint's estimating process to best practices; and reviewed cost estimates from associations that represent selected businesses that submitted estimates to the U.S. Mint, such as the vending and laundry industries. GAO interviewed U.S. Mint officials and industry representatives to understand how their estimates were developed.", "GAO is not making recommendations in this report. In comments, the U.S. Mint questioned GAO's use of the Cost Guide to assess the U.S. Mint's estimates. GAO continues to believe it is appropriate to use the Cost Guide to assess the U.S. Mint's estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Mint estimated that the government could potentially save between $8 million and $39 million per year by changing the metal composition of the nickel, dime, and quarter. The estimated savings of $8 million would come from slightly changing the current metal in coins, which would decrease metal costs and retain the characteristics of existing coins. The savings of $39 million would come from changing the nickel and dime to a plated steel coin, which would change the coin's weight and other characteristics. While the U.S. Mint previously estimated potential savings of $83 million per year by changing the nickel, dime, and quarter to a plated steel-based coin, the U.S. Mint determined that it was not viable to change the quarter because less-valuable foreign coins would have similar characteristics to a steel quarter and could be used as counterfeit quarters. GAO found that the U.S. Mint's cost-estimating process does not fully align with best practices outlined in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide ( Cost Guide ) and as such may not result in precise estimates. For example, U.S. Mint officials discussed but did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\u2014a best practice\u2014 that would have allowed them to know how savings estimates could be affected by changes in metal prices. However, the U.S. Mint's estimates can provide insight into the general magnitude of potential savings.", "Associations representing selected industries that use coin acceptance machines estimated a cost impact ranging from $2.4 billion to $10 billion to modify an estimated 22-million coin machines, such as vending machines, to accommodate steel-based coins. According to these associations, these costs would be incurred because coin machines would require modifications to accept new coins while continuing to accept current coins. However, GAO found that these estimates may be overstated for several reasons. For example, the vending industry assumed 7-million vending machines would require modification, but a 2015 industry study estimated that there are 4.5-million vending machines in the United States. Second, the cost estimates assumed steel changes to all coins, but the U.S. Mint has determined it is not viable to change the quarter. Therefore, machines that only accept quarters (such as coin laundry machines) would not require modification. However, any change in coin composition that requires changes to coin acceptance machines will result in some industry costs.", "Although government savings and industry cost estimates may not be precise indicators of savings and costs, they nonetheless show that metal compositions that would increase government savings also increase industry costs. U.S. Mint estimates show that one change could result in no industry costs but show a savings of only $8 million annually. In contrast, changing the nickel and dime to multi-ply plated steel coins could save $39 million annually but result in substantial industry costs. The Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act of 2010 requires that any new coins work in existing machines that accept coins \u201cto the greatest extent practicable.\u201d U.S. Mint officials have not yet analyzed whether the options they are considering meet these criteria for making recommendations to Congress.

Coins play a major  role in commerce, as consumers use them daily to purchase food and  beverages from vending machines, wash clothes at coin-operated  laundries, and procure entertainment at amusement venues, among other  things. Since 2006, the prices of metals used in coins have risen so much  that the total production unit costs of the penny and nickel exceed their  face value resulting in financial losses to the U.S. Mint. The Coin  Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act of 2010 (the Act) directed  the Department of the Treasury to develop and evaluate the use of new  metallic materials in coins and make recommendations that would reduce  the costs of coin production.

We reviewed estimates of government savings  developed by the U.S. Mint and assessed how the U.S. Mint\u2019s estimating  process compared with best practices from the GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide (Cost Guide). We also reviewed a 2012 estimate of  government savings that was produced by a consulting firm\u2014Navigant  Consulting (Navigant)\u2014and commissioned by a supplier of coin material.  We reviewed estimates of potential industry costs from changes to the  metal composition of coins. These estimates were provided to the U.S.  Mint by industry associations that represent businesses with coin- accepting machines, such as the vending, amusement, and parking  industries. We interviewed; (1) U.S. Mint officials and Navigant  representatives to better understand how they developed their  government-savings estimates; (2) officials from the Royal Canadian Mint  and Royal Mint of the United Kingdom because those two entities have  changed the metal composition of their coins; and (3) the six selected  industry associations that developed cost estimates for the U.S. Mint. In  addition to these associations, we selected and contacted five other  industry organizations to understand technical aspects of coin acceptance  machinery used in the industry. We selected industries using a variety of  criteria, including industries that; (1) were specifically identified in the Act,  such as the vending and parking industries; (2) reported sizeable cost  impacts, such as the amusement park industry; and (3) rely on different  coin denominations, such as the armored car industry. The information  we received from interviews cannot be generalized to represent the views  of the entire universe of industries that use coins, but it provides insight  into how industries developed their estimates and how they could be  affected by a change in coin composition.

In 2012,  Concurrent Technologies Corporation, a contractor to the U.S. Mint,  estimated that there were from 355 billion to 370 billion coins in  circulation\u2014about two-thirds of them pennies. Many of these coins are  not in active circulation because people hold coins in storage containers  in their homes, automobiles, or office desk drawers, among other places.  However, coins in active use are accepted across the nation as payment  in hand-to-hand transactions and for products and services in millions of  machines ranging from vending and laundry to amusement and parking  machines. These automated, unattended machines validate U.S. coins  and their denominations by measuring one or more of the diameter,  thickness, weight, and electromagnetic signature (EMS) of each coin. In  addition to the four primary coins in circulation\u2014the penny, nickel, dime,  and quarter\u2014the 50-cent piece and 1-dollar coin are also considered  circulating coins.", "The Constitution gives Congress the power to coin money, and under this  authority, Congress has specified that the current metal composition of  coins be as follows:  the penny (1-cent) is made of copper-plated zinc and consists of 97.5  percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper,  the nickel (5-cent) is made with an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25  percent nickel (a combination known as \u201ccupronickel\u201d), and  the dime (10-cent) and the quarter (25-cent) consist of three layers of  metal. The inner layer is copper and the two identical outer layers are  a silver-colored alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. (A  multi-layer coin is called a \u201cclad coin.\u201d)", "The Federal Reserve determines the number of coins required to meet  the public\u2019s needs. Specifically, depository institutions (e.g., commercial  banks and credit unions) order new coins from the Federal Reserve  through an online coin-ordering system called FedLine. Then, the Federal  Reserve\u2019s Cash Product Office submits a new coin order to the U.S. Mint.  In turn, the U.S. Mint produces and distributes new coins each month to  the 12 Federal Reserve Banks that fulfill the orders made by the  depository institutions. In general, coin production varies from year to  year depending on several factors, such as public demand, the need to  replace mutilated or worn coins, and the price of copper, as well as orders  from the Federal Reserve to maintain its targeted inventory levels. The  U.S. Mint produced about 5-billion circulating coins in 2010 and about 13- billion circulating coins in 2014.", "When the cost to produce and distribute a coin is less than its face value,  the federal government experiences a financial gain, creating a value  known as \u201cseigniorage\u201d. In fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Mint realized about  $315 million in seigniorage from circulating coins. The quarter and dime  resulted in seigniorage of $406 million, whereas the nickel and penny  resulted in a loss of seigniorage in the amount of $91 million. Seigniorage  is returned to the Treasury General Fund and reduces government\u2019s  borrowing and interest cost, resulting in a financial benefit to the  government, whereas loss of seigniorage is absorbed as part of the U.S.  Mint\u2019s operating costs. Table 1 shows the amount of seigniorage from  fiscal year 2010 through 2014.", "The Act authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct research and  development on new metals for all circulating coins with the goal of  reducing production costs.

In identifying potential new materials for circulating coins,  the U.S. Mint needed to ensure that the material could be used as a  viable, durable coin. After testing 29 different metal compositions for  circulating coins, the U.S. Mint has identified four viable metal  compositions\u2014a new version of the current cupronickel (copper and  nickel), nickel-plated steel, multi-ply plated steel, and stainless steel.  The U.S. Mint plans to issue another report in December 2016. According  to U.S. Mint officials, the 2016 report will highlight areas of further study  as discussed in the 2014 Biennial Report to Congress. The areas of study  include further testing and evaluation of the new cupronickel alloy,  stainless steel research and development, improvements in production,  and outreach to the coin industry, among other things.", "Other countries have also taken steps to reduce metal composition of  coins to reduce costs. For example, the Royal Canadian Mint and the  Royal Mint of the United Kingdom have both changed the metal  composition of their coins from cupronickel to steel-based coinage in an  effort to reduce production costs. The Royal Canadian Mint  manufacturers its coins using a patented multi-ply plated steel  technology. The Royal Mint produces its coins using its own plated steel  technology known as aRMour\u00ae plating.", "A variety of businesses rely on coins. Some industries sell products or  services through the use of coin machines, such as vending and coin- operated laundry machines. According to the vending machine industry, it  generally sells products using modern, technologically advanced coin  machines that validate and accept many types of circulating coins as well  as dollar bills. Its members include well-known, large corporations. In  contrast, representatives from the coin-operated laundry industry stated  that the industry is comprised of small \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d business owners  and operators, provides services using mechanical technology, and  depends heavily on the quarter. Representatives from the amusement  industry also stated that their industry depends heavily on the quarter for  playing games, billiards, and juke-boxes. Businesses in the amusement  industry range from large national chains to small owners and operators.  Another type of industry that deals with coins is the armored car industry.  According to this industry, it sorts, counts, wraps, and transports all  denominations of circulating coins from Federal Reserve Banks to  commercial banks and other privately owned businesses. This industry is  dominated by four large armored car carriers.

The U.S.  Mint developed four alternatives for coin composition and estimated the  savings for each alternative (see fig. 1).", "The U.S. Mint\u2019s analysis shows that changing to a new version of a  copper and nickel combination (cupronickel) could potentially save the  government about $8 million per year, based on 2014 production costs,  and should not affect industry. This change is known as the \u201cseamless\u201d  alternative because it would not significantly change the characteristics of  the nickel, dime, or quarter. The savings would result from a change in  metal costs alone, specifically (1) increasing the amount of copper in the  nickel and the outer clad layer of the dime and the quarter from 75  percent to 77 percent and decreasing the amount of nickel, which is more  expensive, from 25 percent to 20 percent, and (2) adding manganese to  the coins. The seamless alternative is designed to have the same  diameter and EMS characteristics and nearly the same weight as the  current cupronickel composition. According to the U.S. Mint, this  alternative would not require any changes to coin acceptance machines  and would not affect industry. As of September 30, 2015, the U.S. Mint  was conducting further testing of another version of this alloy that  substitutes zinc or zinc and manganese for some of the nickel, to help  ensure that the alloy has the same characteristics as the current nickel  and would not require changes to coin acceptance machines.", "The U.S. Mint\u2019s analysis also shows that the largest savings the  government could potentially achieve is about $39 million per year by  changing the coin composition of the nickel and dime to multi-ply plated  steel. This type of change is referred to as a \u201cco-circulating\u201d alternative  because different types of coin compositions for the same coin  denomination would circulate together in the economy for 30 years or  more. Under this co-circulating alternative, savings would result from  both metal changes (as steel is less expensive than copper or nickel) and  production changes. According to U.S. Mint officials, their metal suppliers  would supply coin \u201cblanks\u201d for multi-ply plated steel coins, thereby  eliminating the need for the U.S. Mint to make its own blanks. Currently,  suppliers provide sheets of metal that the U.S. Mint uses to produce coin  blanks. A change to steel-based coins would require the coin industry to  make modifications to current coin acceptance machines to recognize  and accept both new and existing coins, because the new coins would  have a different weight and EMS than existing coins and would also be  magnetic.", "The U.S. Mint had originally included the quarter in its savings estimates  for a co-circulating coin change. When including the quarter, the U.S. Mint  had estimated that the government could save $83 million per year by  changing the quarter, nickel, and dime to multi-ply plated steel.", "In October 2015, U.S. Mint officials told us that they determined that  neither multi-ply plated steel nor the nickel-plated steel compositions were  viable for the quarter due to security concerns. Specifically, as the use  of steel coins has increased around the world, the U.S. Mint determined  that there is too great a risk that the size, weight, and EMS of any steel- based U.S. quarter may be close to that of a less valuable foreign coin.  According to Mint officials, this disparity may result in fraud because  machines would not be able to differentiate between the U.S. quarter and  lower-value foreign coins. According to U.S. Mint officials, it is viable to  change the nickel and dime to multi-ply plated steel because these coins  are lower in value and therefore do not provide a similar incentive to  counterfeiters.", "The Act provides the parameters that the U.S. Mint used to direct its  research and development and evaluate the impact to industry as it  developed estimates. For example, the Act limits the U.S. Mint to  considering metallic materials during its research and development for co- circulating alternative coinage. Specifically, the Act specifies that metallic  materials be tested for coinage, and this testing prevents the U.S. Mint  from considering less expensive materials and nonmetallic alloys that  could be suitably fabricated as coins and limits the co-circulating  alternatives. Additionally, the U.S. Mint did not include metallic changes to  the penny because the U.S. Mint could not identify a less expensive metal  for the penny. In its 2012 biennial report, the U.S. Mint reported that while  the penny costs more to produce than its face value, there is no viable  metal alternative that is cheaper than zinc. Representatives from a raw  material supplier, and consulting firm told us that they agreed with the  U.S. Mint\u2019s assessment. The Act also specified that any proposed  changes may not allow for greater risk of fraud from counterfeiting or  substituting cheaper foreign coins. Finally, according to U.S. Mint officials,  the Act\u2019s language on minimizing the effect on vending machines and  commercial coin processing equipment led the U.S. Mint to pursue  research on a seamless alternative as well as a co-circulating alternative.", "In addition, the U.S. Mint\u2019s analysis did not include information on how the  organization would transition from the current coin composition to a new  coin composition. For example, the U.S. Mint did not determine the  disposal costs of equipment that would no longer be used if coin  composition changed or consider potential changes to its workforce.  According to officials, the U.S. Mint has improved its internal processes  through a separate effort. Specifically, according to U.S. Mint officials, the  U.S. Mint reduced plant overhead by 7 percent and general and  administrative costs by 18 percent from between 2009 to 2014; reduced  employee shifts\u2014from 3 to 2 shifts per day\u2014at the two Mints that  produce circulating coins; and streamlined its die- manufacturing  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Mint\u2019s Cost- Estimating Process Does Not Fully Align with Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["Although these estimates can provide an understanding of the general  magnitude of potential government savings, our analysis found that the  U.S. Mint\u2019s cost-estimating process and resulting analyses are limited  because they did not fully align with best practices for estimating costs, as  outlined in the Cost Guide. Without following best practices, the U.S.  Mint\u2019s estimates may not be reliable.", "The Cost Guide includes a 12-step process to develop a reliable cost  estimate. These best practices are the basis for developing high-quality,  reliable cost estimates and help ensure that the cost estimates are  comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. For example,  following these practices should result in cost estimates that can, among  other things, be replicated and updated. According to the Cost Guide,  these best practices can guide government managers as they assess the  credibility of a cost estimate for decision-making purposes for a range of  programs. Of the 12 steps in the Cost Guide, our analysis found that the  U.S. Mint\u2019s cost-estimating processes fully met 1, partially met 7,  minimally met 3, and did not meet 1 of these 12 steps. More detailed  information describing how the U.S. Mint\u2019s cost estimating process  aligned with the Cost Guide can be found in appendix II. In summary:", "Fully met: The U.S. Mint fully met one step. This step was to brief its  management as part of its review process and obtain and document  management\u2019s approval of the estimate.", "Partially met: The U.S. Mint partially met 7 steps of the cost- estimating process. These steps generally occurred during the cost  assessment portion of the cost-estimating process. To its credit, the  U.S. Mint partially met the steps of (1) defining the estimate\u2019s  purpose, (2) developing the estimating plan using technical staff, (3)  defining the program characteristics, (4) determining the estimating  structure from the cost of raw materials to overhead, (5) obtaining the  data from the U.S. Mint\u2019s cost-accounting system, (6) developing the  point estimate and comparing it to an independent cost estimate, and  (7) updating the estimate. For example, the U.S. Mint partially met  defining the purpose of the savings estimate because the U.S. Mint  defined the scope of the estimate but did not fully consider all costs.  Specifically, the U.S. Mint did not include about $5.7 million in one- time expenses to conduct research, development, and testing of  viable metals and did not consider expenses to dispose of equipment  that may no longer be needed if a decision is made to produce steel- based coins.", "Minimally met: The U.S. Mint minimally met 3 steps that generally  occurred during the analysis of the cost-estimating process. These  steps include (1) conducting a sensitivity analysis, (2) documenting  the estimate, and (3) identifying ground rules and assumptions. While  U.S. Mint officials discussed a sensitivity analysis, it was not  conducted. Without a fully documented sensitivity analysis, the U.S.  Mint cannot determine how a change in inputs\u2014such as the price of  metal\u2014would affect the potential for savings because the cost of  metal is an important factor in the U.S. Mint\u2019s overall costs to produce  coins. Also, when documenting estimates, the U.S. Mint used 2014  metal prices to determine its estimates. However, metal prices change  over time. For example, from 2011 to 2015, the price of copper  ranged from $2.24 per pound to $4.58 per pound. Such a change in  metal prices impacts the U.S. Mint\u2019s costs and therefore can  significantly impact its savings estimates. Finally, certain assumptions  were not made or documented since the U.S. Mint\u2019s savings estimate  did not project savings into the future, but rather all analyses were  based on one year.", "Not met: The U.S. Mint did not meet the step that required it to  conduct a cost-risk and uncertainty analysis. These analyses examine  a broad range of factors, such as unforeseen technical problems or  changes in staff availability and expertise, that could possibly occur  and would affect the estimate.", "The U.S. Mint\u2019s cost-estimating process did not fully align with the best  practices described in the Cost Guide and therefore the estimates may  not be reliable as a precise indication of government savings. However,  the efforts taken by the U.S. Mint nonetheless provide an understanding  of the general magnitude of government savings. We discuss later in this  report how the magnitude of estimated government savings compares to  the magnitude of estimated industry costs to illustrate the scale and  relationship between estimates of government savings and industry costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Estimates of Government Savings Are Narrow in Scope", "paragraphs": ["Our review of other estimates of potential government savings found  these estimates to be narrow in scope. For example, a 2012 Navigant  study that was commissioned by a supplier of coin material estimated that  the U.S. government could achieve savings of up to $207.5 million per  year by changing the current coin compositions of the nickel, dime, and  quarter to multi-ply plated steel, which is the same composition used in  Canadian coins. However, by design, the estimate is not comprehensive  because it does not account for other costs associated with making this  change such as production, processing, transportation, and new  equipment costs as well as licensing fees to use multi-ply plated steel  technologies. In addition, this study was limited in scope because it was  not designed to be a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of government  savings and industry costs. Generally, according to guidance from the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), changes in federal programs  should be informed by an assessment of whether the benefits exceed the  costs. Navigant determined how the use of multi-ply plated steel that is  used by the Royal Canadian Mint could be applied to U.S. government  coins to potentially achieve raw material savings. Navigant did not make  comparisons to other seamless or other co-circulating metal-composition  options and did not consider how a statutory requirement, such as  minimizing industry conversion costs, might be applied.", "Another 2012 Navigant study explored potential government savings by  eliminating the penny but did not consider how a change in metal  composition other than multi-ply plated steel for the other coins could be  made to reduce costs and achieve savings.

Industry associations  developed these cost estimates and provided them to the U.S. Mint in  response to an April 2014 Federal Register notice. The U.S. Mint  reprinted the estimates in its December 2014 Biennial Report to  Congress.", "The cost estimates in table 2 presuppose a metal change from  cupronickel to steel for the nickel, dime, and quarter as well as the need  to accept both current and new coins co-circulating together. These  estimates reflect a level of uncertainty about the dimensions (diameter  and thickness) and other technical specifications of any new coins. For  example, the vending industry estimated a cost impact of at least $700  million\u2014a cost of at least $100 per machine\u2014to update the software in 7- million modern, electronic coin machines to accept new metallic coins  with different EMSs. The vending industry representative we interviewed  said the low estimate assumes little or no changes to the dimensions of  new coins, and therefore costs for mechanical hardware changes are not  estimated, but presumed are changes in the EMS or weight due to a  metal change. Two of the six industry associations we contacted, as well  as a coin machine manufacturer and the contractor for the U.S. Mint, told  us that software modification costs are primarily driven by labor costs to  update software, not the software cost itself. That is, businesses would  have to hire a certified technician to update the software on every  electronic coin machine in order for that machine to accept any new coins  that do not have the same properties as the current coins that would  remain in circulation. These representatives stated that updates would  typically take less than an hour and each service call would cost up to  $100. The vending industry\u2019s high cost estimate of $3.5 billion reflects  changes to coin dimensions as well as EMS specifications. According to a  vending industry representative, changes in coin dimensions would  require the vending industry to update the software as well as remove the  hardware associated with coins within the vending machine and replace it  with redesigned and expanded hardware in order to accept both current  and new coins with different dimensions.", "The situation for the amusement industry is similar to that of the vending  industry. The amusement industry estimated costs ranging from $100  million to $500 million depending on the need to either update the  software on the estimated 1-million amusement machines, or remove and  replace their coin machines with new machines designed to accept both  current and new coins with different dimensions, which would be more  costly.

Industry costs to modify machines are proportional to the  number of coin machines needing modifications. As the number of  coin machines decreases, these costs would also decrease. Two  examples illustrate that the number of coin machines may be  overstated. First, the vending association reported in its 2014 written  response to the U.S. Mint that there were about 7-million food,  beverage, and product vending machines in the United States.  However, a 2015 study developed by the vending association, in  partnership with a food research and consulting firm, reported that  there are now 4.5-million vending machines\u2014a decrease of about 36  percent. A lower actual number of vending machines would translate  to a decrease in estimated cost from $700 million to about $450  million\u2014assuming the cost of $100 per machine. Second, in a 2014  written response to the U.S. Mint, the amusement park industry  association\u2014whose members include family entertainment centers  and arcades, among others\u2014stated that there are about 10-million  coin-operated machines in the United States and that changes in the  metallic content of coins would result in a cost impact ranging from $1  billion to $5 billion. However, our review found the its cost estimate  may have double-counted coin machines from the larger amusement  sector, which also represents family entertainment centers and  arcades. The industry did not provide enough detail to determine the  scope and breadth of its coin machine estimate.", "The parking industry is shifting from coin-operated to coinless parking  meters. According to a parking industry representative, the number of  parking meters is decreasing due to a trend from single-space, coin- operated, parking meters to multi-space, smart meters that allow  payment by credit card or phone. Because of the many benefits  associated with smart meters, the representative believes that within  15 years, nearly all parking meters will no longer accept coins.  However, the parking industry estimated its costs by estimating that 2-  million parking meters would need to be updated to accept new coins.  According to a parking industry representative, this information was  based on data collected from an informal phone survey in 2007 and  does not reflect industry changes since then.", "According to U.S. Mint officials, they did not independently verify industry  cost estimates to help ensure that they are reliable.

However, after the United Kingdom had  completed its transition to steel coins, studies showed that actual  conversion costs were about \u00a317 million (about $26 million), or about 58  percent less than estimated.

However, coin machines for some industries,  such as the vending industry, would require a one-time update to accept  these new nickels and dimes because the properties of these coins would  change. Industry costs are unknown for this option because industry  estimates reflect the cost to change all coin acceptance machines for all  denominations. Under this option, there may be significant costs for those  industries that accept the nickel and the dime (about $1.1 billion to about  $4.1 billion for the vending, parking, and armored car as shown in table  2).

The U.S. Mint also  stated that manufacturing coinage is covered under the Statement of  Federal Financial Accounting Standard 4 (SFFAS 4), which the U.S. Mint  used in developing its cost estimates.  While we agree that there is no  requirement for agencies to use the Cost Guide, the guide consists of  best practices that can guide government managers as they assess the  credibility of a cost estimate. In addition, SFFAS 4 primarily refers to  fundamental elements of managerial cost accounting rather than cost  analysis and estimating.  In our view, the Cost Guide is the most  appropriate criteria to assess the reliability of cost estimates. The Cost  Guide includes best practices, from the private and public sectors, in cost  estimating for capital assets. A coin is produced using capital equipment  and is a physical asset.

These  estimates identified savings by coin denomination (nickel, dime, and  quarter) and by alternative metals (cupronickel and steel-based  alternatives) when compared to fiscal year 2014 actual costs. We also  reviewed the Concurrent Technologies Corporation study on alternative  metals conducted under contract with the U.S. Mint. We interviewed U.S.  Mint officials to understand (a) the rationale for not considering metal  alternatives to the penny; (b) the purpose, data sources, methodology,  and assumptions used in developing savings estimates; and (c) the  process followed in developing these costs estimates. We compared the  U.S. Mint\u2019s cost-estimating process with best practices.

We analyzed the extent to  which the cost-estimating process used by the U.S. Mint to develop these  cost and savings estimates followed the 12-step process described in  cost estimating best practices\u2014and assigned each step with a rating of  not met, minimally met, partially met, substantially met, or fully met. We  also held detailed discussions with U.S. Mint officials and reviewed their  documentation to identify key factors that could affect the potential costs  and savings such as changes in coin production or workforce and  operational changes that may not have been included directly in the  estimates.
