To address perceived  weaknesses within the MHS and leverage advances in civilian business  practices, the Department of Defense (DOD) initiated the Report on  Military Health System Modernization (the Study) in 2013. Its two main  goals were to achieve cost savings within the MHS and increase the  readiness of the medical force to support military operations. The Study  recommended a number of interim goals, metrics, and changes to MHS  business practices, but highlighted the need for further analysis of these  issues, making a number of recommendations along those lines. It also  recommended some immediate changes, including changes in  capabilities to 10 of the 24 military hospitals with low numbers of patients,  such as closing inpatient facilities in whole or part for 8 hospitals. The  Study estimated that all of these recommended changes could save $366  million annually. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness accepted changes for 8 of the 10 hospitals, and the military  services made further modifications to the recommendations.", "Subsequent to DOD initiating the Study, Section 713 of the National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015 included a  provision for DOD to submit the Study to the congressional defense  committees and also listed nine elements, some with multiple items, to be  incorporated as part of the report. In addition, the NDAA included a  provision for us to review the Study with regard to its methodology and  the data used to support it. DOD provided the Study to the congressional  defense committees in February 2016. We assessed the extent to which  the Study (1) addressed each of the nine elements included in the NDAA;  (2) followed an approach that is consistent with relevant generally  accepted research standards; and (3) utilized key practices for cost  savings estimates.", "To address our first objective, we compared Part III of DOD\u2019s submission  to Congress, the data appendix, with the nine elements listed in the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015. In evaluating the data appendix, we  considered an element \u201caddressed\u201d if it included all of the items listed in  the NDAA; \u201cpartially addressed\u201d if it included some, but not all, of the  items; and \u201cnot addressed\u201d if it did not include any of the items within the  element. We discussed the data appendix and our preliminary  observations based on our analyses with officials from the Study team  within the Defense Health Agency.", "To address our second objective, we compared the Study with selected  generally accepted research standards relevant to the Study, such as the  need for clearly stated objectives, reasonable assumptions, and efforts to  assess and address data reliability. These standards were developed by  reviewing research literature and DOD guidance and identifying  frequently occurring, generally accepted research standards that are  relevant for defense studies, and were initially used in a prior review of a  DOD study on mobility capabilities. We determined that these standards  are still current and relevant for the purposes of this report. We selected  those standards that were most relevant to the Study, in particular those  standards related to the \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d of a defense study. For  further information on the development and application of these generally  accepted research standards, see appendix I. We also interviewed  officials from each of the Study\u2019s working groups within the Defense  Health Agency and representatives of each of the military services  concerning their analytical and decision-making process. To assess  DOD\u2019s efforts to address data reliability, we compared the Study with  selected principles from the standards that, among other things, state that  it is good practice for a study to describe how researchers determined the  data used were valid and reliable for a study\u2019s purposes and to state and  adequately explain the limitations, if any, of the data used to support it. To  conduct this comparison, we (1) reviewed the Study for passages in  which data reliability is discussed; (2) utilized a structured data-collection  instrument to query Study officials regarding their efforts to assess the  reliability of data used in the Study; and (3) systematically searched and  reviewed work papers provided by the Study team to identify descriptions  of how study-team members gathered and assessed the reliability of the  data used in their analyses. We did not independently assess the  reliability of the source data that DOD used in developing the Study.  Rather, as part of our examination of the Study\u2019s adherence to the  relevant generally accepted standards for defense research, we asked  DOD officials what steps they took to assess the reliability of the data  used in developing their respective sections of the final report, and we  reviewed supporting documentation provided by the officials to identify  any known data reliability issues.", "To address our third objective, we compared the 2016 Study\u2019s cost  savings estimates for the changes to 10 military hospitals recommended  in the Study and the related achievement of the Study\u2019s goals for  transferring health care to DOD\u2019s own facilities and increasing active-duty  provider productivity with key practices we derived from cost-estimating,  budgeting, and related guidance.

Officials were organized  into four working groups that collectively made up the Study team. Study  officials told us that the majority of the Study\u2019s work was completed in  early 2013, but DOD did not finalize the Study until early 2015, and it did  not submit the Study to the congressional defense committees until  February 2016. The Study included eight recommendations for further  study and analysis in a wide range of areas, such as defining medical  force readiness. The areas addressed in the Study included the following:", "Medical Readiness Personnel Requirements: The Study team sought  to determine the number of active-duty uniformed medical personnel  needed to support military operations.", "Health Care Demand: The Study team analyzed the demand for  health care in geographical medical markets both within DOD\u2019s direct  care system of hospitals and clinics and from its purchased care  network of private providers. The Study developed goals for the  transfer of health care from the private sector to DOD\u2019s own facilities  both to increase the efficiency of its spending by making better use of  active-duty providers and to provide sufficient workload for them to  maintain their skills.", "Provider Currency Requirements: The Study team sought to develop  a metric to assess the currency of medical personnel\u2014that is, an  assessment of the maintenance of clinical skills. Currency, in turn,  supports the readiness of medical personnel, meaning their ability to  provide medical support during operations. However, the Study team  was unable to agree upon a clinical currency measure, and instead  adopted a productivity metric as a proxy for currency. The productivity  metric aims to measure active-duty providers\u2019 workload level  measured in Relative Value Units, a measure of health care  production. The accompanying goal is for active-duty specialist  providers to achieve 40 percent of the median productivity of  specialist private-sector providers as defined by a major medical  survey.", "Provider Allocation Model: The Study team developed a model that  matched uniformed active-duty medical providers with demand for  health care within geographic medical markets, with the assumption  that the aforementioned goals for the transfer of health care from the  purchased network of private providers to DOD\u2019s facilities and  increasing the productivity of active-duty providers will be achieved.  This process was intended to demonstrate over- or undersupply of  providers in certain specialties. The analysis found that for some  specialties, there was insufficient demand or other constraining  factors that prevented the matching of all providers to markets. For  example, based on the Study\u2019s assumptions regarding the transfer of  health care to DOD facilities and increasing active-duty provider  productivity, 32 orthopedic surgeons could not be matched to medical  markets, based on 2013 data.", "Primary-Care Analysis: The Study examined the ratio of enrolled  beneficiaries to primary-care providers, and found that the MHS was  close to its goal of 1,100 enrollees per primary-care provider.", "Overseas Hospital Analysis: Due to a variety of cultural, logistical, and  readiness concerns, the Study recommended no change to overseas  military hospitals. Officials told us that this was the primary issue of  contention within DOD due to concerns surrounding the potential  need for these facilities in support of operations.", "The Study also included a facility analysis of 24 small hospitals within the  MHS to determine their future medical capabilities, such as whether they  should continue to have inpatient facilities or birthing centers. The Study  recommended changes for 10 of the 24 hospitals, including closing  inpatient services at 8 of them. The Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness approved proposed changes for 8 of the 10  facilities.", "The Study estimated annual net cost savings of $366 million in fiscal year  2012 dollars for the recommended changes to the 10 affected hospitals  and for achieving its goals for transferring health care to DOD facilities  and increasing active-duty provider productivity. This estimated cost  savings included about $132 million of savings associated with reductions  in civilian Full Time Equivalents (FTE), $333 million of savings associated  with decreased purchased care costs, and $98 million in increased  nonlabor costs. Prior to the release of DOD\u2019s report to Congress, the  Navy completed changes to two of the hospitals and retained, though  reduced, inpatient services at the third.

For example, the Study partially addressed the element concerning the  impact of recommended changes to military treatment facilities on the  access of eligible beneficiaries to high-quality health care, and  satisfaction with such care. While the Study listed the criteria by which  DOD evaluated the impact of recommended changes on beneficiaries\u2019  access to high-quality health care and satisfaction with such care, it did  not provide further details on the results of its evaluation.

To estimate the size of the operational force, the Study presented the  sum total of the services\u2019 individual estimates of their needs. These  estimates are produced by service-specific models and planning tools  that examine a common set of defense planning scenarios. However, the  Study highlighted differences in approach between the services. For  example, the Army chose to use its own estimating tool because the Joint  Medical Planning Tool was not accredited at the time of the Study. In  contrast, the Navy chose to use an early, unaccredited version of the  Joint Medical Planning Tool. Similarly, while the Army used the Joint  Integrated Contingency Model to develop its casualty estimates, which  are an input into the various planning tools, the Navy used four separate  models, including two prototypes. The Air Force does not use casualty  estimates, but rather an estimate of the number of likely evacuees from  theater. The Study noted that a separate independent analysis conducted  by the Joint Staff correlated with the services\u2019 estimates for the  operational force. In addition, Study team officials stated that the services\u2019  processes for developing their \u201cgenerating\u201d and \u201cinstitutional\u201d forces,  which include personnel responsible for issues such as graduate medical  education and headquarters staff functions, were not shared with the  Study team. Previous reviews of the necessary size of the medical force  have highlighted the differences between analyses based on service- generated estimates and analyses based on DOD-wide estimates.  Specifically, during the 1990s, two analyses based on DOD-wide  estimates found the services had excess medical personnel relative to  their needs, while one analysis based on service-generated estimates  found the services needed nearly all of their medical personnel to meet  their needs.", "Generally accepted research standards state that limitations and  constraints, which are generally found in studies, should be identified and  reasonably mitigated. While the Study clearly outlined the limitations of  its service-oriented approach, the Study did not fully mitigate them, such  as by explaining how these limitations affected the results of the analysis.  Officials with the working group that addressed readiness requirements  stated that their methodology was limited by the time available for  analysis. Specifically, the officials stated that they knew they would be  unable, in the time allowed, to conduct a full, independent analysis of the  number of active-duty medical personnel necessary to support  contingency operations, and that they therefore relied upon estimates  from the military services. Officials stated that it would be feasible to  conduct an independent analysis of the required number of active-duty  medical personnel if there were greater information sharing from the  services and more time to complete such an analysis. While we recognize  the time constraints faced by the Study team, addressing these issues  would provide more meaningful results as DOD considers further  changes to the MHS. Absent such efforts to address these limitations,  DOD will not have a full assessment of its medical workforce needs.", "In addition, the Study\u2019s Charter included a goal to determine civilian  personnel levels, but the Study did not include such an assessment in its  scope. Civilians represent a significant proportion of the MHS workforce.  For example, in 2015, civilians represented 61 percent of the Army\u2019s  medical positions. Civilian personnel levels also have a direct effect on  active-duty personnel levels, and DOD policy requires the services and  defense agencies to determine the appropriate mix of manpower (military  and civilian) and private-sector support. DOD\u2019s Medical Readiness  Review, an outgrowth of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, found  that efficiencies could be made by converting military billets to civilian  positions, although a prohibition on such conversions was later put in  place.

Currency, in turn, supports the readiness of  medical personnel, meaning their ability to provide medical support during  operations. The Study stated that the Study team attempted to identify an  industry standard for clinical currency, but none existed. In addition, a  Study official stated that the working group had a limited time frame to  complete its work. The Study team instead adopted a productivity metric  as a proxy for currency, along with an accompanying goal for active-duty  specialist providers to achieve 40 percent of the median productivity of  private-sector specialist providers as defined by a major medical survey.", "However, some Study team officials expressed doubts concerning the  accuracy of provider productivity data used to develop the proxy measure  for clinical currency. Specifically, officials stated that they believe that the  MHS as a whole does not accurately record Relative Value Units,  meaning that the MHS does not accurately record providers\u2019 workload.  Further, a senior Study team official stated the military services and  individual military treatment facilities differ in how they record this  information, and, due to these differences, the Study team adjusted the  Relative Value Unit figures for a number of hospitals, sometimes with a  margin of error of up to 50 percent. Generally accepted research  standards state that limitations and constraints should be identified and  reasonably mitigated.

The Study recommended the  establishment of associated goals, and DOD adopted such goals in  March 2014. However, this approach was not consistent with the  generally accepted research standard that assumptions should be  reasonable. Specifically, the Study\u2019s assumptions regarding its goals for  transfer of health care to DOD\u2019s facilities and increasing active-duty  provider productivity are unsupported because DOD has not developed  an accompanying strategy describing how these goals can be achieved.", "Our prior work has identified six selected leading practices of effective  federal strategic planning, which we derived in part from the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA), as updated by the GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010, associated guidance, and our prior work.  Specifically, these leading practices are to: (1) define the mission and  goals, (2) define strategies that address management challenges and  identify resources needed to achieve goals, (3) ensure leadership  involvement and accountability, (4) involve stakeholders, (5) coordinate  with other federal agencies, and (6) develop and use performance  measures. Study team officials told us that, notwithstanding the absence  of a strategy, transfer of health care to DOD facilities is a priority and that  such goals were modest and achievable. However, the Study set out  goals for transferring health care into its own facilities for large groups of  beneficiaries, such as TRICARE for Life beneficiaries, for whom, unlike  active-duty military and their families, the MHS has few tools to  encourage their use of military treatment facilities.", "In addition, transfer of health care into DOD facilities has been an MHS  goal for several years, but limited progress has been made. For example,  the Congressional Budget Office reported in 2014 that most of the  growth in outpatient utilization of health care services within the MHS has  occurred within the purchased care system, while military hospitals and  clinics have maintained a relatively constant workload since 2005.  Similarly, it is uncertain that DOD can achieve its related productivity  goals without an accurate means for measuring providers\u2019 workload, as  discussed earlier. Without a strategy that incorporates leading practices, it  remains unclear whether or how DOD can achieve its goals to transfer  health care from the purchased care network into its own network of  facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Study\u2019s Provider Allocation Model Did Not Reflect Differences among the Military Services", "paragraphs": ["The Study included a provider allocation model that identified the medical  specialties needed with anticipated health care demand within specific  geographic medical markets. The model\u2019s results highlighted specialties  for which the MHS has too many medical specialists relative to  anticipated market demand for various health care services and other  specialties for which the MHS has too few physicians to accommodate  market demand. Generally accepted research standards state that  models should, among other things, represent a reasonably complete  range of conditions and be appropriate for the intended purpose.  However, an important aspect of the provider model did not reflect the  standards in that it unreasonably assumed that medical providers from  the different services were interchangeable. Specifically, the Study\u2019s  model for allocation of specialist physicians based on anticipated health  care demand in geographic markets did not account for the military- service ownership of the relevant hospitals and the physicians\u2019 military  service. Instead, it matched the number of physicians across all services  within a given specialty, such as orthopedic surgery, to anticipated health  care demand in geographic markets, regardless of the service ownership  of the medical treatment facility in that market. While such arrangements  do exist in \u201cmultiservice markets,\u201d such as the National Capital Region  and San Antonio, they are less common elsewhere. The model could  potentially provide results that do not reflect MHS business practices in  the real world. For example, it could suggest that there are sufficient  physicians to provide a given type of specialty care to a particular  geographic medical market, when in reality there are not sufficient  physicians from that medical market\u2019s primary military service to assign.  Currently, active-duty providers generally practice within their own  services\u2019 hospitals in a team context unique to their military service. The  Study emphasized the view that it is important for physicians to practice  medicine within this team context of other specialists and nurses from the  same service, which can be seen within the services\u2019 different  configurations of medical personnel in a deployed setting.", "CNA independently assessed one part of DOD\u2019s model. However, its  assessment included only the mechanics of the model and not an  examination of the supporting data used in the model. The Study stated  that the Study team relied on military-service representatives to verify  these data. In addition, CNA noted that alternative approaches could yield  different results depending on assumptions concerning transfer of health  care to DOD facilities and increased active-duty provider productivity. The  Study asserted that its modeling results were reasonable given the time  constraints of the Study. The Study recommended further work to refine  and formalize the model and use it to inform decisions concerning the  delivery of health care services. However, unless DOD addresses  differences between the services and the effects of the model\u2019s practical  application, the model\u2019s usefulness will be limited and could lead to  impractical decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Study Did Not Describe Steps Taken to Ensure the Reliability of the Data Supporting Its Analyses and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["The Study and the data appendix did not describe steps that the Study  team took to ensure that the data used to support the Study and data  appendix were sufficiently reliable for the Study\u2019s purposes.

In addition, documenting a study\u2019s  analytical and decision-making process helps to ensure the accuracy,  completeness, and credibility of study results. However, we found that the  study presented limited information on its efforts to assess data reliability.  For example, the Study\u2019s data appendix did not document the source of  its data in several instances. Specifically, the data source is provided for 9  of 15 data metrics, but not for the other 6 metrics.", "Because the Study presented limited information on the Study team\u2019s  efforts to assess the reliability of the data used, we provided each working  group\u2019s lead official with a standard set of questions concerning their  efforts to ensure data reliability. Specifically, we asked the working group  leads which data sources they used in their respective analyses. Their  responses indicated that they used five databases and one data set that  were not mentioned in the main body of the Study or the data appendix.  We questioned the working group leads concerning steps taken to ensure  data reliability, such as whether they consulted with the source or owner  of the data to determine what methods were used to ensure reliability or  whether they took other steps to ensure reliability, such as conducting  their own assessment or reliance on existing assessments. Working  group officials stated that they generally relied on the reliability processes  of the owners of the data to ensure the data provided were reliable. For  example, two of the working groups stated that they used databases that  are commonly used within the MHS, and that these databases are subject  to oversight reviews and periodic validity checks. An official from one  working group stated that the group also conducted reviews of relevant  data to check for completeness of records related to inpatient care and  found missing data. The working group developed adjustment factors and  applied them by market and provider specialty to impute missing data  where possible. An official from another working group stated that the  group used data provided by contractors, and that DOD\u2019s subject-matter  experts routinely discuss report content with the contractors as a way to  verify the validity and reliability of the data provided as part of the  performance assessment of the contract. In addition, we interviewed  service officials regarding the accuracy and reliability of the data used in  the Study, and officials from the Navy disputed the accuracy of the  Study\u2019s reported physician productivity data. Army officials stated that  they had some differences in data interpretation based on their own  analysis, which led them to some different recommendations.", "When asked if there were any limitations on the use of specific data  sources, working group officials reported to us some limitations that were  not specifically described in the main body of the Study or data appendix.  For example, one working group official mentioned that military treatment  facility bed counts and ambulatory surgery counts were not consistently  reported, though officials stated that these data did not appear to have a  significant effect on the group\u2019s findings. Another limitation concerned the  consistency of data from the Medical Expense and Performance  Reporting System affecting the assessment of a primary-care provider\u2019s  availability. An official noted that as a result of this limitation, the final  analysis of primary-care capacity was curtailed and specific  recommendations were limited.", "A systematic review of over 300 supporting work papers provided to us by  Study officials found multiple examples of known data or analysis  limitations that, if the Study was adhering to generally accepted research  standards, would have been conveyed in the Study. For example, one of  the work papers noted data reliability issues with certain overseas-related  data which were not noted in the report. One work paper noted some  limitations in a data source used in the study that were not discussed in  the report, and another work paper mentioned having to manually adjust  some data metrics, which was not noted in the Study. Conveying data or  analysis limitations is important so that decision makers relying on the  Study can fully understand the quality and soundness of the research.

For example,  DOD included estimated savings from three categories\u2014reductions in  civilian personnel, net decreases in purchased care, and net increases in  nonlabor costs\u2014and listed general sources of potential savings.  However, the Study did not fully reflect key practices we derived from  cost-estimating, budgeting, and related guidance.

In addition, of the total estimated  savings, $333 million was associated with changes that were based on an  assumption concerning DOD\u2019s ability to achieve its goals related to  transfer of health care to DOD facilities and increased active-duty  provider productivity without stating a strategy to reach those targets.  Absent a clear and likely achievable strategy, the predicted cost savings  associated with transfer of health care to DOD facilities and increasing  active-duty provider productivity are questionable.", "Second, the Study\u2019s predicted net savings estimate did not include all  potentially significant costs.

However,  we have previously reported that DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce civilian  FTEs do not always result in planned decreased costs of a  proportionate magnitude to the decrease in FTEs. For example, in  2016, we found that across DOD, from fiscal years 2012 through  2016, civilian FTEs declined by 3.3 percent, but civilian personnel  costs declined by only 0.9 percent, adjusted for inflation.", "Onetime costs to realign active-duty providers to other hospitals: The  Study recommended changes that would realign active-duty providers  to other facilities. However, movement of these providers, the  associated active-duty medical professionals with whom they work in  a team setting, and their families will incur costs such as permanent  change of station expenditures. Study officials told us that they did not  include these costs because permanent change of station costs vary  widely and final decisions concerning where personnel would be  relocated rest with the military services. We previously reported on the  costs of permanent change of station moves and found that these  moves, on average, cost about $6,700 per servicemember in 2014.", "Construction costs, if applicable, at facilities losing or gaining active- duty providers: The Study recommended that a number of inpatient  facilities be closed or converted to ambulatory surgery centers, but  our analysis found that the Study did not identify estimated costs  associated with these changes. Construction costs also may be  applicable at facilities gaining active-duty providers, but Study officials  stated that execution of such changes would be the responsibility of  the services.
