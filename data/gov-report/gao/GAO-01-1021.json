Although coca cultivation estimates have fallen by about two-thirds in Bolivia and Peru since 1996, increases in coca cultivation in Colombia have offset much of these successes. Under State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the Office of Aviation, through a contract with DynCorp Aerospace Technology, supports foreign governments' efforts to locate and eradicate illicit drug crops in the Andean region. In recent years, DynCorp has maintained and operated aircraft to locate and eradicate drug crops in Colombia, trained pilots and mechanics for the Colombian Army Aviation Brigade, and provided logistical and training support for the aerial eradication programs of the Colombian National Police and manual eradication programs in Bolivia and Peru. The Office of Aviation met both State's overall contracting oversight requirements and more specific oversight and evaluation requirements in the DynCorp contract. Office of Aviation officials interacted daily with DynCorp managers at the main operating base and in each country, made regular site visits to each country, and reviewed DynCorp's internal reports. The Office of Aviation ensured that its aviation program operated safely and was physically secure, but it can do more. The Office relied on monthly reports and the trimester performance evaluations, as well as periodic surveys and independent assessments of DynCorp's operations and facilities.

Insurgent and paramilitary groups have increased their drug-trafficking activities, severely complicating U.S. and Colombian efforts to reduce illicit drug cultivation and production. For example, the insurgents exercise some degree of control over 40 percent of Colombia\u2019s territory east and south of the Andes where, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most of the new coca cultivation sites and most of the major drug production facilities are located.", "As a result, the aerial eradication missions are dangerous; and as a normal course, helicopter gunships and search and rescue aircraft accompany the eradication aircraft. Eradication planes and the supporting helicopters are often shot at.

State requires the Office of Aviation to examine contractor performance to ensure compliance with the contract and coordinate with the contractor on all matters that may arise in the administration of the contract. The contract includes State\u2019s oversight requirements and also establishes DynCorp\u2019s performance-based award fee plan, which requires the Office of Aviation to evaluate contractor performance every 4 months to determine DynCorp\u2019s monetary award.", "Under the terms of the contract, DynCorp is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable and allowable costs incurred and an award fee\u2014which averaged about $410,000 each trimester between June 1999 and January 2001\u2014based on the Office of Aviation\u2019s evaluation of DynCorp\u2019s performance. The contract establishes four evaluation categories\u2014 management, technical proficiency, safety, and cost\u2014and four performance assessment levels\u2014outstanding, excellent, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. Each assessment level corresponds to a range of percentages of the additional compensation that could be granted to DynCorp. For example, if the Office of Aviation rates DynCorp\u2019s overall performance in the evaluation categories as outstanding, the Office would award a minimum of 95 percent of the award fee. An excellent rating would be 75 to 94 percent of the award fee.

At the headquarters office in Bogota, Colombia, for example, we observed a senior Office of Aviation official conferring with DynCorp\u2019s operations manager about the flight schedule of the C-27 cargo plane; frequent telephone communication among Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials about operational matters, such as the delivery of needed supplies or the availability of pilots and mechanics at specific locations; and discussions about a program to verify the amount of coca eradicated. Further, during our visits to Larandia and Tolemaida, DynCorp managers made frequent contacts with their Office of Aviation counterparts concerning the status of planned security upgrades and training for the Colombian Army Aviation Brigade, respectively.", "Senior Office of Aviation officials told us that they held regular meetings at the main operating base with DynCorp managers to discuss program objectives and provide guidance on operational plans and procedures. Several DynCorp employees stated that the regular meetings have improved the program\u2019s operations. The DynCorp maintenance manager in Colombia told us that Office of Aviation officials have incorporated his expertise when drafting or revising standard operating procedures on issues relevant to his duties. Furthermore, a manager\u2019s meeting in April 2001 addressed the delay in shipping special tools to the DynCorp maintenance manager in Tolemaida. To solve the problem, DynCorp is now assessing the status of requests and reviewing the procedures for ordering tools.", "Senior Office of Aviation officials also made frequent visits to Colombia to oversee DynCorp operations. The operations officer made seven visits from June 1999 to March 2001. On several of his visits in 2000, he provided guidance to help establish the aviation support for the Colombian Army\u2019s Aviation Brigade. He stated that he regularly accompanies the contractors on eradication missions to provide guidance. The Office of Aviation Director and other senior officials told us they made numerous trips to overseas locations, primarily Colombia, during the same period to confer with DynCorp managers and other Office of Aviation officials and provide technical assistance.", "Office of Aviation officials regularly reviewed DynCorp\u2019s reports, including monthly reports from DynCorp\u2019s in-country managers summarizing the contractor\u2019s performance. These reports are based on daily and weekly reports submitted by managers from each forward operating location. The Office of Aviation also regularly received daily and weekly reports on the flight status of all aircraft and copies of all contractor memorandums dealing with safety. The senior Office of Aviation official in Colombia told us he viewed the contractor\u2019s input as critical for his monthly evaluation of contractor performance.", "Although the Office of Aviation and DynCorp interacted regularly, several Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials told us that a high turnover of DynCorp managers in Colombia over the past 2 years had led to frequent misunderstandings between the main operating base in Florida and operational sites in Colombia. We were told about several instances when managers in Colombia communicated directly with the main operating base, bypassing DynCorp managers in Bogota. In late 2000, the Office of Aviation encouraged DynCorp to promote a pilot to operations manager in Bogota and, after a new country manager was hired, provided oral and written guidance clarifying the chain of command. A number of Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials told us that these changes had alleviated tension that had been building between the Office of Aviation and DynCorp and greatly improved the overall morale of personnel in the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Every month, senior Office of Aviation officials in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru submit a report to the main operating base in Florida evaluating DynCorp\u2019s performance using the evaluation categories\u2014management, technical proficiency, safety, and cost. The Office of Aviation Deputy Director consolidates the country reports and an evaluation of contractor performance at the main operating base into an overall monthly evaluation. The consolidated report is used to evaluate DynCorp\u2019s performance and help make the trimester award fee determination.", "We reviewed the monthly and consolidated reports prepared from June 1999 through January 2001. We noted that the trimester performance evaluations encouraged DynCorp to correct deficiencies. For example: In August and September 1999, the senior Office of Aviation official in Peru rated DynCorp\u2019s performance in quality control (a measure within the technical proficiency category) as unsatisfactory\u2014the lowest of four ratings. He determined that poor quality control resulted in unnecessary downtime for one of the aviation program\u2019s cargo planes and that the downtime affected daily operations. These evaluations were incorporated into the September 1999 trimester evaluation, lowering Peru\u2019s technical proficiency and overall ratings from the previous trimester evaluation. In October and November 1999, Peru\u2019s quality control ratings improved, and in January 2000 a joint review by Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials also noted improvements in Peru\u2019s quality control program. The January 2000 trimester evaluation showed Peru\u2019s quality control as excellent\u2014the second highest of the four ratings.", "In the May 2000 trimester performance evaluation, the Office of Aviation lowered DynCorp\u2019s safety rating to satisfactory following a March 2000 internal safety survey that was highly critical of the Colombian program. Office of Aviation officials noted that most deficiencies resulted from an unqualified safety manager at one operating location. In response, DynCorp hired a new safety manager, who began conducting regular audits and inspections of each operating location in Colombia. The September 2000 trimester evaluation showed that DynCorp had addressed the shortcomings identified in the internal safety survey.", "In the January 2000 trimester performance evaluation, the Office of Aviation rated Bolivia\u2019s material support as unsatisfactory. The monthly reports leading to the evaluation cited lengthy delays in receiving spare parts and chemicals for a corrosion control program. Following the poor trimester rating, DynCorp improved the timeliness of its shipments and received an excellent rating in the April 2000 monthly report and the subsequent trimester evaluation in May 2000.", "In our review of the monthly and consolidated reports, we noted that DynCorp did not meet aspects of an evaluation category but received a high evaluation overall. Office of Aviation officials told us that in assessing DynCorp\u2019s overall performance, the evaluation system permits them to consider mitigating circumstances and other information not specifically in the formal assessment. We found this to be the case with the contract\u2019s technical proficiency category, which is based, in part, on the time aircraft cannot fly due to (1) maintenance deficiencies or (2) needed supplies were not available. During the majority of the period we examined (June 1999 through January 2001), DynCorp met the maintenance and supply rates. However, during two periods when DynCorp did not meet the contract\u2019s rates, it was rated satisfactory or better for these two subcategories.", "During July through September 1999, more aircraft flying hours were lost due to maintenance problems than the contract allowed. Office of Aviation officials determined that this loss was beyond DynCorp\u2019s control because an unusually high number of aircraft engine changes were needed.", "During August through December 2000, more aircraft flying hours were lost than allowed by the contract because DynCorp did not have needed supplies. Office of Aviation officials considered the situation beyond DynCorp\u2019s control because it was the Office\u2019s responsibility to provide the needed helicopter mast assemblies. Further, Office officials said that DynCorp did well to come as close as it did to this measure given the lack of mast assemblies.", "Although we are satisfied that the Office of Aviation considered each country\u2019s reports in preparing the consolidated reports, during July 1999 to May 2000, portions of the Bolivian Office of Aviation senior official\u2019s reports were not included. The current Office of Aviation officials in Bolivia and at the main operating base in Florida told us that the Office of Aviation official in Bolivia at the time sometimes provided information that was irrelevant to contractor performance. As a result, senior Office of Aviation officials at the main operating base often revised or excluded parts of the reports. For example, the official in Bolivia repeatedly reported that several training documents needed to be translated into Spanish, although translation was not part of the contract with DynCorp. In other instances, the official in Bolivia evaluated Office of Aviation performance rather than contractor performance\u2014in more than half the affected reports, the official reported that the Office of Aviation did not provide needed supplies or guidance on the Bolivian nationalization program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Office of Aviation Ensured Safe Operations but Needs to Address Certain Safety and Security Concerns", "paragraphs": ["To oversee and evaluate the safety of contractor operations and physical security of the aviation program\u2019s facilities, Office of Aviation officials relied on daily interaction with DynCorp\u2019s country managers and forward operating location managers, frequent site visits, periodic reports as part of the trimester performance evaluation, and internal and external reviews.

The manager said he used a safety checklist based on U.S. government and aircraft manufacturers\u2019 requirements when inspecting contractor operations and maintenance. He said that he monitored the main operating base on a daily basis and made periodic trips to overseas locations to monitor the safety of operations and maintenance. His trip reports identified safety issues that needed to be resolved and progress made in implementing previously identified safety concerns.", "The safety manager also coordinated with the DynCorp staff responsible for maintaining safe aircraft operations.

According to Office of Aviation officials, these surveys are intended to provide a stringent on-site safety assessment. The most recent survey for Colombia, completed in March 2000, concluded that DynCorp needed to devote more attention to safety. As previously noted, DynCorp hired a new safety manager who began conducting regular audits and inspections of each operating location in Colombia. In addition, DynCorp made other safety improvements, including establishing safety classes for pilots and instituting an airfield cleanup campaign.", "In August 2000, the Office of Aviation requested an independent evaluation of aviation operations and safety by the Inter-Agency Committee for Aviation Policy (ICAP). In November 2000, ICAP conducted a review of the Office of Aviation\u2019s operations at two forward operating locations and the headquarters office in Colombia and at the main operating base in Florida. In February 2001, ICAP issued its report. ICAP concluded that the aviation program in Colombia and at Patrick Air Force Base was safe but made approximately 80 suggestions and recommendations to enhance safety and security.", "Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials have taken action on or implemented most of ICAP\u2019s suggestions and recommendations. For instance:   To improve their document control process, Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials told us they clarified the procedures for seeking comments on and approving changes to operating procedures and other directives.", "To improve maintenance oversight, DynCorp hired additional quality control staff to fill this role.", "To correct deficiencies identified at fuel stations at forward operating locations, DynCorp hired a fuel management specialist who has ensured that the deficiencies were corrected.", "In some instances, Office of Aviation officials disagreed with ICAP\u2019s suggestions and recommendations. Among others, we noted the following: ICAP recommended that search and rescue helicopters accompany eradication aircraft on night operations. The Office of Aviation Director and Deputy Director said that eradication planes are much less likely to be shot down during night operations than in the daylight because the planes cannot be easily seen. Deploying helicopters nearby would serve to alert drug traffickers to the impending arrival of eradication aircraft and increase the likelihood that the traffickers could shoot them down. Further, deploying many aircraft during night operations increases the likelihood of aircraft accidents.", "ICAP recommended that the Office of Aviation update manuals to reflect modifications that were made to certain eradication aircraft. Office of Aviation officials noted that the aircraft in question were originally used 40 years ago as unarmed observation planes by the U.S. military. Later, the U.S. military added armaments and tested and documented their effect on the airplane\u2019s performance. According to the Office of Aviation Director, the aviation program\u2019s modifications have less effect on the aircraft\u2019s performance than the U.S. military\u2019s modifications. He said that as a result the manuals reflect a worse case than necessary and the aircraft does not need additional testing. In addition, such testing would be very expensive.", "In other instances, Office of Aviation and DynCorp officials agreed with ICAP\u2019s suggestions or recommendations but have not yet corrected the problem.", "ICAP recommended that the aviation program provide emergency vehicles at its forward operating locations to assist in the event its aircraft have an accident during takeoff or landing. Office of Aviation officials said that they have asked the Department of Defense to identify any excess emergency vehicles in its inventory. The Office of Aviation was also searching for used emergency vehicles because new emergency vehicles are very expensive.", "ICAP pointed out that the aviation program needed to improve its management information system. Office of Aviation officials said they are implementing a new, integrated management information system and obtaining a satellite communications system to improve communication between remote locations. They said they expect to have both systems in place by November 2001.", "ICAP found that certification and training records for maintenance personnel were often not readily available or were dated.

In May 2001, the forward operating location in use at Larandia still needed security improvements and, according to RSO officials, was especially vulnerable to sabotage. Specifically, a public road runs within a few feet of and parallel to a runway used for aerial eradication missions. On weekends the road carries considerable civilian traffic. The only physical security is a chain-link fence and a partially completed barrier. We observed that the public road had only minimal security with a checkpoint at the base entrance and an unmanned bunker near the airfield. RSO and other security reports have recommended additional security measures, such as adding a second checkpoint and erecting a solid barrier between the road and the airfield.", "Further, both RSO and ICAP have concluded that the headquarters office and hangar at the Bogota airport are not secure. The ICAP report identified this location as being especially vulnerable. During several weeks in April and May 2001, we observed that only one guard was at the entrance at any given time, and the office had no x-ray or bomb-detection equipment to inspect packages. Further, the office and hangar are on a public road adjacent to a commercial shipping business. Each day, we observed a large volume of vehicles entering the area and parking near the aviation program\u2019s office. Both RSO and ICAP recommended that State find a more secure facility.", "Office of Aviation and Bureau officials agreed with the physical security assessments and recommendations and said upgrades in security should be completed in the next few months.
