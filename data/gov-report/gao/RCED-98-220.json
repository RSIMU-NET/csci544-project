One measurement for drinking water quality is its turbidity, which is the amount of suspended sediment in the water. Suspended sediment levels fluctuate with time and can change dramatically during a single day and within a short distance.", "In February 1996, western Oregon experienced its worst storm since December 1964. Prior to the storm, large amounts of precipitation during the fall and early winter months of 1995 and 1996 had saturated the soil in the Cascade and Coast mountain ranges and in the valley areas. During January 1996, heavy snow had accumulated in the mountains, followed by freezing temperatures. The storm arrived with warmer temperatures and heavy rainfall\u20148 to nearly 15 inches in 4 days in many locations. The warm rain on top of the snow (rain-on-snow), saturated soil, and frozen ground produced rapid snowmelt and runoff, resulting in severe flooding and erosion. Water quality during the storm was severely degraded as the turbidity increased dramatically.", "Because of the increased turbidity, the municipal water treatment system serving Salem, Oregon, was shut down for 8 days, threatening the city\u2019s ability to provide its residents with safe drinking water. Other cities in western Oregon\u2019s Willamette and Lower Columbia river basins\u2014including Cottage Grove, Eugene, Portland, and Sandy\u2014also reported high turbidity levels at the locations (intakes) where water flows into their water treatment systems. After the storm, Salem and certain environmental groups raised concerns about the extent to which the timber harvests and related roads on the lands managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) contributed to the increased turbidity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Government Is a Major Landowner in Western Oregon", "paragraphs": ["The federal government owns nearly 40 percent of the more than 15 million acres of land in western Oregon, most of which are managed by the Forest Service and BLM.

Because of wet weather conditions and other factors, many of the rocks and soils within these mountain ranges have undergone physical changes that leave them unstable and subject to erosion. In addition, prior natural disturbances, such as windstorms and fires, leave the soil in the forests subject to erosion by destroying the trees and vegetation that holds soil on hillsides.", "Although the baseline rates at which erosion should naturally occur in large watersheds have not been identified for periods of accelerated sediment production during large storms, studies have shown that erosion increases in the presence of large, infrequent storms, and, from evidence in the forests, it appears that this process has occurred for centuries. In normal years, the first one or two large storms of the winter season transport much of the sediment that flows from a watershed during the entire year. However, when the rainy season is punctuated by a rare, large-scale storm, such as the ones in December 1964 and February 1996, a large amount of precipitation is delivered in a short period of time.

Scientific studies have shown that this harvesting method, which removes all of the trees from a timber-harvesting site at one time, can contribute sediment to streams, especially during large storms. (See the bibliography for the scientific studies we reviewed on the impact of past timber-harvesting practices on water quality.)", "These studies have also shown that other past timber-harvesting practices can contribute to sedimentation during large storms. For example, ground-based logging practices, including the use of heavy equipment such as tractors to haul logs along trails to landings where they are loaded onto trucks, compact the soil and create ruts. Rain falling on these areas tends to run off the surface, following the ruts, allowing sediment to flow more easily into streams. Similarly, using fire to clear harvested areas of all vegetation before reforestation (broadcast burning) can destroy protective layers of organic debris and expose soil to the erosive impact of rain. Finally, vegetation along streams and large, woody debris in streams\u2014both of which can trap and filter sediment\u2014were often removed during timber harvesting. Without the vegetation and debris, water velocity increases, allowing streams to (1) carry more sediment and (2) cut more into stream banks, eroding them and transporting the sediment downstream."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Timber-Related Road Construction", "paragraphs": ["Harvesting timber has often required the construction of numerous miles of roads to move heavy equipment into the harvest areas and up and down hillsides.

Erosion from roads has been found to be a major contributor of sediment to riparian areas and streams.", "Initially, the easiest timber to reach was along streams, so streamside roads were constructed in these areas, primarily on private industrial lands. However, the increased demand for timber from federal lands to meet post-World War II housing construction needs and to replace the supply of timber from depleted industrial lands, resulted in roads being constructed on steep slopes on federal lands.", "Road construction on federal lands continued rapidly between 1950 and 1970. These roads were constructed using a \u201csidecast construction\u201d design in which excavated soil was used to build much of the roadbed along a hillside. Roadside ditches were constructed to move water quickly from roadbeds into nearby streams, thereby reducing the damaging effects of the water to the roadbeds. Stream crossings consisted of culverts to pass water beneath the road.", "By the time of the December 1964 storm, which was similar in magnitude to the one that occurred in February 1996, road location, sidecast road construction, and culverts had been recognized as major contributors to sediment delivery to streams during large storms for a number of reasons. First, sidecast construction on hillsides had resulted in unstable roadbeds that were unconsolidated, not part of the natural slope of the hill, and subject to erosion and failure. Second, roadside ditches transported eroded topsoil from the roadbeds and hillsides and delivered it quickly into streams and rivers. And, finally, culverts became blocked, resulting in water flowing across the roadbeds and contributing to their erosion and failure.", "A Forest Service report prepared after the December 1964 storm concluded, among other things, that (1) road damage could have been avoided entirely or greatly reduced by better road location or design to cope with site conditions; (2) in some cases, the primary criterion for road location was apparently the \u201cshortest distance from clearcut to clearcut;\u201d (3) some of the most impressive storm damage was caused by sidecast road construction on steep slopes; and (4) the failure or impairment of drainage structures (i.e., ditches and culverts) was involved in almost all road-related storm damage.", "More recently, BLM has identified roads as a contributor to increased streamflows and sedimentation in some watersheds. For instance, in an analysis of the lower McKenzie River watershed\u2014an area of mostly nonfederal ownership and mixed uses\u2014BLM found that (1) some of the primary causes of increased peak and total water flows were an increase in compacted areas from roads, forest and agricultural activities, man-made structures, and other human development and an extension of the stream network resulting from the direct routing of water from roads to streams and (2) elevated sediment levels in a portion of the watershed were in part explained by the large number of hillside roads, many of which lacked proper drainage and roadside vegetation. BLM estimated that streamside roads contribute more than twice as much sediment per mile than other forest roads. (See the bibliography for the scientific studies we reviewed on the impact of forest roads on water quality.)", "During the 1970s and 1980s, the Forest Service and BLM made concerted efforts to reduce road failures through improved location, design, and maintenance. However, by then, the main road networks had been nearly completed, and only small secondary roads were required to obtain access to new timber harvest areas. Thus, the national forests and BLM lands contain a mixture of roads\u2014of different ages and construction designs\u2014that vary in their potential to deliver eroded soil to streams during large storms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agricultural, Industrial, Urban, and Residential Development Can Increase Turbidity", "paragraphs": ["Two of the watersheds\u2014those serving Eugene and Salem\u2014have agricultural, industrial, urban, and residential development.

This growth in population has resulted in soil that is compacted, paved, covered, or cleared of most vegetation.", "For example, since the 1940s, residential development and related roads have nearly doubled in some watersheds. Development has increased the percentage of the basin covered by roofs, roads, parking lots, compacted areas, and other surfaces that prevent rain from penetrating into the soil. During storms, this increased runoff moves across barren or disturbed soil, eroding the soil, which can then be transported into streams. In addition, construction activities can contribute sediment to streams. For instance, without proper controls at construction sites, sediment loads can reach 35 to 45 tons per acre per year.", "Interstate highways, state and county roads, and other types of roads also contribute sediment to streams during large storms. According to information provided by two groups sponsored by the state of Oregon\u2014the Willamette River Basin Task Force and the Willamette Valley Livability Forum\u2014the basin\u2019s roads (paved and unpaved, urban and rural) total over 46,500 miles\u2014about enough to circle the earth twice. Both the North Santiam River watershed serving Salem and the McKenzie River watershed serving Eugene have highways that parallel the rivers upstream from the locations where water flows into the cities\u2019 water treatment systems. Like those constructed to harvest timber, these streamside roads increase the likelihood that sediment will be delivered directly into streams during large storms.", "Increased populations in the Willamette and Lower Columbia river basins have also resulted in the construction of a large number of streambank stabilization projects to protect property from flooding. Nearly half of the original primary and secondary river channels in the Willamette River basin have been eliminated by channel straightening and other activities, and one-quarter of the remaining channel banks have been stripped of riparian vegetation and stabilized with rocks. As a result, floodplains, wetlands, and riparian areas are no longer able to function as intended\u2014that is, to absorb excess water and dissipate its energy during storms and to provide buffers to filter suspended sediment from surface runoff before it reaches streams. Streambank stabilization projects also increase water velocity and the erosive power of the river on downstream reaches.", "For example, the settlement and development of the floodplain, as well as the lands around the mouths of many of the tributaries, within Eugene\u2019s McKenzie River watershed have accelerated since World War II.

Conversely, in the lower subbasin\u2014on predominantly nonfederal lands\u2014agricultural and urban runoff was loading the river with soil, organic materials, and other wastes and pollutants.", "Preliminary results from a pilot project to monitor storms, recently completed by the McKenzie Watershed Council, reached a similar conclusion. Although the Council cautions that information derived from repeated monitoring over a number of storms will be required before general conclusions can be reached on the patterns of water quality in the watershed, data from one storm indicated that the highest recorded turbidity levels came from a growing residential area east of Eugene and that turbidity levels measured from this area during the storm were about double those from agricultural lands and considerably higher than those from federal forest lands.

The dam, like other dams and flood retention structures, also acted like a giant sediment-settling pond. When flowing water entered the reservoir behind the dam, much of the sediment in the water fell out of suspension and settled to the bottom.", "However, according to a 1998 study of the 1996 storm in the North Santiam watershed\u2014conducted by Salem, the Willamette National Forest, the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and the Willamette Geological Services\u2014sediment from natural erosion and human activities on primarily nonfederal lands in the lower portions of the watershed below the dam was transported down the city\u2019s sole source of drinking water\u2014the North Santiam River.

The North Santiam River watershed contains soils with high levels of microscopic clay particles. Although the larger clay particles carried by the storm water settled to the bottom of the Detroit Reservoir behind the Detroit Dam, the finer sediment remained suspended in the water retained by the dam. This material was delivered downstream when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began releasing flood waters from the reservoir on February 9, 1996.", "Without a secondary source of water, Salem nearly exhausted its reserve water supplies and had to take emergency measures, according to city officials. These measures included (1) drilling emergency wells, (2) purchasing water from neighboring communities, (3) constructing an emergency system to pretreat the water, (4) asking customers to curtail their use of water, and (5) banning all nonessential outdoor uses.", "Salem restarted its water treatment system on February 14, 1996. However, according to city officials, water use had to be curtailed for more than a month after the storm to reduce the demand on Salem\u2019s crippled water treatment system. The system was also not able to adequately filter the turbid water being released from the Detroit Reservoir. Since the microscopic clay particles were able to pass through the water treatment system\u2019s filter beds, the city had to obtain an exemption from the state in order to deliver to its customers drinking water that had a turbidity level exceeding drinking water standards through July 16, 1996. In addition, one of the system\u2019s filters was damaged by the microscopic clay particles and has continued to create operational problems, according to city officials.", "Other western Oregon cities experienced elevated sediment levels during and following the February 1996 storm (see fig. 2.2) but were better prepared to continue to deliver safe drinking water to their customers.", "Specifically, Cottage Grove did not experience severe flooding, and although turbidity levels were slightly higher than those reported by Salem, the city was able to filter and deliver safe drinking water to its residents. In Eugene, turbidity levels were more than 20 times greater than those reported by Salem. Eugene shut down its water treatment system for about 12 hours and relied on its reserve water supplies until its water treatment system could be adjusted to handle the rapidly changing turbid water. Portland experienced considerably lower turbidity levels than Cottage Grove, Eugene, and Salem and relied on its backup water system\u2014a well field along the Columbia River\u2014for 5 days to provide safe drinking water during and following the storm, when water from its watershed was too turbid to meet safe drinking water standards.", "According to Sandy\u2019s public works director, the city is usually prepared to continue to deliver safe drinking water to its customers during large storms. Sandy never shuts down its water treatment system but relies on a secondary source of water and reserve water supplies, rather than Alder Creek, to meet demand. However, the city\u2019s secondary source of water had been severely damaged during a windstorm in late 1995 when large trees adjacent to a timber harvest clearcut on private land fell onto the source\u2019s pipes and storage tanks. In addition, a malfunctioning sensing device in the city\u2019s main storage reservoir led the city to believe that this reservoir was full, when in fact it was nearly empty.

However, the 1998 study of the 1996 storm in the North Santiam watershed builds on the findings in previous studies on persistent turbidity. The 1998 study reaffirms earlier findings that the persistent turbidity in the Detroit Reservoir came from the microscopic clay particles that remained suspended in the water retained by the Detroit Dam. The main sources of these particles are (1) natural, large, deep-seated, slow-moving masses of earth (called earthflows) and (2) naturally occurring erosion from streambanks, which brings to the surface deep-seated clay deposits.
