Through the CARE Act, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), awards grants (known as Part D grants) to provide services to women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS and their families. These grantees incur administrative expenses and indirect costs, such as rent and utilities. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment and Modernization Act of 2006 (RWTMA), which took effect in fiscal year 2007, capped at 10 percent the amount that Part D grantees could spend on administrative expenses. According to HRSA, there is no cap on indirect costs, but grantees must have an indirect cost rate to use funds for indirect costs. RWTMA directed GAO to examine Part D spending. In this report GAO describes (1) the services that Part D grantees provide and what effect, if any, the administrative expense cap has had on those services and on grantee programs; (2) how Part D grantees report on administrative expenses, indirect costs, and compliance with the cap; and (3) how HRSA implemented the cap and grantees' views on that implementation. GAO surveyed all Part D grantees, interviewed selected grantees, reviewed Part D grant applications and guidance, and interviewed HRSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Part D grantees reported in our survey that they provide a range of services to clients, and the majority of these grantees reported that they have not made changes to services in response to the administrative expense cap implemented in fiscal year 2007. These services included both medical services, such as outpatient health services, as well as support services, such as child care. The majority of the 83 grantees that responded to our survey reported that the cap has not affected the services they provide. However, 4 grantees reported increasing services and 3 grantees reported reducing client services in response to the cap. In addition, the majority of grantees also reported that the cap has had a negative effect on their Part D programs, even if it has not changed client services, because it has, for example, made it necessary for clinical staff to perform administrative tasks. In addition, about half of the grantees reported that not all of their Part D administrative expenses were covered by the 10 percent allowance. Part D grantees report planned administrative expenses and indirect costs to HRSA and, starting in fiscal year 2009, HRSA will require additional reporting. In their grant applications, Part D grantees provide HRSA with budgets that include administrative expenses and indirect costs. Grantees must then update HRSA on any changes to that information, and some provide the results of independent financial audits. Starting in fiscal year 2009, HRSA will require all Part D grantees to report more detailed budget information at both the beginning and end of each year. In fiscal year 2007, the first year of the administrative expense cap, grantees reported to HRSA that they were in compliance with the cap. Grantees with approved indirect cost rates could include expenses such as rent and utilities in their indirect costs rather than in their administrative expenses and so were able to spend more than 10 percent of their Part D grants on such expenses. Beginning in fiscal year 2007, HRSA took multiple steps to implement the administrative expense cap but, while some grantees reported that HRSA's guidance on how to implement the cap was helpful, others reported difficulties in implementing the cap due to unclear guidance from HRSA. HRSA reported revising its grant application guidance and developing training for both its staff and grantees in response to the cap. HRSA also included additional revisions related to the administrative expense cap in the fiscal year 2008 grant application guidance and plans to provide grantees with further guidance in the fiscal year 2009 application. While some grantees reported that HRSA's guidance was helpful, others reported receiving conflicting information. In the first year of the cap, some grantees also indicated a need for additional guidance on the administrative expense cap and reported that they sought such guidance from sources other than HRSA.

In fiscal year 2007, HRSA provided $68,500,000 in Part D grants to  90 grantees, ranging from about $230,000 to over $2 million per grant. This  represented about 3 percent of all CARE Act funding.", "CARE Act Part D Grantees  Part D grantees compete for grant funding to provide a range of services\u2014 both medical and support\u2014to women, infants, children, and youth in a  variety of settings. Medical services are those outpatient and ambulatory  care services that are part of essential medical care. They can include, for  example, primary medical care and HIV/AIDS drug assistance. Support  services are nonmedical services necessary to use the medical services.  They can include, for example, client transportation to medical  appointments, child care, or food assistance services.", "Applicants generally submit applications to HRSA for 5-year project  periods. Grantees receive funding for the first year and then submit annual  noncompeting applications to HRSA to receive the remaining funding and  to update HRSA on their projects\u2019 spending and services. Although the  grant applications and federal funds are released by fiscal year, HRSA  refers to grantee spending in each of the 5 years constituting a project  period as budget years. Within Part D, there are two types of grants, each  of which has a slightly different budget year. For example, in 2007, one  Part D budget year ran from August 1, 2007, until July 31, 2008, and  another budget year ran from September 1, 2007, until August 31, 2008.

Indirect costs differ  from administrative expenses in that indirect cost rates for specific  activities are typically negotiated with the federal agency from which the  grantee receives the greatest amount of federal awards and that rate then  applies to all relevant federal award programs that permit indirect costs,  unless it conflicts with a legislative indirect cost cap. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles provide guidance as to the  expenses that can be included in indirect costs to the cognizant agencies  and grantees according to entity type. Within HHS, the Division of Cost  Allocation performs this role. HRSA, following OMB cost principles,  defines indirect costs as costs \u201cincurred for common or joint objectives,  which cannot be readily identified but are necessary to the operations of  the organization.\u201d HRSA defines administrative expenses as \u201cfunds that are  to be used by grantees for grant management and monitoring activities,  including costs related to any staff or activity unrelated to services or  indirect costs.\u201d", "Some expenses can be considered to be either administrative or indirect.  For example, rent and utilities could be considered either administrative  expenses or indirect costs. However, for a grantee to claim any expenses  as indirect costs, it must have an approved indirect cost rate. Smaller  organizations or ones that receive only one federal grant may not have  approved indirect cost rates, but organizations that receive multiple  federal grants would need to have approved rates. For example, a  university that receives multiple federal grants would have an indirect cost  rate to cover different grants\u2019 shares of costs such as rent, utilities, as well  as library expenses. However, a small organization that receives only one  federal grant might not have an indirect cost rate since it may be able to  account for all of those expenses for the single federal grant it receives. If  a grantee does not have an approved indirect cost rate agreement, the  grantee must charge (account for) expenses such as rent and utilities as  administrative expenses in order to pay for those expenses with grant  funds. This means that grantees with approved indirect cost rates have  greater latitude than those without such rates to pay for expenses that  might otherwise be considered administrative expenses as they can spend  more than 10 percent of their Part D grant on expenses such as rent and  utilities.", "The CARE Act now caps at 10 percent the amount of the Part D grant  awards that grantees can spend on administrative expenses.

Specifically, we examined  (1) the services that Part D grantees provide and what effect, if any, the  administrative expense cap has had on those services and on grantee  programs; (2) how Part D grantees report on administrative expenses,  indirect costs, and compliance with the administrative expense cap; and  (3) how the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Health Resources  and Services Administration (HRSA) implemented the Part D  administrative expense cap and grantees\u2019 views on that implementation.", "To determine what services Part D grantees provide and what effect the  administrative expense cap has had on those services; how Part D  grantees report on administrative expenses, indirect costs, and compliance  with the administrative expense cap; and how HRSA has implemented the  Part D administrative expense cap, we analyzed data from our Web-based  survey sent to all 90 Part D grantees. We obtained the e-mail addresses and  the names of grantee contacts from HRSA. The survey contained questions  on grantees\u2019 services and clients, administrative expenses and indirect  costs, and HRSA\u2019s implementation of the administrative expense cap. The  questions focused on changes that occurred in fiscal year 2007, the first  year the administrative expense cap was in effect. Fiscal year 2007 was the  only full year of information we were able to obtain from grantees.  Because the Part D grants are generally awarded in August of each year\u2014 the beginning of what HRSA officials refer to as the budget year\u2014a full  year of information was not available for fiscal year 2008. Of the 90 Part D  grantees, 83 completed the survey for a 92 percent response rate (see   table 2).", "During the development of our survey, we pretested it with three Part D  grantees from New York, Washington, D.C., and Maryland. We opened the  survey on May 14, 2008. During the course of the survey, we sent two  follow-up e-mails to each nonrespondent and then made telephone follow- up calls to remaining nonrespondents to address any problems they had  and to encourage them to complete the survey. We closed the survey on  July 10, 2008. Because this survey was conducted with all of the Part D  grantees, it is not subject to sampling error. However, the practical  difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other errors. For  example, difficulties in interpreting a particular question or sources of  information available to respondents can introduce unwanted variability  or bias into the survey results. We took steps to minimize such  nonsampling errors in developing the questionnaire and collecting and  analyzing the data. While the response rate of 92 percent is high, if those  not responding differed materially from those responding on any  particular question we analyzed, our analysis may not accurately represent  the group surveyed. Our results therefore best represent only those  responding to our survey. However, given our analysis of the  nonresponders, we determined that we could generalize our findings to all  Part D grantees.", "To obtain information on grantees\u2019 fiscal year 2007 spending, including  administrative expenses and indirect costs, we reviewed the grantees\u2019 2007  Part D grant applications that contain their proposed budgets.
