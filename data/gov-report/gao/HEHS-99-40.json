To foster this goal, the Congress authorized welfare-to work grants in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33). These grants were intended to help hard-to-employ persons receiving aid under the block grant program of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), to obtain employment. The welfare-to-work grants total $3 billion\u2014$1.5 billion to be awarded by the Department of Labor each year in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. About 75 percent of the funds are for formula grants to states, and nearly 25 percent are for competitive grants to local organizations for innovative approaches in moving welfare recipients into permanent work. To receive a formula grant, states must pledge one dollar of state matching funds for every two dollars of federal welfare-to-work funds. States must also submit a plan describing how the formula funds will be used and ensure that the plan was developed in consultation with appropriate state and local agencies, including those responsible for TANF funds. States, in turn, must pass most of the formula funds to substate areas that plan for and administer the funds. Governors may retain a small portion, 15 percent, of the states\u2019 formula funding for special welfare-to-work projects.", "As requested, we are providing information about (1) welfare-to-work formula and competitive grants awarded to, or declined by, states for fiscal year 1998; (2) how selected grantees are planning to use these funds; and (3) how selected grantees plan to meet welfare-to-work requirements to better integrate the states\u2019 workforce development services with other human services for welfare recipients. Because the grants were mostly awarded in the second half of fiscal year 1998, in discussions with your offices we agreed that it is too early to report on how welfare-to-work funding was actually spent or to collect outcome data about the impact of the funds on finding jobs for hard-to-employ welfare recipients.", "In performing this work, we met with Labor officials who administer the welfare-to-work grants and obtained information on the formula and competitive grants Labor awarded for welfare-to-work funds available for fiscal year 1998. We also interviewed state and local officials in six states\u2014Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Wisconsin\u2014to obtain information on their plans for the welfare-to-work grant funding.

Although some states were already implementing changes to their welfare programs before this legislation, the act abolished the federal Aid to Families With Dependent Children program and established TANF block grants, which imposed stronger work requirements for welfare recipients than its predecessor program. TANF provides benefits for a time-limited period and focuses on quickly putting individuals to work. The TANF block grants available to states totaled about $16.6 billion in fiscal year 1998\u2014ranging from about $21.8 million in Wyoming to over $3.7 billion in California. To receive their TANF grants, states must maintain funding for needy families at specified levels tied to their historical expenditures on welfare programs.", "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized $3 billion for welfare-to-work grants to state (the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) and local communities to move welfare recipients into jobs\u2014$1.5 billion is available to be awarded by Labor each year in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. A small amount of the total grant money was set aside for special purposes: 1 percent for Native American tribes ($15 million for each year), 0.8 percent for evaluation ($12 million for each year), and $100 million in fiscal year 1999 for performance bonuses to states that successfully move welfare recipients into employment. After these set-asides, Labor allocated 75 percent (about $1.1 billion for fiscal year 1998) of the welfare-to-work funds to states on the basis of a formula that equally considers the shares of individuals with incomes below the poverty level and adult recipients of TANF assistance residing in the state. States must pledge one dollar of nonfederal funding to match every two dollars of federal funding provided under the formula; up to half of the match may consist of third-party in-kind contributions. The state welfare-to-work matching funds are in addition to the state funds that must be expended as required under TANF block grants.", "Funds not allocated by formula, which are nearly 25 percent of the welfare-to-work funds (over $368 million for fiscal year 1998), were available for Labor to award competitively to local organizations. These organizations\u2014local governments, Private Industry Councils, and private organizations that apply in conjunction with a Private Industry Council or local government\u2014submit applications to Labor describing how they plan to use welfare-to-work funds. In addition to giving special consideration to cities with large concentrations of poverty and to rural areas, Labor reviews applications and awards competitive grants using the following criteria: the relative need for assistance in the area proposed to be served; the extent to which the project proposes innovative strategies for moving welfare recipients into lasting work; the quality of the proposed outcomes of the project; the degree to which the project is coordinated with other services; and the demonstrated ability of the grant applicant.", "To receive its allocation of welfare-to-work formula funds, a state was required to submit a plan for the use and administration of the grant funds to Labor. The Secretary of Labor then determined whether the plan met the statutory requirements, including assurances that the plan was developed with coordination from appropriate entities in substate areas and that welfare-to-work programs and funds would be coordinated with programs funded through the TANF block grants. Using an allocation formula developed by the state, 85 percent of the state\u2019s federal formula funds were to be passed to local Private Industry Councils. The Private Industry Councils have policy-making responsibility in these service delivery areas and administer the welfare-to-work programs at the local level unless the Secretary of Labor approves a governor\u2019s request to use an alternative administering agency. The remaining 15 percent of the state\u2019s formula allotment may be spent on welfare-to-work projects of the state\u2019s choice, which is described in this report as the governor\u2019s discretionary fund.", "States establish their own formula for allocating formula funds to Private Industry Councils for local service delivery areas but must give a minimum weight of 50 percent to the number of people in the area in excess of 7.5 percent of the population whose income is below the poverty level. States may also consider the local area\u2019s proportion of the state\u2019s long-term welfare population or the state\u2019s unemployed population. Additionally, if the amount to be allocated by formula to a local service delivery area is less than $100,000, that money may be held by the state and added to the 15 percent governor\u2019s discretionary funds.", "Labor was required to obligate the fiscal year 1998 formula grant funds by September 30, 1998; however, funds for the competitive grants were multiyear, and Labor could obligate those funds into fiscal year 1999. Both formula and competitive grants must be spent within 3 years of the grant award. Under the Balanced Budget Act, the welfare-to-work grants were initially legislated as multiyear allocations that could be awarded any time in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, but this law was amended to require that Labor award formula funds available for fiscal year 1998 by September 30, 1998. If at the end of any fiscal year states have not applied for or have applied for less than the maximum amount available for formula funds, the funds are to be transferred to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Competitive grant funds, however, remain multiyear funds, and there is no requirement to obligate funds for fiscal year 1998 within the fiscal year.", "Grantees have flexibility in designing welfare-to-work strategies geared to the needs of their own local populations and labor markets. Overall, welfare-to-work program services help individuals get and keep unsubsidized employment. Allowable activities include job readiness and placement services financed through vouchers or contracts; community service or work experience; job creation through public sector or private sector employment wage subsidies; and on-the-job training, postemployment services financed through vouchers or contracts, and job retention and support services.", "Both formula and competitive grant funds are to be used for certain TANF families\u2014recipients on long-term welfare assistance, TANF recipients with characteristics of long-term welfare dependence, and/or their noncustodial counterparts. These people are considered hard to employ and may have low educational attainment or poor work histories. The law requires that at least 70 percent of the funds be spent on the hardest to serve long-term welfare recipients with two of three specified barriers to successful employment. Up to 30 percent of the grant funds may be spent on individuals with characteristics of long-term welfare recipients; these characteristics could include dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy, or poor work history. Under either the 70- or 30-percent category, noncustodial parents with dependents receiving TANF assistance may qualify for welfare-to-work activities.

Of the states that declined to participate in the welfare-to-work program, four states did not submit a welfare-to-work plan to Labor and the remaining states informed Labor that they would not participate in the formula grant program. These six states chose not to participate for various reasons, including concerns about their ability to provide state matching funds.", "Arizona needed about $9 million in matching funds to obtain its full allocation of about $17 million in federal welfare-to-work funds; however, the state legislature was not willing to provide this amount in matching funds. Instead, the state assured a match of $4.5 million and obtained a formula grant for $9 million in fiscal year 1998. Initially, Arizona asked the local service delivery areas to determine whether they could raise the required matching funds; however, the local areas, while they wanted the welfare-to-work funding, did not believe they could raise the matching funds locally.", "Of the six states that declined to participate in the welfare-to-work formula program, four states\u2014Idaho, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Wyoming\u2014neither informed Labor they would not be participating in welfare-to-work, nor submitted a welfare-to-work plan to Labor; the remaining states\u2014Ohio and Utah\u2014informed Labor that they would not participate. Ohio initially applied for its welfare-to-work allocation, but the governor later decided the grant was too complex and burdensome, especially the match requirement. Since Ohio had excess, unobligated TANF funds, state officials believed the TANF funds should be used to move welfare recipients to work\u2014especially because there were no matching requirements and the eligibility requirements were less restrictive. Utah sent a letter declining its allocation, listing two reasons for its decision\u2014that the state believed the formula funding was too restrictive regarding participant eligibility and that it believed the welfare-to-work grants were too prescriptive and did not allow the state enough flexibility. A state official in Utah also said that, at the time the letter was sent, officials believed TANF funds were sufficient to serve the TANF population\u2019s needs; furthermore, the funds required a state match, which did not seem feasible at the time.", "The states that did not apply for welfare-to-work funds had various reasons for not participating. For example, an official in Idaho noted that the state\u2019s TANF caseload had dropped precipitously, consequently the state had adequate TANF funds to meet the employment and training needs of the remaining welfare recipients. The official also estimated that no more than about 350 of the state\u2019s welfare recipients were eligible for welfare-to-work services\u2014and perhaps as few as 100. A state official in Mississippi said that a significant amount of TANF funds had been budgeted for job skills development and job search. Additionally, the state had set aside 30 percent of enrollments in JTPA for welfare recipients and was having difficulty filling these slots. Consequently, in addition to concerns about the state\u2019s ability to provide matching funds, the state decided against applying for welfare-to-work funds.

V through X for a brief description of the formula grant plans in each of the six states.) In the six states, the local plans we reviewed proposed a range of welfare-to-work activities for eligible participants.", "Three states planned a specific statewide focus for formula grant funds. For example, Michigan\u2019s plan emphasized serving unemployed noncustodial parents who have child support payments in arrears and whose dependents are receiving TANF assistance. The goal was to increase payments by these noncustodial parents for child support. Not participating in the welfare-to-work program has serious consequences\u2014incarceration\u2014unless there is good cause for nonparticipation. Michigan required local service delivery areas to devote 50 percent of their welfare-to-work grant funds to assist noncustodial parents. Wisconsin\u2019s plan also emphasized serving noncustodial parents, and because its TANF caseload is low, the state also proposed to assist individuals receiving only TANF child care subsidies. Massachusetts planned on serving TANF recipients who are reaching their 24-month limit for receiving cash assistance\u2014about 7,000 were expected to lose cash assistance benefits on December 1, 1998.", "In contrast, three states defined their formula grant focus more broadly and did not emphasize a specific service strategy. California\u2019s state plan noted that\u2014given the diversity of the state\u2019s local service delivery areas\u2014no one service strategy could be effectively applied statewide. Arizona\u2019s plan outlined the state\u2019s support to local service delivery areas in their efforts to target welfare-to-work services to hard-to-serve TANF recipients, noncustodial parents, and other eligible individuals. New York\u2019s plan provided a general welfare-to-work focus on improving the connection to work, although the state plan placed some emphasis on serving individuals with disabilities; many of these individuals have experienced long-term welfare dependency and had been exempt from work requirements under Aid to Families With Dependent Children but are no longer exempt under the state\u2019s TANF program.", "The local plans we reviewed proposed a range of activities for their formula grant allocations. Because welfare-to-work programs are administered locally, state officials in the six states we reviewed said local entities have the ability to design welfare-to-work activities and target populations within the parameters of the state plan. For example, the New York state plan did not define, beyond the federal welfare-to-work eligibility requirements, the population to be served with formula funds, and state officials said that different local plans emphasized different activities, such as mentoring, case management, training to upgrade employment, literacy, and career ladder development. The officials also noted that local service delivery areas considered the services funded by TANF and proposed to focus formula grant funds on areas where services were lacking.", "In states with a focus on serving a targeted population with formula grant funds, local service delivery areas focused on these objectives in their welfare-to-work plans. For example, in Massachusetts, local service delivery areas, following the state\u2019s direction, will provide services to TANF recipients facing time limits on cash assistance. Likewise, a service delivery area in Michigan will identify its welfare-to-work participants through the Family Independence Agency, which is the TANF agency, and the Friend of the Court, which refers noncustodial parents. However, focusing on the needs of its own local population, this service delivery area also plans to serve several other populations whose characteristics are associated with or predictive of long-term welfare dependency, such as rural isolation, substance abuse, homelessness, being a single parent, or being an offender.", "For states leaving more discretion to local service delivery areas in planning their strategies for the use of formula grant funds, some local areas designed their welfare-to-work activities to complement existing employment delivery systems. For example, in the San Diego, California, service delivery area, about 3,000 long-term welfare recipients will receive a package of services, for about 18 to 24 months, designed to meet their needs, which will include at least 16 hours a week of work activities and up to 16 hours a week of support services. These services are provided by competitively procured contractors, and each contract includes an incentive program to move participants into work expeditiously. Some local plans emphasized new approaches for moving welfare recipients to work. For example, local officials in Phoenix, Arizona, plan to use formula grant funds to develop new relationships with large businesses that will receive consulting services in exchange for hiring welfare recipients; the welfare-to-work participants will receive job readiness training as well as mentoring and job coaching after they are hired to improve their chances of job retention.", "Local officials we interviewed said service delivery areas planned to use formula grant funds particularly to provide postemployment services. For example, in New York\u2019s Oneida-Herkimer-Madison service delivery area, the welfare-to-work program is based on using employment retention specialists who will provide 24-hour support service to participants. A third of the area\u2019s formula funds will be spent on the 6-person employment retention staff; smaller amounts of the formula funds were allocated for services such as transportation and child care because the program hopes to use existing programs and resources for these services. Even with its focus on job retention services, the local service delivery area will maintain a menu of services so that it can provide all services to clients as needed.", "The welfare-to-work program for a local area in Massachusetts represents another example of providing postemployment services with formula grant funds. This welfare-to-work program planned to provide support after job placement for up to 6 months rather than the 30 to 60 days that other employment and training programs generally provide participants. At the time of our review, this program had placed about 10 of the 70 current participants in jobs, and these employed participants were receiving services such as mentoring and case management. A program official noted that, until a participant finds a job, the local career center provides most services; however, once the participant finds a job, the career center\u2019s role diminishes, and participants primarily are served through the welfare-to-work program since it can provide postemployment services. The local area is still developing community resource teams to help TANF recipients manage their lives. The official explained that, once placed in jobs, welfare-to-work participants might fail to report to work if they are sick or if they cannot obtain child care. Ideally, the community resource teams would help individuals find resources to assist them with these situations without losing their jobs.", "The proposed use of the governor\u2019s discretionary portion of state formula funds (up to 15 percent of the formula funds) generally followed the states\u2019 welfare-to-work initiatives. States that targeted populations for welfare-to-work activities used discretionary funds for those individuals. For example, Michigan distributed its discretionary funds (about $6 million) to the local areas in order to provide more funding to serve noncustodial parents. In Wisconsin, the discretionary funds (about $2 million) will be used for a variety of purposes; however, the largest portion of the discretionary funds (about $1.1 million) will be allocated to the state\u2019s Department of Corrections to provide employment assistance to noncustodial parents in correctional institutions, on parole, or on probation. In Massachusetts, which emphasized assistance to TANF recipients facing time limits on cash assistance, the state planned to allocate over half of its about $3 million in discretionary funding to the Department of Transitional Assistance to supplement its program of assessment and structured employment assistance. Massachusetts also planned to subsidize five local areas that were allocated the lowest amount of formula funds. The state used these funds to provide a minimum of $400,000 to each area because state officials believed that local areas needed this level of funding to have an effective welfare-to-work program.", "For states that had a broader focus for their formula funds, plans for the governor\u2019s discretionary funds were analogous with those for local areas given wider discretion for the use of these funds. In California, the state distributed the governor\u2019s discretionary funds (about $29 million) primarily through a competitive process\u2014special consideration was given to a broad array of programs that addressed needs in rural areas; leveraged other resources; and demonstrated an innovative, coordinated approach to services. Of New York\u2019s discretionary funds (over $14 million), the state planned to use about 70 percent to support varied services\u2014also on a competitive basis\u2014to move individuals into employment and provide postemployment services to help working participants continue to work and increase earnings. Finally, Arizona combined its discretionary funds (about $1.4 million) with allocations made to the local service delivery areas but did not emphasize service to a specific population as did Michigan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Welfare-to-Work Competitive Grants Focused on Specific Populations and Activities", "paragraphs": ["The plans for competitive grants we reviewed in the six states focused on specific populations and activities. The competitive grantees proposed a variety of different activities and targeted different populations under this program for innovative approaches. Some of the welfare-to-work competitive grants will be used to complement programs funded by local formula allocations, and others will function separately from the local formula grant but rely on the same systems as the formula grantees to verify welfare-to-work eligibility.", "Several competitive grants will complement formula grant programs. For example, Phoenix planned to use its formula funds to assist participants in gaining employment with large businesses, while its competitive grant will be used to link participants with small businesses. The same approach will be used for both programs. Using both formula and competitive grant funds, EARN, an acronym for Employment and Respect Now, will assess and screen participants for drug use, then enroll them in a 5-week job readiness program that includes some computer-based training. For the competitive grant, these participants will be placed in employment among 900 small businesses that receive tax credits for employing them. Throughout the participant\u2019s work experience, EARN staff and volunteers will provide mentoring, job coaching, and other services for job retention. Similarly, Detroit\u2019s competitive grant will be used to complement its basic program of assisting all individuals in obtaining employment by providing more intense services for the hardest-to-employ population. Transportation to work sites is often a critical problem for welfare-to-work participants, and a portion of the competitive grant will be used to fund a demonstration project called Easy Ride that will purchase several alternative fuel vehicles and employ a person to coordinate transportation schedules for welfare-to-work participants. Additionally, the competitive grant in Detroit will provide more intense job readiness training such as substance abuse counseling and classes for English-as-a-Second-Language.", "The Metropolitan Area Planning Commission in Boston also planned to use its competitive grant funds to complement the area\u2019s formula grant programs by developing a transportation program to help individuals get to work. An \u201cAccess to Jobs\u201d study found specific gaps in transportation services that hampered individuals from obtaining employment. The study found that people either had no available public transportation, had to make multiple trips to get from their residence to their work site, or simply did not know how to make the trip. The Commission will work to connect city residents to suburban jobs, and suburban residents to jobs in other suburbs or the city. The program will assist people served by the formula grant programs and will provide (1) information about transportation modes, schedules, and day care sites near transportation; (2) direct assistance, such as subsidies for public transportation; and (3) an emergency fund for unanticipated transportation needs, allocated on a case-by-case basis. For example, if someone is not served by public transportation but has a car in need of repairs, the fund could be used to keep this individual\u2019s car in running order.", "Other competitive grants will function separately from the local formula grant but rely on the same systems to verify welfare-to-work eligibility as the formula grantees\u2014the welfare offices or the court system. For example, Oakland, California, will use its competitive grant to expand its pilot program to train and place Head Start parents in jobs. The program staff hope to identify participants who are noncustodial parents or who have substance abuse problems, but, similar to the welfare-to-work eligibility determination for the local formula grant, the staff will also submit a list of interested Head Start parents to the county welfare agency to verify TANF status. The Private Industry Council of Milwaukee County will provide legal assistance to long-term welfare clients and noncustodial parents whose legal problems\u2014combined with poor academic and work skills\u2014are barriers to employment. For its competitive grant, the Private Industry Council plans to serve 200 long-term TANF recipients (primarily women) and 450 noncustodial parents (primarily men) identified by the welfare agency or the court system\u2014this is the same way that the Private Industry Council will determine welfare-to-work eligibility for participants served by the local formula grant. The competitive grant will be used to provide legal advocacy and case management to participants, track individuals who drop out of the program and try to reintegrate them, and develop a process that will place a randomly selected group of noncustodial parents in unsubsidized or subsidized employment. This process will require that placement firms pay for the subsidized employment, thus providing the firms with incentives for finding jobs for their clients.", "In New York City, the Consortium for Worker Education will use its competitive grant to train and assist women to provide child care from their homes as satellites for private sector child care centers. The Consortium planned to build on its concept of both putting welfare recipients to work by providing child care in their homes and creating needed child care slots for workers in New York City. Recruitment for the program will be managed by two vendors who will advertise, hold presentations at community centers, and obtain referrals from the city welfare department. Once recruited, participants will be assessed and interviewed. For those selected for the program, their welfare-to-work eligibility will be determined by the city\u2019s TANF agency, which is also the administrative entity for the city\u2019s local formula grant. Those deemed eligible must then have their homes inspected for compliance with city building and health codes. Once accepted, the Consortium will enroll participants in a 2-week job readiness program followed by a 16-week Work Experience Program. Participants will spend 60 percent of their work experience working in a day care center and 40 percent in classroom training. When individuals have successfully completed their work experience, they will be hired by the parent company, Satellite Child Care, Inc. The provider\u2019s home will then be opened as a satellite child care center, and the provider will receive a $4,000 kit containing various equipment, including a computer package that has software for children and distance learning capabilities so the provider can receive continued instruction.

For example, in Massachusetts, an intergovernmental state steering committee prepared the state plan for formula grant funds and continues to respond to technical questions raised by local service delivery areas regarding implementation of welfare-to-work programs. The welfare-to-work stakeholders included representatives from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; the Corporation for Business, Work and Learning; the Executive Office of Health and Human Services; the Department of Transitional Assistance, which is the state TANF agency; the Regional Employment Board Association; the Service Delivery Area Association; the Career Center Office; and the Division of Employment and Training. By planning and working together, this group shares information in order to minimize duplication of effort between state agencies and with the local service delivery areas.", "In California, planning for formula grant funds and coordination between the California Employment Development Department and the state\u2019s Department of Social Services began as soon as the welfare-to-work program was introduced by Labor. Both departments are within California\u2019s Health and Welfare Agency, and, even before welfare-to-work legislation, these departments had formed a coordination committee\u2014CalWORKS\u2014to discuss issues regarding the state\u2019s effort to move welfare recipients into employment. At the state level, California has an interdepartmental work group that includes representatives of agencies responsible for education, transportation, housing, community services, mental health, and job services. In all, the work group includes 15 state departments responsible for 20 different programs. The state had also implemented one-stop career centers and had adopted a policy that would make the county welfare departments part of the one-stop system. The state further emphasized collaboration by holding five public hearings on the draft state plan to elicit comments from local service delivery areas and by posting its plan on the Internet to obtain public comment.", "The formula grant plans for the six states we reviewed required coordination between the workforce development and welfare agencies at the local level. For example, California required that local plans for formula funds also be approved by the county welfare department. In New York, state officials developed guidelines for local formula grant proposals that required the Private Industry Councils and area social services districts to develop a written welfare-to-work operational agreement to detail respective roles, responsibilities, and procedures within the service delivery area.", "At the local level, partnerships were formed to coordinate welfare-to-work activities provided by the local workforce development agencies with other human services for welfare recipients. For example, a community task force in Flagstaff, Arizona, was formed with representation from 64 state and local agencies in the service delivery area that were involved with moving individuals from welfare to work. Together, these stakeholders developed a matrix, listing each organization and the services offered to welfare recipients, to leverage resources and minimize duplication of effort. In Michigan, an official representing a local service delivery area noted that because the TANF population is the hardest to employ, she relies heavily on the expertise of the Michigan Rehabilitation Services for assistance regarding participants with more serious impediments to employment, such as substance abuse or mental illness. Additionally, because local service providers in Michigan focus on noncustodial parents, collaborative efforts with the court system are vital for identifying this population; the Family Independence Agency, which is the TANF agency, is also an important welfare-to-work partner in identifying TANF-eligible recipients. According to officials in Wisconsin, implementation of formula grant programs at the local level is a joint project between the local workforce development agency and the local TANF offices. This coordination allows the welfare-to-work funds to be used to expand on services provided by TANF funds, thus avoiding duplication of effort in service delivery.", "For the welfare-to-work competitive grants we reviewed, competitive grantees also coordinated their plans with state and local officials. For example, the competitive grant awarded in Merced, California, is planned for use in assisting welfare-to-work participants in becoming self-employed, and a strong aspect of this program is its collaboration with various partners. The program, which primarily targets noncustodial parents and public housing residents, has a coalition of partners including the Merced County Community Action Agency, Employment Development Department of Merced County, Merced County Private Industry Council/Private Industry Training Department, Merced County Human Services Agency, Housing Authority of the County of Merced, and chambers of commerce throughout the county. In several states we reviewed, the competitive grants were awarded to the same or similar entities that received a formula grant; consequently, the competitive grant linked significantly with the welfare-to-work program established under the formula grant. In these cases, the competitive grant funds were generally used to provide the more intensive services needed to help welfare recipients get and keep jobs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor for comment.
