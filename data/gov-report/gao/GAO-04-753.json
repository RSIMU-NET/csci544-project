None of the plans included analyses of the gaps between critical skills and competencies (a set of behaviors that are critical to work accomplishment) currently needed by the workforce and those that will be needed in the future. Without including gap analyses, DOD and the components may not be able to effectively design strategies to hire, develop, and retain the best possible workforce. Furthermore, none of the plans contained results-oriented performance measures that could provide the data necessary to assess the outcomes of civilian human capital initiatives. The major challenge that DOD and most of the components face in their efforts to develop and implement strategic workforce plans is their need for information on current competencies and those that will likely be needed in the future. This problem results from DOD's and the components' not having developed tools to collect and/or store, and manage data on workforce competencies. Without this information, it not clear whether they are designing and funding workforce strategies that will effectively shape their civilian workforces with the appropriate competencies needed to accomplish future DOD missions. Senior department and component officials all acknowledged this shortfall and told us that they are taking steps to address this challenge. Though these are steps in the right direction, the lack of information on current competencies and future needs is a continuing problem that several organizations, including GAO, have previously identified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The achievement of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) mission is  dependent in large part on the skills and expertise of its civilian  workforce.

During its downsizing in the early 1990s, DOD did not  focus on reshaping the civilian workforce in a strategic manner. This  downsizing has resulted in a workforce characterized by a growing gap  between older, experienced employees and younger, less experienced  ones. With more than 50 percent of its civilian personnel becoming eligible  to retire in the next 5 years, DOD may find it difficult to fill certain  mission-critical jobs with qualified personnel. The problem is exacerbated  by today\u2019s emerging security threats and rapidly evolving technology.  Civilian personnel have been deployed along with military personnel to  participate in operations such as Iraqi Freedom, Desert Storm, Bosnia, and  Kosovo. In addition, technological advances have generated the need for a  DOD civilian workforce with more advanced education and greater  technological skills.", "DOD has undertaken several human capital reforms that will affect its  future civilian workforce of approximately 700,000 personnel. One major  initiative is DOD\u2019s creation of a new human capital management system,  the National Security Personnel System (NSPS), which will give the  department significant flexibility for creating a new framework of rules,  regulations, and processes to govern the way civilians are hired,  compensated, promoted, and disciplined. In addition, DOD has undertaken  efforts to convert over 20,000 military positions to civilian positions in  fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and more conversions are to be addressed in  fiscal year 2006 and the out-years. Futhermore, DOD was granted  permanent authority beginning in fiscal year 2004 to extend buyouts to as  many as 25,000 civilian employees each year to downsize or restructure  the workforce to meet mission objectives. For these and other human  capital reforms to have maximum effectiveness and value, it is critical that  DOD engage in effective strategic workforce planning.", "Leading public-sector organizations have found that strategic human  capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious change  management initiative to transform the culture of government agencies.  Strategic workforce planning, an integral part of human capital  management, helps ensure that an organization has the staff with the  necessary skills and competencies to accomplish its strategic goals.  Critical skills are core mission and support occupations that are vital to  the accomplishment of an agency\u2019s goals and objectives. Competencies are  a set of behaviors that encompass knowledge, skills, abilities, and personal  attributes that are critical to successful work accomplishment. They  describe what employees know, what they do, and how they do it and  translate into effective on-the-job performance. Strategic workforce  planning is an iterative, systematic process that addresses two critical  needs: (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human capital program with its  current and emerging mission and programmatic goals and (2) developing  long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining an  organization\u2019s workforce to achieve programmatic goals. The strategic  workforce planning process includes five elements used by leading public-  and private-sector organizations: (1) involvement of management,  employees, and stakeholders in developing, communicating, and  implementing strategic workforce plans; (2) performing analyses to  identify critical skill and competency gaps between current and future  workforce needs; (3) developing strategies to fill these skill and  competency gaps; (4) building the capability necessary to address  administrative, educational, or other requirements to support workforce  strategies; and (5) monitoring and evaluating progress and the  contribution of strategic workforce planning efforts in achieving program  goals.", "In recent years, we have examined various aspects of DOD\u2019s human  capital management of its civilian workforce. For example, in March 2000,  we testified that a strategic approach should be used to guide DOD civilian  workforce management. We further testified that DOD must define the  kind of workforce it will need in the coming years, develop plans for  creating that workforce, and follow up with the actions and investments  needed so that the right employees\u2014with the right skills, training, tools,  structures, and performance incentives\u2014will be on hand in the years to  come. In March 2003, we reported on the department\u2019s strategic planning  efforts for civilian personnel both at DOD and selected defense  components. In that report we recommended that the Secretary of  Defense strengthen civilian human capital planning, including integration  with military personnel and sourcing initiatives. DOD did not concur with  our recommendation and stated that it presently has both a military and  civilian plan; the use of contractors is just another tool to accomplish the  mission, not a separate workforce, with separate needs, to manage. In  April 2003, we issued a report on DOD\u2019s strategic workforce planning  efforts for its civilian industrial workforce. We recommended, among  other things, that the Secretaries of the services and the Commandant of  the Marine Corps improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the  services\u2019 workforce planning efforts for civilian industrial employees.

As of December 30, 2003, DOD\u2019s civilian workforce was down  to 655,545 employees. DOD performed this downsizing without proactively  shaping the civilian workforce to ensure that it had the specific skills and  competencies needed to accomplish future DOD missions. A consequence  of this lack of attention to force shaping can be seen in the age distribution  of the civilian workforce in comparison to the distribution at the start of  the drawdown.

We have found that these  organizations have used strategic workforce planning as a management  tool to develop a case for human capital investments and to anticipate and  prepare for upcoming human capital issues that could jeopardize the  accomplishment of goals. Strategic human capital planning begins with  establishing a clear set of organizational intents\u2014including a clearly  defined mission, core values, goals and objectives, and strategies\u2014and  then developing an approach to support these strategic and programmatic  goals. Strategic workforce planning, an integral part of human capital  management, requires systematic assessments of current and future  human capital needs and strategies\u2014which encompass a broad array of  initiatives to attract, retain, develop, and motivate a top-quality  workforce\u2014to fill the gaps between an agency\u2019s current and future  workforce needs. Approaches to such planning vary according to agency- specific needs and mission, but our work suggests that, irrespective of the  context in which planning is done, such a process should address five key  elements (see fig. 2):  1.  Involvement of management and employees: Efforts that address key  organizational issues, like strategic workforce planning, are most likely  to succeed if, at their outset, agencies\u2019 top program and human capital  leaders set the overall direction, pace, tone, and goals of the effort, and  involve employees and stakeholders in establishing a communication  strategy that creates shared expectations for the outcomes of the  process.  2.  Workforce gap analysis: Identifying whether gaps exist between the  current and future workforces needed to meet program goals is critical  to ensuring proper staffing. The absence of fact-based gap analyses can  undermine an agency\u2019s efforts to identify and respond to current and  emerging challenges. The analysis of the current workforce should  identify how many personnel have the skills and competencies needed  to meet program goals and how many are likely to remain with the  agency over time, given expected losses due to retirement and other  attrition. The characteristics of the future workforce should be based  on the specific skills and competencies that will be needed. The  workforce gap analyses can help justify budget and staff requests by  linking the program goals and strategies with the budgetary and staff  resources needed to accomplish them.  3.  Workforce strategies to fill the gaps: Developing strategies to address  any identified workforce gaps in critical skills and competencies  creates the road map needed to move from the current to the future  workforce. Strategies address how the workforce is acquired,  developed and trained, deployed, compensated, motivated, and  retained.  4.  Build-up of capability to support workforce strategies: As agencies  develop tailored workforce plans and the administrative, educational,  and other requirements that are important to support them, it is  especially important to educate managers and employees about the  human capital flexibilities so that the flexibilities are implemented  openly, fairly, and effectively.  5.  Evaluation of and revisions to strategies: Evaluating the results of the  workforce strategies and making needed revisions helps to ensure that  the strategies work as intended. A key step is developing results- oriented performance measures as indicators of success in attaining  human capital goals and program goals, both short- and long-term.  Periodic measurement and evaluation provide data for identifying  shortfalls and opportunities to revise workforce plans as necessary.", "These concepts are especially relevant in considering the human capital  reforms that DOD has under way that will fundamentally change the way it  manages its civilian workforce. Because DOD is one of the largest  employers of federal civilian employees, how it approaches human capital  management sends important signals about trends and expectations for  federal employment across the government.

However, it is questionable whether DOD\u2019s  implementation of these reforms will result in the maximum effectiveness  and value because DOD has not developed comprehensive strategic  workforce plans that identify future civilian workforce needs.", "Although DOD and the components have taken steps to develop and  implement civilian strategic workforce plans to address future civilian  workforce needs, they generally lack some key elements essential to  successful workforce planning. Because DOD and the components have  not addressed all of the elements of strategic workforce planning, they do  not know what gaps exist in skills and competencies; what type of  recruitment, retention, and training and professional development  workforce strategies should be developed and implemented to meet future  organizational goals; and what competencies their staff need to do their  work now and in the future. More complete information on the  competencies needed for the future workforce would, for example,  enhance DOD\u2019s decisions on which employees to offer cash buyouts. In  addition, DOD and the components lack defined practical, meaningful  measures to gauge outcomes of their workforce strategies. Without  including these key elements, their civilian strategic workforce plans lack  comprehensiveness and consequently, DOD\u2019s future strategic workforce  plans may not result in workforces that possess the critical skills and  competencies needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the comprehensiveness of strategic workforce planning for the  DOD civilian workforce, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military service  headquarters, and the Defense Logistics Agency to build upon their  strategic workforce planning efforts through the following three actions:    Analyze and document the gaps between current critical skills and  competencies and those needed for the future workforce.", "Develop workforce strategies to fill the identified skills and competency  gaps.", "Establish results-oriented performance measures to use in evaluating  workforce planning efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Department of  Defense.

The department stated that in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2004, it began analyses between gaps in the critical  skills currently needed and those needed in the future, and that it  supplements the analyses, as necessary, to meet emerging technologies  and missions. We cannot verify DOD\u2019s statement because DOD was unable  to provide any specific documentation showing that it had performed gap  analyses. Regarding gap analyses of competencies, DOD stated that the  value of conducting a global gap analysis between current competencies  and those needed for the future is unclear, particularly as applied to over  650,000 jobs in nearly 700 occupations. Our recommendation did not  suggest that DOD conduct a global gap analysis of competencies for its  entire civilian workforce. Rather, we recommended that DOD analyze and  document the gaps between current critical skills and competencies and  those needed for the future workforce.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the department  develop workforce strategies to fill identified workforce gaps in skills and  competencies.

The department also noted that it continues to  use existing flexibilities such as recruitment and retention bonuses, and  relocation allowances. In our report, we acknowledge that the NSPS will  give the department significant flexibility for creating a new framework of  rules, regulations, and processes to govern the way civilians are among  other things, hired, compensated, and promoted. We also acknowledge  that DOD and the components have implemented various recruitment,  retention, training and professional development, and compensation  strategies to address workforce imbalances.

We also  obtained and reviewed civilian human capital strategic plans, workforce  planning documents, and workforce analysis submitted by the Department  of Defense (DOD) to OMB. We assessed the reliability of data used for the  workforce analysis by (1) reviewing existing information about the system  and the data produced by the system; (2) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data and reviewing their responses to questions  on system controls; and (3) making basic comparisons of the data with  OPM\u2019s Civilian Personnel Data File\u2019s data for obvious errors in accuracy.

Using the workforce planning documents, we evaluated DOD\u2019s  and the components\u2019 strategic workforce planning efforts in terms of five  strategic workforce planning elements that we identified through our prior  work in review of studies by leading workforce planning organizations  that included the OPM, other U.S. government agencies, the National  Academy for Public Administration, and the International Personnel  Management Association.
