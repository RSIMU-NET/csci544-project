However, less than half of the fiscal year 2002 entitlement grant funds had been accepted by those airports at the end of fiscal year 2002. The remaining portions of unused entitlement funds for the 2 fiscal years were carried over to use in the following years--up to 3 years. In both fiscal years, the percentage of entitlement grant funds accepted varied widely by state. Larger general aviation airports accepted a greater percentage of their entitlement grants than small airports for both fiscal years. In fiscal 2001, general aviation airports used these funds primarily to undertake landing area construction projects--runways, taxiways, and aprons. In addition, the airports used the funds to undertake pavement maintenance; airfield lighting, weather observation systems, and navigational aids; and planning projects. These four categories constituted over 75 percent of all projects undertaken with these funds. While most state aviation officials, selected airport managers, and FAA officials we spoke with indicated these entitlement grants were useful, they also suggested some changes. The most common concerned the amount of funding. Several state aviation officials and some selected airport managers indicated that the $150,000 annual maximum amount per airport was not adequate to complete projects. However, state officials expressed concerns that increasing the entitlement amount could hinder the states' ability to address their own aviation priorities because any increase would proportionately decrease the states' apportionments. The majority of the selected airport managers indicated that, without these grants, their airports would have been unable to undertake the projects. Other suggestions concerned increasing the amount of time to use the grants, broadening the categories of eligible projects, and using an alternative to FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airports Systems as the basis for funding eligible projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In April 2000, Congress passed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment  and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21), which, in part, directed  funding to general aviation airports as part of the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP). AIR-21  reauthorized various programs administered by FAA and made changes to  other programs. Among these changes, AIR-21 restructured the  apportionment of state aviation grant funds by including entitlements for  individual nonprimary airports, (hereafter referred to as general aviation  entitlement grants). These general aviation entitlement grants allow up to  $150,000 annually, or one-fifth of development costs shown in the latest  published National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS), whichever  is less, to be allocated to general aviation, reliever, and nonprimary  commercial service airports (hereafter, these three types of airports are  referred to collectively as general aviation airports). Grants are awarded  directly to these airports in 41 states and 2 territories, and pass through 9  states that receive the funds as block grants.", "Based on your interest in how well this entitlement grant program was  working, you asked that we review the first 2 years\u2019 implementation of  general aviation entitlement grants. As agreed with your office, we  addressed the following questions:   How much general aviation entitlement grant funding for fiscal years  2001 and 2002 has been accepted by general aviation airports, by state  and airport size?", "What types of projects have general aviation airports funded using  general aviation entitlement grants?", "What changes, if any, do state aviation officials, general aviation airport  managers, and FAA officials suggest to general aviation entitlement  grants?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed FAA\u2019s data on grants and  information on eligible projects listed in the NPIAS. We discussed this  information with FAA headquarters staff and resolved any discrepancies  with them. We reviewed data from an FAA survey that its field offices  completed on the use of these grant funds by general aviation airports. We  also surveyed state aviation officials, by telephone, from all 50 states and 2  territories and a sample of officials representing 56 general aviation  airports nationwide. The small sample size of general aviation airport  officials was not designed to be projectable to the population of general  aviation airports. In addition to interviewing cognizant FAA officials, we  interviewed officials of general aviation industry groups. Appendix I  explains this report\u2019s scope and methodology in greater detail. We  performed our work from June 2002 through February 2003, in Easton,  Maryland; Odenton, Maryland; Greenville, Texas; Mesquite, Texas; and  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to AIR-21, which was signed into law on April 5, 2000, general aviation  airports received AIP funding through funds apportioned to states by using  geographic area and population-based formulas, as well as through discretionary funds. These airports also received funds through FAA\u2019s  small airport fund. AIR-21 amended the general aviation state  apportionment grant program, in part, by creating a special rule, which  provides general aviation entitlement grants for any fiscal year in which the  total amount of AIP funding is $3.2 billion or more. Under this rule, the  amount available for state apportionments increases from 18.5 percent of  total AIP funding to 20 percent when AIP\u2019s total funding is $3.2 billion or  more. From the state apportionment, FAA computes and allocates the  amount available for general aviation entitlements and the remaining funds  are provided for \u201cunassigned\u201d state apportionment. The general aviation  entitlement grant amount for any one airport represents one-fifth of the  estimate of that airport\u2019s 5-year costs for its needs, as listed in the most  recently published NPIAS, up to an annual maximum of $150,000. After the  aggregate amount of general aviation entitlements has been determined,  the remainder is provided for the same type of airports within a state on an  unassigned basis, the allocation of which is determined by a state\u2019s area  and population relative to all other states. To be eligible for a general  aviation entitlement grant, an airport must be listed and have identified  needs in the most recently published NPIAS; therefore, an airport\u2019s listed  needs largely determine the size of an airport\u2019s annual grant. However,  funding is not limited to the projects listed in the most recent NPIAS. The  1998-2002 NPIAS provided the basis for fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002  grants. The 2001-2005 NPIAS, published in August 2002, provides the basis  for fiscal year 2003 grants.", "A general aviation entitlement grant provides funding for 90 percent of an  eligible project\u2019s total costs; the airport must finance the remaining 10  percent, although many states pay a share of this local matching  requirement. FAA\u2019s regional and district offices work with state aviation  officials and sponsors to find appropriate uses for these funds. Grant funds  can be used on most airfield capital projects, such as runway, taxiway, and  apron construction but generally not for terminals, hangers, and  nonaviation development, such as parking lots. Some airfield maintenance  and project planning costs are also allowed. Accepting a grant not only  requires airport officials to pledge to continue operations and maintenance  for 20 years but also precludes the airport from granting exclusive rights to  those providing aeronautical services and allowing any activity that could  interfere with its use as a general aviation airport.", "The number of general aviation airports that were apportioned general  aviation entitlement funds is expected to increase from 2,100 in fiscal year  2001 to 2,493 in fiscal year 2003, as shown in figure 1. The expected 19  percent increase reflects the fact that more airports identified capital needs  in the most recent NPIAS, which serves as the basis for fiscal year 2003  grants. FAA officials explained that before the NPIAS served as a basis for  calculating entitlement grants, some FAA officials, sponsors, and state  aviation officials did not always give high priority to keeping the general  aviation portion of the NPIAS up to date. Thus, they added, the NPIAS used  to calculate the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 general aviation entitlement  might have understated airport development needs for these airports.", "In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, entitlement grants for general aviation  airports were available because AIP funding levels were at least $3.2  billion. As the number of eligible airports or the value of development  identified in the NPIAS for these airports increases, the funding for these  grants also increases. However, this increase could result in a  corresponding decrease in the amount of AIP funding available in that year  for \u201cunassigned\u201d state apportionment grants. Since the latter amount is  determined after subtracting the total general aviation entitlements from  the total state apportionment, FAA estimates that general aviation  entitlement grant funding will rise by about $70 million from $271 million in  fiscal year 2002 to about $341 million for fiscal year 2003, as shown in  figure 2.", "Over half of general aviation airports were apportioned the maximum  amount of funding. For fiscal year 2001, of the 2,100 airports that were  apportioned these entitlements, 71 percent were eligible for the maximum  amount of $150,000. With the publication of the new NPIAS in August  2002, 83 percent of the 2,493 eligible airports were apportioned the  maximum for fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The General Aviation Entitlement Grant Process", "paragraphs": ["Working in collaboration with FAA\u2019s regional or airport district offices,  general aviation airports identify projects that will be funded with  entitlement grants. These projects are listed in FAA\u2019s Airports Capital  Improvement Plan (ACIP), which includes only those projects that FAA has  identified as candidates for AIP funding. After FAA has certified that the  application materials are in order and all relevant AIP statutory, regulatory,  and policy requirements have been satisfied, FAA then sends a grant offer  to the airport sponsor or the state aviation agency representing the airport  sponsor. The flowchart in figure 3 illustrates this process.", "When an airport elects not to accept its general aviation entitlement grant  funds, the funds revert to AIP\u2019s discretionary fund to be awarded by FAA to  another airport, as provided by statute. However, the funds remain  available to this airport for up to 3 years. Therefore, in the third year that an  airport has entitlement grant funds available, it could have as much as  $450,000 available for a grant. In addition, an airport can use part of its  general aviation entitlement grant in the first year and carry over the  remainder for use later. For example, an airport might have a general  aviation entitlement grant of $140,000, but the only AIP-eligible project it  can implement during the fiscal year might require just $80,000 in AIP  funds. FAA could issue the grant for $80,000 that fiscal year and include the  remaining $60,000 of the airport\u2019s available funds in another grant for that  airport at any time within the 3 years after the grant was first made  available.", "For general aviation airports in the nine block grant states, the acceptance  process for these entitlement grants works differently. Each block grant  state is apportioned a lump sum equal to the total of these grants for  airports in that state plus total unassigned state apportionment funds. FAA  has distributed all general aviation entitlement grant funds to these states  in the same year the funds were apportioned. The block grant states are  then responsible for distributing the funds to individual general aviation  airports according to FAA\u2019s requirements.", "According to FAA officials, states are required to offer eligible general  aviation airports their entitlements in the fiscal year it is made available. If  an airport does not accept the entitlement in the first year of its availability,  the distribution of a general aviation entitlement grant must nonetheless be  made to that airport by the end of 3 years. If an airport has not accepted the  funding at the end of the 3-year period, the grant would be reduced by the  amount of the funding not accepted. FAA officials explained that each  block grant could be adjusted on an annual basis, but this approach is used  to provide block grant states flexibility similar to the authority FAA has in  managing AIP and general aviation entitlement grants. FAA officials added  that the state assumes the risk if funds are used for another airport during  the 3-year period. If funds have been expended at another airport and an  unassigned state apportionment is not available to provide the general  aviation entitlement funding to the original eligible airport, it would be  necessary for the state to repay the federal funds with its own state- generated funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Fiscal Year 2001 General Aviation Entitlement Grant Funds Were Accepted", "paragraphs": ["As of October 1, 2002, about 75 percent of the total fiscal year 2001 general  aviation entitlement grant funds had been accepted by the airports to  which they were apportioned, and about 46 percent of the total fiscal year  2002 general aviation entitlement grant funds had been accepted.

Two airport managers we interviewed  also suggested increased flexibility. For example, three state aviation  officials suggested making all 3 years of grant funding available to airports  in the first year. One of these officials said that making the full 3-year grant  amount available to airports during the first year of funding would help  airports undertake critical projects earlier because they would not need to  wait to accumulate sufficient funding. According to FAA officials, this  suggestion would represent a significant departure from current practices  for administering entitlement funds. Officials told us that while multiyear  grants can be made to primary airports for multiyear projects,AIR-21 did  not provide this authority for general aviation entitlement grants.

Some state aviation officials said that because they can  better determine which projects within their states are high priorities, they  are better able to distribute the funds to airports on a statewide basis. For  example, a state aviation official said that because these entitlement grants  have reduced funding for significant projects, the small projects general  aviation airports have undertaken have had a minimal impact on that state\u2019s  aviation system.

FAA officials pointed out that, under current formulas, care would be  needed in selecting the uniform grant level under this approach.

After comparing these  data with the 1998-2002 National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems  (NPIAS), we found some discrepancies. In coordination with FAA officials,  we resolved these discrepancies and they are reflected in our report. We  classified all grants accepted through state sponsorship program grants as  having been accepted directly by individual airports. We then deleted all  state sponsorship program grants from the data. The total block grants  accepted were removed to avoid overstating the amount that individual  airports accepted. To obtain grant acceptance data for airports receiving  grants through block grant states, we asked state aviation officials in those  states to provide acceptance data as of October 1, 2002, on all the airports  that were eligible for general aviation entitlement grants. This information  was self-reported, and we did not verify the information provided by the  states. After we discussed our methodology with FAA officials and reached  agreement that the data from FAA and the individual block grant states  were comparable, we aggregated the datasets. Funds not accepted were  classified as \u201ccarry over/not yet accepted.\u201d We then merged these data with  the 1998-2002 NPIAS file and categorized the results by airport size, as  measured by the number of based aircraft and state, in order to identify  possible trends in the data. Using FAA\u2019s guidance, we stratified airports into  four size categories: less than 20 based aircraft, 20-49 based aircraft, 50-99  based aircraft, and 100 or more based aircraft.", "In order to ascertain the projects that have been undertaken by general  aviation airports, we used FAA\u2019s survey of Airport Improvement Program  FY2001 Non-Primary Entitlements. FAA surveyed its nine regions and the  nine block grant states to gather data for several items, including the  projects for which airports used the general aviation entitlement grant  funds. FAA created 11 categories for the projects. We reviewed the results  of its survey and met with FAA officials to discuss our interpretation. We  did not verify the information provided by FAA. However, we raised  questions about the overall design of FAA\u2019s data collection effort and the  specific steps carried out to help ensure the quality of the collected data.  We determined that the data quality was sufficient for the purpose of our  review.", "To assess the usefulness of the general aviation entitlement grants and to  identify the potential areas of change, we surveyed state aviation and  airport management officials. We designed a computer-assisted telephone  interview (CATI) instrument to collect their responses. We conducted a  census of state aviation officials (50 states and 2 territories) who oversee  the operations of airports and head their respective state aviation  programs. All 52 of these aviation officials provided their opinions on the  experiences of airports in their respective states and territories. To  compare state and airport-level responses about the program, we also  obtained the perspectives of 56 general aviation airport management  officials to acquire their responses to the same questions and direct  illustrations of their experience with the program. The small sample size  was not designed to be projectable to the population of general aviation  airports. However, measures were taken to help ensure that the airports  chosen systematically cover and broadly represent the substantive criteria.  Our selection approach was completed in three steps. First, we identified  airports that accepted entitlement grant funds in either fiscal years 2001 or  2002. Second, we stratified these airports according to: size\u2014the number  of based aircraft\u2014measured as small (less than 20 based aircraft), medium  1 (20-49), medium 2 (50-99), and large (100 or more); FAA regional location;  and block grant status (whether the airport is located in a block grant  state). We sought guidance from FAA in determining the airport size  categories. The stratification process produced 56 exclusive groups  (airports in block grant states are not located in each FAA region). Then, in  the third step, we randomly selected one airport from each of the groups,  which were joined to form the final sample of 56 airports. All of the airport  management officials provided responses about their experiences with the  program.", "The CATI consisted of closed- and open-ended questions that asked about  an airport\u2019s experiences with and its ability to meet the requirements of the  general aviation entitlement grant. Descriptive statistical analyses of close- ended survey data were performed to determine response patterns.  Analyses of open-ended responses were conducted to detect broad themes  and topics within those themes, summarizing state aviation and airport  management responses on program improvements and projects  undertaken using entitlement grants.", "We conducted our review from June 2002 through February 2003 in Easton,  Maryland; Odenton, Maryland; Greenville, Texas; Mesquite, Texas; and  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. The collection of state aviation and airport  management interview data was completed in September and November  2002, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Airport Improvement Program", "paragraphs": ["The Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which was created in 1982, is  funded by the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. AIP distributes funds to  airports through grants in a manner that reflects several national priorities  and objectives including financing small state and community airports. The  distribution system for AIP grants is complex. It is based on a combination  of formula grants (also referred to as apportionments) and discretionary  funds. Formula funds are apportioned by formula or percentage and may  be used for any eligible airport or planning project. Through the AIP, the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) apportions formula grants  automatically to specific airports or types of airports including primary  airports, cargo service airports, general aviation airports, and Alaska  airports.", "In administering AIP, FAA must comply with various statutory provisions,  formulas, and set-asides established by law, which specify how AIP grant  funds are to be distributed among airports. Each year, FAA uses the  statutory formulas to determine how much in apportionment funds are to  be made available to each airport or state. After determining these  amounts, FAA informs each airport or state of the amount of funding  available for that year. However, these funds do not automatically go to an  airport\u2019s sponsor. To receive the funds it is entitled to, an airport or state  has to submit a valid grant application to FAA. In addition, under the act,  individual airports and states do not have to use these funds in the year  they are made available. The act gives most airports and states up to 3  years to use their apportionment funds. This carryover allows airports to  accumulate a larger amount to pay for more costly projects. Once the  apportionments have been determined, the remaining amount of AIP funds  is deposited in that program\u2019s discretionary fund, which consists of set- asides that are established by statute and other distributions. AIP funds are  usually limited to planning, designing, and constructing projects that  improve aircraft operations, such as runways, taxiways, aprons, and land  purchases, as well as to purchase security, safety, and emergency  equipment. AIP funds are also available to plan for and implement  programs to mitigate aircraft noise in the vicinity of airports. However,  these grants are generally not eligible for projects related to commercial  revenue-generating portions of terminals, such as shop concessions,  commercial maintenance hangars, fuel farms, parking garages, and off- airport road construction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Categories of U.S. Airports", "paragraphs": ["Outside the national system are many  landing strips and smaller airports, most  with fewer than 10 aircraft.", "These airports have at least 10 aircraft based  at their locations and fewer than 2,500  scheduled enplanements.", "General aviation airports (which  includes reliever airports) and non- primary commercial service airports  may be eligible to receive general  aviation entitlement grant funding. enplanements annually.", "Large hubs (31):  at least 1 percent or more of all enplanements.", "Medium hubs (35):  at least 0.25 percent, but less than  1 percent of all enplanements.", "Small hubs (71):  at least 0.05 percent, but less than  0.25 percent of all enplanements.", "Nonhubs (282):  more than 10,000 enplanements, but less than   0.05 percent of all enplanements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Jon Altshul, Nancy Boardman, Jeanine  Brady, Kevin Jackson, Bert Japikse, Michael Mgebroff, Jeff Miller,  George Quinn, and Don Watson made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
