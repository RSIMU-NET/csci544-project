In 1999, GAO reported that better management of VA's large inventory of aged capital assets could result in savings that could be used to enhance health care services for veterans. In response, VA initiated a process known as Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES). Through CARES, VA sought to enhance veteran care by the appropriate sizing, upgrading, and locating of VA facilities. GAO was asked to examine the CARES process. Specifically, GAO examined (1) how CARES contributes to VHA's capital planning process, (2) the extent to which the CARES process considered capital asset alignment alternatives, and (3) the extent to which VA has implemented CARES decisions and how this implementation has helped VA carry out its mission. To address these issues, we analyzed CARES documents, interviewed VA officials, and conducted six site visits, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The CARES process provided VA with a blueprint that drives VHA's capital planning efforts. As part of the CARES process, VA adapted a model to estimate demand for health care services and to determine the capacity of its current infrastructure to meet this demand. VA continues to use this model in its capital planning process. The CARES process resulted in capital alignment decisions intended to address gaps in services or infrastructure. These decisions serve as the foundation for VA's capital planning process. According to VA officials, all capital projects must be based upon demand projections that use the planning model developed through CARES. A range of capital asset alignment alternatives were considered throughout the CARES process, which adheres to capital planning best practices. There was relatively consistent agreement among the Draft National CARES Plan prepared by VA, the CARES Commission appointed by the VA Secretary to make alignment recommendations, and the Secretary as to which were the best alternatives to pursue. Although the Secretary tended to agree with the CARES Commission's recommendations, the extent to which he agreed varied by alignment alternative. In particular, the Secretary always agreed with the commission's recommendations to build new facilities, enter into enhanced use leases, and collaborate with the Department of Defense and universities, but was less likely to agree to the CARES Commission's recommendations to contract out or close facilities. The decisions that emerged from the CARES process will result in an overall expansion of VA's capital assets. For example, the capital alignment alternatives the Secretary chose to meet future health care demand includes building 3 new medical centers and opening 156 outpatient clinics. In contrast, VA will completely close one facility. A number of factors, including competing stakeholders interests and legal restrictions, shaped and in some cases limited VA's range of alternatives considered during the CARES process. VA has started implementing some CARES decisions, but does not centrally track the implementation of all the CARES decisions or monitor the impact such implementation has had on its mission. VA has begun implementing 32 of the more than 100 capital projects and 32 of the 156 outpatient care centers approved by the Secretary during the CARES process. Although VA has over 100 performance measures to monitor other agency programs and activities, these measures either do not directly link to the CARES goals or VA does not use them to centrally monitor the implementation and impact of CARES decisions. Without this information, VA cannot readily assess the implementation status of CARES decisions, determine the impact such decisions are having on veterans' care, or be held accountable for achieving the intended results of CARES."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the largest health  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the largest health  care systems in the country.

However, its lasting result was to provide a set of tools and processes that  allow VA to continually plan for the future resources needed to provide  health care to our nation\u2019s veterans.

Although CARES will require substantial investment, the  Secretary noted that not proceeding with CARES would require funding to  maintain or renovate obsolete facilities and would leave VA with  numerous redundant, outmoded, or poorly located facilities. The Secretary  further stated that through the CARES process, VA had developed more  complete information about the demand for VA health care and a more  comprehensive assessment of its capital assets than it ever had before.  The Secretary noted that this information, along with the experience  gained through conducting CARES, positioned VA to continue to expand  the accuracy and scope of its planning efforts.

As VA increased its emphasis on  outpatient care rather than inpatient care, VA was left with an increasingly  obsolete infrastructure, including many hospitals built or acquired more  than 50 years ago in locations that are sometimes far from where veterans  live. To address its obsolete infrastructure, VA initiated its CARES  process\u2014the first comprehensive, long-range assessment of its health care  system\u2019s capital asset requirements since 1981. CARES is intended to  enhance outpatient and inpatient care, as well as special programs such as  spinal cord injury, blind rehabilitation, seriously mentally ill, and long-term  care through the appropriate sizing, upgrading, and location of VA  facilities. Since its inception in 1999, the CARES process has reached  several major milestones (see table 2).", "The challenge of misaligned infrastructure is not unique to VA. We  identified federal real property management as a high-risk area in January  2003 because of the nationwide importance of this issue for all federal  agencies. We did this to highlight the need for broad-based transformation  in this area, which, if well implemented, will better position federal  agencies to achieve mission effectiveness and reduce operating costs. But  VA and other agencies face common challenges, such as competing  stakeholder interests in real property decisions. In VA\u2019s case, this involves  achieving consensus among such stakeholders as veterans service  organizations, affiliated medical schools, employee unions, and  communities.", "As noted in our high-risk work, having an effective capital planning  process can help to ensure that the needs of veterans are being met.  Effective planning for capital investments is a very important task because  large sums of taxpayer funds are spent on capital assets and because their  performance affects how well agencies are able to achieve their missions,  goals, and objectives. We\u2014as well as Congress and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB)\u2014have all identified the need for effective  capital planning. (App. III outlines a set of effective capital planning  principles that we, as well as OMB, have identified.) One of these  principles is for agencies to evaluate a wide range of alternatives before  choosing to purchase or construct a capital asset. OMB guidance also  emphasizes the importance of evaluating alternatives. Specifically, OMB  guidelines state that when evaluating capital assets, a comparison of  alternatives is critical for ensuring that the best alternative is selected. In  its guidance, OMB challenges decision makers to consider the different  ways in which various functions, most notably health care service delivery  in VA\u2019s case, can be performed. In this regard, OMB labeled the  development of alternatives the single most important element in that  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CARES Process and Modeling Tools Drive VHA\u2019s Capital Planning Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In developing the model for analyzing VA\u2019s health care demand and  making recommendations for ways to meet that demand, the CARES  process provided VA with a blueprint that drives VHA\u2019s capital planning  process.

One of the  objectives of creating this departmental-level office was to strengthen VA\u2019s  capital planning process and ensure the coordination of planning and  investment decisions throughout the department. To streamline the  process for developing capital investment proposals, OAEM developed a  new process that requires officials to submit and review investment  proposal data in increasing levels of detail.

Some of these factors are similar to the challenges we  have identified in our review of real property management efforts across  the government. The factors we identified in our site visits are  summarized below.", "Competing stakeholder interests. Experiences from Walla Walla and  Big Spring illustrate the challenges that VA can face when considering  closing a facility or reducing services. In both locations, CARES workload  projections indicate that the demand for services is decreasing. However,  community and veteran groups as well as elected officials strongly  opposed reducing services or closing facilities. Rather, they argued for  preserving the status quo or increasing services. For instance, Big Spring  and Walla Walla stakeholders formed community task forces to explore  options for continuing VA services. According to a former Big Spring VA  official, approximately 2,000 members of the community attended town  hall meetings to discuss the future of the Big Spring facility. According to  VA officials and stakeholders, these efforts were intended to influence the  Secretary\u2019s decision to maintain or increase services. Although the CARES  Commission recommended closing or studying the feasibility of closing  the facilities in Walla Walla and Big Spring, the Secretary ultimately  decided to (1) build a new outpatient facility in Walla Walla and (2)  maintain inpatient services and expand mental health services in Big  Spring. According to VA, the Secretary\u2019s decisions in these two locations  were based on a variety of factors, including access issues, the condition  of the facilities, and potential reuse options.", "Facility condition and location. Experiences in Pittsburgh and Orlando  illustrate how the condition of the facility and its location can influence  decision making. According to a VA official, the Highland Drive facility in  Pittsburgh was in poor condition and not designed for modern health  care\u2014a fact that influenced the alignment alternatives considered. The  DNCP and the CARES Commission recommended consolidating services  in Pittsburgh\u2014specifically, by shifting services provided at the Highland  Drive facility to the two other VA medical facilities in Pittsburgh. In  Orlando, expanding the existing facility to meet growing demand was  ruled out as an option because there was inadequate land available at the  existing site to accommodate a larger facility.", "Access issues. Experiences in Walla Walla, Big Spring, and Orlando  illustrate how access issues influenced the alternatives considered and  recommended. VA facilities in Walla Walla and Big Spring are located in  rural areas, and are at least 4 hours drive time from other VA facilities,  including facilities with mental health services. In addition, although the  inpatient workloads at both facilities are projected to decline, demand for  outpatient services is expected to remain stable or increase at these  locations, according to VA. Based on our interviews with VA officials and  stakeholders, maintaining access to health care services was an important  factor in deciding not to completely close the Big Spring and Walla Walla  facilities. Similarly, a VA official stated that a new facility was needed in  Orlando to meet the CARES access proximity standard (i.e., within a 1- hour drive of acute patient care). In particular, only 45 percent of the  veteran population in VA\u2019s Sunshine Health Care Network live in an area  that meets this standard. Building a new facility in the Orlando area would  increase the percentage of veterans living within 1 hour of acute patient  care to 78 percent.", "Established relationships with other health care providers.", "Experiences in El Paso and Big Spring demonstrate how established  relationships influenced whether collaborative opportunities were  considered and recommended as an alternative. For example, according to  VA officials, collaborative opportunities between the VA facility in Big  Spring, Texas, and Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, were not  pursued, in part, because the two entities had no history of sharing  services. Conversely, VA and DOD have a history of sharing services in El  Paso, and as a result, considering further collaborative opportunities at  this location was a natural outgrowth of their current relationship.", "Legal restrictions. Legal restrictions on the disposal of property and the  use of enhanced use leasing in Los Angeles illustrate how legal restrictions  can influence the capital asset alignments considered and recommended.  A VA official at the West Los Angeles facility said that the value of  underutilized property at the site is considerable given real estate prices in  the surrounding area. As noted in the Secretary\u2019s 2004 Decision document,  VA is interested in finding uses for underutilized property. However, legal  restrictions have limited alternatives for the reuse or disposal of parcels of  the valuable but underutilized property. In particular, a 1988 law prohibits  VA from declaring as excess or taking any other action to dispose of  approximately 109 acres at the 387-acre VA campus in Los Angeles.

As  table 6 shows, most of these projects are in the construction phase,  although some are in the design phase. For instance, VA is in phase I of  designing a new hospital in Orlando, while it is in the construction phase  of consolidating three VA facilities into two in Pittsburgh. VA completed  construction for one CARES-related major capital project.", "In addition to these major capital projects, VA has started efforts to  develop new CBOCs.

For instance,  stakeholders in Big Spring, Texas, noted that it took almost 2 years for the  Secretary to decide whether to close the facility. During this period, there  was a great deal of uncertainty about the future of the facility\u2014as a result,  there were problems in attracting and retaining staff at the facility,  according to network and local VA officials. A VA official acknowledged  that implementation of some CARES decisions, notably the further studies  of the 18 facilities, have taken longer than expected and time frames have  not been established for implementing decisions on those facilities.", "A number of stakeholders we spoke to also indicated that the  implementation of CARES decisions has been influenced by competing  stakeholders\u2019 interests\u2014thereby undermining the process. For example,  several stakeholders questioned why certain projects appear to be on the  fast track, while projects in other locations, such as Orlando, have not  moved as quickly\u2014even though CARES data indicate a significant need in  these locations. We have previously reported that competing interests  from local, state, and political stakeholders have often impeded federal  agencies\u2019, including VA\u2019s, ability to make transparent capital alignment  decisions. As a result of competing stakeholder interests, decisions about  real property often do not reflect the most cost-effective or efficient  alternative that is in the interest of the agency or the government as a  whole but instead reflect other priorities. In particular, this situation often  arises when the federal government attempts to consolidate facilities or  otherwise dispose of unneeded assets. In its report, the CARES  Commission also noted that stakeholder and community pressure can act  as a barrier to change, and can serve to pressure VA to maintain the status  quo, such as maintaining specific services or facilities.", "VA has also taken steps to integrate CARES decisions into its strategic  planning process.

In response, the Secretary established a  permanent, senior-level CARES Implementation Board. According to the  Secretary\u2019s May 2004 CARES Decision, the board was to consist of senior  leadership from across the department, would work with the VA networks  to implement CARES decisions, and would report directly to the  Secretary. The board was charged with ensuring that CARES was  integrated into strategic planning and that all CARES decisions were  effectively planned, implemented, and managed. In addition, the board  was responsible for overseeing the additional studies that the Secretary  deemed necessary for 18 facilities. However, the board was disbanded in  February 2005, less than 10 months after the Secretary announced its  creation.

The CARES process was and continues to be a significant  undertaking for VA. For example:    CARES was a lengthy process\u2014over 3 years elapsed between the time VA  initiated CARES to when the Secretary issued his decisions. During this  time, VA put a number of decisions on hold in anticipation of the CARES  decisions. For example, according to VA officials at the West Los Angeles  facility, they were planning to develop a master plan for developing and  reusing its property prior to the CARES process. However, the  development of the master plan was suspended until CARES decisions  were made. Similarly, VA did not pursue a collaborative opportunity with  the University of Colorado in Denver, Colorado, in part, because VA was  waiting for the CARES decisions. In particular, after studying a possible  joint facility between VA and the university for several years, in 2002, the  President of the university asked VA to make a decision within 1 year. The  Secretary responded that VA could not commit to a joint facility within  that time frame because the proposal needed to be evaluated in the  context of the CARES Commission\u2019s report, which was not yet released.  The Secretary\u2019s response effectively ended discussions about constructing  and operating a joint facility in Denver.", "The CARES process was also a costly undertaking. VA did not track many  of the costs associated with implementation of the CARES process, such  as the staff resources spent on the process, and therefore could not  estimate how much was spent on implementing the process. However, VA  was able to provide us the contracts let in support of the process. The total  cost of these contracts was about $18.1 million.", "The implementation of CARES\u2014and the associated investment\u2014is  expected to yield a number of benefits for VA and our nation\u2019s veterans.  According to the CARES Commission and the Secretary\u2019s Decision  reports, implementing CARES decisions will improve access to health  care, modernize VA capital assets, decrease operating costs, and decrease  vacant space, among other things.

Performance measures  allow an agency to track its progress in achieving intended results.  Performance measures can also help inform management decision  making, such as the need to redirect resources or shift priorities. In  addition, performance measures can be used by stakeholders, such as  veterans service organizations or local communities, to hold agencies  accountable for results. Performance measures for CARES should be  output-based, measuring the level of activity over a period of time that was  generated by CARES. An example of an output measure would be the  progress VA has made in implementing CARES decisions within desired  time frames. The performance measures should also be outcome-based,  measuring the impact that CARES has on VA\u2019s ability to carry out its  mission or on the lives of veterans. An example of an outcome measure  would be the impact the implementation of CARES had on access to  health care for veterans\u2014that is, has access improved? In addition, VA\u2019s  performance should be assessed using nonfinancial and financial  performance measures, such as program costs or savings. VA, however,  lacks critical data, including the cost and timelines of implementing  CARES projects and the potential savings that can be generated through  alignment of resources. The CARES Commission noted these missing data  in the DNCP and when developing its recommendations.", "VA has over 100 performance measures that it uses to centrally monitor  agency programs and activities. Examples of these measures include the  percentage of used space compared to owned and leased overall space,  the ratio of operating costs per gross square foot, and the percentage of  patients waiting within 20 minutes to be seen. Many of these existing  measures are related to the goals of CARES. However, VA does not use  these existing measures to monitor the implementation and impact of  CARES decisions. Thus, VA cannot readily determine whether the  implementation of certain CARES decisions are achieving the intended  results.", "In addition, VA does not have some performance measures that could be  used to monitor the implementation and impact of CARES decisions. For  example, VA does not centrally monitor or track the implementation of  CARES decisions, a process that could be used as a performance measure  for CARES. The lack of such a measure hinders VA leadership and  stakeholders from assessing the status of implementation and making  necessary adjustments. Originally, VA planned to centrally track CARES  decisions\u2014and a senior VA official started to collect and assemble this  information. However, this effort was abandoned because there were  concerns it would duplicate efforts of officials at the network level and in  individual program offices within the department. According to senior VA  officials, individual networks and program offices are responsible for  tracking the implementation of the CARES decisions within their area of  responsibility. However, in our interviews with senior VA officials within  individual program offices and at the network level, there was confusion  and disagreement as to who was tracking what. For example, a senior VA  official stated that VHA\u2019s Office of Policy and Planning was tracking all  major CARES projects. However, officials from this office stated that this  was not their responsibility; they stated it was the responsibility of the  Office of Asset Enterprise Management.

For example, VA officials from the Sunshine Health Care  Network and the Desert Pacific Health Care Network stated that they  maintain a spreadsheet tracking the status of all their major construction  projects, including the status of CARES decisions. According to officials  in some of the networks we visited, the department does not require them  to track the implementation of CARES decisions.

However, factors such as competing  stakeholder interests and legal restrictions constrained VA\u2019s ability to  make difficult capital alignment decisions. Consequently, VA plans to close  or downsize only a few of its aging and outmoded facilities, making it  difficult for VA to redeploy and reduce the funds needed to maintain and  operate such facilities\u2014which was a major impetus of CARES.", "VA\u2019s challenge now is to ensure that CARES becomes an ongoing and  effective part of its capital asset management efforts and that CARES  decisions are carried out.

Currently, VA does not use, or in some cases does not have, performance  measures to assess its progress in implementing CARES decisions and  attaining the goals of CARES. Given that VA will seek billions of dollars in  additional investments to implement CARES decisions, the use of  performance measures is essential to ensure that these decisions are  achieving their intended results.

The three issues are as follows:  (1) Alignment/consolidation of services due to proximity: As part of the  CARES process, VA medical centers within 60 miles of each other were  required to evaluate whether the services could be consolidated. The West  Los Angeles facility is about 27 miles apart from VA\u2019s Long Beach facility,  and both offer comprehensive health care services and are affiliated with  teaching hospitals. However, certain complex services are done at the  West Los Angeles campus, such as neurosurgery, interventional  cardiology, and cardiac surgery. Despite the short distance between Long  Beach and West Los Angeles facilities, their location in highly urban,  congested settings may create extended travel times for veterans.  Consolidations have already occurred, mainly in the clinical support, and  administrative functions, and more are under way in geriatrics and mental  health.  (2) Infrastructure and life safety issues: The West Los Angeles campus  needs to correct seismic structural deficiencies for some of its old  buildings. Most of the buildings on campus require major repairs and  deferred maintenance, including seismic and structural upgrades. The  main hospital building is considered exceptionally high risk for earthquake  damage and has the potential to endanger patient and employees housed  in the building. Ensuring patient safety is a high priority for VA CARES  funding.  (3) Excess land use: Interest in the future use of VA\u2019s West Los Angeles  campus is a major issue. Given the size of the campus (387 acres with 91  buildings), the West Los Angeles facility has excess land and vacant space.  However, VA is legally restricted from taking any action in declaring 109 of  the 387 acres on the West Los Angeles campus as excess or taking any  other action to dispose of the property. Additionally, when VA was  provided EUL authority in 1991, VA was only authorized to enter into an  EUL for the 109 acres on the West LA campus if the lease is specifically  authorized by law. Leases relating to child care services for the 109 acres  have been specifically authorized by law. The West Los Angeles campus  currently has nine land use agreements, including a 10-year enhanced  sharing agreement (to expire in April 2015) with the Salvation Army and a  50-year revocable license with the American Red Cross, which expires in  April 2039.", "The network\u2019s CARES market plan proposed a majority of the vacant  space be reduced through the demolition of vacant buildings.
