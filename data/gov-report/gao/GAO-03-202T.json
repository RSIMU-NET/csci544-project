The testimony focused on RHS's and FSA's progress in referring delinquent debt for administrative offset and cross-servicing and Agriculture's implementation of administrative wage garnishment (AWG). During the hearing, Agriculture pledged to place a higher priority on delinquent debt collection and to substantially improve its implementation of DCIA by December 31, 2002. After the hearing, GAO made recommendations The Subcommittee requested GAO to review and provide an update on actions Agriculture has taken to resolve these problems. In addition, the Subcommittee requested that GAO report on the status of Treasury's implementation of a debt collection improvement account, a vehicle authorized by DCIA to give agencies financial incentives to improve their debt collection efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Recent actions taken by Agriculture demonstrate increased commitment to DCIA implementation. However, it will take sustained commitment and priority by top management to fully address the problems we identified. RHS has worked to address systems limitations that hampered it from promptly referring debts to Treasury for cross-servicing and is now referring all reported eligible debt. RHS will begin reporting certain loans' entire unpaid principal balances on accelerated debt as delinquent, beginning with its report for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. RHS is working on making regulatory changes needed for it to refer losses on guaranteed loans to Treasury's offset program, but the changes are not expected to be completed until about August 2003. FSA has developed an action plan to improve its process and controls for identifying and referring eligible debts to Treasury. GAO's review of documents related to the plan indicates that FSA has made progress toward implementing the improvements. In addition, by December 2002, FSA expects to be able to begin reporting information for some codebtors when referring delinquent debts for collection action; to begin referring debts quarterly, rather than annually; and to be able to refer eligible losses on guaranteed loans. Agriculture has taken steps toward departmentwide implementation of AWG. Agriculture has completed its AWG implementation plan but still needs to carry out certain elements of the plan, including obtaining from its component agencies specific information on the types of debt subject to AWG and finalizing an agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct AWG hearings on Agriculture's behalf. Agriculture has also drafted regulations necessary for implementing AWG, which may not be published until May 2003. Treasury has established a debt collection improvement account but, to date, it has not been activated because no amounts have been made available in Treasury's appropriations to fund the account. Agencies would be allowed to contribute a portion of their debt collections into the account, and amounts could be used to reimburse agencies for certain expenses related to credit management and debt collection and recovery. Because the account has not been activated, it is difficult to assess how effective it might be in improving federal debt collection beyond the debt collection improvements that have resulted directly from DCIA's major debt collection requirements for federal agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (Agriculture\u2019s) actions and plans to resolve certain implementation  problems involving the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA),  and the status of the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury\u2019s) use of a  special financial incentive provision of the act to encourage federal  agencies to improve their delinquent debt collection efforts.  During a  hearing on Agriculture\u2019s implementation of DCIA, which was held before  this Subcommittee on December 5, 2001, we stressed that the department\u2019s  implementation of DCIA requirements would have to improve vastly if the  debt collection benefits of DCIA were to be more fully realized. Also during  that hearing, Agriculture officials pledged to give debt collection higher  priority and to substantially improve the department\u2019s implementation of  the act by December 31, 2002. Subsequent to the hearing, we made a  number of recommendations to Agriculture to help it address specific  DCIA implementation problems that we identified and discussed at the  hearing. It is with this backdrop that you asked us to review actions taken  by Agriculture to resolve the specific DCIA implementation problems that  we identified and discussed. In addition, given the fact that in recent  hearings on DCIA implementation, little if any mention has been made of  the act\u2019s financial incentive provision\u2019s merits, you wanted to know  whether Treasury has established a fund or account to implement this  provision, and if so, which federal agencies have received payments from  the account and for what activities.", "Agriculture\u2019s full implementation of certain key provisions of DCIA is  critical to overall federal nontax debt collection.  As a major federal lending  agency, Agriculture continues to hold a substantial amount of delinquent  federal nontax debt. As of September 30, 2001, Agriculture reported  holding about $6.2 billion of debt over 180 days delinquent. In DCIA, the  Congress, with key leadership and support from this Subcommittee,  provided agencies, including Agriculture, with a full array of tools to collect  such delinquent debt. Among other things, DCIA provides (1) a requirement  for federal agencies to notify Treasury of eligible debts delinquent over 180  days for purposes of centralized administrative offset, (2) a requirement for  agencies to refer such debts to Treasury for centralized collection action  known as cross-servicing, and (3) authorization for agencies to  administratively garnish the wages of delinquent debtors.", "The primary emphasis of my testimony today is on corrective actions taken  by two major Agriculture components\u2014Rural Development\u2019s Rural  Housing Service (RHS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA)\u2014to resolve  problems associated with the identification and referral of eligible  delinquent debts to Treasury for collection action since the December 2001  hearing.

RHS officials told us that since implementing a new automated centralized  loan servicing system in fiscal year 1997, RHS had been unable to readily  identify direct SFH loans that are eligible for referral to Treasury for cross- servicing. Essentially, the system did not contain sufficient data to  differentiate loans eligible for cross-servicing from those that were not.   For example, the system needed to be capable of determining the status of  any collateral, because all collateral must be liquidated prior to a loan\u2019s  referral to Treasury for cross-servicing.

In April 2002, RHS made its first  automated referral of direct SFH loans to Treasury for cross-servicing. This  referral involved about 10,900 loans totaling about $165.6 million. RHS is  currently using its enhanced system to identify loans eligible for cross- servicing and electronically refer them to Treasury on a monthly basis.  According to RHS documents and Treasury officials, RHS has referred all  of the loans that it has reported as eligible for cross-servicing.

We subsequently  recommended that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Administrator of  RHS to maintain supporting documentation, in an appropriate level of  detail that can be made readily available for independent verification, for  all SFH debts reported and certified to Treasury as excluded from referral  for collection action. At a minimum, the documentation should include, for  each exclusion category, such as foreclosure, the total amount reported as  excluded on the certified Treasury Report on Receivables Due from the  Public (TROR) and a listing of the identities and dollar amounts of the  specific loans excluded.

Although we were not requested to and did not test the specific loans  excluded to determine whether they met relevant legislative and regulatory  criteria, RHS\u2019s ability to provide such listings should facilitate future  independent verifications of the validity of its reported exclusions, and is  critical for the oversight of the agency\u2019s DCIA implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Instructs Rural Development to Report Accelerated Balances for RHS\u2019s Direct SFH Loans", "paragraphs": ["Treasury is the sole operator of a governmentwide centralized debt  collection center. As such, it is critical that Treasury obtain accurate  information from federal agencies on the status of their nontax debt,  particularly the debt over 180 days delinquent, for which DCIA was  designed in large part to help agencies collect through centralized  collection. During the December 2001 hearing, we stressed that RHS was  only reporting the delinquent installment portion of its direct SFH loans as  delinquent in its TROR. It was not reporting, as required by Treasury, the  accelerated loan balance, which is the total debt due and payable.  In the  report we issued after our testimony, we stated that, as a result of such  reporting, RHS may have underreported to Treasury direct SFH loan  amounts delinquent over 180 days by about $849 million and direct SFH  loan amounts eligible for Treasury\u2019s offset program by about $348 million  as of September 30, 2000. We recommended that the Secretary of  Agriculture direct the Administrator of RHS to work with Treasury to  resolve any inconsistencies between RHS\u2019s reporting of delinquent debts  on its TROR and Treasury\u2019s instructions for such reporting. In addition, we  recommended that absent any modifications to Treasury\u2019s instructions for  preparing the TROR, RHS report the entire accelerated balance of  delinquent direct SFH loans to Treasury as delinquent debt and, absent any  allowable exclusions, as debt eligible for referral to Treasury for collection  action.", "After we made our recommendations, Agriculture and Treasury officials  met to address the inconsistency that existed between RHS\u2019s reporting of  delinquent direct SFH loans on the TROR and Treasury\u2019s instructions for  such reporting. In a September 2002 letter, Treasury informed Rural  Development that RHS should report the entire unpaid principal balances  as delinquent on the TROR, and requested that such reporting begin with  the TROR for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. Treasury stated in the  letter that once an acceleration notice is sent to the borrower, which has  been RHS\u2019s ongoing practice, the entire debt is due and payable and should  be reflected as such on the TROR. Treasury also stated that its decision was  based on consultation with its legal counsel and recent discussions with  Agriculture officials including its CFO.

RHS officials  told us that the agency could not pursue recovery from the debtor or utilize  DCIA debt collection tools because under the SFH guaranteed loan  program, no contract existed between the debtor and RHS. Consequently,  RHS did not recognize the losses that it paid to guaranteed lenders as  federal debt and could not apply DCIA debt collection remedies to them.  We were particularly concerned about DCIA debt collection remedies not  being available for RHS\u2019s guaranteed SFH losses because, according to  RHS, through September 30, 2000, such losses totaled about $132 million.  After the hearing, we recommended that the Secretary of Agriculture direct  the Administrator of RHS to finalize and implement necessary regulatory  changes and modifications to lender agreements so that losses on  guaranteed SFH loans could be treated as federal debt and referred to  Treasury for collection action.", "RHS is currently working on making the regulatory changes that are  needed to refer losses on guaranteed SFH loans to Treasury\u2019s offset  program; however, the agency will not be able to refer such losses until  regulatory action is completed and guaranteed loan applications are  modified. According to a RHS official, to expedite the regulatory  recognition of losses on guaranteed SFH loans as federal debt, Agriculture  is currently incorporating the regulatory changes that are needed into the  draft final rule for the Section 502 Guaranteed Rural Housing Program. It is  important to note, however, that the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) has determined that the final rule for this program will constitute a  \u201csignificant regulatory action.\u201d As such, the rule will be subject to a more  lengthy clearance process that will involve OMB review in the final rulemaking stages. According to a schedule provided by Agriculture,  which includes internal agency review as well as OMB review, publication  of the final rule for the Section 502 Guaranteed Rural Housing Program is  expected by about August 2003.", "Given that the aforementioned regulation is not expected to be finalized for  a considerable time, it is important to note that, as of our fieldwork  completion date, RHS also had not modified the guaranteed loan  applications for the SFH guaranteed loan program that are needed to  establish a contractual relationship between the debtor and RHS so that  losses stemming from SFH guaranteed loans can be recognized as federal  debt and be subject to the debt collection provisions of DCIA. Initially, an  RHS official stated that RHS planned to make changes to the applications  when the final rule for the guaranteed loan program is issued. However, we  pointed out that that approach could possibly delay RHS\u2019s ability to  recognize guaranteed loan losses as federal debt, and we suggested that  RHS change the guaranteed loan applications as soon as practicable so that  once the rule goes into effect, it may be able to be applied retroactively to  cover as many guaranteed loans as possible. As a result, according to an  RHS official, RHS consulted with its Office of General Counsel and  obtained approval for changing the guaranteed loan applications prior to  the issuance of the final rule. Currently, RHS is in the process of revising  its guaranteed loan application form to include an acknowledgement that  any claim paid by RHS on a guaranteed loan would be subject to provisions  of the DCIA.", "Once the regulations are finalized and RHS makes the necessary  modifications to the guaranteed loan application, the agency will need to  be able to promptly refer guaranteed losses to Treasury\u2019s offset program.  Given the fact that the SFH guaranteed loan program continues to grow  significantly, thereby increasing the number of loss claims being processed  each year, automated tracking of guaranteed loan losses and referring them  to Treasury will be critically important. RHS has initiated a project to  automate the tracking of SFH loss claims from lenders and payments made  to lenders to cover such claims, which it plans to complete in April 2003. It  is important to note, however, that the project does not cover the process  for the automated referral of guaranteed losses to Treasury. According to  RHS officials, this automated referral process will not be covered until RHS  initiates the second phase of the current project after April 2003, and which  is estimated to take an additional 9 to 12 months to complete.

We emphasized that, as a result, amounts of  direct farm loans FSA reported to Treasury as eligible for referral were not  accurate and, for certain loans, not only distorted the TROR for debt  management and credit policy purposes but also distorted key financial  indicators such as receivables, total delinquencies, and loan loss data.   Specifically, FSA automatically excluded from referral all judgment debts  without any review to identify and refer deficiency judgments, which are  eligible for Treasury\u2019s offset program and should be referred.  We  emphasized that, as of September 30, 2000, FSA\u2019s judgment debts totaled  $295 million, and our inquiries prompted the agency to initiate a manual  process to identify deficiency judgments eligible for referral.", "Moreover, FSA\u2019s Program Loan Accounting System did not contain current  information from the detailed loan files located at the numerous FSA  county field offices that would be key to determining a farm loan\u2019s  eligibility for referral to Treasury. In addition, there were no monitoring or  review procedures in place to help ensure that FSA personnel routinely  updated the detailed loan files that are the source of such key information.  The severity of this problem was reflected in the results of our statistical  sample of loans that had been excluded by FSA in four large states. Based  on our review of this sample, we estimated that about one-half of the  excluded loans in the four states had been inappropriately placed in  exclusion categories by FSA as of September 30, 2000. One of the most  frequently identified inappropriate exclusions pertained to amounts that  had been discharged in bankruptcy. Such exclusions involved debts that  FSA should have written off and closed out, in many instances, several  years prior to our test date. In addition, the written-off and closed-out  amounts for such debts should have been reported to IRS as income to the  debtor in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards and  OMB Circular A-129.", "After the hearing, to address these problems, we recommended that the  Secretary of Agriculture direct the Administrator of FSA to develop and  implement (1) automated system enhancements to make the Program Loan  Accounting System capable of identifying all judgment debts eligible for  referral to Treasury for collection action, (2) oversight procedures to  ensure that FSA field offices timely and routinely update the Program Loan  Accounting System to accurately reflect the status of delinquent debts,  including whether the debts are eligible for referral to Treasury for  collection action, and (3) oversight procedures to ensure that all debts  discharged through bankruptcy are promptly closed out and reported to  the IRS as income to the debtor in accordance with the Federal Claims  Collection Standards and OMB Circular A-129.

As of our fieldwork completion  date, FSA was using its Program Loan Accounting System and system- generated reports to better track the status of FSA\u2019s delinquent debts,  including judgment debts, for the purpose of meeting the DCIA referral  requirements. Specifically, FSA was generating an enhanced debt report to  include various types of debts under FSA\u2019s farm loan programs, including  judgment debts, to facilitate field office review of debts to determine  eligibility for referral to Treasury. In September 2002, FSA provided its field  offices the initial enhanced debt report and directed the field offices to  review the debts for accuracy. FSA plans to routinely use the enhanced  debt report in such field office reviews in the future.", "In addition, actions are being taken to improve field office oversight for  DCIA implementation. Beginning in August 2002, county field offices must  provide their respective state offices with documentation for loans that  they determine are ineligible for Treasury\u2019s offset program because of  bankruptcy, foreclosure, or litigation. The state offices, in turn, are  responsible for making the final decision regarding the loans\u2019 eligibility for  referral and for actually excluding the loans from referral. In addition, FSA  has amended its National Internal Review Guide to include specific  procedures that are designed to help ensure that state offices, among other  things, establish monitoring systems to accurately track borrowers in  foreclosure, bankruptcy, and litigation. The procedures are intended to  facilitate the timely and routine updating of information in the Program  Loan Accounting System to accurately reflect the status of delinquent  debts, including whether the debts are eligible for referral to Treasury for  collection action, and that all debts discharged through bankruptcy are  promptly closed out and reported to IRS. FSA\u2019s policy is to perform its  national internal reviews at state offices not less than every 2 years, and the  new procedures should improve FSA\u2019s implementation of DCIA\u2019s delinquent  debt referral requirements. It is important to note, however, that specific  actions in FSA\u2019s action plan that are needed to (1) ensure field offices are  routinely reviewing accounts for Treasury\u2019s offset program and cross- servicing referral eligibility; (2) ensure that field offices routinely monitor  the status of accounts and properly code them for foreclosure, bankruptcy,  and litigation; and (3) ensure discharged bankruptcy accounts are promptly  closed out, removed from the farm loan debt portfolio, and appropriately  reported to the IRS as discharged debts, have target completion dates of  September 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts Under Way at FSA to Begin Referring Codebtors to Treasury", "paragraphs": ["We stated at the December 2001 hearing that even though FSA reported  having referred $934 million of direct farm loans to Treasury\u2019s offset  program as of September 30, 2000, the agency has lost opportunities for  maximizing collections on this debt because it does not refer codebtors.

For example, the CFO plans to obtain individual AWG implementation  plans from Agriculture\u2019s agencies that include each agency\u2019s timetable for  implementation, written policies and procedures, and types of debt subject  to AWG.  In addition, Agriculture still needs to work with its agencies to  provide Treasury with authorization to use AWG as part of cross-servicing  and to complete the agreement with Veterans Affairs to conduct AWG  hearings on Agriculture\u2019s behalf."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury\u2019s Debt Collection Improvement Account Has Not Been Activated", "paragraphs": ["DCIA includes a voluntary \u201cgainsharing\u201d provision that allows agencies to  deposit a limited and defined portion of their debt collections into a special  fund account maintained and managed by Treasury. The law provides that  deposits into the special fund are available to the Secretary of the Treasury  for gainsharing purposes only in amounts provided in advance in  appropriations acts. The Secretary may make payments from amounts  appropriated to agencies for purposes related to credit management, debt  collection, and debt recovery. However, because collections are routinely  deposited into the general fund of the Treasury, appropriations would be  required in order to implement this incentive provision.", "Treasury has established a debt collection improvement account that can  be activated if its appropriations authorize the expenditure. To date, only  the Small Business Administration (SBA) has requested funding for  gainsharing through Treasury\u2019s debt collection improvement account.  Based on SBA\u2019s requests, Treasury\u2019s appropriation requests for fiscal years  1998 and 1999 included language for funding the debt collection  improvement account for up to $384,000 and $3 million, respectively.   However, the Congress made no amounts available in Treasury\u2019s  appropriations to fund the account.", "According to Treasury, because the debt collection improvement account  has never been utilized, it is difficult to assess how effective the account  could be in enhancing federal agencies\u2019 debt collection or what changes, if  any, should be made in the financial incentive area to improve debt  collection governmentwide.", "Although the effectiveness of DCIA\u2019s gainsharing provision cannot be fairly  assessed at this time, it is important that the provision be kept in proper  perspective relative to the overall effectiveness of DCIA in improving the  federal government\u2019s debt collection efforts.  DCIA contains specific  requirements for federal agencies to improve collection of their nontax  debts, namely referral of certain delinquent debts to Treasury for  centralized collection. While the pace of implementation has been slow,  and collection opportunities have been lost, progress is being made.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
