If not mitigated, the noise associated with these flights could significantly diminish the quality of life for communities surrounding airports and constrain an airport\u0092s ability to expand. Over the last 30 years, Congress has provided billions of dollars in grants under the Airport Improvement Program to airports to reduce and mitigate significant noise exposure. FAA\u0092s overall strategic noise goal is to reduce the population exposed to significant noise to fewer than 300,000 people nationwide.", "At your request, GAO (1) described how airport noise exposure has changed, (2) evaluated noise grant results, and (3) assessed potential future demand for these grants. GAO analyzed FAA data on noise grants, planned projects, and population exposure and reviewed relevant literature. GAO also conducted interviews with relevant airport and FAA officials and industry representatives, as well as visited seven airports that have used noise grants, judgmentally selected based on size, location, and other factors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of people in the United States exposed to significant airport noise has steadily declined from roughly 7 million people in 1975 to about 309,000 today. This change reflects large decreases in the size of areas that are exposed to significant airport noise and is primarily due to improvements in aircraft technology.", "Since 1982, FAA has provided $5.8 billion in Airport Improvement Program noise grants to 481 airports for residential and public building noise insulation and land acquisition, among other project types. The majority of grants went to airports that voluntarily undertook Noise Compatibility Programs (NCP). While these funds benefitted thousands of people, GAO identified two areas of concern regarding FAA\u0092s enforcement of project eligibility criteria that creates a risk that some undetermined amount of grant funds may have gone to projects that do not meet FAA\u0092s project eligibility criteria. First, FAA does not always require airports to maintain updated and accurate noise exposure maps to define eligible project areas. For example, half of the noise exposure maps\u0097which show the areas around an airport that are exposed to significant airport noise and are a key element in determining project eligibility\u0097are from the 1990s or earlier. For an airport to receive a noise grant, program criteria generally require that such maps are updated every 5 years, but nine airports received $87.6 million in grants in fiscal years 2010 to 2011 based on maps that predate 2000. Second, FAA has inconsistently implemented requirements that limit residential noise insulation projects to homes with interior noise levels above an established threshold. In the absence of FAA enforcement, airports have little incentive to update maps and limit residential treatment because doing so might eliminate planned projects expected by the public. Concurrent to GAO\u0092s review, FAA issued new guidance that should substantially address this risk if effectively implemented. Further, the results of noise grants are not linked to FAA\u0092s strategic noise reduction goal and measurement approach. For example, the goal does not include the results of noise insulation of homes and schools. As a result, there is insufficient performance information about the effects of noise grants and the extent to which noise exposure remains a constraint on airport growth.", "There has been an increase in the estimated cost of planned noise mitigation projects in FAA\u0092s 2011 National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems report to Congress, but a number of indicators point to a future decline in demand for grants for noise projects. Specifically, the 2011 report, compared to prior reports, includes a smaller portion of projects in the most significantly noise-impacted areas. Further, since the 2001 report, the number of airports planning eligible noise projects is down 16 percent, with about half the number of planned projects. Additionally, fewer airports are developing new noise compatibility programs and many of the 234 airports with such programs may be completed. For example, 102 of 137 airports with an NCP more than 10 years old received no noise grants since 2007, an indication that those airports may have completed all eligible projects in those plans. Finally, about a third of the people living in significantly noise-impacted areas reside near airports that have not completed, and may never complete, an NCP, a necessary step before an airport can use noise grants for residential noise insulation. This population, therefore, may never be reached by FAA\u0092s grant program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of Transportation align its strategic goal for noise reduction with the results of the noise grant program and establish corresponding performance measures. The department provided technical comments and agreed to consider the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The number of commercial and general aviation flights in the United  States is estimated to increase 20 percent by 2024, according to the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Since  1982, to address and mitigate the problems associated with airport noise,  Congress has provided a dedicated source of funding within the Airport  Improvement Program (AIP) for noise mitigation projects. FAA  administers the AIP, which has provided nearly $5.8 billion in grants since  fiscal year 1982 to sound insulate homes and other buildings near  airports as well as acquire land in, and relocate residents away from,  significantly noise impacted areas, among other noise mitigation   FAA\u2019s 2018 strategic goal for noise is to reduce the residential  activities.population exposed to significant airport noise in the United States to less  than 300,000 people. AIP-funded noise mitigation projects, administered  by airports, are FAA\u2019s primary tool to achieve this goal.", "FAA has an ongoing responsibility to balance the growing demand for  aviation capacity against the environmental concerns and effects on  communities caused by airport noise. Aircraft technology, the number of  aircraft operations, and noise levels have changed markedly since FAA  first began providing AIP noise grants. Moreover, the implementation of  the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)growth in aircraft operations that NextGen investments could spur may  lead to new demand for airport noise mitigation or new noise challenges.  As a result, it is not clear how well the AIP noise grant program will be  able to provide an appropriate and effective tool for addressing changes  in future airport noise exposure. In light of these concerns, you requested  that we examine FAA\u2019s AIP noise grants. Our report addresses the  following questions:  1.  How has overall airport noise exposure changed since AIP noise  grants were first funded? 2.  How have AIP noise grants been used by airports to mitigate noise  and what have these grants achieved? 3.  What is the likely future demand for AIP noise grants?", "To describe how airport noise exposure has changed over time, we  reviewed available literature; assessed the use of FAA noise models;  interviewed industry, FAA, and airport officials; and, for illustrative  purposes, performed Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of  changes in the areas exposed to airport noise near several large airports.  To assess how AIP grants have been used by airports for noise mitigation  projects and planning, we analyzed FAA data in the System of Airport  Reporting (SOAR). This database includes detailed information about AIP  grantees, Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) approvals, project types, and  other information. We performed a data reliability assessment of SOAR  that included electronic testing, review of FAA documentation, and  interviews with relevant FAA officials. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. To assess the likely future demand for AIP  noise grants we compiled and analyzed a range of data from different  sources. Sources included planned projects in the National Plan of   FAA\u2019s main planning tool for  Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS),identifying future airport capital projects; data on airports\u2019 Noise  Compatibility Programs (NCPs) and noise exposure maps, both key  documents for many AIP noise grants; and FAA\u2019s estimates of the  population exposed to significant airport noise. FAA calculates these  estimates with models that are broadly used and generally considered  accurate for the purposes intended. We did not independently assess  FAA\u2019s models. To illustrate the results of our analysis and better  understand the real world implementation and future of airport noise  programs, we reviewed noise programs at seven judgmentally selected  airports. These airports were selected to represent a range of sizes,  geographical locations, and use of noise grants. Information gathered  from these reviews is not generalizable to all airports. We conducted this  performance audit from October 2011 to September 2012 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since the late 1950s, noise from aircraft and other airport operations has  generated controversy within many surrounding communities and can be  a constraint on airport development and aircraft operations. As we have  previously reported, noise is one of the top environmental concerns at  airports.such as cities, counties, or port authorities, which have primary  responsibility for addressing community concerns about noise. The  federal government has a long history of helping airports address noise  concerns by, for example, defining how airport noise is measured;  providing a framework for assessing the impact of noise and for airports  to plan noise mitigation projects; and funding eligible noise mitigation  projects. Within this context, airports may undertake a range of noise  mitigation projects. The federal government has also required the use of   Most airports are owned and operated by public authorities,  quieter aircraft technologies. The Aviation Noise and Capacity Act of 1990  required that all commercial jets at civilian airports switch to Stage-3  aircraft by the year 2000. Airlines phased out the loudest aircraft over  time, and by 2000, the U.S. commercial fleet was composed of quieter  aircraft than in the 1990s.", "Pub. L.

For example, residential  development within the DNL 65+ dB contour is deemed incompatible,  whereas commercial and manufacturing development is not because of  the different impacts of noise on people. The NCP documents the noise  mitigation projects the airport proposes to implement and is submitted to  FAA for review and approval. The airport may offer mitigation measures  within incompatible land use areas that meet other eligibility criteria. For  example, a residence located within a DNL 65+ dB area that also has  interior noise levels above DNL 45 dB may receive noise insulation.  Airport participation in the Part 150 process is voluntary. The typical level  of noise in a suburban residential neighborhood that is not near an airport  is about DNL 50 dB and an urban residential area is about DNL 60 dB.", "FAA administers two programs that fund airports\u2019 capital development  projects, including noise-related projects. With the creation of the AIP in  1982, FAA had a source of funds to provide grants to airports for noise  mitigation projects. Congress reserved a set-aside specifically for noise  projects that is currently funded at no more than $300 million per year, but  has also expanded over time to include other types of environmental  projects including water projects at airports undertaken as a result of an  environmental record of decision for an airport development project and  certain types of air quality projects. Capital projects in approved NCPs  that meet AIP criteria are eligible for AIP grants. Further, airports can be  awarded AIP noise grants for some types of noise mitigation projects  without an NCP. First, in 2003, AIP noise grant eligibility was temporarily  expanded by permitting FAA to provide grants to state and local  governments for land use compatibility planning and noise mitigation  projects around large and medium hub airports if the airport had not  submitted a Part 150 study or had not updated its NCP for more than 10   Second, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA),  years.as amended, requires federal agencies to examine the potential impacts  associated with a proposed federal action, including potential noise  impacts. As a result, airport development proposals, such as adding new  runways or otherwise expanding capacity, must be reviewed for the  potential environmental effects as fully as technical, economic and other  considerations. Likewise, operational changes, such as changes in flight  paths, may trigger a similar review process, depending on the extent of  the likely noise impact. These reviews may require airports to prepare an  environmental assessment or may require the FAA to prepare an  environmental impact statement which could, in turn, lead to a noise  mitigation project that is eligible for AIP funding. Airports must match AIP  grants to varying degrees, depending on an airport\u2019s size. The second  FAA funding program for noise mitigation projects is the Passenger  Facility Charge (PFC) program. This program allows publicly operated  airports to charge passengers a fee and retain these fees for their use on  FAA-approved projects, including those that reduce noise. Project  eligibility criteria for the PFC and AIP programs are largely the same,  although an NCP is not required to use PFC funds for noise mitigation  projects. PFC funds can be used to match AIP grants.", "There are a variety of projects and actions to mitigate and reduce airport  noise that airports may use, some of which are eligible for AIP grants.  See figure 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Populations Exposed to Significant Airport Noise Have Declined Because of Improvements in Aircraft Technology", "paragraphs": ["The number of people exposed to airport noise has been steadily  declining for several decades, according to FAA. FAA uses a model,  called Model for Assessing Global Exposure from Noise of Transport  Airplanes (MAGENTA), to calculate a high-level national estimate of the  population exposed to different levels of airport noise. MAGENTA uses,  among other factors, airport-level information about the number of aircraft  operations, types of aircraft, flight paths, and census data for communities  near airports (see sidebar). Individual airports may have, through Part  150 studies or through studies undertaken for NEPA compliance, for  example, more precise estimates. FAA estimates that approximately 7  million people lived in areas exposed to significant airport noise\u2014DNL 65  dB or higher\u2014in 1975. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this exposure  declined to less than a million by the year 2000. FAA estimates that about  309,000 people currently live in areas at or above DNL 65 dB. FAA  estimates also show declines in the populations exposed to non- significant airport noise (i.e., below DNL 65 dB). For example, FAA  estimates that between 2000 and 2010 the number of people residing in  areas with DNL 60 to 65 dB decreased from about 3 million to 1.5 million  (see fig. 2). The downward trend in noise exposure has held relatively  steady despite overall increases in air traffic. For example, total U.S.  operations\u2014including arrivals and departures\u2014went up from  approximately 17.4 million in 2000 to 20.8 million in 2011, though some  locations have seen declines.", "FAA\u2019s model is intended to determine the population living within  geographic areas exposed to airport noise, regardless of whether the  houses or apartments have been sound insulated using AIP, PFC, or  other funds. Consequently, some percentage of the population that FAA  estimates is exposed to DNL 65 dB or higher lives in structures that have  benefited from noise insulation. There are no readily available data to  determine this percentage. Thus, FAA\u2019s model cannot be used to  specifically assess the results of AIP grants.", "As with the shrinkage in the populations living in noise-exposed areas,  the geographic areas exposed to significant noise around airports have  also generally been shrinking based on multiple recent assessments of  DNL 65 dB noise contours that we, FAA officials, and others have  conducted. Likewise, FAA and airport officials, as well as industry  representatives with whom we spoke generally agreed that the DNL 65  dB noise contours around airports have been shrinking. We did not  perform an overall assessment of the extent of this change because noise  exposure maps are updated at different times at the discretion of  individual airports. At all seven of the airports we examined\u2014including  two airports that have recently added runways\u2014noise contours have  shrunk overall, according to airport officials or our assessments of noise  exposure maps for these airports. For example, at Atlanta-Hartsfield  airport, the DNL 65 dB contour has become smaller since the 1980s  despite a tripling of airport operations. Likewise, at Seattle-Tacoma  International airport, noise contours are substantially smaller today than in  the past. Specifically, the DNL 65 dB contour decreased in area almost  60 percent, from approximately 14 to 6 square miles, from 1998 to 2009.  However, while noise exposed areas have generally become smaller  overall, the shapes of some contours may have changed or shifted over  time, decreasing significant noise exposure in some areas, but also  exposing new areas to significant noise. For example, while the DNL 65  dB area around Los Angeles International airport decreased from  approximately 13 to 11 square miles in total area from 1987 to 2011, the  shape of the contour changed and now includes different communities  (see fig. 3).", "Improvements in aircraft technology, spurred by federal mandates and  industry actions to reduce aircraft noise levels, have been the largest  contributor to the shrinkage in airport-noise-exposed populations and  noise contours. FAA and airport officials we spoke with generally agreed  that the phase out of the loudest aircraft\u2014specifically, stage 1 and stage  2 aircraft weighing over 75,000 pounds\u2014by 2000 and improved aircraft  and engine technology are the most significant factors causing noise  contours to shrink. For example, reduced air velocity moving through  improved engines has reduced engine noise. Likewise, acoustical liners  and improved air flap designs have reduced airframe noise.factors that may have contributed to decreased airport noise exposure  include the implementation of flight procedures that can, for example,  direct air traffic over less populated areas during arrivals and departures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Is Taking Steps to Ensure that Projects Meet Eligibility Criteria, and FAA\u2019s Strategic Noise Goal Is Not Linked to the Noise Grant Program", "paragraphs": ["AIP noise grants have been widely used by airports and have provided  noise mitigation to thousands of people.

Specifically, most primary airports have been awarded at least one noise  grant. General aviation airports have received $75 million in grants since  fiscal year 1982. Airports that have completed voluntary Part 150 studies  and have had an NCP approved by FAA have received the majority of  AIP noise grant funding. As of May 2012, 234 airports had an approved  NCP and received grants totaling about $5 billion. Primary commercial  airports account for 168 of the 234 approved plans. Of the remaining 66,  62 are larger general aviation or reliever airports. Additionally, grants  have been awarded to airports and communities outside the Part 150  framework following statutory changes in 2003 that allow for such  grants. During fiscal years 2005 through 2011, grants totaling $336  million have been awarded to 24 airports or communities that do not have  NCPs. These grants went to some of the largest airports in the country.  For example, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey secured  $134 million in grants for noise insulation of public buildings\u2014mostly  schools\u2014near Teterboro, Newark, LaGuardia, and Kennedy airports.", "AIP noise grants have funded a range of different types of projects,  reflecting FAA and airport priorities, with noise insulation and land  acquisitions receiving the most support. From fiscal year 2000 through  2011, out of approximately $3.2 billion total, residential and public building  noise insulation projects received approximately $1.7 billion and $456  million, respectively; property acquisition projects received $780 million  (see fig. 4). In addition, since fiscal year 2000, FAA has approved PFC  applications from 73 airports to collect nearly $2 billion for noise mitigation  projects.", "The distribution of funds reflects airport priorities and FAA\u2019s project  assessments based on AIP grant-scoring formulas as well as judgmental  considerations. FAA\u2019s grant scoring formula ranks proposed projects in  higher DNL areas above lower DNL areas and at larger airports above  smaller airports. For example, a proposed residential noise insulation  project in the DNL 70-74 dB range would score higher than a project in  the DNL 65-69 dB range, regardless of airport hub size. In addition to  formula scores, FAA made grant award decisions based on judgmental  factors such as input from regional FAA officials\u2014such as FAA\u2019s Airports  division regional offices or Airports District Offices (ADO)\u2014about an  individual airport\u2019s capacity to execute its proposals and consideration of  FAA regional priorities, as well as to meet national priorities. In recent  years, FAA has also considered information on the number of expected  beneficiaries\u2014whether residents, students, or other groups\u2014and  attempted to fund a mix of grants that will meet an annual beneficiary  goal. These beneficiary goals, discussed later in this report, are  measured in the number of people expected to benefit from awarded  grants. The fiscal year 2012 goal was 15,000 people.", "In the first decades of the program, noise grants largely went to projects  in areas most significantly impacted by airport noise\u2014generally areas  closest to airports\u2014while grants in more recent years have gone to  projects in areas that are less significantly impacted, but still deemed to  be exposed to DNL 65 dB or higher noise levels (see fig. 5). For example,  based on FAA data, all 385 acquisition and noise insulation grants from  fiscal year 1982 through 1991 went to projects in DNL 75 dB or higher  areas. In the last 12 years, as areas of higher noise exposure were  increasingly already addressed, a large majority of grants went to projects  in DNL 65-69 dB areas, the lowest significant noise-level eligible for  grants under the program. Also, most of the grants for planning activities  were awarded in the first half of the program\u2019s history. Specifically,  through fiscal year 2000, FAA awarded 332 planning grants for  approximately $50.3 million. As of 2000, 195 airports had approved  NCPs. Since fiscal year 2000, FAA has awarded 117 grants totaling  approximately $45.5 million for planning. Since 2001, thirty-nine airports  had new NCPs approved by FAA. In some cases, instead of conducting a  Part 150 noise study, airports completed environmental impact  statements for major proposed development that included developing  noise exposure maps that could be used to identify mitigation projects  eligible for AIP noise grants.", "Consistent with the grant trends discussed above, according to FAA and  airport officials with whom we spoke, planned projects within individual  airport noise programs were prioritized to first address the most noise  impacted areas or specific project types. At all of the seven airports we  visited, officials indicated that they began mitigation efforts with properties  in the noisiest areas that are typically closest to the airport or with  schools. For example, Burbank (Bob Hope) Airport in California first  insulated most of the schools inside the DNL 65 dB contour before  beginning residential noise insulation. At Boeing Field in Seattle,  residences in areas above DNL 70 dB were generally insulated first.  However, airport officials also noted that project selection can also  depend on practical program considerations, not simply noise exposure.  For example, before starting a residential insulation project, the airport  sponsor must identify and sign up homeowners and complete other  planning steps\u2014all of which take time\u2014and could lead to noise insulation  of homes in areas with lower noise before homes in higher noise areas  simply because they cleared these steps more quickly.", "As part of managing the grant program, FAA sets beneficiary goals for  AIP noise grants and tracks progress towards those goals.

For example, in fiscal year 2011, the awarded noise  grants benefited 10,913 people, short of the goal of 15,000, at nearly 40  percent higher per beneficiary costs than in fiscal year 2005. FAA officials  explained that these trends are partly attributable to increasing  construction costs due to inflation and more projects in higher cost areas,  such as San Diego and Los Angeles. Finally, as discussed more below,  these results are not reflected in FAA\u2019s overall reporting on the population  exposed to significant airport noise.", "AIP noise grants have been the most important source of funding for  noise mitigation projects, but other funding sources have also been used.  Officials representing all seven of the airports we reviewed agreed that  AIP funds were of great importance to their noise mitigation programs and  most stated that, in the absence of these funds, much less, if anything,  would likely have been spent on such projects. For example, Boeing Field  does not collect PFCs, and according to airport officials, its noise  mitigation program is highly dependent on AIP funds. However, many  airports do have other funding sources\u2014primarily PFC funds\u2014that can  be used for noise mitigation projects. According to FAA and airport  officials, PFC funds are most commonly used to provide the local  matching funds required of AIP grantees. For example, officials at five of  the six airports that we reviewed that collect PFCs indicated that PFCs  were used for noise mitigation projects as a match to AIP grants. PFCs  also have been used to supplement AIP funds. FAA officials indicated  that PFC funds may be used to speed up the completion of planned noise  mitigation projects in light of limited availability of AIP grants. However,  most officials agreed that projects essential to the continued operations of  the airport, such as runway rehabilitation and maintenance, were typically  a higher priority for PFCs than noise mitigation projects.

Federal regulation defines a  significant change as a 1.5 decibel increase or decrease in the DNL for a  substantial land area exposed to airport noise.

Several airport officials  acknowledged that the maps used in their AIP funded noise program  could overstate current exposure. Some airport officials we spoke with  explained that they were reluctant to update maps when doing so could  limit AIP eligibility for planned projects that the airport has already  promised residents. Airport and FAA officials explained that planned  project areas, as reflected in noise maps, need to be somewhat stable.  They emphasized that while noise exposure is constantly evolving, it  takes time to define a program, receive a grant, enroll people, and then  design and execute projects. According to these officials, planned  projects represent promises to communities, making program stability  important. Changing or canceling planned projects because of decreasing  noise can create public relations problems for airports, especially since  gradual decreases in DNL may be difficult for residents to perceive. In  light of these considerations, airport sponsors are unlikely to limit projects  to only those that clearly meet program criteria without FAA\u2019s insistence.  FAA, however, is responsible as the steward of the program for insuring  that AIP noise mitigation funds only support projects that meet the  program\u2019s eligibility criteria. Because the program has limited funding,  paying for noise mitigation that is no longer needed takes money away  from eligible projects that did not receive funding or from other aviation  priorities.", "Furthermore, program criteria\u2014including regulations and FAA guidance\u2014 require that only homes located in DNL 65 dB areas with interior noise  levels above DNL 45 dB can be approved for noise treatment, with limited  exceptions, such as neighborhood equity. For example, FAA\u2019s principal  guidance on AIP implementation explains that the design goal of  residential noise insulation should be to achieve a noise level of 45  decibels in all habitable rooms; homes with interior noise levels already  below this level should not generally receive noise insulation. This  guidance does not explain the method by which a project sponsor needs  to assess interior noise levels. FAA district officials told us that the only  practical way to determine interior noise levels is with testing. FAA  officials indicated that airport sponsors generally conduct interior noise  testing on a sample of homes to determine eligibility based on the 45 dB  criterion and to assist in designing acoustical treatments, but  acknowledged that not all airports and consultants were consistently  applying these rules. We found that interior noise assessments to  determine project eligibility had been conducted at only three of the six  airports we visited with residential noise insulation programs. Two of the  three airports tested samples of homes, and officials at one of these  airports noted that, to date, no homes have been excluded based on  testing results because all had tested above DNL 45 dB. The third  airport\u2019s program included interior noise assessment for all homes in the  DNL 65-69 dB contour to determine eligibility prior to including a home in  the insulation program. In that program\u2019s current phase\u2014focused on  homes in the DNL 65-69 dB contour in the airport\u2019s noise exposure  map\u2014less than half of the homes qualified for insulation following testing.  We also found that testing protocols differed at these three airports. For  example, some tests used artificial noise to simulate aircraft noise while  other test procedures relied on actual flyovers. The other three airports  we visited did not conduct interior noise assessments for eligibility, but did  do some testing for project design purposes. However, without  information on testing practices at all airports performing residential noise  insulation, we cannot determine the extent of the risk to federal  investments or how much, if any, AIP noise grant funding has gone to  projects that did not meet the eligibility criteria.", "Residential noise insulation projects may not have been limited to  residences that have interior noise levels above DNL 45 dB because FAA  has not consistently and routinely implemented criteria on interior noise  level assessment. These criteria do not delineate requirements and  protocols in detail. FAA officials explained that implementation has been  inconsistent because airport officials, airport consultants, and FAA district  officials have different interpretations of existing program criteria. FAA  guidance did not, for example, specify testing protocols fully. Further, as  with updating noise maps, there are disincentives for airports to rigorously  implement existing criteria. For example, as a result of assessments  some residents may not receive expected benefits, such as acoustical  doors, windows, and ventilation systems. Airport officials often have to  deal with community discontent when they explain why some residents  are eligible for noise insulation and others are not.", "At the time of our review, FAA, recognizing concerns about the age of  noise exposure maps and the inconsistent implementation of interior  testing criteria, issued program guidance in August 2012 to clarify existing  requirements regarding noise mitigation. According to FAA officials, the  guidance reinforces existing criteria on grant eligibility regarding the age  and accuracy of noise exposure maps and clarifies the DNL 45 dB interior  noise eligibility criteria. The guidance also addresses how interior noise  should be measured and will provide for a 3-year transition period that will  allow airports to continue with promised noise mitigation projects while  better aligning projects slated for 2014 and beyond with the eligibility  criteria. It is unclear whether FAA will fund projects during the transition  period that do not demonstrably meet program eligibility criteria. FAA  previously identified similar concerns about fund use and issued clarifying  guidance. Namely, the problems we found regarding potentially  inaccurate and old noise exposure maps were also identified in a 2002  internal FAA study.and 2001, grants were provided to airports based on potentially  inaccurate maps from the 1980s and early 1990s that pre-dated the  stage-2 aircraft phase-out. The study indicated that, because of shrinking  contours, some grants may have funded projects in moderately noise  impacted areas (DNL 55 to 64 dB) that should not have been funded. To  address this issue, in 2003, and again in 2005, FAA issued program  guidance requiring that all grant decisions be based on noise exposure  maps that are less than 5 years old or otherwise certified as a reasonable  representation of conditions at the airport. Therefore, it will be important  that FAA enforce and its district offices adhere to the new guidance to  ensure that noise grants are both eligible and targeted to the highest  needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Strategic Goal for Noise Reduction Is Not Linked to Noise Grant Program", "paragraphs": ["FAA has established an overall agency goal for addressing airport  noise\u2014which covers all noise-related agency efforts, not just the AIP  noise grant program\u2014to reduce the population living in significantly noise   This goal  impacted areas to below 300,000 people nationwide by 2018.is articulated in the Department of Transportation\u2019s fiscal year 2013  performance plan, FAA\u2019s long-range strategic plan\u2014Destination 2025\u2014 and other FAA performance documentation.

According to FAA and as would  be expected, 30 years into a voluntary program, airports that are likely to  pursue AIP-funded residential noise insulation programs have likely  already at least begun to do so. Some of the busiest airports in highly  populated areas have chosen not to complete an NCP.

However, in the  decades since the AIP noise grant program began, airports have  completed numerous noise mitigation projects and technology has  produced quieter aircraft and better operating procedures. Our review  shows that, now and going forward, the need for noise grants may be  lower than it was in the past. It is up to FAA to ensure that  future noise grants are directed to the remaining projects that meet  the grant eligibility criteria,  the agency\u2019s goal for addressing airport noise aligns with the current  airport noise problem, and  the measures used to assess progress accurately reflect FAA\u2019s  programmatic results.", "As implemented, there is a risk that some federal investments in noise  mitigation went to projects that may not have met existing eligibility  criteria, and if not effectively addressed, this risk will continue in the  future. FAA has not uniformly enforced the accuracy of noise exposure  maps and has inconsistently applied program criteria for interior noise  assessments. This diminishes Congress\u2019s and the public\u2019s assurance that  federal funding has been or will be spent appropriately and, to the extent  that some misapplication of AIP grants to projects has occurred, creates  the risk that more meritorious projects at other airports may not have  been funded. It is encouraging that FAA issued guidance to more clearly  articulate the program\u2019s eligibility criteria and has called upon airports to  review their noise programs to better ensure the eligibility of planned  projects.

However, there are  shortcomings to this approach. First, FAA\u2019s overall goal is disconnected  from FAA\u2019s primary tool to address noise\u2014the AIP noise grants\u2014 because it does not reflect the results of these grants. Beneficiaries of  noise insulation projects continue to reside or attend school in DNL 65 dB  or louder areas even though the noise exposure has been mitigated for  them. Second, approximately one-third of the estimated remaining  population exposed to significant airport noise resides near airports that  have yet to and may never establish an NCP. After 30 years, it appears  unlikely that this population will ever be reached by the current program.  FAA\u2019s strategic goal and measures do not account for this population. To  more effectively manage the program and target federal funds, goals and  metrics should align with the nature and extent of the remaining airport  noise problem.
