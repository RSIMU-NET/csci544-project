The countries engage in two high-level dialogues to address trade barriers and cross-cutting economic issues. These are the JCCT, co-led for the United States by Commerce and USTR, and the economic track of the S&ED, led by Treasury. GAO was asked to review China's bilateral trade commitments made in these dialogues. This report (1) describes trade and investment commitments China has made at the JCCT and S&ED; (2) describes U.S. agency tracking of China's implementation of these commitments; and (3) evaluates U.S. agency reporting on implementation. GAO analyzed documents, including public fact sheets stating commitments; interviewed officials, industry representatives, and other experts; used a structured process to categorize commitments; and reviewed reports officials identified as reporting implementation status of commitments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 298 trade and investment commitments made by China in the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT)\u2014184 since 2004\u2014and the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) and its predecessor\u2014114 since 2007. The commitments range from affirmations of open trade principles to sector-specific actions. GAO identified 11 issue areas to characterize the content of each commitment. The prominence of issue areas, measured in number of commitments associated with an issue area, differs between the dialogues, reflecting differences in the dialogues' structure and focus. Intellectual property rights commitments are among those most common in the JCCT and investment commitments are among those most common in the S&ED. (For a detailed inventory of commitments and their categorization, see GAO-14-224SP .)", "U.S. agencies track commitment implementation through several means, including outreach to domestic stakeholders, issue-based working groups with China in the JCCT, and consultations in advance of S&ED annual meetings. No single document is used to track implementation, according to U.S. officials. In addition, although there have been calls to use metrics such as exports and sales in developing commitments, agencies identified only one such commitment in the dialogues and cited challenges in identifying appropriate data.", "Although several reports on trade barriers present information on JCCT and S&ED commitments, information on commitment implementation in these reports does not provide a clear and comprehensive picture of progress across the dialogues. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) produces these reports with assistance from other agencies, including the Departments of Commerce (Commerce) and Treasury (Treasury). GAO's analysis of 10 software commitments from 2008-2011 shows, for example, that the implementation status of most could not be clearly identified. More comprehensive reporting would give Congress and other policy makers a clearer understanding of progress and the role of the dialogues as they continue to assess challenges in the U.S.-China relationship."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve understanding of progress through the bilateral dialogues in increasing access to China's markets, USTR, in conjunction with Commerce and Treasury, should work to improve reporting on China's implementation of JCCT and S&ED trade and investment commitments.

To describe U.S.  agency tracking of commitment implementation, we obtained and  analyzed documentary and testimonial evidence on relevant agency  activities. To evaluate U.S. agency reporting on implementation status,  we reviewed key reports that U.S. officials identified as containing their  assessments of the implementation of commitments made in these  dialogues, and discussed the results with officials and other experts.

According to senior U.S. officials, the United States  also engages with China at all levels of government in other bilateral  interactions, such as formal and informal conversations at U.S.-China  summits. In addition, the two governments discuss trade and investment  issues in multilateral forums, such as the WTO and the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.", "The JCCT, established in 1983, is the main bilateral dialogue for  addressing trade matters and promoting commercial opportunities  between the two countries.

The S&ED addresses  bilateral, regional, and global economic and strategic issues, both  medium and longer term. Under the S&ED, the two sides meet once a  year, alternating between Washington, D.C., and Beijing. The fifth S&ED  meeting was held in Washington, D.C., in July 2013. The S&ED has  strategic and economic tracks; the U.S. Secretary of State and China\u2019s  State Councilor for foreign affairs co-chair the strategic track, and the  U.S. Treasury Secretary and China\u2019s Vice Premier for foreign trade co- chair the economic track. From 2006 through 2008, the S&ED was  preceded by the SED, in which the two governments discussed the most  important economic, but not political, issues in the bilateral relationship.", "The S&ED\u2019s economic track has four pillars, one of which focuses on  trade and investment, and addresses short, medium, and longer term  economic issues. In setting S&ED priorities, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) and the National Security Staff lead an interagency  process, working closely with the Department of Commerce (Commerce),  the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and other agencies,  on trade and investment issues.

Commerce and USTR issue a JCCT fact sheet following the JCCT annual  meeting; Treasury issues jointly with China an S&ED fact sheet for the  economic track that presents the joint commitments negotiated by the  United States and China following the S&ED annual meeting. Treasury  also issues a U.S. fact sheet that discusses the benefits of the  commitments for U.S. workers and companies.

According to  Commerce officials, JCCT cooperative activities are undertaken with the  goal of advancing U.S. priorities and are often crucial for developing  successful policy commitments from China. They may involve discussions  with public and private sector participants focusing on issues or areas at  the pre-commitment level. For example, in 2009, China and the United  States held a program, pursuant to JCCT commitments, with public and  private participants to discuss legal liability for intellectual property rights  infringement that occurs on the Internet. There were JCCT commitments  related to this issue in 2010 and 2012 that resulted, according to U.S.  officials, in the Supreme People\u2019s Court\u2019s publication of a judicial  interpretation stating that those who facilitate online infringement will be  held jointly liable for that conduct. Similarly, the S&ED allows for activities,  such as consultations or technical exchanges, that are separate from  commitments but allow the two sides to engage in a dialogue on a range  of issues.

Additionally, differences in the formats of the  reports make locating information on a given commitment or issue area  across reports difficult in some cases. The lack of detailed information on  China\u2019s progress in implementing certain commitments makes it difficult  for Congress and other stakeholders to fully understand the progress the  United States is making in reducing trade barriers.", "Our analysis found several instances of incomplete reporting on the  status of specific commitments related to market access barriers in  sectors, such as software, and in cross-cutting areas such as industrial  policy. For example,", "We identified 9 commitments from the 2008-2011 JCCT, and 1 from  the 2011 S&ED related to software legalization. Based on our  analysis of the nine reports identified above, we were not able to  clearly identify the implementation status of most of these specific  commitments. For example, USTR has not reported on whether China  has increased resources devoted to conducting audits and  inspections as it committed to do at the 2011 JCCT.", "A second software legalization example illustrates a lack of clarity  across reports on implementation status. At the 2011 JCCT, China  committed to complete software legalization programs at the  provincial level by the middle of 2012 and to publish the results of its  software audits. The 2013 NTE report indicated that, because of a  lack of published information, USTR could not verify that China had  completed a program to ensure provincial governments used legal  software. However, the 2013 Special 301 report, issued a month later,  stated that China had completed the program. In addition to the  difference regarding completion status of the legalization program at  the provincial level, it is unclear whether China has implemented its  related commitment to publish the results of audits. Thus, it cannot be  determined whether the gap in implementation is one of program  completion or one of reporting.", "There has not been reporting on implementation of commitments  concerning certain Chinese industrial policies. Specifically, at the  2011 JCCT, China committed to ensure open and transparent  processes for developing standards for smart-grid products and  technologies. USTR has not reported on the status of implementation  of this commitment, despite having a specific report that describes  progress in greenhouse gas reducing technologies. The greenhouse  gas reports issued in 2012 and 2013 do not describe the steps taken  in the JCCT regarding this issue.", "USTR has not reported on the implementation of some commitments  made by China related to its use of technical standards to favor  domestic suppliers. In the 2011 JCCT, China reported on the  development and publication of revised safety standards for medical  devices, acknowledged the value of closer cooperation with the  United States on those standards, and committed to participate in an  information exchange program with the United States in 2012. The  status of that commitment was not addressed in either the 2012 or  2013 reports.", "Reporting on implementation of China\u2019s commitments to reform state- owned enterprises has been incomplete. In the 2010 S&ED, China  committed to continue its reform of these entities by, among other  actions, inviting non-public and foreign investors to take equity stakes  in them. China also committed at the 2010 JCCT that all enterprises in  China, including state-owned enterprises, will make purchases and  sales based solely on commercial considerations. As part of that  same commitment, it committed to leave such decisions to those  entities and to provide equal treatment to public and private  enterprises. USTR has not reported on the status of implementation of  these commitments in any of the nine trade-related reports.", "In addition to incomplete or unclear reporting on the status of  implementation of some commitments, differing report structures make it  difficult in some cases to obtain information across reports. For example,  we found reporting relevant to a 2010 S&ED commitment on new energy  technologies discussed in the import barriers section of the NTE report\u2019s  chapter on China, whereas the WTO Compliance report discussed it  under investment. Similarly, with respect to a 2012 JCCT commitment by  China to issue a catalogue for the purchase of official use vehicles, the  WTO Compliance report discussed the commitment in the intellectual  property rights section, and the NTE report discussed it in a newly  created category for the China chapter of the report, \u201cIndigenous  Innovation, Technology Transfer and Strategic Emerging Industry  Barriers.\u201d", "In interviews and documents, agency officials emphasized the need to  balance reporting on the status of implementation of commitments with  the requirement to avoid disclosures that would disadvantage the United  States in ongoing consultations. For example, in the NTE report, USTR  indicates that it does not provide estimates of the impact of trade barriers  that are the subject of ongoing consultations to avoid disrupting them. In  the case of the trade agenda, USTR may submit classified information to  Congress in confidence, if it deems necessary.", "The absence of clear and complete reporting on the status of  implementation of commitments makes it difficult for policymakers to gain  a comprehensive understanding of the progress made toward reducing  trade barriers through the implementation of commitments from the  dialogues.

Although at least nine reports present  information on the status of U.S. efforts to decrease trade barriers with  China, in some cases referencing the JCCT and S&ED, obtaining specific  information on implementation status from the reports presents  challenges.

Commerce stated that it would take GAO\u2019s ideas and  findings under careful consideration, but expressed concern regarding our  conclusion that lack of comprehensive reporting makes it difficult for  external parties to understand progress made in bilateral trade dialogues  with China. It further observed that assessments of reporting needs  should include consideration of resource requirements. We agree that  resource considerations are a key factor in agency approaches to  reporting, but believe that steps to make information on commitment  implementation status more comprehensive and accessible can be taken.", "USTR stated that it welcomed GAO\u2019s suggestions and would consider  them carefully, but identified several concerns. First, USTR expressed its  view that some commitments are more noteworthy than others and  counting and categorizing commitments can be misleading when used as  the basis for conclusions about the relative significance of issue areas.  We agree that not all commitments are of equal significance and reflected  that view in our draft report. We believe, however, that summary  quantitative information is one useful tool for conveying information about  the issues addressed in these dialogues.", "USTR commented that the report\u2019s discussion of agencies\u2019 tracking of the  implementation of China\u2019s commitments is generally accurate, but stated  that the role of U.S. stakeholders such as industry associations and  companies is not adequately reflected in the report. We agree that such  organizations are an important source of information on commitment  implementation and have added additional information in the report to  reflect their role.", "With respect to U.S. agency reporting on commitment implementation,  USTR stated that in its view the Administration\u2019s written reporting  currently provides congressional policymakers and other stakeholders  comprehensive information on China\u2019s implementation of JCCT and  S&ED commitments, and stated that it also meets with those parties on  these issues. It stated that not all JCCT and S&ED commitments warrant  discussion in the reports, but acknowledged that GAO\u2019s analysis identifies  commitments whose implementation status should be reported on and  has not been. Based on extensive analysis of agency reporting on the  implementation of these commitments, we concluded that information on  the status of commitments made in these bilateral dialogues with China is  not complete and easily accessible, which can make it difficult for  policymakers to identify areas of success and failure and assess options  for moving forward. We recognize that meetings with policymakers and  stakeholders are also an important part agency communication on these  issues.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the U.S. Trade Representative; the Secretaries of  Commerce, the Treasury, State, and Agriculture; the Director, Office of  Science and Technology Policy; and other interested parties.

We also interviewed  representatives of trade associations and research organizations.", "To describe the commitments, we conducted a detailed review of the fact  sheets issued at the conclusion of annual meetings at the JCCT from  2004 through 2012, the S&ED from 2009 through 2013, and the SED  from 2006 through 2008. Commerce and USTR issue a JCCT fact sheet;  Treasury issues jointly with China an S&ED fact sheet for the economic  track that presents the joint commitments negotiated by the United States  and China. (Treasury also issues a U.S. fact sheet that discusses the  benefits of the commitments for U.S. workers and companies.) According  to senior Commerce, USTR, and Treasury officials, the fact sheets  present the commitments negotiated between the U.S. and Chinese  governments. In addition to presenting the commitments, the fact sheets  also contain details of cooperative activities between the two countries.  We used the joint fact sheets for our analysis of China\u2019s S&ED  commitments because, according to senior officials, they reflect the two  governments\u2019 understanding of the results of the S&ED plenary meeting.  For the S&ED, we limited our analysis to China\u2019s commitments in the  trade and investment pillar of the dialogue\u2019s economic track. In our  analysis, \u201cS&ED commitments\u201d refer to the trade and investment  commitments China made in the S&ED in 2009 through 2013 and in the  SED in 2007 and 2008.", "We discussed the fact sheets with cognizant officials from Commerce and  USTR, the two agencies that jointly lead the JCCT for the United States,  and from Treasury, which leads the S&ED\u2019s economic track for the United  States, to obtain an understanding of the information they contain and  how they are put together. According to senior USTR officials, the  commitments as presented in the fact sheets are high-level political  commitments and are the outcomes of the structured dialogues  established to address and resolve a range of issues. While the outcomes  documents are not legal instruments, the commitments are taken  seriously, according to these officials.", "To identify the commitments, we separated the fact sheet text describing  steps taken by China into individual commitments, created a database,  and systematically analyzed individual commitments. The fact sheets  state China\u2019s commitments, U.S. commitments, and joint U.S-China  commitments. We excluded fact sheet text reflecting U.S. commitments,  but included statements about commitments made jointly by the United  States and China and by China alone.", "We identified 184 JCCT commitments and 114 S&ED trade and  investment commitments. (An inventory of the commitments we identified  and their categorization by issue area, described below, is provided in an  online e-supplement, GAO-14-224SP.) JCCT fact sheets, written by the  U.S. government, are typically written in bulleted form, with each bullet  generally considered by us as one commitment. S&ED fact sheets are  different in that the precise wording of every commitment is negotiated  jointly by the U.S. and Chinese governments. The 2013 S&ED fact sheet  listed the trade and investment commitments in bulleted format. Prior to  that, the commitments were written in paragraphs that included  statements on multiple topics. The JCCT and S&ED fact sheets vary in  terms of the number of areas and activities addressed, and in the  specificity of the statements. We discussed with U.S. agencies ways to  identify and count specific commitments in fact sheets, and determined  that there is no single way to do so. For example, an analysis of the  S&ED fact sheets for 2009 through 2012 might treat a paragraph as a  commitment. We chose to break some paragraphs into multiple  commitments, using decision rules that we developed to ensure the  consistency and completeness of this exercise. These included whether  the paragraph referred to more than one intended action or discrete  concept, and whether it specified a deadline. In addition, if the same or  similarly worded commitment was made in multiple years, we counted it  anew each time.", "After identifying individual commitments, we categorized them by several  characteristics (issue areas, joint or China-only, deadline). We identified  11 issue areas to characterize the content of each commitment after an  iterative review of all of the commitments in our database by several  analysts. To support development of these categories we used as a  reference point categories developed in a previous GAO report on  China\u2019s commitments as well as the headers used in JCCT source  documents. (S&ED fact sheets do not use headers and sub-headers for  the commitments in the trade and investment pillar.) These were adapted  and recombined producing a set of categories that took into account the  specific language of the specific sets of commitments from recent years  and covered both dialogues. See the list of issue areas with descriptions  and examples in table 2.", "We then assessed each commitment for the issue area(s) it covered.  Because many commitments covered multiple issue areas, we assigned  up to three issue areas to each commitment. Ninety-nine of the 184 JCCT  commitments and 55 of the 114 S&ED commitments were associated  with two or three issue areas. We identified some commitments that did  not fit any of the 11 issue areas and categorized these commitments as  \u201cother.\u201d", "Many commitments, including 110 JCCT and 11 S&ED commitments,  were related to specific sectors (see examples for agriculture and  software in table 2). We identified 15 sectors: agriculture,  distribution/retail, information technology and security, insurance, new  energy vehicles, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, postal/courier,  shipping, software, steel, telecommunications, textiles, transportation,  travel and tourism, and wind power. We discussed this methodology with  officials from Commerce, USTR, Treasury, State, and USDA.", "To ensure the validity of this analysis we performed multiple sets of  reviews and checks. Initial testing of subsets of the commitments was  done by two analysts and a methodologist. The full analysis of all  commitments was performed by two analysts who cross-checked each  other\u2019s analysis and reconciled differences through discussion. A  methodologist provided a spot-check of the analysis. Finally, the full team  met and discussed in detail every commitment to ensure final consensus  on the issue area categorization.", "To describe how agencies track the status of implementation of  commitments, we interviewed officials and reviewed documents from  Commerce, USTR, Treasury, State, USDA, and OSTP. We also  discussed these issues with U.S. embassy staff in Beijing, via  videoconference. We discussed with the officials their processes for  tracking commitment status, and sought corroborating information where  needed. For example, we sought corroborating information from officials  concerning their engagement with China in other various bilateral and  multilateral forums, and their obtaining input from industry stakeholders  and U.S. government officials based overseas. We corroborated this  information by reviewing public reports from the outcomes of other  diplomatic forums such as minutes from World Trade Organization  standing committee meetings and public comments submitted by industry  officials in conjunction with agency preparation of public reports. We also  reviewed a cable from the 2010 JCCT mid-year review and a cable about  the 2010 S&ED annual meeting. Finally, we reviewed agendas for the  2010-2012 JCCT mid-term reviews. We also interviewed industry  associations.", "With respect to the use of tools such as tracking sheets to maintain and  share information on commitment implementation, we discussed agency  staff-level methods for tracking the status of commitments with officials  from Commerce. For contextual purposes, we also discussed with State  officials their process for tracking the status of commitments in the  strategic track of the S&ED. We discussed with Commerce staff the  characteristics and use of a tracking document developed by staff for  compiling information on commitment implementation for use in briefing  senior officials for key meetings.", "To evaluate how U.S. agencies report on the status of commitment  implementation, we asked agency officials and consulted agency  documents to identify relevant public documents and other types of  reports they use to inform the public and Congress on the outcomes and  status. They identified nine reports that describe administration efforts to  reduce trade barriers through negotiations, consultations and dispute  settlement, which are identified in the body of this report. To make  assessments of the reporting that we identified across the reporting  documents, we focused primarily on identifying information that  specifically referenced the status of implementation of the commitment by  the Chinese government or other relevant Chinese entities. To assess the  completeness of the reporting, we examined the nine reports for  information on the status of implementation of commitments made in the  JCCT and the S&ED in 2010 and 2011 and in additional years\u20142008 and  2009\u2014related to software legalization. We examined these commitments  related to software legalization because intellectual property was a  prominent JCCT issue area and we had identified software earlier in our  review as a potential illustrative area. For each of these commitments, we  reviewed reporting subsequent to when the commitment was made. The  assessment included keyword searches of the nine reports.. For example,  for a software legalization commitment we performed keyword searches  using \u201csoftware,\u201d \u201clegalization,\u201d and other terms specific to the  commitment. We also did a more general reading of reporting language  relevant to a given commitment. This analysis was reviewed by a second  analyst and any differences the reviewer had with the original analysis  were reconciled.", "We reviewed the congressional budget justifications for Commerce,  USTR, Treasury, and USDA to describe how U.S. efforts to track and  report on the status of China\u2019s implementation of commitments supported  agency and administration goals. We also reviewed comments from  industry representatives submitted in conjunction with the preparation of  statutory reports.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 to February 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
