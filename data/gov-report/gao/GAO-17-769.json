Its training ranges within the United States and overseas  help prepare forces to face combat and complex missions around the  globe. As DOD seeks to provide training on its ranges to sustain military  readiness, challenges related to range capabilities and encroachment  continue to grow, new challenges emerge, and dynamic conditions and  events exacerbate existing challenges. According to DOD\u2019s 2017 Report  to Congress on Sustainable Ranges (hereinafter referred to as DOD\u2019s  2017 Sustainable Ranges Report), range capability challenges include  insufficient resources as well as outdated equipment and systems that  require updates in order to complete current training requirements. In  addition, the military services continue to face encroachment challenges  that include endangered species and critical habitat; incompatible  development and land use adjacent to DOD training areas, to include  foreign investment located in proximity to military training areas; effects  related to the reallocation of electromagnetic spectrum as a result of the  National Broadband Plan; and effects related to climate change. Further,  DOD\u2019s 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report states that the implementation of  the Budget Control Act of 2011 continues to affect DOD and the military  services through changes in force structure and significant reductions in  funding for operations and maintenance, military construction, and  research and development investments, as well as acquisition programs.  To work within these limits and increase the long-term sustainability of its  military range resources, DOD has launched a number of efforts aimed at  both preserving its training ranges and addressing the effects of its  training activities on the environment and on local communities through  the issuance of policy, the establishment of programs, and proactive  partnering at the federal, state, and local levels.", "Section 366 of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2003 required DOD to submit to Congress, at the same time  as the President submitted his budget for fiscal year 2004, a  comprehensive plan for using existing authorities available to the  department to address training constraints caused by limitations on the  use of military lands, marine areas, and airspace in the United States and  overseas. Further, section 366, as amended, requires the Secretary of  Defense to submit an annual progress report to Congress through fiscal  year 2018 at the same time as the President\u2019s budget. Since 2004, DOD  has submitted an annual Sustainable Ranges Report to address these  requirements. Additionally, the act includes a provision for us to submit  annual evaluations of DOD\u2019s reports to Congress within 90 days of  receiving these reports from DOD. This report assesses the extent to  which DOD met the statutory reporting requirements for its 2017  Sustainable Ranges Report. This is our fourteenth annual review of  DOD\u2019s Sustainable Ranges Report.", "To determine whether DOD\u2019s 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report met the  statutory reporting requirements specified in section 366 of the Bob  Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (as  amended) we reviewed the report and compared it with the statutory  requirements contained in section 366, as amended. Specifically, two  independent analysts reviewed the 2017 report to determine whether the  report included information that met the reporting requirements. We  considered a requirement to be \u201cmet\u201d if the 2017 Sustainable Ranges  Report provided evidence concerning all requirements of the sub-section.  We considered the requirement to be \u201cpartially met\u201d if the report provided  evidence concerning some of the requirements and \u201cnot met\u201d if the report  did not provide any evidence concerning the requirements. We also  compared the 2015 and 2016 reports to determine what changes, if any,  DOD had made since its most recent Sustainable Ranges Report. We  also reviewed the memorandum that the Office of the Secretary of  Defense sent to the military services to request data for the 2016 and  2017 Sustainable Ranges Reports to determine what differences, if any,  there were in the types of information requested from each of the military  services. Finally, we obtained responses from officials of the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training  and from the military services on changes, if any, to the services\u2019  submissions of information on training ranges to DOD for the 2017 report,  and any challenges DOD faced in preparing the report. The intent of our  review was not to comprehensively evaluate the data presented in DOD\u2019s  2017 Sustainable Ranges Report, but rather to determine the extent to  which the report met mandated statutory requirements and whether DOD  faced challenges in preparing its report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May to September 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The provision that we evaluate  the plans submitted pursuant to section 366 within 90 days of receiving  the report from DOD has also been extended through fiscal year 2018.", "In our prior reviews of DOD\u2019s Sustainable Ranges Reports, we found that  DOD did not address certain required elements when it initially submitted  its comprehensive plan in 2004. Further, we noted that it took DOD some  time to develop a plan consistent with the basic requirements of section  366. Over time, we found that as DOD reported annually on its progress  in implementing its comprehensive plan, it continued to improve its  Sustainable Ranges Reports, and it has reported on the actions it has  taken in response to prior GAO recommendations. Specifically, in 2013  we reported that DOD had implemented all 13 of the recommendations  we had made since 2004 for expanding and improving DOD\u2019s reporting  on sustainable ranges. Further, DOD has progressed from using four  common goals and milestones to using seven shared goals for which the  services have developed their own actions and milestones that are  tailored to their missions. We have reported that these new goals and  milestones are more quantifiable and now are associated with identified  time frames."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report Met the Annual Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report met the annual statutory  reporting requirements to describe DOD\u2019s progress in implementing its  sustainable ranges plan and any actions taken or to be taken in  addressing constraints caused by limitations on the use of military lands,  marine areas, and airspace. In its 2017 report, DOD provided updates to  the plan that were required by the act. These updates included: (1)  proposals to enhance training range capabilities and address any  shortfalls in current resources; (2) goals and milestones for tracking  planned actions and measuring progress in the implementation of its  training range sustainment plan; and (3) projected funding requirements  for implementing its planned actions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Reported Proposals to Enhance Range Capabilities and Address Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["In our review of DOD\u2019s 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report, we found that,  as required by statute, DOD reported on its proposals to enhance training  range capabilities and address any shortfalls in resources. DOD  developed these proposals by evaluating current and future training range  requirements and the ability of current DOD resources to meet these  requirements. In its 2017 report, DOD revalidated its 2015 individual  range capability and encroachment assessments and the current and  future military service training range requirements. To do so, DOD  updated the report sections pertaining to each military service\u2019s issues  related to range capability, encroachment, and special interests to the  military service. For instance, regarding the Marine Corps, the report  noted, among other things, that the Marine Corps has identified the need  for an aviation training range on the East Coast of the United States  capable of supporting precision-guided munitions training. The report  states that the Marine Corps selected the expansion of Townsend  Bombing Range in Georgia as the best alternative for securing this East  Coast capability after a thorough assessment of area capabilities. The  report notes that a record of decision to expand Townsend was signed in  January 2014, and that a formal airspace proposal supporting the land  expansion has been submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration.  The report further stated that full operational capability is now planned for  December 2019.", "In its 2017 report, DOD also reported on seven evolving activities and  emerging issues, all of which were reported in its 2016 report. These  seven activities and issues were as follows: (1) new sustainable range  initiative-related influences and actions; (2) budget reductions impacting  range capability; (3) foreign investment and national security; (4)  threatened and endangered and candidate species; (5) demand for  electromagnetic spectrum; (6) continued growth in domestic use of  unmanned aircraft systems; and (7) offshore energy. DOD\u2019s 2017 report  outlined some actions being taken to mitigate the challenges these issues  may present for DOD test and training ranges. For example, in response  to new sustainable range initiative-related influences, DOD responded to  a recommendation in Senate Armed Services Committee Report 114-49  to include a review of the general capabilities, critical issues, and future  capabilities necessary to support Special Operations Forces (SOF) range  requirements. The 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report is the first to  incorporate SOF-specific range issues.", "Foreign investment and its effects on national security continue to be an  evolving issue faced by DOD. In an April 2016 report, we evaluated the  extent to which DOD made progress in its efforts to assess the national  security risks and effects of foreign encroachment. In that review, we  found that DOD had made limited progress in addressing foreign  encroachment on federally managed land since we had last reported on  the subject in December 2014. We also found that DOD has begun to  take some steps toward assessing the national security risks and effects  of foreign encroachment, but had not yet fully implemented the  recommendations from our December 2014 report, which were as  follows: (1) that DOD should develop and implement guidance for  conducting a risk assessment on foreign encroachment and (2) that DOD  should collaborate with other federal agencies to obtain additional  information on transactions near ranges. DOD concurred with both  recommendations. According to the 2017 report, DOD is pursuing  opportunities to obtain information related to foreign investment and  transactions in proximity to DOD mission-essential locations from  agencies with land management authority as well as conducting a risk  assessment related to those locations. In addition, DOD reported that it is  considering seeking legislative relief to enhance data-collection and data- sharing practices regarding foreign investment in the proximity of DOD  mission-essential locations as an avenue to mitigate national security- related encroachment, and it has engaged the various federal land  managers to expound on potential issues related to DOD concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Used Goals and Milestones to Describe Its Progress in Implementing Its Comprehensive Training Range Sustainment Plan", "paragraphs": ["In its 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report, DOD used goals and milestones  to address the statutory requirement to describe its progress in  implementing its comprehensive training range sustainment plan. DOD  has seven goals, as follows, in support of this plan: (1) mitigate  encroachment pressures on training activities from competing operating  space; (2) mitigate electromagnetic spectrum competition; (3) meet  military airspace challenges; (4) manage increasing military demand for  range space; (5) address affects resulting from new energy infrastructure  and renewable energy; (6) anticipate climate change effects; and (7)  sustain excellence in environmental stewardship.", "Using these goals as a common framework, each military service  developed its own milestones and needed actions for reaching those  milestones. In DOD\u2019s 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report, each service  provided updates to its milestones and actions based on annual  assessment data. The report included the following examples:", "The Army has ongoing actions to mitigate electromagnetic spectrum  competition on ranges. For example, the Army reported that  installation of fiber optic cabling has been completed at approximately  20 installations to support wireless networks and targeting control  systems in order to mitigate electromagnetic spectrum interference on  ranges.", "The Navy has ongoing interactions with Bureau of Ocean Energy  Management state renewable energy task forces to support  assessments of proposed wind energy developments to minimize  effects on Navy and DOD offshore readiness.", "The Marine Corps has ongoing actions to engage in regulatory and  legislative processes at the local, state, and national levels on issues  that may affect range sustainability or readiness. The Marine Corps is  also exploring partnerships to meet natural resource regulatory  responsibilities.", "The Air Force is engaged in ongoing development of the Center  Scheduling Enterprise flight scheduling system for use at Air Force  Ranges. In addition, the Air Force is developing an interface between  its flight scheduling system and the Army/Marine Corps Range Facility  Management Support System, to facilitate scheduling across military  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Reported Its Projected Funding Requirements for Implementing Planned Actions", "paragraphs": ["In the 2017 Sustainable Ranges Report, DOD met the statutory  requirement to track its progress in implementing the comprehensive plan  by identifying the funding requirements needed to accomplish its goals.  DOD delineated the following four funding categories to be used by the  services to project their range sustainment efforts: (1) modernization and  investment; (2) operations and maintenance; (3) environmental; and (4)  encroachment. The funding requirements section of the 2017 report  includes descriptions and specific examples for each funding category, as  well as actual funding levels for fiscal year 2016 and requested funding  levels for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. For example, the encroachment  category is described as funding dedicated to actions optimizing  accessibility to ranges by minimizing restrictions that do or could limit  range activities, including outreach and buffer projects. Specific examples  of encroachment funding include Army Compatible Use Buffer program  administration and support and encroachment planning efforts. The report  also provides an explanation of any fluctuations occurring over the 5-year  funding period covered in the report. For example, the Air Force\u2019s  requested funding for the modernization and investment category  fluctuated from $48.3 million in fiscal year 2017 to $236.8 million in fiscal  year 2020 to $185.6 million in fiscal year 2021. The Air Force attributes  this planned fluctuation to a decision to infuse funding in range  infrastructure to research, develop, procure, and sustain advanced threat  emitters, range communications/networks, and datalink systems, among  other things."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report.
