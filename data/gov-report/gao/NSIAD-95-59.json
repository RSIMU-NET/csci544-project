The stated rationale for concurrency is to introduce systems in a more timely manner or to fulfill an urgent need, to avoid technology obsolescence and/or to maintain an efficient industrial development/production work force. For measuring the degree of concurrency in this report we used a statutorily required guide issued by the Department of Defense (DOD) in April 1990 for assessing concurrency and associated risk in major acquisition programs. Its measure of concurrency is the amount of initial operational testing and evaluation (IOT&E) completed before entering production of a system.", "Initial operational tests are field tests intended to demonstrate a system\u2019s effectiveness and suitability for military use. IOT&E is a key internal control to ensure that decisionmakers have objective information available on a weapon system\u2019s performance and to minimize risks of procuring costly and ineffective systems.", "In the late 1980s, the Congress found that DOD was acquiring a large portion of total program quantities, using the low-rate initial production (LRIP) concept, without successfully completing IOT&E. As a result, legislation was enacted in 1989 to limit LRIP quantities for major systems. The law, 10 U.S.C. 2400, defined LRIP as the minimum production quantity needed to provide production representative articles for IOT&E, establish an initial production base, and permit an orderly increase in the production rate sufficient to lead to full-rate production after completion of IOT&E.", "In the conference report supporting the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 101-189), the conferees indicated that LRIP quantities should not total a significant percentage of a total planned procurement. Later, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 prescribed new controls for LRIP. The act states that the Secretary of Defense must specifically explain to the Congress why any planned LRIP quantities exceed 10 percent of a planned production quantity of a system, as defined at the milestone II or development decision. This provision, however, was not in effect when the F-22 program reached milestone II.", "The F-22 passed milestone II in 1991. At that time, the Air Force planned to acquire 648 F-22 operational aircraft at a cost of $86.6 billion. After the Bottom Up Review, completed by DOD in September 1993, the planned quantity of F-22s was reduced to 442 at an estimated cost of $71.6 billion.", "We recently reported that aircraft systems, including the T-45 trainer aircraft, B-1B bomber, and the C-17 cargo aircraft, as well as many other smaller systems, entered LRIP before successfully completing any IOT&E.This resulted in the purchase of systems requiring significant and sometimes costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance, acceptance of less capable systems than planned, and in some cases deployment of substandard systems to combat forces.", "The LRIP contract award is scheduled for September 1997.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense defined a highly concurrent program as one that proceeds into LRIP before significant IOT&E is complete.", "Using DOD guidelines, concurrency in the F-22 program is high because the F-22 program is scheduled to proceed into LRIP well before any IOT&E is started. Further, considering the new technology advancements being developed for use in the aircraft, the level of concurrency increases the cost, schedule, and technical risks of the program. We found that development flight tests of critical F-22 technology advances are not scheduled to begin until about 1 year after LRIP is scheduled to start and over $2 billion will have been committed to procure F-22 aircraft.", "According to the F-22 acquisition plan, the Air Force will commit to LRIP quantities that increase from 4 aircraft a year to 36 a year (an 800-percent increase), totaling 80 aircraft, before completion of IOT&E. Production of 36 aircraft a year under LRIP represents 75 percent of the planned full-production rate. The estimated cost of those 80 aircraft is $12.4 billion. Figure 1 shows the planned schedule of commitments to procurement of F-22 aircraft and the estimated cumulative costs prior to completion of IOT&E.", "A first set of hardened tooling is required initially to produce the developmental aircraft for testing.

Descriptions of some of the problems that have occurred in the development program are included below. The purpose of these descriptions is to illustrate that there remain important cost, schedule, and technical risks in the F-22 program.", "The F-22 Program Office has taken a number of steps to reduce the technical risks of the program, including a 54-month demonstration/validation phase using an F-22 prototype, and a risk management program for engineering and manufacturing.

The key to achieving the necessary performance is the successful development of highly advanced integrated computer processors, known as the common integrated processors, and large amounts of software.", "Avionics and software integration has been characterized by the DOD Defense Acquisition Board as one of the highest risks to the successful development of the F-22. The risk assessment was prepared for the DOD Defense Acquisition Board to evaluate the readiness of the F-22 to begin the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the acquisition cycle in 1991. This report in June 1991 explained that the estimated 1.3 million single lines of software code needed for the F-22 represented the largest software task ever for an attack/fighter onboard software program. Further, the DSB in 1993 rated the integrated avionics as the highest technical risk in the F-22 program. Program managers for the F-22 agreed in October 1994 that the avionics and software integration are the most risky tasks facing the contractors.", "In a separate report, we concluded in 1994 that although the Air Force\u2019s planned strategy for the F-22 software was generally sound in concept, some significant features of the strategy were not being followed. For example, the independent verification and validation of software products\u2014part of the quality assurance process\u2014was less rigorous than planned. In addition, the technical risks being encountered with the system/software engineering environment and common integrated processor were not being formally reported to DOD management. Finally, we indicated that the Air Force had begun actions to respond to our concerns.", "DOD responded to that report in February 1995, indicating that the quality assurance program is now being complied with as planned.

It is expected to provide high performance and high fuel efficiency at slower speeds as well.", "Problems with performance of the F-22\u2019s engine first surfaced after the initial engine ground tests began in December 1992. The contractor is conducting a series of interim tests, with a goal of having a complete engine with a redesigned turbine and other changes qualified for flight by December 1996 if tests now planned for 1995 are successful. If not, F-22 flight tests will be started with an engine that is not fully representative of the current approved configuration.", "An Executive Independent Review Team was formed to provide advice on engine development issues, including a turbine problem. The team stated that it did not consider the nature and number of engine problems to be excessive for a highly sophisticated engine at this stage of development. They also stated that the proposed solutions can only be proven by exposing authentic hardware to the full range of realistic testing.", "Through November 1994, the Air Force had identified engine problems that may cost as much as $479 million to remedy. The Air Force increased the target cost of the engine development contract by $218 million to design and test solutions to the engine problems. The incorporation of corrective modifications to future production engines is expected to increase production costs by $123 million. The Air Force believes its current program estimate can cover the $341 million increase  ($218 million plus $123 million), but the Air Force has identified other potential design changes that may add $138 million to development and production costs.

Although DOD advised us that these problems were not considered major, design changes, such as reducing the number of aircraft maintenance access panels and fuel drain holes, and reshaping the airframe were evaluated through December 1994 to determine if these changes were successful in reducing the signature. DOD further stated that the contractual specifications are being revised. The estimated development cost to resolve these problems is about $20 million according to the F-22 program office.

These comments are dealt with on pages 12 and 13 of the report and in our responses to the DOD specific comments that follow. 2. For the most part, the risk/concurrency guidelines listed in the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s April 1990 guide are specific requirements that should be met before a program progresses. We are aware of many of those requirements that are incorporated in the F-22 program. However, the only assessment provided for in the guide for measuring the degree of concurrency is the amount of initial operational testing and evaluation (IOT&E) completed at the time low-rate initial production (LRIP) begins. By that measure, the F-22 program clearly has a high degree of concurrency. In our opinion, the ramp up of production from 4 a year to 36 a year under the LRIP phase, and initiation of long lead for 48 a year essentially represents a plan to achieve a full-rate production schedule (now defined as 48 a year) before IOT&E is completed. 3. The F-22 program, as currently planned, schedules procurement of 80 LRIP aircraft at an estimated cost of $12.4 billion. We believe that exceeds the minimum needed to successfully complete the LRIP phase of the program and that the production rates should be restricted during LRIP. Although many important F-22 development tests are scheduled prior to the acceleration of production rates, many other critical developmental tests and most IOT&E testing are not scheduled to be complete until after significant commitments are made to production. 4. We adjusted the report to reflect this information. However, it should be noted that the total number of each type of aircraft produced was much higher than planned for the F-22. This results in a higher degree of concurrency in the F-22 program when using the percentage of aircraft procured at completion of IOT&E as a measure of concurrency. 5. Our report does not, either explicitly or implicitly, suggest \u201ctotal avoidance\u201d of concurrency. 6. The Defense Science Board (DSB) portrayal of the F-22 program as relatively conservative was based on the amount of development testing to be completed at early production decision points. However, using the measure called for by DOD\u2019s own 1990 guidance\u2014the amount of IOT&E completed at the time LRIP begins\u2014shows that the F-22 program is far from conservative. 7. Production ramp up from 4 aircraft a year to 36 aircraft a year appears to provide a more rapid acceleration than we believe is necessary in the LRIP phase of the program. In our opinion the ramp up of production from 4 a year to 36 a year under the LRIP phase, and initiation of long lead to support 48 a year, essentially represents a plan to achieve a full-rate production schedule before IOT&E is completed. 8. This material has been deleted from the report. 9. Additional information concerning this matter has been added to the body of the report. 10. DOD response to our prior report on embedded computers has been recognized in the body of this report. 11. We did not attempt to quantify potential cost growth in the F-22 program that may result from a change in the program schedule. However, the thrust of the LRIP legislation is to authorize only minimum necessary quantities. DOD acquisition profiles created for other weapon programs have often proven to be optimistic and are rarely carried out as initially planned because of technical, financial, or test problems. If the baseline against which to compare potential growth of costs is optimistic, an estimate of cost growth would have limited meaning at this point because those problems are likely to occur in highly concurrent programs that involve substantial advances in technology."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cincinnati Regional Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Norfolk Regional Office", "paragraphs": ["Brenda Waterfield, Evaluator The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
