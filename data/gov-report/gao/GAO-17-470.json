In 2007, CBP started its Model Ports program to improve the international arrivals process for travelers to the United States by implementing technology to facilitate entry and expanding public-private partnerships, among other things. GAO was asked to review this program and subsequent airport travel and tourism facilitation initiatives at the 17 busiest U.S. international airports associated with the president's National Travel and Tourism Strategy.", "This report examines (1) how CBP and stakeholders have implemented airport travel and tourism facilitation initiatives, (2) how CBP and stakeholders manage staff to facilitate the traveler entry process, and (3) the extent to which CBP has mechanisms to monitor and report wait times at U.S. international airports. GAO collected data on the implementation of travel and tourism facilitation initiatives and analyzed CBP officer staffing and wait time data at the 17 airports from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also visited a nongeneralizable sample of 11 airports, selected based on traveler volume and variety of implemented initiatives, among other factors, and interviewed CBP, airport, and airline officials at 15 of the 17 airports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security, and airport and airline stakeholders jointly implement travel and tourism initiatives at U.S. international airports to facilitate the arrival of travelers. These initiatives include Automated Passport Control self-service kiosks that allow eligible travelers to complete a portion of the CBP inspection process before seeing a CBP officer, and Mobile Passport Control that allows eligible travelers to submit their passport and other information to CBP via an application on a mobile device. Various airport-specific factors can affect whether and how CBP and stakeholders implement travel and tourism facilitation initiatives at each airport. These factors include the size and layout of the airport facility, the infrastructure needed to support initiatives, the willingness and ability of the airport stakeholders to pay for initiatives or infrastructure to support them, as applicable, and stakeholder discretion in how to implement initiatives. CBP has two airport travel facilitation goals: (1) improving customer service levels for international arrivals and (2) maintaining or reducing wait times\u2014and has implemented mechanisms to assess and obtain feedback on the traveler experience.", "CBP allocates and manages staff using various tools, and stakeholders provide resources to help facilitate the traveler entry process. For example, CBP uses its Workload Staffing Model to determine the staffing requirements and help make allocation decisions for CBP officers at ports of entry, including airports. CBP also uses its Enterprise Management Information System to monitor and make immediate staffing changes to meet any traveler volume and wait time concerns at airports. Airport and airline stakeholders can also enter into agreements to pay for CBP officers to work overtime during peak travel hours or outside regular operational hours.", "CBP monitors airport wait times and reports data on its public website to help travelers plan flights, including scheduling connecting flights, but the reported data have limited usefulness to travelers. Currently, CBP does not report wait times by traveler type, such as U.S. citizen or foreign visitor. Rather, CBP reports average hourly wait times for all travelers on arriving international flights. By reporting wait times for all categories of travelers combined, CBP is reporting wait times that are lower than those generally experienced by visitors. According to GAO's analysis of CBP wait time data for the 17 busiest airports from May 2013 through August 2016, the average wait time was 13 minutes for U.S. citizens and 28 minutes for visitors, while the combined reported average wait time was 21 minutes. Reporting wait times by traveler type could improve the usefulness of CBP's wait time data to travelers by providing them with more complete and accurate data on their wait times. This could help inform their flight plans and could provide additional transparency to allow CBP to work with stakeholders to determine what, if any, changes are needed, to improve the traveler experience and better manage wait times.", "This is a public version of a For Official Use Only\u2014Law Enforcement Sensitive report that GAO issued in February 2017.

At the end of the sterile corridor, travelers enter the  Federal Inspection Service (FIS) area, which is a secure area of the  airport where CBP inspects travelers applying for admission to the United  States.  Once in the FIS area, travelers are generally directed by  signage and officials from the airport, an airline, or CBP officers who work  in the FIS area to queue for inspection by CBP. The manner in which  travelers proceed through the FIS area varies by airport, but generally  travelers are queued by immigration or citizenship status type, such as  U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, Canadian citizens, and B1/B2  visa holders.", "CBP\u2019s international arrivals process incorporates automated technology  to help expedite travelers at passport control. Travelers must clear  passport control, also referred to as primary inspection, where CBP  officers inspect their travel documents and travelers are to declare any  items required by law before they can be admitted into the United  States.  Travelers whose admissibility cannot be initially determined are  referred for a more intensive, or secondary, inspection. After passport  control, travelers enter the baggage claim area to retrieve their checked  luggage. Once travelers retrieve their luggage, they must pass a final exit  control checkpoint. At any point during the process, a CBP officer can  refer a traveler to secondary inspection. In secondary inspection, CBP  officers can further inspect the traveler\u2019s travel documents and baggage.  After passing exit control, travelers exit the FIS area into a non-sterile part  of the airport terminal or to ground or airport transportation.

Following this effort, the  program was formalized under the Implementing Recommendations of  the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, which mandated that the Secretary of  Homeland Security establish a model ports of entry program for the  purpose of providing a more efficient and welcoming international arrivals  process in order to facilitate and promote business and tourism travel to  the United States, while also improving security. This act required CBP  to include program elements that would enhance queue management in  the FIS area leading to primary inspection, assist foreign travelers once  they have been admitted, and offer instructional videos in English and  other languages, as deemed appropriate, in the FIS area to explain the  inspection process and feature welcome videos.  In addition, a portion of  CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2008 appropriation was made available for the agency  to implement the program at the 20 U.S. airports with the highest number  of annual foreign visitors as of 2007 and hire 200 additional officers for  the 20 busiest U.S. international airports.", "In 2008, CBP expanded the Model Ports program to an additional 18  airports.

OFO collaborated with other DHS components,  interagency government partners, and private and public stakeholders to  develop and implement solutions that would facilitate travelers. The goals  of the Model Ports program were to (1) ensure that passengers entering  the United States were welcomed by CBP officers who treat them with  respect and understanding; (2) provide the right information to help  travelers, at the right time and in a hospitable manner; (3) create a calm,  pleasant waiting area; and (4) streamline the customs process.

For example,  during our site visits we observed APC kiosks located inside the FIS area  in some terminals and in sterile corridors at other terminals, based on  space constraints. We also observed APC kiosks in different  configurations, including single and multiple columns, due to the size and  layout of FIS areas and sterile corridors. In addition, according to CBP  officials, not all airports have the space available to create a separate exit  for travelers who could utilize One Stop, and the current Airport Technical  Design Standard, which was established in 2012, does not allow for easy  transitions to a baggage first concept. Finally, while MPC remains in the  pilot phase and CBP continues to roll it out among U.S. international  airports, the initiative requires internet connectivity, meaning the traveler  needs either data on their cell phone or wireless internet connection.  Some airports have taken steps to provide free wireless internet access  to enable MPC to be implemented.", "As previously discussed, airport authorities, airlines, and terminal  operators have the option of implementing initiatives at the airport or  terminal depending on the airport. According to stakeholders that we  spoke with during our site visits, one deciding factor is the willingness and  ability of the airport stakeholders to pay for initiatives or infrastructure to  support them, except Global Entry which is paid for by CBP user fees.   Some of the initiatives, such as APC kiosks, can be costly because they  require infrastructure changes, hardware investment and maintenance,  and personnel to support them, while others, such as MPC, are less  costly because a third-party provides the mobile phone application and  the airport or terminal operator pays for phone scanners and wireless  internet access. The airport\u2019s status as a destination or a hub airport can  also impact stakeholder decisions to invest in these initiatives. A  destination airport is an airport where most travelers plan to stay in the  region and do not have a connecting flight. A hub airport is an airport  where most travelers connect to another airport in the United States or  abroad to complete their trip. According to officials that we spoke with  during our site visits, stakeholders generally have an incentive to pay for  the initiatives at a destination airport so travelers have a welcoming  experience and choose to spend time at in-airport retailors, while  stakeholders generally have an incentive to pay for the initiatives at hub  airports to ensure that travelers make their connecting flights. For  example, airlines implement the Express Connection and International to  International baggage programs at hub airports to assist travelers in  making their connecting flights, which helps with traveler satisfaction and  prevents the airlines from incurring rebooking costs.", "The implementation of some of the initiatives can also vary by terminal or  airport. For some initiatives, implementing partners have more discretion  over how they are implemented, which allows stakeholders to implement  their own design preferences. For example, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne  County Airport (DTW) and Miami International Airport (MIA) are piloting  the modified egress initiative differently. In Detroit, which is a one-level  FIS facility, travelers exiting the FIS area are slowed by a serpentine flow  and CBP officers retrieve the baggage of travelers who are referred to  secondary inspection. At Miami North Terminal, which is a two-level FIS  facility, travelers who are referred to secondary inspection are segregated  from cleared travelers by Plexiglas barriers immediately after primary  inspection so that they can proceed to retrieve their own baggage from  the secure side of the Plexiglas barrier and then self-report at secondary  inspection, as shown in figure 5.", "Another initiative that varies across airports and terminals is the use of  color-coded signage and queueing, as shown in figure 6.  For example,  three terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) use color- coded signage, but all use different color schemes to identify different  traveler types and technology initiatives, and only one of these terminals  also uses color-coded retractable belts to complement the color-coded  signage. Similarly, the color scheme at MIA North Terminal, also known  as Terminal D, is different than the color scheme at Dallas/Fort Worth  International Airport (DFW). Because color-coded signage is not a CBP- led initiative, implementing partners have more flexibility to implement this  initiative how they prefer.", "Another example of variation across airports is the different versions of  the APC kiosks that vary depending on the vendor that the airport  chooses and in which phase the airport implemented the kiosks, as  shown in figure 7. In addition to private vendors, airport authorities such  as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and George Bush  Intercontinental Airport (IAH) have developed their own APC kiosks to  generate revenue.  CBP has rolled out the APC program in four phases  of eligible users, to include: (1) U.S. citizens, (2) Canadian citizens, (3)  U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents, and (4) B1/B2 visa holders.  As a  result, APC is at phase four in some airports, while in phase one, two, or  three at other airports.", "In addition, according to OFO officials, CBP plans to update its Airport  Technical Design Standard to include, among other things, a baggage  first concept for all new airport facilities built in the future. As previously  discussed, this process allows travelers to claim their checked baggage  before completing passport control, modifying the CBP exit control  checkpoint. New facilities at smaller airports, Austin-Bergstrom  International Airport (AUS) and Houston Hobby International Airport  (HOU), have incorporated this process into the design. However, this  update to the Airport Technical Design Standard would not have an  impact on existing facilities, and due to infrastructure constraints and  current FIS area configurations with baggage carousels located between  passport control and exit control, the baggage first concept is not possible  for many existing facilities. The modified egress pilot program is more  flexible than the baggage first concept in that it does not require  significant infrastructure modifications, such as moving the baggage  carousels before passport control. CBP launched its modified egress pilot  program for existing facilities to streamline the inspection process, which  as previously discussed, modifies the CBP exit control checkpoint in the  FIS area. Five terminals at the 17 busiest U.S. international airports have  piloted modified egress, and their implementation varies based on their  specific infrastructure constraints. Figure 8 below shows the evolution of  the CBP air traveler inspection process from the current process to  modified egress to baggage first.", "Table 1 includes these additional stakeholder initiatives, such as color- coded queuing and signage and expected wait time monitors in the FIS,  and provides information on the prevalence of airport travel and tourism  facilitation initiatives at the 31 terminals in the 17 busiest U.S.  international airports. As of the end of fiscal year 2016, the 31 terminals at  the 17 busiest U.S. international airports had a total of 1,014 APC kiosks  and 408 Global Entry kiosks to help facilitate CBP processing of travelers  for primary inspection, based on CBP data.", "See appendix III for additional information about the implementation of  initiatives at international arrivals terminals at the 17 busiest U.S.  international airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Implemented Mechanisms to Assess and Obtain Feedback on the Traveler Experience", "paragraphs": ["OFO has developed two internal airport travel facilitation goals: (1)  improving customer service levels for international arrivals and (2)  maintaining or reducing wait times.

As part  of its Resource Optimization Strategy, the WSM is an analytical, data- driven staffing tool designed to inform CBP officer allocation decisions  regarding current and future officer staffing at POEs.  CBP conducts  WSM calculations annually and publishes its CBP-wide calculation for all  of its POEs in its annual reports to Congress. CBP officials at  headquarters conduct the calculations for each POE within a field office  and provide this information to the field office annually when it allocates  new officers. The port director has discretion to determine how to allocate  officers among his or her ports within the POE. Headquarters officials do  not direct port directors on how to manage staffing allocations to the  ports.", "In determining staffing needs at the POEs, the WSM takes into account  the frequency of all key CBP officer activities; the processing time to  complete each activity; available hours per officer; port-specific factors  required to ensure coverage; and future requirements related to new  facilities, technologies, or service requirements.  The estimated process  time for each POE accounts for different risk factors among the POE, the  additional workload created when officers send a traveler to secondary  inspection, and the impact of travel facilitation initiatives, such as APC  and MPC on processing time. Officials who conduct the calculations must  also manually enter data to ensure coverage of exit control at airports, for  which CBP does not track process time or wait time.", "In addition, CBP officials at headquarters add on allocation of core  overtime (which is discussed later in this section), projected officers  needed for new facilities, and changes to account for growth in traveler  volume and use of business transformation initiatives such as APC. For  example, when a new FIS facility is built, the field office develops an  estimate of projected workload to give to CBP headquarters. These add- on calculations can increase or decrease the total number of officers  needed based on the WSM calculation. For example, an airport that is  opening a new terminal in the next year may need additional officers as a  result of the add-on calculation, but an airport that implemented APC  kiosks in the previous year may need fewer officers as a result of the add- on calculation. While these additional factors are not included in the WSM  calculation, officials at headquarters have developed a methodology to  provide an estimate of additional or fewer officers needed at the POE  based on prior experience. This is added to the WSM calculation. Figure  9 describes these calculations.", "In 2014, the DHS Office of Inspector General conducted a review of the  reliability of the WSM in determining the number of CBP officers needed  to fulfill CBP mission requirements. The DHS Office of Inspector  General found that the WSM had a sound methodology to determine its  officer staffing needs and to identify staffing shortages, but made  recommendations to strengthen the internal controls over the model.   CBP concurred with the recommendations and plans to complete steps to  implement them by December 2016.", "According to CBP\u2019s Assistant Commissioner for Human Resources  Management, staffing is one of the most prominent challenges facing the  agency. CBP needs an additional 2,107 officers for fiscal year 2017  across all POEs, according to CBP\u2019s Deputy Assistant Commissioner.  While a portion of CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2014 appropriation was made  available for hiring at least 2,000 new CBP officers to help address  staffing needs, the agency has been able to hire and onboard a net  increase of 1,135 officers due to attrition and hiring challenges, according  to CBP officials.  According to CBP officials, these challenges include  competition from other federal and state law enforcement agencies and a  lengthy hiring and onboarding process that includes polygraph tests and  several months of training. CBP is studying these hiring challenges and  taking steps to address them. For example, according to CBP\u2019s Assistant  Commissioner for Human Resources Management, CBP has begun  initiatives aimed at decreasing the amount of time it takes for an applicant  to complete the hiring process, increased the number of recruiting events,  and coordinated with the Department of Defense to recruit qualified  veterans and individuals separating from military service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CBP Uses Tools, Overtime, and Other Strategies to Manage Staff at Airports", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, OFO supervisors at the airports use a variety of  tools, overtime, and other strategies to manage staffing daily, weekly, and  seasonally at the 17 busiest U.S. international airports.", "In addition to these tools, CBP managers at headquarters and in the field  must consider several airport-specific factors that affect how they are able  to manage staff at airports. For example, if an airport is located in a POE  with more than one port, or more than one international terminal, local  CBP operations require CBP to split its available staff and staff may  spend time traveling between ports or terminals. This can affect the total  number of hours an officer is available to process travelers during his or  her shift, which requires managers to plan daily staffing with these  periods of time in mind. In addition, to supplement staffing during peak  travel hours, managers may assign officers to work overtime or reassign  officers where needed.  For example, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood  International Airport (FLL) shares its CBP officers with the Fort  Lauderdale sea port to process cruise ship and other arriving sea traffic.  Officers drive between the airport and sea port to meet the peak traveler  volumes at both facilities.", "Another factor that can affect how OFO supervisors manage staffing at  the airports is how often flights from destinations with high-risk profiles  arrive at the airport.

As such, CBP monitors and  manages airport wait times. On a daily basis, CBP collects data at  airports that it uses to calculate wait times. CBP defines wait time as the  time interval between the arrival of the aircraft (the block time) and the  swipe of a passport by the traveler at an APC kiosk, Global Entry kiosk,  MPC scanner, or by a CBP officer at a passport control booth or podium,  minus the walk time to the FIS area.  Walk time is an estimate of the  average amount of time it takes an average traveler to walk from the  aircraft to the FIS entrance. The walk time is facility-dependent and varies  by airport terminal.  CBP electronically collects two data points for wait  time calculations: the block time and the passport swipe time. CBP  measures wait time for the primary inspection process only. Figure 10  shows the CBP airport wait time calculation process.", "According to CBP officials and airport and airline representatives, flight  arrivals and wait times can vary throughout the course of the day, by day  of the week, and by season. In addition, various factors can affect wait  times, including traveler volume exceeding FIS capacity; concurrent or  overlapping fight arrivals; co-mingling of travelers in the FIS area from  earlier flights; the number of high-risk travelers; arrivals of large numbers  of visitors; technology issues such as computer network outages and  slowdowns and malfunctions in equipment and facilities; unscheduled  flight diversions due to inclement weather conditions; the implementation  of initiatives (i.e., APC kiosks, Global Entry kiosks, and MPC); CBP officer  staffing and airport and airline ambassador staffing; and whether airports  provide timely interpretation and wheelchair services to travelers. For  example, when traveler volume exceeds FIS capacity, CBP or airport  representatives at some airports can hold travelers on the aircraft until  space in the FIS becomes available or, if available, CBP or airport or  airline representatives can queue travelers in a waiting room in the sterile  corridor before proceeding to the FIS area, such as in Orlando  International Airport (MCO).", "In addition, concurrent or overlapping flight arrivals or unscheduled flight  diversions due to inclement weather conditions could result in co-mingling  of travelers in the FIS area from previous flights. Co-mingling of travelers  refers to instances when travelers from one flight may queue in line  behind travelers from an earlier or later flight, which affects the traveler\u2019s  individual wait time and can affect the overall wait time for that traveler\u2019s  flight. Further, the processing of large numbers of visitors may increase  wait times because they often cannot use technology initiatives that  expedite primary inspection, such as APC and Global Entry kiosks, and  take longer to inspect at CBP officer booths than other types of travelers.  Moreover, wait times could increase if airport or airline representatives do  not provide timely interpretation or wheelchair services to travelers when  needed.", "CBP has undertaken various efforts to manage, monitor, or reduce airport  wait times. On a daily basis, CBP port-level supervisors are able to  monitor airport wait times in near-real time using the Airport Wait Time  Console, an automated system that provides current, and forecasts  future, international flight and traveler arrivals data.  Using the console,  CBP is able to monitor the wait time at primary inspection for each  individual traveler and the combined average wait time for all travelers on  a flight. This information helps CBP supervisors identify and respond to  unexpected surges and overloaded queues in the FIS areas that can  occur due to weather delays, among other reasons. In response to such  situations, CBP supervisors may decide to open additional primary  inspection booths, shift staff assignments, or use overtime to help  manage wait times.", "CBP and stakeholders at all 17 busiest U.S. international airports also  conduct at least monthly meetings to discuss airport operations and travel  facilitation issues such as options for modernizing facilities, flight  schedules, use of available staff and technology, and management of  wait times. In its monthly airport travel and tourism dashboards for the 17  airports, OFO reports trends in wait times at each terminal and compares  wait times among terminals, among other things. According to OFO, it  publishes the dashboards, in part, to provide transparency and help  facilitate discussion with airport stakeholders at monthly meetings.", "OFO also monitors wait times at the headquarters level through its  Planning, Program Analysis, and Evaluation Directorate to identify  patterns or trends of increasing or excessive wait times. At times, OFO  has sent Operational Review Teams, also referred to as \u201cjump teams,\u201d to  airports with long wait times, including Boston-Logan International Airport  (BOS), Honolulu International Airport (HNL), and San Francisco  International Airport (SFO), to review operations and make  recommendations to help reduce wait times. For example, in 2015, OFO  sent a team to review wait times, staffing, and overtime at Honolulu  International Airport (HNL). The team identified contributing factors  impacting wait times, including the lack of APC kiosks which delayed  processing during peak arrival periods, and made recommendations to  CBP and HNL stakeholders. In February 2016, HNL implemented 32 APC  kiosks. In May 2016, the CBP acting port director for the Port of Honolulu  said that he had seen a significant reduction in average wait times,  excessive wait times, and gate holds at HNL. According to our analysis of  CBP airport wait time data, wait times decreased an average of 5 minutes  for U.S. citizens and 12 minutes for visitors in the first 3 months after the  implementation of APC kiosks at HNL.

In these studies, the private company provided  recommendations to each airport for how CBP, the airport, and the  airlines could improve processes and reduce wait times. According to  OFO officials, CBP and stakeholders generally reviewed and  implemented the recommendations at airports. For example, the study of  the Miami International Airport (MIA) North Terminal in September 2014  identified operational issues, including congestion in the FIS and egress  areas.

These initiatives include Automated Passport Control (APC) kiosks,  baggage first, diplomatic arrival processes and diplomatic processing  lanes, electronic signage and multimedia, enhanced queueing, Express  Connection, Global Entry kiosks, International to International baggage  program, Mobile Passport Control (MPC), modified egress, One Stop,  Professionalism Service Manager (PSM) program, Reimbursable  Services Program, stakeholder meetings, and Variable Message  Signage. We collected and analyzed information on the implementation of  these initiatives at the 17 busiest U.S. international airports as of the end  of fiscal year 2016, according to CBP.", "To examine how CBP and airport and airline stakeholders implemented  these initiatives from 2007 through 2016, we reviewed CBP reports,  including the Model Ports Program Report to Congress in 2010 and the  Department of Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) 2015 report to the President that defines a national goal to \u201cprovide  a best-in-class arrivals experience.\u201d  We also reviewed CBP\u2019s most  recent version of its Airport Technical Design Standard; business  requirements for APC kiosks; internal assessments and reports on  initiatives such as Global Entry and MPC; and internal memorandums  from the Model Ports program which directed officials at airports to test  initiatives such as enhanced queueing and diplomatic processing lanes.", "To examine how CBP obtains feedback on the traveler experience, we  reviewed CBP\u2019s reports on its performance goals and measures,  including its Traveler Satisfaction Survey Reports for the surveys it  conducted in 2012, 2015, and 2016. We also reviewed CBP\u2019s standard  operating procedures for the Complaint/Compliment Management System  and the directive that established policy and responsibilities of the PSM  program. We interviewed CBP officials at headquarters, officials from  eight travel and tourism industry associations selected based on the  nature of the associations and suggestions by CBP and association  officials, and the National Treasury Employees Union, the labor union  representing CBP officers, to gain insights on initiatives.", "As shown in table 4, to obtain the perspectives of local CBP officials and  stakeholders on the implementation of initiatives, we collected information  and interviewed CBP officials and airport and airline representatives at 15  of the 17 airports and conducted site visits at 11 of these airports to  observe airport operations.", "We obtained perspectives from airport authorities, airlines, terminal  operators, and Office of Field Operations (OFO) officials at the 15  selected airports\u2014including Port Directors or Acting Port Directors,  Assistant Port Directors, and Professionalism Service Managers, among  others\u2014on how CBP and stakeholders have implemented initiatives to  facilitate the international arrivals process to the United States and factors  that affect the implementation of initiatives. At the 11 site visits, we  observed OFO officers conducting inspections of international travelers  and received demonstrations on how airports employ technology  initiatives, such as APC and MPC, and viewed multimedia and signage,  among other activities.", "We selected a non-probability sample based on traveler volume, traveler  wait times, technology employment, and geographic diversity. We  selected airports with the highest traveler volume, longest wait times, and  most technology employment as well as the lowest traveler volume,  shortest wait times, and least technology employment to provide a range  of traveler experiences at the 17 busiest U.S. international airports. We  considered traveler volume because, as we have previously reported,  traveler volume is one of three key factors that affect traveler wait time.   We considered wait time because it has a role in the experience of  travelers arriving at U.S. international airports, according to CBP\u2019s  Traveler Satisfaction Surveys. We considered the extent to which airports  have employed technology, including APC kiosks and MPC, because  these initiatives can impact the wait times and experiences of travelers  arriving at U.S. international airports. We considered geographic diversity  to study a full spectrum of issues that impact airports, including security  risk factors based on the origin of arriving flights, among others. The  information we collected from these site visits cannot be generalized to all  U.S. international airports. However, because we selected these airports  based on a variety of factors, they provided us with a diversity of insights  about the experience of international travelers arriving at the 17 busiest  U.S. international airports.", "To address the second objective, we identified CBP\u2019s Workload Staffing  Model (WSM) and various tools and strategies that CBP uses to manage  its staff nationally and locally. To examine how CBP determines its  staffing needs for officers at the ports of entry (POE) with the 17 busiest  U.S. international airports, we reviewed CBP\u2019s WSM calculations;  additional staffing calculations (add-ons) completed by officials at CBP  headquarters that the WSM cannot calculate, including forthcoming  implementation of initiatives or new facilities; and the authorized staffing  level for fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016.  We assessed the reliability  of these data by (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewing existing information about the  data and the system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing the staffing process. We  reviewed CBP\u2019s internal statement of policy and intent for the use of the  WSM; Resource Optimization Strategy and subsequent reports to  Congress; and three reviews of the WSM, including a review by a  government consulting firm in 2010, an internal review by a DHS Program  Analysis and Evaluation team in 2012, and a DHS Office of Inspector  General review in 2014.  However, we did not conduct an evaluation of  the WSM to determine its usefulness or accuracy as an officer staffing  allocation tool during this review.", "To assess how CBP manages its available staff, we reviewed CBP\u2019s total  overtime expenditures for the POEs with the 17 busiest U.S. international  airports for fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 and reviewed CBP\u2019s  internal documentation. This included Time and Motion studies CBP  conducted with a private contractor in 2014 and 2015 for each of the 17  busiest U.S. international airports, summer peak travel staffing plans for  each of the 17 airports, local airport staffing rosters, Reimbursable  Services Program fee agreements and weekly usage reports, and  national and local collective bargaining agreements.  We assessed the  reliability of CBP data on funding spent on overtime and reimbursable  service agreements, if applicable, at the 17 busiest U.S. international  airports from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 by (1) performing electronic  testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewing  existing information about the data and the system that produced them,  and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We collected information and interviewed CBP officials and airport  and airline representatives at the 15 selected airports and conducted site  visits at 11 airports to gain a better understanding of the various factors  that affect staffing and how CBP and stakeholders manage staff. We  interviewed CBP officials and airport and airline representatives at these  airports, as well as CBP officials at headquarters, officials from eight  travel and tourism industry associations, and the labor union representing  CBP officers, to gain insights on how CBP manages staffing nationally  and locally airports, and to gain insights on staffing challenges.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed CBP\u2019s process for collecting,  monitoring, and reporting airport wait time data. We collected and  analyzed CBP airport wait time data for the 17 airports from May 2013  through August 2016. We assessed the reliability of these data by (1)  performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We reviewed CBP  internal documents, including Time and Motion studies CBP conducted  with a private contractor in 2014 and 2015 for each of the 17 busiest U.S.  international airports; standard daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual  airport wait time and volume reports that officials at CBP headquarters  use to monitor trends in airport wait times; after-action reports from  Operational Review Teams, also referred to as \u201cjump teams,\u201d sent to  airports experiencing excessive wait times; and an internal memorandum  on passenger wait time mitigation strategies for the summer travel  season. We reviewed CBP\u2019s wait time calculation method, including its  algorithm for automatically excluding refugees, asylum seekers, and three  percent of travelers with the longest wait times from each flight, as well as  CBP\u2019s manual process for excluding additional travelers from its wait time  calculations that it reports on its public website.  We reviewed legislation  requiring CBP to publish its airport wait time information on its public  website and CBP\u2019s annual reports to Congress on airport wait times in  response to legislative requirements. We also collected information and  interviewed CBP officials and airport and airline representatives at the 15  airports selected and conducted site visits at 11 airports to gain a better  understanding of the various factors that affect CBP airport wait times and  interviewed CBP officials and airport and airline representatives at these  airports. We also interviewed DHS Science and Technology Directorate  (S&T) officials, CBP officials at headquarters, officials from eight travel  and tourism industry associations, and the labor union representing CBP  officers to gain insights on wait time calculations and reporting. We  compared this information against CBP performance goals and Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to March 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
