Nevertheless, analyzing agency data submitted to SBA suggests that 9 of the 11 agencies participating in the SBIR program and 4 of the 5 agencies participating in the STTR program complied with spending requirements for fiscal year 2013. Specifically, agencies are required to submit the actual amount obligated for extramural research or research and development (R&D)\u2014which is generally conducted by nonfederal employees outside of federal facilities\u2014and these obligations are the basis for calculating the agencies' spending requirements. However, most agencies submitted budget data instead. Program managers raised concerns about the difficulties in determining the amount of extramural R&D obligations and the challenges in using this amount to calculate spending requirements, as extramural R&D obligations are not known until after the end of the fiscal year. However, without the required data, SBA cannot accurately report on agencies' compliance with spending requirements\u2014as defined in the law\u2014to Congress.", "Some agencies did not comply with certain methodology reporting requirements for the programs. For example, 3 of the 11 participating agencies did not itemize the specific programs they excluded from their extramural R&D in their required methodology reports, or did not explain the reasons why they excluded the programs, or both. GAO also found that SBA did not assess whether the information it collected was adequate to appropriately analyze agencies' methodology reports. Without such an assessment, SBA cannot provide Congress with an accurate analysis of how agencies calculate their extramural R&D. Furthermore, SBA has not issued its required report to Congress on the programs for fiscal year 2013.", "Basing the programs' spending requirements on total R&D instead of extramural R&D could increase the amount of each agency's spending requirement and increase the number of agencies required to participate. Some agency officials said that basing the calculation methodology on their total R&D budget would make administering their programs easier, but officials at other agencies said that the change could result in reduced funding for intramural research and extramural research outside of the SBIR and STTR programs.", "Little is known about total administrative spending on the programs for fiscal year 2013 because the agencies that participate are not required to and do not fully track these costs. Six agencies participated in an administrative pilot program that allowed them to spend program funds on new administrative and oversight activities in fiscal year 2013. These agencies reported spending $12.3 million on these activities, but this amount does not represent total administrative spending. Additionally, this is about 20 percent of what the agencies had planned to spend on the administrative pilot program at the beginning of the fiscal year. Program managers at seven agencies told GAO that they would prefer that the administrative pilot program were either extended or made permanent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that SBA notify Congress if it cannot determine agency compliance with spending requirements and assess the adequacy of the methodology reporting requirement.

For example, Mapp  Biopharmaceutical, Inc. received SBIR awards in 2007 and 2011 totaling  more than $3.5 million to develop the ZMapp drug that was administered  to two Americans infected with the Ebola virus in West Africa in 2014. The  SBIR and STTR programs are similar in that participating agencies  identify topics for R&D projects and make awards to small businesses to  develop and commercialize innovative technologies. For the SBIR  program, a for-profit small business performs the work associated with  the award, while the STTR program requires the small business to  partner with a nonprofit research institution\u2014such as a nonprofit college  or university or federally funded research and development center\u2014to  perform the work.", "Federal agencies with budgets of $100 million or more for extramural  R&D are required to establish and administer an SBIR program, and  federal agencies with budgets of $1 billion or more for extramural R&D  are also required to establish and administer an STTR program.

We also assumed that current spending thresholds that require agencies  to participate in SBIR and STTR programs when applied to extramural  R&D budgets would apply to the total R&D budgets. As in our previous  reports, we compared the spending requirements from the alternate  scenarios with those under current law to determine the potential effects  that changing this methodology would have had in fiscal year 2013.

The purpose of the STTR program\u2014initiated  about a decade later in 1992\u2014is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and  technologies between innovative small businesses and research  institutions through federally funded R&D. Legislation enacted in 2011  reauthorized the programs from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year  2017. The Small Business Act requires agencies to spend a certain  percentage on programs each year. The spending requirements for SBIR  and STTR are to be calculated as a percentage of each agency\u2019s  extramural R&D obligations, provided their extramural R&D obligations  exceed the participation thresholds of $100 million for SBIR and $1 billion  for STTR. Under the 2011 reauthorization, the SBIR extramural spending  requirement was set at 2.7 percent for fiscal year 2013 and will increase  incrementally to 3.2 percent of extramural R&D obligations by fiscal year  2017, and the STTR allocation was set at 0.35 percent for fiscal year  2013 and will increase incrementally to 0.45 percent by fiscal year 2017.", "The SBIR and STTR programs each include the following three phases:  In phase I, agencies make awards to small businesses to determine  the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas that appear to  have commercial potential. Phase I awards normally do not exceed  $150,000. For SBIR, phase I awards generally last 6 to 9 months. For  STTR, these awards generally last 1 year.", "In phase II, small businesses with phase I projects that demonstrate  scientific and technical merit and feasibility, in addition to commercial  potential, may compete for awards of up to $1 million to continue the  R&D for an additional period, normally not to exceed 2 years.", "Phase III is for small businesses to pursue commercialization of  technology developed in prior phases. Phase III work derives from,  extends, or completes an effort made under prior phases, but it is  funded by sources other than the SBIR or STTR programs. In this  phase, small businesses are expected to raise additional funds from  private investors, the capital markets, or from funding sources within  the agency that made the initial award other than its SBIR or STTR  program. While SBIR or STTR funding cannot be used for phase III,  agencies can participate in phase III by, for example, purchasing the  technology developed in prior phases.", "SBA\u2019s Office of Investment and Innovation is responsible for overseeing  and coordinating the participating agencies\u2019 efforts for the SBIR and  STTR programs. As part of SBA\u2019s oversight and coordination role, the  agency has issued SBIR and STTR policy directives to explain and  outline requirements for agencies\u2019 implementation of these programs. The  policy directives include a list of the data that agencies must submit to  SBA annually\u2014such as their extramural R&D obligations amount and the  amount obligated for awards for the programs.", "Each participating agency must administer its SBIR and STTR programs  in accordance with program laws, regulations, and the policy directives  issued by SBA. In general, the programs are similar across agencies. All  of the agencies follow the same general process to obtain proposals from  and make awards to small businesses for both the SBIR and STTR  programs. However, each participating agency has considerable flexibility  to design and manage the specifics of their programs, such as  determining research topics, selecting award recipients, and  administering funding agreements. At least annually, each participating  agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals for projects in topic  areas determined by the agency. Each agency uses its own process to  review proposals and determine which proposals should receive awards.  For those agencies that have both SBIR and STTR programs, agencies  usually use the same process for both programs. Also, each agency  determines whether the funding for awards will be provided as grants or  contracts. According to an agency program administrator, agencies such  as the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) typically issue contracts that address highly focused topics and  include a number of requirements that small business must comply with,  while agencies like the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National  Science Foundation (NSF) often issue grants for less specified topics that  allow for more flexibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Cannot Fully Determine Compliance with Spending Requirements, but Data Submitted to SBA Indicate Most Agencies Met the Requirements", "paragraphs": ["SBA cannot fully determine if all 11 agencies met their spending  requirements for fiscal year 2013, as 9 of the 11 participating agencies  did not follow SBA\u2019s guidance in submitting data on their total extramural  R&D obligations.

The Small Business Act requires agencies to calculate  their spending requirements based on their extramural R&D budget, but it  defines the extramural R&D budget as the actual obligations over the  course of the year\u2014which are not fully known until the end of the year\u2014 rather than the amount that agencies propose to spend on the program  early in the fiscal year. For years before fiscal year 2013, most agencies  provided the amount that they proposed to spend on extramural R&D and  not the amount they actually obligated in their data submitted to SBA after  the end of the fiscal year. SBA issued a revised template for data  submission for fiscal year 2013 to clarify what information was needed to  calculate spending requirements and directed agencies to submit data on  their extramural R&D obligations. SBA officials said that they changed the  template for data submission to respond to our past recommendations to  provide additional guidance to agencies about submitting data and  calculating spending requirements. SBA provided agency program  managers with new guidance describing how to submit the relevant data  and information to SBA. In addition, SBA officials told us that they  discussed this issue at length with the agencies. However, SBA\u2019s efforts  did not fully address the problem, as NASA and the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) are the only agencies that submitted data on  extramural R&D obligations to SBA for fiscal year 2013, as requested by  SBA in accordance with the law. The remaining nine agencies submitted  incorrect data by providing their extramural R&D budget estimates.", "Program officials said that the requirement to use extramural R&D  obligations rather than extramural R&D budget makes it difficult for  agencies to comply with spending requirements because extramural R&D  obligations are not known until the end of the fiscal year. Several program  managers told us that they believe it is unfair or impractical to hold their  agency to a target that is not known until the end of the year, when it is  not possible to obligate additional money. In addition, some program  officials told us that they do not have systems in place to easily calculate  extramural R&D obligations. For example, DOD officials said that it would  likely not be possible to determine a final extramural R&D obligations  figure until 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. Furthermore, some  agency officials told us that their agency does not calculate total  extramural R&D obligations. For example, officials at the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) said that their financial system did not provide  the level of detail necessary to calculate extramural R&D obligations, and  modifying the current system would require a level of effort beyond what  is justified for an agency with a small extramural R&D budget.  Nevertheless, the Small Business Act requires agencies to use  extramural R&D obligations to calculate their annual spending  requirements. Moreover, SBA\u2019s guidance for fiscal year 2013 continues to  direct agencies to use this approach, and SBA officials told us that the  best way to ensure compliance with spending requirements is to use  obligations.", "SBA\u2019s ability to conduct an accurate assessment of whether agencies are  complying with spending requirements is dependent on agencies  submitting the correct data. For example, during fiscal year 2013, NASA  estimated its extramural R&D budget to be about $4.9 billion, and it  developed a spending plan for the SBIR and STTR programs based on  this budget. However, according to data submitted to SBA, NASA\u2019s end- of-year extramural R&D obligations totaled about $5.2 billion, causing  NASA\u2019s actual spending requirements for the programs to be higher than  anticipated at the beginning of the year, as shown in table 2. NASA spent  $132.5 million on its SBIR program, which would have been enough to  comply with its estimated spending requirement, but it was less than the  actual spending requirement. NASA officials told us that they did not  know what the final extramural R&D obligations would be until after the  end of the fiscal year and, therefore, were unable to spend more to meet  the higher-than-anticipated spending requirements. Consistent with our  findings for fiscal year 2012, this increase in extramural R&D obligations  compared with the budget contributed to NASA\u2019s noncompliance with  SBIR spending requirements in fiscal year 2013, according to program  officials. NASA submitted the correct data to SBA, and our analysis  showed it did not meet the spending requirements in fiscal year 2013.  However, had NASA provided SBA with its extramural R&D budget rather  than extramural R&D obligations, as other agencies provided, NASA  would have\u2014incorrectly\u2014appeared to have met its SBIR spending  requirement.", "Other agencies that appeared to have met their spending requirement  based on extramural R&D budget data may not actually have complied  with their spending requirement if their extramural R&D obligations were  higher than the amount they budgeted for the year. Conversely, an  agency that appeared to spend less than the required amount on the  programs could have actually met the spending requirements if the  agency\u2019s extramural R&D obligations at the end of the year were lower  than the amount the agency budgeted at the beginning of the year. As  discussed earlier, most agencies did not provide extramural R&D  obligations data to SBA, which is a key piece of data for determining  whether an agency met the spending requirements. SBA uses the data  that agencies submit to determine the agencies\u2019 compliance with  spending requirements and reports this information to Congress as part of  its annual report on the programs. However, without the correct data on  the amount that agencies obligated for extramural R&D, SBA cannot fully  determine agencies\u2019 compliance with the spending requirements and  cannot accurately report to Congress on their compliance. If SBA cannot  fully determine agencies\u2019 compliance based on data those agencies are  submitting, then notifying Congress of this limitation would be important to  help ensure that Congress receives critical information for overseeing  these programs. Further, if SBA determines that calculating spending  requirements based on extramural R&D obligations is not feasible, then  developing a proposal for Congress to change the requirement could  better position SBA and the agencies in determining requirements to help  ensure that the intended benefits of these programs are being attained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Data Indicate Most Agencies Met SBIR and STTR Spending Requirements", "paragraphs": ["While it was generally the wrong data, the data agencies did submit to  SBA indicate that 9 of the 11 participating agencies met or exceeded their  fiscal year 2013 spending requirements for the SBIR program, while the  remaining 2 agencies did not meet the requirements.

In  addition, agency officials told us that extenuating circumstances, such as  late appropriations and spikes in funding related to natural disasters, also  affected their ability to meet annual spending requirements in fiscal year  2013. For example, Commerce officials said that in fiscal year 2013 the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received additional  funding from supplemental appropriations related to Super Storm Sandy  late in the fiscal year\u2014after the agency\u2019s internal deadline for issuing new  contracts\u2014which kept them from obligating enough money to meet the  spending requirement that increased due to the supplemental funding.  They said that the money not obligated in fiscal year 2013 was obligated  in fiscal year 2014. Consistent with the findings from our June 2014  report, some program managers said their agency did not meet spending  requirements, but the officials said they will spend all of the funding that  was budgeted for the programs before the funding expires. However, they  did not spend the minimum required amount in fiscal year 2013 and,  therefore, did not comply with the spending requirements.", "SBA officials agree that meeting the spending requirements for the SBIR  and STTR programs requires agencies to spend at least the minimum  required percentages on the programs each fiscal year. However, we  found in our June 2014 report that SBA\u2019s most recent SBIR policy  directive states that agencies must reserve the minimum percentages for  awards to small business, and we recommended that SBA revise its  policy directives to correctly summarize the law. officials told us that they are planning to review and clarify the language in  future policy directives, but, as the officials told us in January 2015, they  disagree that the policy directive inaccurately summarizes the law. The  officials told us that the inclusion of the word \u201creserve\u201d in the policy  directive does not lead agencies to reserve money for multiple years.

Most  agency officials told us that they submitted their methodology reports late  because SBA did not request the reports at an earlier date.

In  October 2014, SBA officials told us that they had recently begun  reviewing the agencies\u2019 annual data submissions for fiscal year 2013 and  anticipated that it would take 6 to 9 months to complete their report and  submit it to Congress. Officials said that their review of the data  submissions was delayed because of changes SBA had made to the data  submission template, which prompted SBA to extend the reporting date  for agencies from March 2014, as required by SBA\u2019s policy directives, to  June 2014. We previously concluded in September 2013 that, without  more rigorous oversight by SBA, and more timely and detailed reporting  on the part of both SBA and participating agencies, it would be difficult for  SBA to ensure that intended benefits of these programs are being  attained and that Congress was receiving critical information to oversee  these programs.

The fiscal  year 2012 report to Congress, which SBA submitted to Congress in  November 2014 and is the most recent report available, did not include  the required analysis of agencies\u2019 methodology reports. SBA officials told  us that they did not provide clear guidance to the agencies about the  information to submit to SBA in their fiscal year 2012 methodology reports  and, therefore, it could be unclear how agencies calculated their  extramural R&D. For fiscal year 2013, SBA provided agencies with  additional guidance requesting the identification of all R&D programs  excluded from the determination of extramural R&D and the dollar  amounts of those programs, but they have not yet assessed whether the  information is adequate to determine whether agencies are calculating  their extramural R&D correctly. Currently, each of the agencies submits  methodology reports of varying detail, with some providing limited  information on how they calculated their extramural R&D budgets that  make it difficult for SBA to determine how the agencies are calculating  their extramural R&D.

For  example, if the spending requirements were calculated based on an  agency\u2019s total R&D budget rather than its extramural R&D obligations  using the same percentages and participation thresholds defined in  current law, total spending requirements in fiscal year 2013 would have  increased from $2.3 billion to $3.9 billion, an increase of roughly $1.6  billion or 70 percent, according to our analysis of budget data and data  submitted to SBA. This increase would have occurred both because  agencies that currently participate would be required to spend more on  the programs\u2014because an agency\u2019s total R&D budget is larger than its  extramural R&D budget\u2014and because additional agencies would be  required to participate. Figure 3 shows the effects of changing spending  requirements at each agency from current law, which is based on a  percentage of extramural R&D obligations, to an alternative scenario that  applies the same percentages to total R&D budgets. These effects are  consistent with our findings in previous reports on these issues.", "As shown in figure 3, some agencies\u2019 spending requirements would  increase more than others under the alternative scenario. This variation is  due primarily to differences in the relative proportions of the agencies\u2019  extramural and intramural R&D obligations, but also affected by the  inclusion of programs in total R&D that were excluded from extramural  R&D by statute. Agencies that fund primarily extramural research would  see smaller increases to their spending requirements under the  alternative scenario, while agencies that fund more intramural research  would see larger increases in their spending requirements, a finding  consistent with those of our previous reports. Examples are as follows:", "NSF used more than 95 percent of its total R&D budget to fund  extramural research in fiscal year 2013 and was required, based on  data submitted to SBA, to spend $131.7 million on its SBIR program  that year. Under the alternative scenario, NSF\u2019s SBIR spending  requirement would have been $133.6 million, an increase of about 1  percent.", "The Department of Commerce, on the other hand, used more than 20  percent of its total R&D budget to fund extramural R&D in fiscal year  2013 and was required to spend about $7 million on its SBIR program  in that year. Under the alternative scenario, Commerce\u2019s spending  requirement would have more than quadrupled to $30.9 million.  Furthermore, assuming that the thresholds for participating in the  program did not change, this scenario would have required  Commerce to spend $4 million on a new STTR program in fiscal year  2013. Consequently, the alternative scenario would have required  Commerce to spend an additional $27.9 million on SBIR and STTR  programs in fiscal year 2013, an increase of about 400 percent.", "As noted above, changing the calculation methodology from basing the  spending requirement on extramural R&D obligations to total R&D budget  would also require additional agencies to participate in SBIR and STTR,  assuming that the dollar thresholds for participation remain the same.  Two additional agencies\u2014the Departments of Veterans Affairs and the  Interior\u2014would have been required to participate in SBIR during fiscal  year 2013 under the alternative scenario. Adding these agencies to the  SBIR program would have increased total federal SBIR spending  requirements by $52.5 million, in addition to the $1.3 billion increase in  spending requirements at the 11 agencies that currently participate in the  SBIR program. Likewise, three additional agencies\u2014USDA and the  Departments of Commerce and Veterans Affairs\u2014would have been  required to participate in STTR under the alternative scenario. Adding  these three agencies to the STTR program would have increased total  federal STTR spending requirements by $15.2 million, in addition to the  spending requirement increases of $163 million at the five agencies that  currently participate in STTR.", "Basing the SBIR and STTR spending requirements on an agency\u2019s total  R&D budget, and applying a lower percentage than under current law,  could result in a total federal commitment to the programs that is similar  to what would result under current law. However, such a scenario would  lower spending requirements at some agencies and raise them at others.  As shown in figure 4, if the percentage applied to an agency\u2019s total R&D  budget had been 1.6 percent for SBIR and 0.2 percent for STTR in fiscal  year 2013, and the thresholds for participating had remained the same,  total required federal spending on the programs would be similar to  required federal spending under current law. Using these lower  percentages, spending requirements would have increased at agencies  that primarily fund intramural research, such as EPA or the Department of  Commerce. In contrast, spending requirements would have decreased at  agencies, such as HHS and NSF, which primarily fund extramural  research.

For example, several  program managers said that basing the SBIR and STTR spending  requirements on total R&D would reduce the complexity of calculating  spending requirements since agencies would no longer have to identify  the extramural portion of their total R&D budgets. Some agency officials  said that extramural R&D obligations are not calculated for any purpose  beyond determining SBIR and STTR spending requirements. DOD  program managers also told us that changing the calculation method  would significantly simplify administration of their program. Currently,  DOD\u2019s program managers receive funding for SBIR and STTR from the  comptrollers of all 3 military departments and about 21 other components  that conduct R&D. According to DOD program officials, receiving money  from all of these components can take months. If the spending  requirements were calculated based on total R&D budgets, DOD program  officials said that the SBIR program could receive funding from a single  comptroller, which would allow DOD to make awards faster and better  align SBIR and STTR awards with DOD-wide priorities.", "Program officials also identified potential drawbacks to changing the  methodology, as we found in our previous reviews. In particular, several  program managers said that increasing the amount of money that goes to  SBIR could potentially reduce the amount of resources directed toward  intramural research and extramural research outside of the SBIR and  STTR programs. Program managers at one agency told us that the goals  of extramural and intramural R&D spending are different since spending  on intramural R&D is driven directly by an agency\u2019s mission, while  spending on extramural R&D provides special expertise that may not  exist in the agency. These officials said that shifting money away from  intramural R&D to small businesses that may not have the necessary  expertise could diminish an agency\u2019s ability to address specialized areas  of R&D. Furthermore, program officials at another agency said they did  not think it would make sense to calculate spending requirements for  SBIR and STTR based on total R&D budgets since small businesses are  only involved in extramural R&D, and total R&D budgets include funding  for both intramural and extramural R&D. These officials said that  structuring the spending requirements in this way could result in  intramural research programs paying to support research at small  businesses that does not directly benefit the programs, depending on how  agencies decide to implement the change. In addition, some program  managers raised concerns that a significant increase in the funding for  the programs could be a challenge in the short term because they do not  currently receive enough quality applications to meet the potential  increased spending requirements, and it could take several years before  they would have enough quality applications to meet the new spending  requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Total Administrative Spending in Fiscal Year 2013 Is Unknown, but Six Agencies Spent $12.3 Million on the Administrative Pilot Program", "paragraphs": ["Little is known about total administrative spending for fiscal year 2013  because the agencies that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs  are not required to and do not fully track these costs.

Of  the five agencies that chose not to participate in the administrative pilot  program\u2014Commerce, Education, EPA, DHS, and NASA\u2014three said that  participation in the program would take money away from making awards  to small businesses. Another agency that chose not to participate, DHS,  submitted a program proposal to SBA for the administrative pilot program,  but agency officials told us that they decided not to participate because  internal policies kept them from hiring a dedicated contracting  officer/specialist, and a conference they planned to attend to conduct  outreach to underserved communities was cancelled.", "Program officials at most of the agencies that participated in the pilot  program told us that SBA\u2019s approval of the work plans after the fiscal year  started or late appropriations from Congress contributed to agencies  spending less than they planned to spend in fiscal year 2013.

Of the six agencies that  participated, DOE obligated most of what it estimated it would spend. One  program manager said that the small amount of money the agency spent  through the administrative pilot program in fiscal year 2013 is somewhat  misleading, as many of the agency\u2019s activities were just getting started,  and agency officials expected to spend more in the future on allowable  administrative pilot activities. Another agency official told us that the  agency did not participate in the administrative pilot program in fiscal year  2013 because the agency drafted its plan late in the fiscal year and could  not make planned expenditures, but that the agency participated in the  pilot program in fiscal year 2014. Finally, officials at one agency raised  concerns that it was challenging to find new activities, in part because the  agency was already doing or had recently done some things that they  wanted to fund. For example, program managers for one agency told us  that they wanted to use funds from the administrative pilot program to  reinstate in-person award review panels, which were discontinued due to  lack of funding. However, SBA refused to allow it, stating that funds from  the administrative pilot program could only be used to support new  activities. The agency officials said that they understand SBA\u2019s reasoning  but believed that restoring discontinued administrative activities should be  considered new activities and allowed.", "In fiscal year 2013, SBA requested that agencies submit data on the total  amount spent on the administrative pilot program, but it did not request  agencies to submit information on how they used the funds.

In our previous reports on these issues, we  identified some areas where SBA could take actions to better ensure  agencies\u2019 compliance with spending and reporting requirements. For  example, in our last report, we recommended that SBA clarify in the SBIR  and STTR policy directives that agencies are supposed to spend the  required amount each year, rather than reserving funds for future years to  meet spending requirements. We also recommended that SBA request  that agencies submit their methodology reports within 4 months of  appropriations, as required by law. SBA officials said that they plan to  take actions to address both of these recommendations but had not done  so before agencies submitted their fiscal year 2013 data, and we found  that these issues continue. Thus, we continue to believe the  recommendations have merit and should be fully implemented.", "In addition to issues that could be addressed by implementing our prior  recommendations, we identified three issues that\u2014if left unaddressed\u2014 could affect compliance with spending and reporting requirements in the  future. First, most agencies continued to provide SBA with data on their  extramural R&D budgets, rather than the amounts they actually obligated  for extramural R&D. In doing so, agencies have limited SBA\u2019s ability to  accurately assess whether they complied with program spending  requirements. Without information on how much agencies obligated for  extramural R&D, SBA cannot accurately determine and report to  Congress on compliance with spending requirements. Program managers  told us that they face challenges in submitting obligations data to SBA.  For example, they cited difficulties in calculating their actual extramural  R&D obligations and challenges in complying with spending requirements  based on a figure that is not known until after the end of the fiscal year\u2014 when it is too late to obligate additional funds to comply with the  requirements. Nevertheless, the Small Business Act defines the annual  spending requirements as a percentage of their extramural R&D  obligations. Without SBA notifying Congress or developing a proposal for  Congress to change the requirement, agencies are likely to continue to  face challenges in submitting the correct data to SBA and in complying  with the law. Second, SBA did not include an analysis of agencies\u2019  methodology reports in its most recent report to Congress for fiscal year  2012, and SBA officials told us it was not clear from the methodology  reports how agencies were calculating their extramural R&D. Moreover,  some program managers told us that the purpose of the methodology  reports is not clear. The law requires SBA to include an analysis of the  agencies\u2019 methodology reports to Congress. However, each of the  agencies submits methodology reports of varying detail, with some  providing limited information on how they calculated their extramural R&D  budgets, making it difficult for SBA to analyze the agencies\u2019 methodology  reports. Without assessing whether the information it collects is adequate  to analyze agencies\u2019 methodology reports, SBA cannot ensure that it is  providing Congress with an accurate analysis of how agencies calculate  their extramural R&D. Third, the administrative pilot program provides  agencies with an opportunity to expand their oversight and administration  of the programs. In fiscal year 2013, SBA requested the total amount that  agencies spent on the administrative pilot program from the agencies but  did not require agencies to submit information on how they used the  funds. Without this additional information, SBA cannot undertake a  comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the administrative pilot  program allowing it to provide greater transparency on the program to  Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure full compliance with SBIR and STTR spending and reporting  requirements, we recommend that the SBA Administrator take the  following three actions:", "Notify Congress in SBA\u2019s annual report if it cannot determine agency  compliance with program spending requirements when agencies that  participate in the SBIR and/or STTR programs do not report  extramural R&D obligations data, or develop a proposal to Congress  that would change the requirement.", "Assess the methodology reporting requirement to determine whether  it generates adequate information for SBA to analyze the accuracy of  agencies\u2019 calculations of their extramural R&D.

The remaining agencies\u2014DOD and  USDA\u2014provided written comments, which were reproduced in  appendixes III and IV, respectively.", "In its written comments, the DOD Acting Director for the Office of Small  Business programs raised two issues. First, DOD recommended that we  remove the assertion that the extramural budget is defined as actual  obligations over the course of the year. DOD stated that the spending  requirement is calculated within 4 months following the enactment of  annual appropriations; therefore the spending requirement must be based  on the planned extramural R&D budget, which has an obligation period of  2 years, and not over the course of the year as defined in this report.  DOD is not required to calculate its spending requirement in the first four  months after it receives its appropriation, but only required to submit its  methodology for calculating its spending requirement. In addition, we  acknowledge that DOD generally has two years to obligate its R&D funds,  but agencies are specifically required to spend it in each fiscal year.  Moreover, the Small Business Act defines extramural R&D budget in  terms of obligations. Nothing in the act indicates that \u201cobligations\u201d should  be construed as \u201cplanned obligations.\u201d Therefore, we continue to believe  that the extramural R&D budget is defined as actual obligations over the  course of the year. In their second point, DOD recommends submitting  the extramural budget calculated in the methodology report, rather than  actual extramural obligations, to SBA in the annual report. We recognize  that using extramural R&D obligations makes it difficult for agencies to  comply with spending requirements and we recommend in this report that  SBA notify Congress if it cannot determine compliance with spending  requirements when agencies do not report extramural R&D obligations  data, or develop a proposal to Congress that would change the  requirement.", "In its written comments, USDA\u2019s Director of the National Institute of Food  and Agriculture stated that USDA generally agrees with our report. The  official stated that because total obligations for extramural R&D are not  known until the end of the fiscal year, it makes it difficult for the agency to  ensure that funding targets for SBIR are met every year.
