Taxpayers were forced to bailout the insurance fund for thrifts, and the insurance fund for banks had a negative balance for the first time in its history. This situation prompted concern and considerable debate about the need to reform federal deposit insurance and regulatory oversight. In response, Congress passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) to, among other things, improve the supervision and examination of depository institutions and to protect the federal deposit insurance funds from further losses. Among its various provisions, FDICIA added two new sections to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950\u2014sections 38 and 39\u2014referred to as the Prompt Regulatory Action provisions. The Prompt Regulatory Action provisions required federal regulators to institute a two-part system of regulatory actions that would be triggered when an institution fails to meet minimum capital levels or safety-and-soundness standards. Enactment of this two-part system was intended to increase the likelihood that regulators would respond promptly and forcefully to prevent or minimize losses to the deposit insurance funds from failures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Federal Reserve System (FRS), and two agencies within the Department of the Treasury\u2014the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)\u2014share responsibility for regulating and supervising federally insured banks and thrifts in the United States. FDIC regulates state-chartered banks that are not members of FRS; FRS regulates state-chartered, member banks; OCC regulates nationally chartered banks; and OTS regulates all federally insured thrifts, regardless of charter type. The regulators carry out their oversight responsibilities primarily through monitoring data filed by institutions, conducting periodic on-site examinations, and taking actions to enforce federal safety-and-soundness laws and regulations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Problems of Thrifts and Banks From 1980 to 1990", "paragraphs": ["From 1980 to 1990, record losses absorbed by the federal deposit insurance funds highlighted the need for a new approach in federal regulatory oversight. Sharply mounting thrift losses over the decade bankrupted the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which was the agency responsible for insuring thrifts until 1989, despite a doubling of premiums and a special $10.8 billion recapitalization program. During this period, a record 1,020 thrifts failed at a cost of about $100 billion to the deposit insurance funds for thrifts. Banks also failed at record rates. From 1980 to 1990, a total of 1,256 federally insured banks were closed or received FDIC financial assistance. Estimated losses to the bank insurance fund for resolving these banks was about $25 billion. These losses resulted in the bank insurance fund\u2019s incurring annual net losses in 1988, 1989, and 1990 that jeopardized the fund\u2019s solvency for the first time since FDIC\u2019s inception.", "Industry analysts have recognized many factors as contributing to the high level of thrift failures from 1980 to 1990. For example, thrifts faced increased competition from nondepository institutions, such as money-market funds and mortgage banks, as well as periods of inflation, recession, and fluctuating interest rates during that period. High interest rates and increased competition for deposits during the decade also created a mismatch between interest revenues from the fixed rate mortgages that constituted the bulk of the thrift industry\u2019s assets and the cost of borrowing funds in the marketplace. Increased powers granted to thrifts in a period during which supervision did not keep pace has also been cited by some analysts, including us, as contributing to the problems of the industry.", "Regulators and industry analysts have associated a number of factors with the problems of banks during the 1980s. First, banks suffered losses resulting from credit risk\u2014risk of default on loans\u2014in an environment of prolonged economic expansion and increasingly volatile interest rates. The decade began with crises in agricultural loans and loans to developing nations. Next, unrepaid energy loans took a toll and led to the downfall of several major banks, including Continental Illinois in Chicago and First RepublicBank in Texas. As the decade came to a close, highly leveraged transactions and the collapse of commercial real estate markets, in which banks had been heavy lenders, depleted the capital structures of some major East Coast and West Coast banks and led to their failures.", "One factor we and others cited as contributing to the problems of both thrifts and banks during this period was excessive forbearance by federal regulators. Regulators had wide discretion in choosing the severity and timing of enforcement actions that they took against depository institutions with unsafe and unsound practices. In addition, regulators had a common philosophy of trying to work informally and cooperatively with troubled institutions. In a 1991 report, we found that this approach, in combination with regulators\u2019 wide discretion in the oversight of financial institutions, had resulted in enforcement actions that were neither timely nor forceful enough to (1) correct unsafe and unsound banking practices or (2) prevent or minimize losses to the insurance funds. Regulators themselves recognized that their supervisory practices in the 1980s failed to adequately control risky practices that led to the numerous thrift and bank failures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Response to the Thrift and Bank Crisis of the 1980s", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed two major laws to address the thrift and bank crisis of the 1980s. The first, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), was enacted primarily in response to the immediate problems surrounding FSLIC\u2019s bankruptcy and troubles in the thrift industry. FIRREA created a new regulator for the thrift industry, OTS, and a new insurance fund, the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), to replace the bankrupt FSLIC. In addition, FIRREA increased the enforcement authority of both bank and thrift regulators. For example, FIRREA expanded the circumstances under which regulators could assess civil money penalties and increased the maximum penalty to $1 million per day. FIRREA also authorized FDIC to terminate a bank\u2019s or thrift\u2019s deposit insurance on the basis of unsafe and unsound conditions.", "The second major piece of legislation, FDICIA, contains several provisions that were intended to collectively improve the supervision of federally insured depository institutions. Specifically, FDICIA requires a number of corporate governance and accounting reforms to (1) strengthen the corporate governance of depository institutions, (2) improve the financial reporting of depository institutions, and (3) help in the early identification of emerging safety-and-soundness problems in depository institutions. In addition, FDICIA contains provisions that were intended to improve how regulators supervise depository institutions.", "Among the corporate governance and accounting reforms, FDICIA establishes generally accepted accounting principles as the standard for all reports and statements filed with the regulators. FDICIA also requires the management and auditors of depository institutions to annually report on their financial condition and management. The report is to include management\u2019s assessment of (1) the effectiveness of the institution\u2019s internal controls and (2) the institution\u2019s compliance with designated laws and regulations. In addition, FDICIA requires the institution\u2019s external auditors to report separately on management\u2019s assertions. Furthermore, FDICIA requires the institutions to have an independent audit committee composed of outside independent directors.", "Among the supervision provisions, FDICIA requires regulators to perform annual on-site examinations of insured banks and thrifts (an 18-month cycle was allowed for qualified smaller institutions with assets of less than $100 million). FDICIA\u2019s sections 131 and 132 added two new sections to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (sections 38 and 39) that require the implementation of a \u201ctrip wire\u201d approach to increase the likelihood that regulators will address the problems of troubled institutions at an early stage to prevent or minimize loss to the insurance funds."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 38 Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Section 38 creates a capital-based framework for bank and thrift oversight that is based on the placement of financial institutions into one of five capital categories. Capital was made the centerpiece of the framework because it represents funds invested by an institution\u2019s owners, such as common and preferred stock, that can be used to absorb unexpected losses before the institution becomes insolvent. Thus, capital was seen as serving a vital role as a buffer between bank losses and the deposit insurance system. Although section 38 does not in any way limit regulators\u2019 ability to take additional supervisory action, it requires federal regulators to take specific actions against banks and thrifts that have capital levels below minimum standards. The specified regulatory actions are made increasingly severe as an institution\u2019s capital drops to lower levels.", "Section 38 requires regulators to establish criteria for classifying depository institutions into the following five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The section does not place restrictions on institutions that meet or exceed the minimum capital standards\u2014that is, those that are well- or adequately capitalized\u2014other than prohibiting the institutions from paying dividends or management fees that would drop them into the undercapitalized category.", "A depository institution that fails to meet minimum capital levels faces several mandatory restrictions or actions under section 38. The mandatory actions are intended to ensure a swift regulatory response that would prevent further erosion of an institution\u2019s capital. Specifically, section 38 requires an undercapitalized institution to submit a capital restoration plan detailing, among other things, how the institution is going to become adequately capitalized; restrict its asset growth during any quarter so that its average total assets for the quarter do not exceed the preceding quarter\u2019s average total assets, unless certain conditions are met; and receive prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, branching, and new lines of business.", "Section 38 allows regulators to take additional actions against an undercapitalized institution, if deemed necessary. It also requires regulators to closely monitor the institution\u2019s condition and its compliance with section 38\u2019s requirements.", "Section 38 requires regulators to take more forceful corrective measures when institutions become significantly undercapitalized. Regulators must take 1 or more of 10 specified actions, including (1) requiring the sale of equity or debt or, under certain circumstances, requiring institutions to be acquired by or merged with another institution; (2) restricting otherwise allowable transactions with affiliates; and (3) restricting the interest rates paid on deposits by the institution. Each of these three steps is to be mandatory unless the regulator determines that taking such steps would not further the purpose of section 38, which is to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions at the least possible long-term loss to the insurance fund. Other specific actions available to the regulators include imposing more stringent asset growth limitations than required for undercapitalized institutions or requiring the institution to reduce its total assets; requiring the institution, or its subsidiaries, to alter, reduce, or terminate an activity that the regulator determines poses excessive risk to the institution; improving management by (1) ordering a new election for the institution\u2019s board of directors, (2) dismissing directors or senior executive officers, and/or (3) requiring an institution to employ qualified senior executive officers; prohibiting the acceptance, including renewal and rollover, of deposits requiring prior approval for capital distributions from holding companies having control of the institution; and requiring divestiture by (1) the institution of any subsidiary that the regulator determines poses a significant risk to the institution, (2) the parent company of any nondepository affiliate that regulators determine poses a significant risk to the institution, and/or (3) any controlling company of the institution if the regulator determines that divestiture would improve the institution\u2019s financial condition and future prospects.", "Regulators can also require any other action that they determine would better resolve the problems of the institution with the least possible long-term loss to the insurance funds. Finally, section 38 prohibits significantly undercapitalized institutions from paying bonuses to or increasing the compensation of senior executive officers without prior regulatory approval.", "Section 38 requires more stringent action to be taken against critically undercapitalized institutions. After an institution becomes critically undercapitalized, regulators have a 90-day period in which they must either place the institution into receivership or conservatorship or take other action that would better prevent or minimize long-term losses to the insurance fund. In either case, regulators must obtain FDIC concurrence with their actions. Section 38 also prohibits critically undercapitalized depository institutions from doing any of the following without FDIC\u2019s prior written approval: entering into any material transaction (such as investments, expansions, acquisitions, and asset sales), other than in the usual course of business; extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction; amending the institution\u2019s charter or bylaws, except to the extent necessary to carry out any other requirement of any law, regulation, or order; making any material change in accounting methods; engaging in any covered transaction; paying excessive compensation or bonuses; or paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would increase the institution\u2019s weighted average cost of funds to a level significantly exceeding the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the institution\u2019s normal market area.", "In addition, section 38 prohibits a critically undercapitalized institution from making any payment of principal or interest on the institution\u2019s subordinated debt beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized.", "Finally, section 38 permits regulators to, in effect, downgrade an institution by one capital level if regulators determine that the institution is in an unsafe and unsound condition or that it is engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice. For example, regulators can treat an adequately capitalized institution as undercapitalized if the institution received a less than satisfactory rating in its most recent examination report for asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity. This downgrading would then allow regulators to require the institution\u2019s compliance with those restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions, such as limits on the institution\u2019s growth. Thus, section 38 allows regulators to take enforcement actions against an institution that presents a danger to the insurance fund by virtue of a factor other than its capital level. In addition to the specific provisions of section 38, another section of FDICIA provides FDIC with the authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for undercapitalized institutions that meet certain criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 39 Provisions", "paragraphs": ["To limit deposit insurance losses caused by factors other than inadequate capital, section 39 directs each regulator to establish standards defining safety and soundness in three overall areas: (1) operations and management; (2) asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation; and (3) compensation. Section 39 originally made the safety-and-soundness standards applicable to both insured depository institutions and their holding companies, but the reference to holding companies was deleted in 1994.", "The section originally required regulators to prescribe safety-and-soundness standards through the use of regulations. For the operations and management standards, section 39 did not provide specific requirements other than requiring regulators to prescribe standards on internal controls, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, and asset growth. For asset quality, earnings, and\u2014to the extent feasible\u2014stock valuation, the section initially required regulators to establish quantitative standards. (See the next section for a discussion of amendments made to section 39\u2019s original provisions.) Under compensation standards, regulators were to prescribe, among other things, standards specifying when compensation, fees, or benefits to executive officers, employees, directors, or principal shareholders would be considered excessive or could lead to material financial loss.", "Section 39 initially contained a number of provisions concerning the failure to meet the regulators\u2019 prescribed safety-and-soundness standards. One key provision of the section directed regulators to require a corrective action plan from institutions or holding companies that fail to meet any of the standards. Such plans were to specify the steps an institution or a holding company was taking or intended to take to correct the deficiency. Section 39 directed the regulators to establish specific deadlines for submission and review of the plans. If an institution or a holding company failed to submit or implement the plan, regulators were mandated to issue an order requiring the institution or holding company to correct the deficiency and to take one or more of the following remedial actions as considered appropriate: restrict the institution\u2019s or holding company\u2019s asset growth, require the institution or holding company to increase its ratio of tangible restrict interest rates paid on deposits, and/or require the institution or holding company to take any other action that the regulator determines would prevent or minimize losses to the insurance fund.", "Section 39 also initially required regulators to take at least one of the first three previously mentioned remedial actions against institutions that (1) fail to meet any of the operational and/or asset quality standards listed in FDICIA, (2) have not corrected the deficiency, and (3) either commenced operations or experienced a change in control within the preceding 24 months or experienced extraordinary growth during the prior 18 months of failing to meet the standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 Amended Section 39\u2019s Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (CDRI) was passed on September 23, 1994, and contains more than 50 provisions that were intended to reduce bank regulatory burden and paperwork requirements.

The CDRI amendments allow regulators to issue the standards in the form of guidelines instead of regulations. If guidelines are used, the amendments give the regulators the discretion to decide whether a corrective action plan will be required from institutions that are found not to be in compliance with the standards. Finally, the amendments eliminate the requirement that regulators issue quantitative standards for asset quality and earnings and exclude holding companies from the scope of the standards.", "CDRI did not change section 39\u2019s original provisions regarding the content and review of any plan required as a result of noncompliance with section 39\u2019s safety-and-soundness standards.

In the period from 1992 through 1995, the number of bank and thrift failures declined from their 1980 to 1990 levels. For example, 6 banks failed in 1995, compared with 169 bank failures in 1990.", "The low number of bank failures in recent years has allowed the bank insurance fund to rebuild its reserve level. After falling to a record low of negative $7 billion in 1991, the fund grew to over $25 billion in 1995. The recapitalization of the bank insurance fund allowed FDIC to reduce the deposit insurance assessment rate paid by commercial banks twice in the latter part of 1995. As a result, commercial banks are paying the lowest average assessment rate in history.", "Despite the improved performance of the thrift industry, the thrift insurance fund remained undercapitalized as of December 1995. FDICIA required FDIC to increase the bank and thrift insurance funds\u2019 reserve balances to at least 1.25 percent of the estimated insured deposits of insured institutions within 15 years of enactment of a recapitalization schedule. FDIC achieved this reserve ratio for the bank insurance fund on May 31, 1995. However, SAIF is not expected to achieve its required reserve ratio until 2002, according to FDIC.

In the case of OCC, we looked at all of the 52 undercapitalized banks that were located in OCC\u2019s Western, Southwest, and Northeast districts. These data provided us with coverage of 68 percent of all OCC-regulated banks that were undercapitalized during that period. For FRS, we looked at all nine undercapitalized banks under the jurisdiction of FRS\u2019 Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco district banks. Doing so resulted in a coverage of 56 percent of all FRS-regulated banks that were undercapitalized during that period.

We obtained the officials\u2019 views on the legislative intent underlying sections 38 and 39 and the evolution of the final regulations and guidelines. We also had discussions with the officials about regulatory actions, both under their traditional enforcement and section 38 authority, taken against the 61 banks that we reviewed.

In addition, we reviewed OCC\u2019s and FRS\u2019 internal guidance and policies regarding the use of section 38 versus their other enforcement tools.

In 1991, OCC issued a cease-and-desist order against the bank that required substantial improvements in the bank\u2019s operations and financial condition. Despite the cease-and-desist order, the bank\u2019s asset quality and earnings continued to deteriorate over the next several years.", "The Treasury OIG report said that when section 38 capital standards became effective in December 1992, the Mechanics National Bank had a ratio of classified assets-to-capital of about 309 percent and had experienced losses of $4.3 million during 1992. OCC had just completed an examination of the bank in December 1992, which concluded that the bank was likely to fail. At that time, despite apparent asset quality and earnings problems, the bank\u2019s capital had not deteriorated to the point where it was undercapitalized according to section 38 criteria. The bank\u2019s capital ratios fell within the adequately capitalized category. The bank continued to be categorized as adequately capitalized during the first and second quarters of 1993, despite its high levels of classified assets and mounting losses. In July 1993, OCC reclassified the bank to the undercapitalized level. On January 10, 1994, OCC notified the bank that it was critically undercapitalized because its total capital-to-asset ratio had fallen below 2 percent. The regulators closed the bank in April 1994.", "Although the Treasury OIG report criticized OCC\u2019s supervision and enforcement activities for the period between 1988 and 1991, the report found that the agency\u2019s use of section 38 enforcement authority during 1993 and 1994 was appropriate. For example, the OIG report highlighted OCC\u2019s use of its section 38 reclassification authority to remove two Mechanics National Bank officers who were thought to be largely responsible for the bank\u2019s problems. OCC also used its section 38 authority to close the bank on April 1, 1994, within 90 days of the notification of its critically undercapitalized status. Nevertheless, OCC\u2019s enforcement actions under section 38 were largely ineffective in minimizing the losses that were already embedded in the bank\u2019s loan portfolio before it fell to the undercapitalized level. The bank\u2019s estimated loss to the insurance fund of $37 million represented 22 percent of the bank\u2019s total assets of $167 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bank Insurance Fund Continues to Absorb Losses Despite the Implementation of Section 38", "paragraphs": ["The impact of section 38\u2019s implementation on minimizing losses to the insurance funds is difficult to assess. Between 1985 and 1989, losses to the bank insurance fund ranged from approximately 12 to 23 percent of the assets of failed banks with a 5-year weighted average of about 16 percent. As we reported in 1991, this high rate of losses indicated that regulators were not (1) taking forceful actions that effectively prevented dissipation of assets or (2) closing institutions when they still had some residual value.", "There have been some signs of improvement since the 1985-to-1989 period as illustrated in table 3.2. During the first 2 full years that section 38 was in effect, 1993 and 1994, the rates of loss were 17 and 10 percent, respectively, for a weighted average of 15 percent. While these loss rates are still significant, it is too early to assess section 38\u2019s long-term effectiveness in reducing losses to the insurance funds compared with preceding years.

However, the guidelines and regulations developed by regulators to implement section 39 do little to reduce the degree of discretion regulators exercised from 1980 to 1990. In particular, the safety-and-soundness standards contained in the guidelines are general in nature and do not identify specific unsafe or unsound conditions and practices even though the regulators have already established measures that could have served as a basis for more specific requirements. Moreover, the guidelines and regulations do not require regulators to take corrective action against institutions that do not meet the standards for safety and soundness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unsafe and Unsound Conditions and Practices Are Not Specifically Defined", "paragraphs": ["In two 1991 reports, we recommended that Congress and regulators develop a formal, regulatory trip wire system that would require prompt and forceful regulatory action tied to specific unsafe banking practices. The trip wire system we envisioned would have been specific enough to provide clear guidance about what actions should be taken to address specified unsafe banking practices and when the actions should be taken. The intent was to increase the likelihood that regulators would take forceful action to stop risky practices before the capital of the bank begins to fall and it is too late to do much about the condition of the bank or insurance fund losses. The trip wire system was also to consist of objective criteria defining conditions that would trigger regulatory action.", "In contrast, the safety-and-soundness standards, contained in the guidelines developed to implement section 39, as amended, consist of broad statements of sound banking principles that are subject to considerable interpretation by the regulators. For example, the standards for asset quality state that the institution should establish and maintain a system to identify problem assets and prevent deterioration of those assets in a manner commensurate with its size and the nature and scope of its operations. Specifically, the guidelines direct institutions to do the following: conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets and estimate the inherent losses of those assets, compare problem asset totals to capital and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses, take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets, consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations, and provide periodic asset reports containing adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk.", "Although the asset quality standards identify general controls and processes the regulators expect institutions to have, the standards do not provide specific, measurable criteria of unsafe conditions or practices that would trigger mandatory enforcement actions. In our 1991 report on deposit insurance reform, we suggested that the classified assets-to-capital ratio could serve as an objective criterion because the ratio is routinely used by bank examiners to identify deteriorating asset quality. For example, we reported that the regulators become increasingly concerned when a bank\u2019s classified assets-to-capital ratio increased to 50 percent or more. Similarly, during the interagency process used to develop the section 39 safety-and-soundness standards, FRS had proposed that the regulators take mandatory enforcement actions when a bank\u2019s classified assets-to-capital ratio reached 75 to 100 percent. However, the regulators decided not to include this requirement after CDRI provided them with the option of omitting quantifiable measures of unsafe and unsound conditions. Without such specific criteria, regulators will continue to exercise wide discretion in determining whether a depository institution\u2019s asset quality deterioration is at a point where enforcement actions are necessary.", "Similarly, the section 39-based loan documentation standards do not establish specific criteria for regulators to use to assess an institution\u2019s safety and soundness. The regulators believed that general standards provide an acceptable gauge against which compliance can be measured, while at the same time allowing for differing approaches to loan documentation. However, this approach to loan documentation standards differs from the long-standing approach that the regulators have established in their examination manuals. These standards contain specific loan documentation requirements that examiners are to use in assessing the safety and soundness of depository institutions. For example, real-estate construction loan files are to include current financial statements, inspection reports, and written appraisals. Since the section 39 standards do not contain similar documentation requirements, we believe the standards are open to considerable interpretation and do little to limit the wide discretion regulators have in determining whether banks have adequate loan documentation practices.", "Furthermore, the loan documentation standards do not provide or state a specific level of noncompliance at which enforcement actions will be required. Although it may be difficult to develop quantifiable criteria for making such enforcement decisions, there are various regulatory \u201crules of thumb\u201d in place that we believe could serve as the basis for triggering mandatory actions. For example, in its 1988 report on the reasons why banks fail, OCC found that banks with loan documentation problems in 15 to 20 percent or more of their loan portfolios were typically operating in an unsafe and unsound manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Discretion to Require Section 39 Compliance Plans, and Requirements Are Not Specific", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, CDRI amended the section 39 mandate that regulators require a depository institution to file a compliance plan if the institution is found not to be in compliance with the standards. The new provision allows regulators greater flexibility in deciding whether to impose such a requirement. In the July 10, 1995, Notice of Final Rulemaking, the four regulators (OCC, FRS, FDIC, and OTS) stated that they expect to require a compliance plan from any institution with deficiencies severe enough to threaten the safety and soundness of the institution. However, as discussed in the previous section, regulators have not developed quantifiable criteria or other specific guidance for measuring an institution\u2019s compliance with the section 39 safety-and-soundness standards. Therefore, it is not clear how regulators would determine whether an institution\u2019s noncompliance with generally accepted management principles is \u201csevere\u201d enough to warrant regulatory action.", "In addition, the implementing regulations do not provide any specific criteria for compliance plans beyond those contained in the section 39 legislation. The regulations merely state that compliance plans should identify steps that the institution is to take to correct the identified problems and the time by which the steps are to be taken. In contrast, section 38 and its implementing regulations establish more specific criteria for CRPs. For example, CRPs must specify capital levels that the institution expects to achieve for each year the plans are in effect. In addition, CRPs must show how the institution will comply with any restrictions on its activities under section 38 and the types of businesses and activities in which the institution will engage. Section 38 requires regulators to reject any CRP unless it contains such information, is based on realistic economic assumptions, and would not appreciably increase risk to the institutions.

Instead, regulators plan to use the examination process to identify institutions that have excessive and poorly managed risk exposure, due to concentrations of credit, nontraditional products, or interest rate risk.

Although the section 38 capital standards appear to have played some role in strengthening the condition of the banks and thrifts, other factors have also contributed to this improvement, including lower interest rates and an improving economy. Despite the apparently sound financial condition of the bank and thrift industry, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the current strong performance of the bank and thrift industry is masking management problems or excessive risk-taking that is not being addressed by regulators. For example, the financial press reported in November 1995 and March 1996 that delinquent consumer loans, such as credit card loans, grew considerably during these years and that this growth was partially attributed to lower credit standards.

The implementation of section 38 has provided capital categories and mandated actions that regulators should take if banks or thrifts fall into specific categories. However, section 39, as amended, appears to leave regulatory discretion largely unchanged from what existed before the passage of FDICIA.", "Sections 38 and 39 provide regulators with additional enforcement tools that they can use to obtain corrective action or close institutions with serious capital deficiencies and/or safety-and-soundness problems. These provisions include the enforcement tool that allows regulators to remove bank officials believed to be the cause of the institution\u2019s problems as well as other actions intended to stop the institution from engaging in risky practices. Moreover, section 38 appears to have encouraged institutions to raise additional equity capital and should help prevent capital-deficient institutions from compounding losses.", "Despite such benefits, severely troubled institutions may not be subject to mandatory restrictions and supervisory actions under section 38 due to its reliance on capital as the basis for regulatory intervention.
