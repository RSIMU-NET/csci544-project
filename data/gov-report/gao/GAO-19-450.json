Progress on two projects related to overseas presence has stalled, and State has discontinued a project to consolidate real property management.", "State has not addressed certain key practices related to leadership focus and attention in implementing its reform efforts. Multiple transitions in State's leadership and changing priorities contributed to uncertainty about leadership support for reform projects.Top leadership is expected to drive any needed transformation by clarifying priorities and communicating direction to employees and stakeholders.", "In March 2018, the President replaced the Secretary of State, a transition that created uncertainty within the agency regarding the future of ongoing reform projects. While some officials stated that the new Secretary had expressed support for data analytics and cyber security reform efforts, other officials said they were unclear as to whether their projects remained a priority. According to senior officials, the current Secretary has focused on critical needs, such as ending the hiring freeze and increasing recruitment, and on launching new initiatives.", "In April 2018, State disbanded the dedicated teams overseeing its reform efforts and shifted responsibility to bureaus and offices. In some cases, officials assigned to lead reform projects reported receiving little or no direction from department leadership. GAO's prior work has highlighted the benefits of having a dedicated team to manage agency transformations.", "In addition, State officials indicated that the challenges posed by these transitions were compounded by a lack of Senate-confirmed leadership in key positions. Specifically, during the first 2 years of State's reform efforts, bureaus and offices responsible for implementing 12 of State's 13 continuing reform projects reported directly to one or more officials serving in an acting capacity. For example, State did not have a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Management from January 2017 to May 2019, which, according to senior officials, hindered State's reform efforts.", "According to State officials, taken together these leadership transitions led to several projects being scaled back, slowed down, or both.", "Although uncertainties exist about leadership priorities regarding the reform efforts, the bureaus and offices responsible for implementing reform projects have taken steps to manage and monitor them, consistent with key practices. Each of the continuing projects has implementation plans that include milestones and deliverables, and some report their progress publicly. For example, State reports on the progress of some projects in its annual performance plans and reports. The lack of a dedicated team to manage the reform process, however, could slow State's overall efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of State should (1) determine which unimplemented reform projects, if any, should be implemented and communicate this determination to Congress and appropriate State personnel, and (2) establish a single dedicated team to manage the implementation of all reform efforts that the Secretary decides to pursue.

In April 2017, OMB issued Memorandum M-17-22, requiring executive  branch agencies to submit reform plans to OMB by September 2017.  The OMB memo included detailed guidance on how agencies should  develop these reform plans.", "The Department of State (State) is the lead agency responsible for  implementing U.S. foreign policy and works to advance U.S. interests  around the world. In 2017, State initiated a series of reform efforts in  response to Executive Order 13781 and the subsequent guidance from  OMB. Our prior work has shown that the success of agency reforms  hinges on the agencies\u2019 adherence to key practices for organizational  transformations, such as agreement on reform goals and the involvement  of Congress, federal employees, and other key stakeholders. We  previously developed key questions from our prior work on practices that  can help assess agency reform efforts.", "We prepared this report under the authority of the Comptroller General to  conduct work to assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities. Our  objectives were to (1) examine the status of the reform efforts that State  included in its fiscal year 2019 Congressional Budget Justification and (2)  assess the extent to which State addressed key practices critical to the  successful implementation of agency reform efforts. For both objectives,  we reviewed State\u2019s reform plans, proposals, and related documents, and  interviewed senior officials\u2014at or above the assistant secretary level\u2014as  well as implementing officials involved in State\u2019s reform efforts.", "To determine the extent to which State addressed key practices for  implementing agency reforms, we assessed State\u2019s reform efforts against  selected practices compiled in our June 2018 report, which were distilled  from a body of work published over several decades and reviewed by  subject matter specialists. We focused our evaluation on the current  implementation phase of State\u2019s reform efforts\u2014from April 2018 to the  present\u2014to avoid duplicating the reviews of earlier phases of State\u2019s  reform efforts conducted by State\u2019s and the U.S. Agency for International  Development\u2019s (USAID) Offices of Inspector General (OIG). Because our  review was focused on the implementation phase of State\u2019s reform  efforts, we limited the scope of our evaluation to implementation-related  key practices from our June 2018 report and excluded key practices  related to other phases of agency reform efforts. Specifically, we  assessed State\u2019s implementation of its reform efforts against our prior  report\u2019s key questions in two subcategories of practices specific to  assessing the implementation of agency reforms: (1) Leadership Focus  and Attention and (2) Managing and Monitoring. We considered the key  questions in each subcategory, the nature of State\u2019s reform projects, and  the efforts State had taken to implement them, and then made a  qualitative judgment as to what extent, if any, State had addressed those  practices. A full description of our scope and methodology can be found  in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to August 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As a key component of  this outreach effort, State hired a contractor to design and administer a  confidential online survey, which was sent to all State and USAID  employees in May 2017. According to the contractor\u2019s report, the survey  had a 43 percent response rate, with 27,837 State employees and 6,142  USAID employees responding to the survey.

In July 2017, the Deputy  Secretary of State created five planning teams to develop multiple  projects in those five areas. The Deputy Secretary also established an  Executive Steering Committee composed of senior State and USAID  officials to guide the five planning teams and provide direction during the  reform process. Led jointly by State and USAID, each planning team  comprised participants from a cross section of overseas and domestic  workforces.

According to implementing  officials, all these projects predated the Executive Order and OMB memo  issued in the spring of 2017.

In February 2018, State reported to  Congress in its fiscal year 2019 budget justification that it was pursuing  the reform projects we described above. In March 2018, the first transition  affecting the implementation of those projects occurred when the  President removed the then Secretary of State and nominated the then  CIA director to replace him; in April 2018, the Senate confirmed the  current Secretary. According to senior State officials, when the new  Secretary took office, his top priority was ending the hiring freeze and  restarting a concerted recruitment effort because vacancies in key  positions and a general staffing shortfall would otherwise have led to what  one senior official described as a \u201ccataclysmic failure\u201d at State. These  senior officials noted that the new Secretary decided some of the existing  reform projects were not well designed and that he wanted greater  emphasis on cybersecurity and data analytics. They said he also wanted  to pursue other initiatives, including a new proposal to create a Global  Public Affairs Bureau by merging two existing bureaus. The senior  officials told us that the Secretary authorized responsible bureaus and  offices to determine whether to continue, revise, or terminate existing  reform efforts or launch new initiatives. However, State did not formally  communicate other changes in its reform priorities to Congress, such as  its plan to no longer combine State and USAID\u2019s real property offices.", "State initiated another transition in leadership of the reform efforts in April  2018 when it disbanded the dedicated planning teams overseeing the  reform efforts and delegated responsibility for implementing the reform  projects to relevant bureaus and offices. As the planning teams finished  working on their particular reform efforts and prepared to transfer these  projects to the bureaus, some planning teams provided memos and  reports on the status of their efforts and offered recommendations for the  bureaus to consider when determining next steps in implementing the  projects. Some implementing officials, however, reported that they  received little or no direction regarding their projects or any other  indication of continued interest in their project from department or bureau  leadership aside from the initial notification that the project had been  assigned to them. For example, in separate discussions with  implementing officials responsible for three different projects, the officials  reported that they had not received any direction or other guidance  related to their assigned project since it was delegated to them in April  2018. In one case, this lack of communication continued for nearly a year.  In addition, although implementing officials said that they have managed  to incorporate reform-related work into their daily responsibilities, they  noted that there were multiple benefits from having had dedicated  planning teams to lead earlier phases of State\u2019s reform efforts. For  example, they said that the dedicated teams included senior officials and  the regular involvement of high-level leadership facilitated by these teams  had helped advance the reform efforts. These dedicated teams also  required staff to set aside time to focus on reform initiatives, which  allowed them to develop holistic solutions to reform-related challenges.  Conversely, implementing officials reported negative implications of not  having dedicated teams. For example, one implementing official  described how positive work initiated under the leadership of these  dedicated teams\u2014including efforts to eliminate redundancies and identify  opportunities for consolidation\u2014ended when the teams were disbanded  because the staff and resources needed to continue these efforts were no  longer available.", "Various State officials noted that the prolonged absence of Senate- confirmed leadership in key positions posed additional challenges. We  have previously testified that it is more difficult to obtain buy-in on long- term plans and efforts that are underway when an agency has leaders in  acting positions because federal employees are historically skeptical of  whether the latest efforts to make improvements are going to be  sustained over a period of time. For example, State did not have a  Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Management from January 2017  to May 2019. In November 2018, the Deputy Secretary of State told us  that the lack of a confirmed Under Secretary for Management was  hindering State\u2019s ability to conduct business and implement reforms. The  bureaus and offices responsible for 12 of State\u2019s 13 continuing reform  projects reported directly to an Acting Undersecretary for Management  from January 2017 through May 2019. Moreover, State officials told us  that both projects that we determined to be stalled were, among other  things, awaiting the confirmation of an Under Secretary for Management  to make key decisions. Furthermore, some implementing officials told us  that the lack of confirmed officials in leadership positions within the  bureaus responsible for implementing the projects added to a lack of  leadership focus on implementing some of State\u2019s reform projects.", "According to State officials, as of April 2019, although 13 of the reform  projects described in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Budget  Justification were considered by State to be continuing, some had been  scaled back, slowed down, or both as a result of senior leadership\u2019s  shifting priorities and attention. For example, one of State\u2019s initial reform  projects was related to better management of real property. However,  State ultimately scaled back this project, effectively splitting it into two  projects: One project focused on real property process improvements is  continuing, but State has discontinued the other project to consolidate its  and USAID\u2019s real property function. Implementing officials told us in  November 2018 that they were still pursuing the internal real property  process improvements. They said then that they expected this reform  project would likely progress at a slower pace without the dedicated team  that previously had provided direct access and frequent interaction with  senior department leadership. However, these officials recently informed  us that the pace of progress on this project actually increased under the  leadership of the bureau\u2019s Senate-confirmed Director. The bureau was  led by acting directors from January 2017 through September 2018.", "We have identified leadership focus and attention as practices vital to  successfully implementing reform efforts. These practices include  communicating clear and compelling reasons for the reforms, having a  dedicated implementation team to manage the transformation process,  and designating leaders responsible for implementing reforms and  holding them accountable. Dedicating a strong and stable implementation  team responsible for a transformation\u2019s day-to-day management is  important to ensuring that reforms receive the focused, full-time attention  needed to be sustained and successful. One of the key responsibilities of  a dedicated team is communication, particularly answering questions  about the reform process from employees and other stakeholders. An  implementation team is also important to ensuring that reform efforts are  implemented in a coherent and integrated way. Because an agency\u2019s  transformation process is a large undertaking, we have found that an  implementation team must have direct access to and be accountable to  top leadership. In turn, top leadership must vest the team with the  necessary authority and resources to set priorities, make timely decisions,  and move quickly to implement top leadership\u2019s decisions regarding the  transformation.", "In addition, we previously reported that the single most important element  of successful improvement initiatives is the demonstrated commitment of  top leaders. This commitment is most prominently demonstrated through  top leaders\u2019 personal involvement in developing and directing reform  efforts. Federal standards for internal control in the federal government  also emphasize the importance of maintaining leadership continuity in  order to achieve agency objectives. As a result, in other reports, we  have recognized that agency reform efforts can take years to implement  and that the time frame required for change typically takes longer than the  tenures of political leaders. Similarly, the time it takes to nominate and  confirm officials for senior management positions can also hamper efforts  to initiate reforms or sustain momentum needed to successfully  implement reform initiatives. For these reasons, and others, we have  highlighted the need to ensure that top leadership drives the  transformation and establishes dedicated teams to manage the  transformation process.", "Taken together, the leadership transitions at State had two significant  effects on State\u2019s reform efforts. First, the transition of departmental  leadership and lack of direction and communication about subsequent  changes in leadership\u2019s priorities contributed to uncertainty among  implementing officials about the future of individual reform projects.  Second, according to implementing officials, the transition of project  responsibility from dedicated teams to bureau-level implementing officials  resulted in fewer resources and a lack of senior leadership involvement  and attention for some projects. Absent leadership decisions,  implementing officials will continue to struggle with understanding  leadership priorities with regard to State\u2019s reform efforts. Similarly, for any  projects that are determined to be leadership priorities, day-to-day  implementation activities will continue to be hampered by the lack of a  dedicated team to guide and manage the agency\u2019s overall reform effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing and Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["Although uncertainty exists about the leadership priorities regarding  reform efforts, the bureaus and offices responsible for implementing  State\u2019s reform projects have taken steps to manage and monitor their  reform projects. Our previous work has identified monitoring as another  important practice when implementing reform efforts, including, among  other things, developing implementation plans and ensuring transparency  by publicly reporting on progress toward milestones. These practices  are also incorporated into State\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual and other  department policies.", "We found that the relevant bureaus and offices responsible for  implementing reform projects had developed implementation plans and  that these plans identified milestones and deliverables for the projects.  For example the Human Resources Services Delivery project had an  implementation plan with milestones and deliverables, such as identifying  programs and functions for consolidation in 2019 and reducing human  resource delivery costs by 14 percent by 2022. Similarly, we found that  the implementation plan for the IT Modernization project incorporated  milestones that including, among other things, implementing a  comprehensive enterprise IT risk management program by fiscal year  2020; reducing average deployment time for new IT capabilities by 10  percent annually from fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2021; and  increasing workforce access to cloud-based email and business data  from 10 percent to 100 percent by September 30, 2019.", "With regard to monitoring, while there is no centralized mechanism for  reporting progress on all projects, we found that each of the ongoing  projects currently has some form of progress reporting. For example,  State reports progress on projects with IT components\u2014such as Real- Time Collaboration and Work Anytime, Anywhere and Improve  Enterprise-Wide Data Accessibility\u2014as part of its quarterly reporting on IT  Modernization under the Government Performance and Results  Modernization Act of 2010. As a result, these projects have continued  within a formal monitoring structure that involves regular web-based  status updates and progress reporting. Other reform efforts\u2014such as  human capital and real property projects\u2014are monitored against  milestones established in State\u2019s Joint Strategic Plan and progress is  reported in State\u2019s Annual Performance Reports. Progress for certain  projects is also monitored and reported in other reports, such as State\u2019s  joint strategic plan, IT strategy, or human capital plan. Finally, other  reform projects, such as State\u2019s acquisition reform efforts, are reported at  the government-wide level as part of the Cross-Agency Priority Goals  outlined in the President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "State collects data and evidence in order to measure progress in  achieving outcome-oriented goals it sets for these projects. State reports  these goals and relevant performance data in its annual performance  plans and reports. For example, State uses the U.S. General Services  Administration\u2019s Customer Satisfaction Survey to measure and report the  performance of its Human Capital Delivery Services reform efforts.  State also uses data collected through the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey to measure  employee satisfaction, which State established as a performance  indicator for this project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effectively implementing major reforms can span several years and must  be closely managed. In 2017, State began a reform effort that led to 17  reform projects, most of which are unimplemented but still continuing.  State notified both OMB and the Congress of these projects.  Nevertheless, State leadership has not provided the focus necessary to  support the officials responsible for implementing all these reform  projects. When a new Secretary of State took charge in March 2018, he  transferred responsibility for implementing the reform efforts from  dedicated teams led by senior department leadership to bureaus and  offices. In addition, key political appointee positions remained filled by  officials in an acting capacity until only recently. These transitions at State  have had an effect on its reform efforts. Without explicit direction from  senior leadership, some implementing officials involved in the reform  efforts remain unclear about whether their projects are an agency priority.
