In addition, other factors, such as origination fees paid by borrowers, defaults, subsequent collections on defaulted loans and timing of loan repayments, affect the subsidy cost of FDLP. Although Education is able to estimate origination fees close to the actual amounts in the financial system, other key cash flows varied significantly.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP) and  the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The federal  government\u2019s role differs significantly between these two programs. Under  FDLP, often referred to as the direct loan program, students or their  parents borrow money directly from the federal government through the  schools the students attend, which include vocational, undergraduate, or  graduate schools. The first FDLP loans were made in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 1994. Under FFELP, also known as the guaranteed student loan  program, money is borrowed from private lenders, such as banks, and the  federal government guarantees repayment if the borrowers default. FFELP  is the older of the two programs, having started in fiscal year 1966. As of  September 30, 1999, Education reported that the outstanding gross balance  of FDLP was $46.5 billion and the total outstanding loan guarantees for  FFELP were approximately $127 billion. As of September 30, 1999,  Education estimated that it would incur total subsidy costs\u2014the estimated  cost of extending credit over the life of the loans\u2014of $1.6 billion for FDLP  and $12.2 billion for FFELP.", "FDLP, established by P.L. 103-66, was implemented by Education in fiscal  year 1994 as another method of delivering loans to students. FDLP makes it  possible for students and their families to borrow directly from the federal  government through the colleges or other postsecondary institutions the  students attend. In fiscal year 1999, 3.2 million loans totaling $17.7 billion  were disbursed to borrowers through FDLP.", "Because of concerns about Education\u2019s reliance on estimates to project  FDLP costs and a lack of historical information on which to base those  estimates, you asked us to review how Education develops its cost  estimates for the program, review and analyze actual versus estimated  financial performance, and address factors or circumstances that can  significantly affect Education\u2019s ability to develop realistic estimates of  program costs. Specifically you asked us to address nine questions. 1. How much financing has been provided to Education for the direct loan  program through borrowing from Treasury and appropriations  received? 2. Have cash inflows (excluding borrowings from Treasury and borrower  principal repayments) exceeded cash outflows (excluding repayments  to Treasury and loan disbursements)? 3.", "In Education\u2019s calculation of its subsidy cost estimates for the Federal  Direct Loan Program, what are the key cash flow assumptions, how  sensitive are Education\u2019s subsidy costs to changes in these  assumptions, and what data are used to support these assumptions? 4. How closely do Education\u2019s subsidy cost estimates and their underlying  assumptions compare to actual loan performance for each loan and to  what extent does Education track differences between its subsidy cost  estimates and actual loan performance for each loan cohort? 5. What effects have reduced loan origination fees had on subsidy costs,  and how has Education taken account of these changes in its subsidy  cost estimates and reestimates? 6. What effects have increased consolidations had on subsidy costs, and  how has Education taken account of these changes in its subsidy cost  estimates and reestimates? 7. What effect have declining interest rates had on subsidy costs, and how  has Education taken account of these changes in its subsidy cost  estimates and reestimates? 8. What are the future prospects for the continued negative subsidy for  the Federal Direct Loan Program? 9. What data did Education use to project an estimated savings of $4 for  every $100 of direct student loans, as it reported in November 1999?", "To respond to your request, we reviewed Education\u2019s audited financial  statements and examined the workpapers of Education\u2019s independent  auditors for fiscal years 1995 through 1999. We interviewed knowledgeable  personnel from Education\u2019s Budget Service and obtained information  relevant to your questions. We compared Education\u2019s practices to  (1) federal budgeting and accounting standards\u2014such as Statement of  Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 2, Accounting for  Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees, as amended, and Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget  Estimates\u2014and (2) the guidance contained in the Federal Financial  Accounting and Auditing Technical Release 3, Preparing and Auditing  Direct Loan and Loan Guarantee Subsidies Under the Federal Credit  Reform Act. Our audit work was conducted in Washington, D.C., from May  2000 through November 2000 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Appendix II describes our objectives,  scope, and methodology in detail. We provided the Department of  Education copies of a draft of this report for review and comment. On  December 7, 2000, we met with cognizant Education officials and obtained  oral comments on a draft of this report.", "Because of the number and diverse nature of the questions, we are  responding in a question-and-answer format. The next section provides an  overview of some of the key points from our review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Several circumstances make it difficult to make the best possible  determination of FDLP\u2019s financial performance at this time. First, because  FDLP is a relatively new program, it has a short history of repayment  activity and little historical data are available. Second, because Education  lacks historical FDLP data, Education relies heavily on data from the  guaranteed loan program to develop estimates for most key cash flow  assumptions in its FDLP cash flow model, which is used to estimate the  subsidy cost of the program. While this is appropriate for the interim,  guaranteed loans may perform differently from FDLP loans and therefore,  Education ultimately will need to use FDLP data. Education plans to phase  out the use of guaranteed loan data as FDLP data become available.", "Our ability to answer some of your specific questions was limited because  the needed data were not readily available. For example, Education\u2019s cash  flow model and financial systems do not readily provide comparable  information on estimated and actual defaults. Also, Education did not have  readily available performance data by \u201ccohort,\u201d which refers to all the loans  of a particular loan type for which a subsidy appropriation is provided for a  given fiscal year. For this reason, Education was not able to give us a  comparison of estimated to actual cash flows at the cohort level during the  time frames of this review. Comparisons of estimates and actuals at the  cohort level are key to identifying the causes of disparities, which, in turn,  is key to improving future subsidy cost estimates. Furthermore, there is  little information on the effects of loan consolidations on FDLP subsidy  costs. This is significant because Consolidation loan volume has been  rapidly increasing. Education is taking or plans to take steps to address  these limitations in the future.", "Because Education has not documented its previous sensitivity analyses,  we asked Education to perform a limited sensitivity analysis of FDLP  subsidy costs and found that the subsidy calculation is most sensitive to  changes in interest rates. Specifically, the interest rates involved were the  discount rate\u2014generally the rate at which Education borrows money from  the Department of the Treasury to finance its loans\u2014and the borrower  rate. The difference, or spread, between the borrower rate and discount  rate determines the magnitude the change in interest rates has on the FDLP  subsidy cost. Because these rates cannot be readily predicted from year to  year, estimating the subsidy cost of FDLP is very difficult. Therefore, wide  fluctuations in subsidy costs can be expected depending on the extent of  interest rate changes.", "Because FDLP is a direct loan program that allows its borrowers to defer  payment until after the borrower leaves school, several years would  typically pass between the time the borrower receives the loan and begins  making repayments. This deferment of principal and interest payments  from borrowers has contributed to the negative cash flow FDLP  experienced that totaled about $2 billion as of September 30, 1999.  Although more cash will be received by Education when more borrowers  enter repayment, Education is unable to determine when FDLP will have a  positive cash flow primarily because of uncertainty related to the key cash  flow assumptions. Further, because Education lacks key data on loan  consolidations and default data is not readily available, Education\u2019s ability  to predict future cash flows is limited. This further impedes Education\u2019s  ability to estimate when and how much of this negative cash flow will be  recovered.", "We are making several recommendations to address the limitations  identified during our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Education is the primary agency overseeing federal investments in support  of educational programs for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens.

Interest is subsidized by the federal government while the  student is in school, and during the grace, or deferment period. A loan  origination fee is charged to obtain these loans. The borrower rate is  variable and based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus an add-on  amount that has ranged from 1.7 percent to 3.1 percent, with a  maximum borrower rate of 8.25 percent. Education reported that the  outstanding balance of this loan type was $19.7 billion as of  September 30, 1999.", "Unsubsidized) provides loans to undergraduate, graduate, and  professional students regardless of financial need. The borrower is  responsible for interest that accrues during any period. Interest that  accrues while the student is in school or during the grace period or  deferment period is added to the loan balance. A loan origination fee is  charged to obtain these loans. The borrower rates on these loans are the  same as the borrower rates on Stafford Subsidized loans. Education  reported that the outstanding balance of this loan type was $11.9 billion  as of September 30, 1999.", "The Federal Direct PLUS Program provides loans to parents of  dependent students. The borrower is responsible for interest that  accrues during any period. A loan origination fee is charged to obtain  these loans. The borrower rate is variable and currently based on the  91-day Treasury bill rate plus an add-on amount of 3.1 percent, with a  maximum borrower rate of 9 percent. Education reported that the  outstanding balance of this loan type was $2.8 billion as of  September 30, 1999.", "The Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program (Consolidation loans)  allows borrowers to combine their loans from different federal student  loan programs into a single loan with one monthly payment. After the  promissory note has been signed for the new Consolidation loan, the  underlying loan(s) are paid off. The Higher Education Act Amendments  of 1998 (P.L. 105-244) provided that for all Direct Consolidation Loan  applications received from February 1, 1999, through June 30, 2003, the  borrower rate is a fixed rate for the life of the loan. The rate is the lesser  of the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being  consolidated, or 8.25 percent, the current maximum allowable rate.  Borrower rates on previously disbursed Consolidation loans are  variable rates, similar to the other FDLP loan types. Education reported  that the outstanding balance of this loan type was $12.1 billion as of  September 30, 1999.", "Borrowers most commonly repay their FDLP loans using one of four  repayment plans: standard, extended, graduated, or income contingent.  These four options differ by the amount of time allowed to repay loans and  the flexibility of the repayment schedule. With standard repayment,  borrowers make fixed payments of at least $50 a month for up to 10 years.  With extended repayment, they make fixed payments of at least $50 a  month over a period generally ranging from 12 to 30 years, depending on  the total amount borrowed. With graduated repayment, borrowers\u2019  payments start out low and then increase, usually every 2 years; the  repayment period generally ranges from 12 to 30 years, depending on the  total amount borrowed. The income contingent repayment plan is the most  flexible, allowing borrowers to make monthly payments that are based on  adjusted gross income, family size, and the total amount of their  outstanding loans.", "The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) was enacted to require  agencies to more accurately measure the government\u2019s cost of federal loan  programs and to permit better cost comparisons both among credit  programs and between credit and noncredit programs. Prior to the  implementation of FCRA, credit programs were reported in the budget on a  cash basis. Thus, loan guarantees appeared to be free in the budget year,  while direct loans appeared to be as expensive as grants. As a result, costs  were distorted and credit programs could not be compared meaningfully  with other programs and with each other. FCRA and the related accounting  standards and budgetary guidance, together known as credit reform, were  established to more accurately measure the government\u2019s costs of federal  credit programs and to permit better comparisons both among credit  programs and between credit and noncredit programs. As part of  implementing credit reform, agencies are required to estimate the net cost  of extending credit over the life of a loan, generally referred to as the  subsidy cost, based on the present value of estimated net cash flows,  excluding administrative costs.", "Budgeting guidance requires agencies to maintain supporting  documentation for subsidy cost estimates. Further, auditing standards  related to estimates indicate that agency management is responsible for  accumulating sufficient relevant and reliable data on which to base the  estimated cash flows. SFFAS No. 2 states that each credit program should  use a systematic methodology to project expected cash flows into the  future. To accomplish this task, agencies develop cash flow models. A cash  flow model is a computer program that generally uses historical  information and various assumptions including defaults, prepayments,  recoveries, and the timing of these events to estimate future loan  performance. Those assumptions that have the greatest impact on the  estimated subsidy cost are often referred to as the key assumptions. These  cash flow models, which should be based on sound economic, financial,  and statistical theory, identify key factors that affect loan performance.  Agencies use this information to make more informed predictions of future  credit performance. Generally, the data used for these estimates are  updated or reestimated after the fiscal year end to reflect any changes in  actual loan performance since the estimates were prepared, as well as any  expected changes in assumptions related to future loan performance.  Appendix I provides a detailed discussion of estimating credit program  costs under credit reform. The glossary at the end of this report provides a  list of commonly used terms related to credit program budgeting and  accounting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questions and Answers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Question 1", "paragraphs": ["How much financing has been provided to Education for the direct loan  program through borrowing from Treasury and appropriations received?", "Amounts borrowed from Treasury are amounts that Education expects to  be repaid by borrowers in the future. Amounts appropriated are amounts  that Education has estimated it will lose as a cost of extending credit  through FDLP. For fiscal years 1995 through 1999, Education\u2019s FDLP has  borrowed $59.4 billion from Treasury to finance the program, repaying  $7.8 billion of that amount. Table 1 provides an annual accounting of this  information. Over the same period, considering reestimates, Education has  received $688 million in appropriations (see table 2).", "Education finances FDLP through a combination of appropriations and  borrowing from Treasury as required by FCRA. For loan programs subject  to the act, agencies are required to estimate the cost of extending or  guaranteeing credit, called the subsidy cost. The subsidy cost is the present  value of disbursements from the government (loan disbursements and  other payments) minus estimated payments to the government  (repayments of principal, interest receipts, fees, and other recoveries or  payments) over the life of the loan. The subsidy cost is generally the  amount that Education estimates will not be repaid by borrowers. This  estimate is financed with appropriated funds and is generally \u201creestimated\u201d  or updated annually. The portion of Education\u2019s direct loans that Education  predicts will ultimately be repaid by borrowers is financed by borrowing  from Treasury and is not considered a cost to the government because it is  expected to be returned to the government in future years. If the present  value of the estimated cash outflows from the government exceeds the  present value of the estimated cash inflows, there is a positive subsidy or  cost to the government. However, if the present value of the estimated cash  inflows to the government exceeds the present value of the estimated cash  outflows, there is a negative subsidy.", "When there is a negative subsidy, a higher level of borrowing from Treasury  occurs than when there is a positive subsidy because Education must  borrow an amount greater than the dollar amount of loans disbursed. This  additional borrowing occurs because Education does not receive any  appropriated funds and therefore experiences a temporary shortfall  because, in addition to disbursing the full loan amount, Education pays the  negative subsidy to its program account. This additional amount of  borrowing as well as the amount of loans disbursed is expected to be  repaid by the borrower, primarily through principal and interest payments,  over the life of the loan.", "For example, if a hypothetical FDLP loan of $100 had a negative subsidy of  $5, the amount of borrowing required would be $5 more than the face value  of the loan. Accordingly, Education would borrow a total of $105 from  Treasury. If, however, FDLP had a positive subsidy, required borrowing  from Treasury would be less. For example, if a hypothetical FDLP loan of  $100 had a positive subsidy cost of $5, the subsidy cost of $5 would be  financed with appropriated funds, and the remaining $95 would be  financed by Treasury borrowings (the amount Education expects to be  repaid).", "Additionally, Education is required to periodically update or \u201creestimate\u201d  loan program costs for differences between (1) estimated loan  performance and related cost and (2) the actual program costs recorded in  the accounting records as well as expected changes in future economic  performance. When program costs are reestimated for loans disbursed in  prior years, the revised estimate can either increase or decrease the  original subsidy estimate. These reestimates can also affect the level of  borrowing and appropriations. Generally, downward reestimates are  considered offsetting receipts, which are netted against the subsequent  year\u2019s appropriations, and upward reestimates require additional  appropriations.", "Table 2 shows FDLP\u2019s original subsidy estimates and reestimates for the  1995 through 1999 cohorts. For example, the 1997 cohort column in table 2  shows that this group of loans was originally estimated to have a positive  subsidy of $336 million. Since then, Education has reestimated the cost of  the 1997 cohort twice, increasing its cost by $80 million in fiscal year 1998  and decreasing its cost by $69 million in fiscal year 1999. Therefore, as of  fiscal year 1999, the estimated net cost of the 1997 cohort was a positive  subsidy of $347 million. In contrast, the fiscal year 1999 column shows that  the 1999 cohort was the first cohort originally estimated to have a negative  subsidy. For fiscal years 1995 through 1999, Education\u2019s FDLP estimates  and reestimates for all cohorts show a total positive subsidy of  $688 million, and therefore Education has received net appropriations  totaling this amount.", "Because FDLP is a relatively new program, there is limited historical data  to predict future borrower behavior. Additionally, the future estimated cost  of this program, as explained in questions 3 and 7, is especially sensitive to  changes in interest rates.

Net interest payments to Treasury on  borrowed funds to finance the loans disbursed are the primary source of  cash outflows. As shown in table 3, for fiscal years 1995 through 1999,  total cash outflows exceeded total cash inflows by about $2 billion because  the interest receipts from borrowers and origination fees were less than the  amount of interest Education had to pay to Treasury. Inflows exceeded  outflows only in fiscal years 1995 and 1996.", "The $2 billion negative cash flow for FDLP is at least partially due to a  timing difference in the cash flows. Education is required to make interest  payments to Treasury, even if the borrower is not currently making interest  payments to Education. As of September 30, 1999, 46 percent of the loan  portfolio was in a grace or deferment status. As a result, Education  subsidizes or generally accrues this interest. However, Education must  repay the interest on borrowings from Treasury even though it does not  expect to receive interest payments from borrowers until sometime in the  future. This accrued interest can be substantial\u2014$2.3 billion as of  September 30, 1999.", "Education is unable to determine when FDLP will have a positive cash flow  primarily because of uncertainty related to the key cash flow assumptions.  As discussed in question 3, the estimated cost of FDLP is sensitive to  changes in interest rates and other factors that will affect the program\u2019s  cash flows. In addition, reductions in origination fees, as occurred in fiscal  year 1999, discussed in question 5, will also have an impact on whether  FDLP has an overall negative or positive cash flow in the future.

Education told us that it  performs informal analyses of the cash flow assumptions that result in  about 90 percent of the change in subsidy costs each year. However,  Education did not provide any supporting documentation for this analysis.  Further, Education told us that it has not performed a sensitivity analysis of  all cash flow assumptions in its model. As this type of analysis would be  extremely time-consuming, we requested that Education perform and  document a limited sensitivity analysis as a basis on which to answer this  question. Based on this limited sensitivity analysis, there were seven key  cash flow assumptions that when adjusted, had a significant impact on the  estimated cost of the loan program. These assumptions were discount  rates, borrower rates, loan maturity, collections on previously defaulted  loans, defaults, origination fees, and when repayments begin. The analysis  showed that FDLP\u2019s subsidy cost was most sensitive to changes in the  discount rate and borrower rate.

Timing assumptions for  when defaults and collections occur and when repayments begin should  also be adjusted in a systematic manner. Those assumptions that when  adjusted, caused the largest change in the subsidy cost are determined to  be the key cash flow assumptions.", "Education budget staff told us that they perform analyses of the cash flow  assumptions that result in about 90 percent of the change in subsidy cost  each year when they prepare budget estimates and reestimates. However,  they do not maintain documentation of these analyses. Education has also  done sensitivity analysis on the larger guaranteed loan program, which  Education uses to help identify the key assumptions for the FDLP.  However, because Education\u2019s cash flow model has a large number of  assumptions, there is no assurance that all key assumptions have been  identified through the informal analyses that Education performed for  FDLP. Because a formal analysis of all cash flow assumptions would take a  significant amount of time, we asked Education to perform and document a  limited sensitivity analysis of the assumptions it believed to be key and  added two other assumptions related to the largest loan types, risk groups,  and repayment options that we felt might also be key.", "Based on the results of the limited sensitivity analysis, we determined that  seven of the nine cash flow assumptions tested were key.

Loan maturity is  important because it sets the amount of time borrowers are expected to  take to repay their loans and, accordingly, the number of years Education  estimates that it will receive interest payments from borrowers. The  origination fee assumption is important because it determines the amount  of fee receipts Education will receive.

The comparison did  not include any analysis of defaults because Education was unable to  readily provide comparable data on either estimated or actual defaults. Due  to the nature of direct loan programs, Education\u2019s FDLP cash flow model  estimates principal and interest payments that will be missed in a given  fiscal year as a result of a default, while Education\u2019s financial systems do  not specifically recognize this \u201cabsence of cash flow.\u201d Rather, the financial  systems report defaults as entire loan amounts that are written off in a  given fiscal year. Further, the overall analysis was limited by the fact that  readily available data in the financial systems were not totally comparable  to the data available in the cash flow model. Specifically, Education\u2019s  financial systems lacked readily available data at the cohort and loan  profile level. Education therefore used fiscal year totals from the financial  systems in its analysis.

According to  Education, its approach is consistent with standard credit reform practice  in which costs for all loan cohorts are reestimated each year using the  latest cash flow model and assumptions. However, Education\u2019s budget  officials have acknowledged that their analysis has certain limitations. For  example, the difference between estimated and actual loan performance  could be understated because of offsetting differences among different  cohorts. Further, because Education\u2019s analysis compared loan performance  in total, variances in loan performance within individual cohorts may  become minimized. These variances may indicate anomalies or trends that  were not expected when the credit subsidy estimate was originally  calculated.", "Because we were unable to analyze specific cohorts included in  Education\u2019s analysis, we were unable to determine whether, over time,  estimated cash flows became more predictive of actual cash flows.

During fiscal years 1996 through 1999,  differences between estimated and actual origination fees varied from  about 1 percent to about 6 percent.", "According to Education, the main reason for the significant difference  between estimated and actual interest receipts is the way its cash flow  model handles loan consolidations. Typically, the original loans that are  consolidated into a new loan would be treated as prepayments, and  estimated future cash flows from these underlying loans should be  eliminated in the cash flow model. However, Education\u2019s cash flow model  does not adjust for prepayments. Education currently compensates for this  by shortening the loan maturity in an attempt to reflect the consolidation or  prepayment of the original underlying loans. However, this approach may  misstate the timing and characterization of cash flows reported annually.  For example, when borrowers consolidate their loans, accrued interest on  the original loans is added to the principal balance for some loan types,  while the borrower is in school and in other deferment situations. When  borrowers repay their loans, some of the payment for accrued interest is  shown in the accounting records as payments of principal. According to  Education, this helps explain the differences depicted in figure 2 where  more principal was received than estimated for 4 of the 5 years included in  our review. However, because Education was unable to provide the  supporting data for this explanation, we were unable to verify whether the  way consolidations are modeled is (1) truly the primary cause of the  significant difference between the estimated and actual interest receipts  from borrowers and (2) a key factor in differences in principal receipts.", "According to Education\u2019s budget staff, they are analyzing the method used  to allocate borrower repayments between principal and interest, and they  acknowledged that they are not totally comfortable with the current split.  In addition, as discussed in question 6, Education has been working to  improve its modeling of consolidations and plans to develop a different  cash flow model that will allow Education to model and track cash flows at  the individual loan level. Education\u2019s budget staff told us that they believe  this new cash flow model will address most of the problems they face in  modeling consolidations.", "The largest difference between estimated and actual origination fees  occurred in fiscal year 1995.

In using FFELP data, Education officials believed that the two  loan programs\u2019 performance would be similar. However, up until 1993,  FFELP only offered borrowers the standard repayment option and  currently only two of FFELP\u2019s three repayment plans are similar to those  offered under FDLP. Therefore, FFELP historical data may not prove very  predictive of FDLP, which offers primarily four repayment options. These  repayment options would likely affect the timing and amount of cash flows;  however, under existing guidance, Education may use FFELP data as a  proxy for actual historical data to support some of the key cash flow  assumptions for FDLP, as discussed in question 3.

Any costs involving both grants and loans, such as  application processing, were allocated to the loan programs based on the  proportion of loan recipients to grant recipients. Any cost for activities  common to both loan programs was assigned based on annual projections  of the number of borrowers in each program. Overhead costs were  assigned to the two loan programs based on the source of funds. For  example, overhead expenses funded using section 458 of the Higher  Education Act were assumed by Education to be used for FDLP even  though some of these funds are used for FFELP costs. In using this  assumption, Education believes that it is overstating the portion of  overhead costs attributable to the direct loan program.", "Education projected administrative costs over 50 years\u2014fiscal years 2000  through 2050. The 50-year period was used to reflect the maximum amount  of time that all borrowers in a cohort could be in school, in a deferment or  forbearance period, making loan repayments, or making payments on loan  defaults. After consulting with Education, we concluded that performing  this analysis over a shorter period\u2014within the 9 to 27-year range Education  uses in estimating subsidy costs\u2014would not produce significantly different  results.", "Education chose not to include several cost items in its calculation of  administrative cost for the loan programs. These included costs for  information system upgrades and improvements that Education believes  could reduce future per loan costs of delivering financial aid. Education  officials did not include these costs because the specific components of  these system upgrades had not been determined at the time the study was  issued, and they believe the initial cost will be offset by future savings.  However, the study did not include a cost analysis to support this belief. To  the extent that these costs are not offset by future savings in other cost  categories, Education\u2019s administrative cost estimates will be understated.  According to its budget proposal, Education plans to spend $48.5 million on  information systems modernization for student aid programs in fiscal year  2001.", "Education excluded loan origination costs for consolidation loans because  provisions of FCRA\u2014section 502(5)(B)(iii)\u2014include fees as a subsidy cost.  Additionally, Education chose not to include noncontract costs associated  with offices outside OSFA since these costs only represented $3.2 million  of a total $600 million and included no more than 32 personnel.", "OSFA is currently developing a cost allocation model that will identify the  total administrative cost for each of the major financial aid programs as  well as the per unit cost of delivering each loan or grant award. OSFA plans  to use this model to identify areas where it can reduce these per-unit  delivery costs and to assess how well it is accomplishing these reductions.  Unlike the November 1999 cost study, the OSFA model will include  noncontract costs from other offices within Education that have a role in  delivering student financial aid. It will use data primarily from Education\u2019s  accounting system to determine total and per unit costs.", "While this administrative cost information will be useful, changes in the  subsidy costs from one cohort to the next are the primary drivers of total  program costs. Subsidy costs, in turn, are primarily affected by interest  rates and therefore cannot be predicted with any certainty."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Developing reasonable estimates of subsidy costs for loan programs is a  complex task. Numerous assumptions must be taken into account and  projections must be made for the estimated life of the loans, which could  be up to 30 years. Because FDLP\u2019s subsidy costs are determined largely by  interest rates\u2014specifically the difference, or spread, between the borrower  and discount rates\u2014and since interest rate fluctuations cannot be  predicted with any certainty, it is uncertain that the current trend in  negative subsidy costs for FDLP will continue. A change in interest rates,  for example, can cause a negative subsidy to become positive. Even with  improvements to Education\u2019s cash flow model, it is important to recognize  that estimates of subsidy costs are sensitive to interest rate volatility.", "That being said, there are also other factors that affect the subsidy cost of  FDLP, such as origination fees paid by borrowers, defaults, subsequent  collections on defaulted loans, and the timing of loan repayments. While  Education is able to estimate origination fees close to the actual amounts in  the financial systems, the other key cash flows varied significantly. These  cash flows are primarily estimated based on looking at the history of how  borrowers perform under the conditions provided by each loan type within  FDLP. Because the program is relatively new, Education has primarily used  the history of FFELP as a basis for its FDLP estimates. While this is  reasonable given that it is the best historical data available, it may not be  very predictive of FDLP borrower behavior because FDLP offers different  repayment options than those reflected in most of the historical data  related to FFELP.", "Additionally, Education\u2019s current model for estimating FDLP subsidy costs  does not directly take into account certain key factors, such as  prepayments and consolidations. This limitation hinders Education\u2019s ability  to determine the impacts of consolidation activities, which are increasing  significantly. Also, Education was unable to provide actual data related to  defaults, which are a key assumption. Finally, the fact that Education does  not currently have the information readily available to make meaningful  comparisons of estimated to actual cash flows, and, most important, to  identify the reasons for differences, significantly impedes Education\u2019s  ability to refine future estimates based on actual results. Therefore, the  reliability of Education\u2019s subsidy cost estimates is negatively affected not  only by the volatility of interest rates but also by limitations in the  department\u2019s ability to monitor and adjust for other key factors in its  subsidy cost estimation process.

OMB is authorized to delegate to lending agencies the authority to  estimate costs, based on its own written guidelines. These guidelines are  contained in OMB Circular A-11, sections 85.1 through 85.12, and  supporting exhibits, as well as other OMB guidance, including OMB  Circular A-34, Instructions on Budget Execution, and other documents.", "The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) developed  the accounting standard for credit programs, SFFAS No. 2, Accounting for  Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees, which became effective in fiscal year  1994.

To determine the  expected cost of a credit program, agencies are required to predict or  estimate the future performance of the program. This cost, known as the  subsidy cost, is the present value of disbursements\u2014over the life of the  loan\u2014by the government (loan disbursements and other payments) minus  estimated payments to the government (repayments of principal, payments  of interest, other recoveries, and other payments). For loan guarantees, the  subsidy cost is the present value of cash flows from estimated payments by  the government (for defaults and delinquencies, interest rate subsidies, and  other payments) minus estimated payments to the government (for loan  origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries).", "To estimate the cost of loan programs, agencies first estimate the future  performance of direct and guaranteed loans when preparing their annual  budgets. The data used for these budgetary estimates should be  reestimated to reflect any changes in loan performance since the budget  was prepared. These reestimated data are then used in financial reporting  when calculating the allowance for subsidy (the cost of direct loans), the  liability for loan guarantees, and the cost of the program. In the financial  statements, the actual and expected costs of loans disbursed as part of a  credit program are recorded as a \u201cProgram Cost\u201d on the agencies'  Statement of Net Costs for loans disbursed.", "In addition to recording the cost of a credit program, SFFAS No. 2 requires  agencies to record direct loans on the balance sheet as assets at the present  value of their estimated net cash inflows.

Generally, the subsidy  costs equal the amount of estimated losses to the federal government and  are financed with appropriated funds. The portion of Education's direct  loans that Education predicts will ultimately be collected is financed by  borrowing from Treasury. For example, a hypothetical FDLP loan of $100  may have a subsidy cost of $20 (the amount Education expects to lose),  which is financed with appropriated funds, and the remaining $80 is  financed by Treasury borrowings (the amount Education expects to be  repaid).", "Budgeting guidance requires agencies to maintain supporting  documentation for subsidy cost estimates. Further, auditing standards  related to preparing estimates indicate that agency management is  responsible for accumulating relevant, sufficient, and reliable data on  which to base the estimates. SFFAS No. 2 indicates that each credit  program should use a systematic methodology to project expected cash  flows into the future. To accomplish this task, agencies should develop  cash flow models. A cash flow model is a computer program that generally  uses historical information and various assumptions, including defaults,  prepayments, recoveries, and the timing of these events, to estimate future  loan performance. These cash flow models, which should be based on  sound economic, financial, and statistical theory, identify key factors that  affect loan performance. Agencies use this information to make more  informed predictions of future credit performance. The August 1994 User's  Guide to Version r.8 of the OMB Credit Subsidy Model provides general  guidance on creating cash flow models to estimate future delinquencies,  defaults, recoveries, etc. This user's guide states that, \u201cIn every case, the  agency or budget examiner must maintain current and complete  documentation and justification for the estimation methods and  assumptions used in determining the cash flow figures used for the OMB  Subsidy Model\u201d to calculate the credit subsidy.", "According to SFFAS No. 2, to estimate the cost of loan programs and  predict the future performance of credit programs, agencies should  establish and use reliable records of historical credit performance. Since  actual historical experience is a primary factor upon which estimates of  credit performance are based, agencies should maintain a database, also  known as an information store, at the individual loan level, of historical  information on all key cash flow assumptions, such as defaults or  recoveries, used in calculating the credit subsidy cost. Additional  nonauthoritative guidance on cash flow models may be found in the Model  Credit Program Methods and Documentation for Estimating Subsidy Rates  and the Model Information Store issue paper prepared by the Credit  Reform Task Force of the Accounting and Auditing Policy Committee. This  draft \u201cInformation Store\u201d Task Force paper provides guidance on the type  of historical information agencies need to reasonably estimate the cost of  credit programs. The information store should provide three types of  information. First, the information store should maintain key loan  characteristics at the individual loan level, such as the loan terms and  conditions. Second, it should track economic data that influence loan  performance, such as property values for housing loans. Third, an  information store should track historical cash flows on a loan-by-loan  basis. The data elements in an information store should be selected to  allow for more in-depth analyses of the most significant subsidy estimate  assumptions.", "In addition to using historical databases and the cash flow models, other  relevant factors must be considered by agencies to estimate future loan  performance. These relevant factors include  economic conditions that may affect the performance of the loans,  financial and other relevant characteristics of borrowers,  the value of the collateral to loan balance,  changes in recoverable value of collateral, and  newly developed events that would affect loan performance.", "When new programs are established or changes are made to existing  programs, historical supporting documentation for cash flow assumptions  may not exist.

The reestimate should include all aspects of the original cost  estimate, including prepayments, defaults, delinquencies, recoveries, and  interest. Reestimates of the credit subsidy allow agency management to  compare the original budget estimates with actual program results to  identify variances from the original estimate, assess the quality of the  original estimate, and adjust future program estimates as appropriate. Any  increase or decrease in the estimated cost of the loan program is  recognized as a subsidy expense or a reduction in subsidy expense for both  budgetary and financial statement purposes.", "The reestimate requirements for interest rate and technical assumptions  (defaults, recoveries, prepayments, fees, and other cash flows) differ. For  budget purposes, OMB Circular A-11 states that agencies must reestimate  the interest portion of the estimate when a cohort is substantially disbursed  or generally when at least 90 percent of the direct loans or guaranteed  loans are disbursed. The technical reestimate, for budgetary purposes,  generally must be done annually, after the close of each fiscal year as long  as the loans are outstanding, unless OMB approves a different plan,  regardless of financial statement significance. For financial statement  reporting purposes, both technical and interest rate reestimates are  required annually, at the end of the fiscal year, whenever the reestimated  amount is significant to the financial statements.
