A federal workforce has performed this work since November 2002, in response to a congressional mandate that the federal government take over screening services after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A 2-year pilot program at five airports testing the effectiveness of private sector screening in a post-September 11 environment concluded on November 18, 2004. This report contains GAO's preliminary observations related to TSA's progress in developing a private-sector screening program that allows airports to apply to opt out of using federal screeners. GAO assessed: (1) the status of TSA's efforts to develop policies and procedures for the opt-out program, including operational plans and guidelines for selecting airports and contractors that may participate; (2) guidance about the opt-out program that TSA has provided to airport operators and other stakeholders, or plans to develop, and how the information is communicated; and (3) TSA's efforts to develop performance measures for evaluating the opt-out program and contractor performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of November 2004, TSA has completed or is developing key policies and procedures for the opt-out program. Specifically, TSA has completed and released guidelines for determining how and when private screening contractors will be evaluated and selected to participate in the opt-out program. TSA also has released supplemental information for evaluating potential contractors, such as their financial capabilities. TSA also has prepared a draft technical statement of work for the private screening contractors operating at five pilot program airports, which is to serve as a basis for contractors seeking to serve other airports. In addition, TSA has developed, or is currently developing, internal guidance for managing the opt-out program, such as a transition plan for helping airports to move from federal to private screeners. TSA expects to complete the remaining policies and procedures by mid-2005. TSA is taking steps to communicate with stakeholders about the opt-out program by developing informational guidance and soliciting information and suggestions from them. For instance, since releasing initial summary guidance about the program in June 2004, TSA has posted an opt-out program application for airport operators that asks, among other things, the primary reason for wanting to participate in the opt-out program and the preferred timeline for transitioning to private screening operations. TSA also has posted lists of frequently asked questions and answers on its Web site, in response to questions from stakeholders about the airport application and contracting process. However, some airport operators, private screening contractors, and aviation industry representatives told GAO that they need additional information about how much leeway airports and contractors would have to manage the program, liability protection, and costs related to participating in the opt-out program. TSA is developing performance measures both to assess the screening performance of airports that will participate in the opt-out program and individual contractors performing the screening services, but specific performance measures have not been finalized. TSA said measures for the opt-out program will be based on measures already developed by an independent consulting firm for the five airports participating in the opt-out pilot program. These measures include how well screeners detect test threat objects, such as guns and knives, during screening operations. TSA is also developing performance measures to evaluate how well private screening contractors comply with the terms of their contracts, which will become part of a quality assurance plan. TSA expects to implement contractor-related performance measures in mid-2005, as contracts are being awarded. A draft of this report was provided to TSA. TSA officials generally agreed with our findings and provided technical comments that have been incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to improve aviation security after the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, the newly created Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) was charged by Congress with, among other things,  creating a federal workforce to assume the job of conducting passenger  and checked baggage screening at commercial airports\u2014work that had  been performed by the private sector. The federalized workforce was to be  in place by November 2002. At the same time, TSA was required by Section  108 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to conduct a  2-year Private Screening Pilot program. The mission of the pilot, as defined  by TSA, was to test the effectiveness of using private screening  contractors in a post-September 11 environment. The pilot concluded on  November 18, 2004.", "Using the pilot program as a starting point, ATSA requires TSA to begin  allowing airports to apply to opt out of using federal screeners in favor of  private contractors beginning on November 19, 2004. Consistent with  ATSA, TSA plans to begin receiving applications for this Screening  Partnership Program (known as the opt-out program) on that date. TSA  plans to begin selecting in early 2005 airports that can opt out, as well as  selecting contractors that will conduct private passenger and checked  baggage screening. TSA plans to begin transitioning selected airports to  private screening operations later in 2005.", "This report contains our preliminary observations related to TSA\u2019s  progress in developing the opt-out program. Specifically, we assessed   (1) the status of TSA\u2019s efforts to develop policies and procedures for the  opt-out program, including operational plans and guidelines for selecting  airports and contractors that may participate; (2) guidance about the opt- out program that TSA has provided to stakeholders, or plans to develop,  and how the information is communicated; and (3) TSA\u2019s efforts to  develop performance measures for evaluating the opt-out program and  contractor performance.", "We plan to continue our evaluation of the opt-out program as TSA further  develops and implements the program.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed documentation related to TSA\u2019s  opt-out program and pilot program and interviewed various officials. We  analyzed TSA documents related to the opt-out program, including  program guidance developed for airports. We reviewed an independent  consulting study prepared for TSA that evaluated the pilot program. We  interviewed officials from two aviation associations\u2014the American  Association of Airport Executives and the Airports Council International.  We attended an aviation security conference in September 2004, where  TSA officials and some airport operators discussed planning for the opt- out program, and we reviewed staff notes from two congressional  subcommittee-sponsored roundtables on the program. We also reviewed  ATSA provisions related to the opt-out program and related GAO reports.  In addition, we conducted telephone interviews with the operators of  randomly selected commercial airports from each of the five security risk  categories\u2014X, I, II, III, and IV. We interviewed the airport operators of 4  to 6 airports in each category, for a total of 26 interviews (one official per  airport). We also conducted telephone interviews with officials from 6  private security contractors that we were able to contact from a listing of  10 contractors. The listing included private security contractors that  expressed an interest in providing passenger and checked baggage  screening services. Because of the small sample size, the results of our  interviews with airport operators and contractors cannot be generalized.  TSA released significant details on its opt-out program guidance after our  interviews; therefore, the interviewees\u2019 responses were based only on the  information TSA had released at that point. Additional information on our  scope and methodology is contained in appendix I.

Beginning on November 19, 2004, all commercial  airports with federal security screening will be eligible to apply to opt-out  of using federal screeners. In addition to assessing airport applications for  using private screeners, TSA will select qualified private screening  contractors to conduct screening (including airports that seek to apply to  be private contractor screening companies), which meets ATSA\u2019s and  TSA\u2019s requirements. Nongovernmental employees, such as airport  directors or their representatives, would be able to participate as advisors  in the selection process, as long as the airport is not participating as a  qualified screening company. ATSA requires private screeners selected to  handle screening to meet the same hiring and training qualifications as  federal screeners. ATSA also mandated that the private screeners\u2019 pay and  benefit levels should be not less than their federal counterparts.  Furthermore, ATSA required that the contractor companies be owned and  controlled by U.S. citizens.", "ATSA also required TSA to establish a 2-year pilot program using qualified  private contractors to screen passengers and checked baggage at not more  than one airport from each security category. TSA selected five airports to  participate in the pilot program. The private passenger and checked  baggage screening contractors selected for the pilot program had to  comply with federal passenger and checked baggage screening standard  operating procedures.", "In order to obtain an objective evaluation of the pilot program, TSA  retained the services of an independent consulting firm. The consultants  were charged with developing an evaluation methodology; conducting  performance evaluations and comparisons between the five participating  pilot program airports and federally screened airports; and developing a  process to help TSA determine if a private screening company can meet  ATSA\u2019s performance standard for the opt-out program, which is to provide  a level of screening services and protection equal to or better than that  provided by federal screeners. The consultants found that, in general, the  private screening contractors met ATSA\u2019s performance standard.  However, the consultants cautioned that the findings must be viewed in  light of several key factors. For example, the consultants reported that the  small number of pilot airports seriously limited the program\u2019s usefulness  as a true scientific pilot and the ability of the findings to be generalizable  to apply to future privately screened airports. Additionally, the  performance data available for review and analysis were limited,  according to the consultants.", "Outside of the pilot program, any commercial airport may apply to opt out  beginning on November 19, 2004. In accordance with ATSA, an airport  operator may submit to TSA an application to have the screening of  passengers and checked baggage at an airport be carried out by the  screening personnel of a qualified private screening company, under a  contract entered into with TSA. TSA will make the final approval of any  application submitted and reserves the right to consider airport-specific  threat intelligence and an airport\u2019s record of compliance with security  regulations and security requirements to determine the timing of the  transition to private screening. TSA may also impose a delay on when an  airport can transition to private screening based on such factors as peak  travel season and the total cost of providing screening services at an  airport.

The conference report accompanying the fiscal year   2005 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 108-774) allocated appropriations of $2.424 billion to cover  personnel, compensation, and benefits for passenger and checked baggage  screeners and to cover screeners at the five pilot airports. This allocation  represents an increase of more than $200 million over the fiscal year   2004 enacted level of $2.2 billion. According to TSA, this increase is  necessary to fully fund compensation and benefits at the identified staffing  levels. The requested level of funding will support screener salaries and  management at all commercial airports, whether federalized or privatized.

Thirteen airport operators we interviewed cited concerns about liability.  In addition, all of the private screening contractors we interviewed cited  the need for additional guidance on liability protection.

TSA\u2019s presolicitation  includes a compensation and benefits certification form that private  screening contractors applying to be on the qualified offeror list must  complete. The applicant has to certify that it will propose and pay at least  the minimum labor rate that is paid to screeners for every $1 of direct  labor and that benefits will be not less than 44.75 percent\u2014the current  fringe benefits percentage as computed by TSA.", "In addition, TSA has interpreted ATSA to require qualified private  screening companies to provide pay and benefits at a loaded cost (direct  hour plus percentage cost of fringe benefits) that equals or exceeds the  loaded cost of the pay and benefits provided to the federal government.  According to TSA, this approach provides the contractor with flexibility to  trade additional pay against other benefits, or to enhance certain benefits  and reduce others; enables the contractor to determine and provide the  best package necessary for the recruitment and retention of quality  screeners; and increases flexibility while permitting recruitment and  retention of quality screeners."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Is Developing Performance Measures for the Opt- Out Program, but More Work Remains To Be Done", "paragraphs": ["TSA is developing measures to assess the screening performance of  airports that will participate in the opt-out program and individual  contractors performing the screening services, but specific performance  measures have not been finalized. In June 2004, TSA developed a draft of  the performance measurement principles and actual measures that TSA is  considering to measure the performance of the entire opt-out program and  private screening operations.  For example, TSA plans to measure the  results of annual screener proficiency reviews, customer satisfaction and  complaints, and screening costs. TSA may also evaluate the program in  terms of how well screeners perform using the threat image projection  (TIP) system to detect threat objects.(TIP projects images of threat  objects on an x-ray screen during actual operations and records whether  screeners identify threat objects.) These measures will be similar to those  used by the independent consulting firm to compare the performance of  private screening contractors operating at the five pilot program airports  against federal screening services. TSA expects to complete a preliminary  draft of a performance measurement plan later this month and to finalize  this plan by February 2005.", "In addition to assessing how the performance of federal and private  screening services compare, TSA is working to develop performance  measures for evaluating how well private screening contractors comply  with the terms of their contracts. TSA officials said that the opt-out  program office is in the process of determining whether quantifiable  measures are available, how to collect relevant data, and the best way to  establish baseline measures. TSA expects to complete its data collection  plan later this month and to complete the final plan by February 2005.", "The contractor-related performance measures TSA plans to develop are to  be included in a quality assurance plan. This plan is an element in TSA\u2019s  draft statement of work specifically for the five airports that participated  in the pilot program, which are continuing to use private screeners. The  plan includes general information on how TSA will measure and assess  their performance and how TSA will use the performance data to make  decisions on performance awards, extension of contracts, and termination  of contracts. Contractors may, for example, be evaluated\u2014and their  contracts extended\u2014based on their screeners' performance on TIP scores.  TSA officials said that the measures included in the draft statement of  work are not as sophisticated or rigorous as those that TSA will adopt in  the future. TSA expects to implement these measures in mid-2005, as  contracts are being awarded.", "We plan to continue to collect and analyze TSA documentation on the opt- out program and to follow-up with airports and private security  contractors on their views of TSA\u2019s development and implementation of  the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Homeland Security  and the Transportation Security Administration for review and comment.

We reviewed documents  including:    all guidance-related materials TSA had developed to date for airports; reports from an independent consulting study prepared for TSA that  evaluated the contract screening pilot program and made suggested  improvements to the program;  information from two congressional committee-sponsored roundtables  on the program;  testimony at congressional hearings on the program;    provisions of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act;   our prior reports that addressed issues related to the opt-out program,  including the performance of airport passenger and checked baggage  screeners.", "In addition, we interviewed TSA headquarters officials, officials from two  aviation associations\u2014the American Association of Airport Executives  and the Airports Council International and TSA\u2019s private contractor that is  assisting TSA in its development of the opt-out program. We conducted  semistructured telephone interviews with the operators of 26 randomly  selected commercial airports nationwide. The 26 airports were selected  randomly from all airports in each of the five airport categories\u2014X, I, II,  III, and IV. Category X airports generally have the largest number of  enplanements, and category IV airports have the smallest number. We  interviewed one official at each of 4 to 6 airports in each category.  Although the airports were selected randomly, because of the small  sample size in each category the results of these interviews may not be  generalized to other airports. We conducted telephone interviews with  officials from 6 of 10 private security contractors selected from a listing of  private security contractors that had expressed interest in the opt-out  program. The listing of private security contractors that expressed interest  in the opt-out program is included in Airport Security Report, (Potomac,  MD: Air Safety Week), September 22, 2004, Volume 11, Number 19. The  views and opinions of these contractors may not be representative of  those of other contractors and, therefore, should not be generalized. TSA  released significant details on its opt-out program guidance after our  interviews; therefore, the interviewees\u2019 responses (airport operators\u2019 and  contractors\u2019) were based only on the information TSA had released at that  point. We conducted our work from September to November 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
