For example, the Bureau is applying lessons learned from its implementation of an Internet response option for another household survey, called the American Community Survey, which is conducted on a smaller scale than the decennial census.

For example, the estimate has not been updated to reflect significant changes related to the Internet response option that have occurred since it was developed in 2011. Additionally, the unreliability of the Bureau's cost estimate for the Internet response option cast doubt on the reliability of associated potential cost savings estimates.

The optimizing self-response design area includes  examining contact strategies and self-response modes to identify which  are best for each demographic, geographic, and language-based group.  This includes giving households the option of responding to the census  through an Internet-based survey\u2014referred to as the Internet response  option.

In July 2006, the Bureau decided not to  include the Internet response option in the design for the 2010 census  and eliminated it from the scope of the contract.

The scale of the decennial census is significantly larger than  ACS, and will require IT systems and infrastructure to be sized  accordingly. However, it is not clear in the documentation how the  Bureau applied the ACS cost data in estimating 2020 census costs,  nor could Bureau officials explain this. For example, 2020 census IT  infrastructure costs were estimated to be higher than ACS IT  infrastructure costs, but Bureau officials could not explain what  assumptions and methodology were used to account for the much  larger scale of IT infrastructure needed for the 2020 census compared  to the ACS. Without insight into how historical data were used to  estimate future costs, we cannot determine whether the cost models  are accurate.", "Additionally, in 2014, the Bureau revised selected components of the  2020 census life-cycle cost estimate to inform the fiscal year 2015  budget request, but did not revise the Internet response option cost  estimate as part of this update even though there had been significant  changes to the program since 2011. For example, projects related to  the Internet response option have evolved, and thus not all projects  are represented in the 2011 $73 million estimate, such as non-ID  processing. Also, the Bureau determined in 2013 that its existing IT  infrastructure was not sufficient to support the scale-up needed for  Internet response data processing and storage in the 2020 census,  and is planning to address this as part of the enterprisewide IT data  collection and processing program, known as CEDCAP. According to  Bureau officials, they are in the process of developing estimated costs  for relevant CEDCAP projects, and these will be incorporated into the  Internet response option cost estimate. Additionally, the Internet  response option cost estimate was not updated with more current  data from the analogous ACS program, as a result of its  implementation of an Internet response option in January 2013.", "The estimate was not credible. Sensitivity and risk and uncertainty  analyses were conducted on the 2020 census life-cycle cost estimate,  but they were not completed properly. For example, a risk and  uncertainty analysis was only applied to fiscal years 2018 to 2020  rather than on the total cost estimate. According to Bureau officials,  the Bureau focused on fiscal years 2018 to 2020 because 80 percent  of all costs for the decennial census are expected to be incurred  during this period. However, accounting for all risks throughout the life  of the program is necessary to adequately capture the uncertainty  associated with a program\u2019s estimate. The Bureau also did not  perform risk and uncertainty analyses on the Internet response option  cost estimate to reflect the uncertainty introduced by the significant  program changes discussed previously, such as the uncertainty  associated with the initial estimate for IT infrastructure costs ($11.4  million).", "The 2020 Census Directorate officials have recognized that the estimate  for the Internet response option had weaknesses and stated that the  preliminary 2020 census rough-order-of-magnitude life-cycle cost  estimate was not developed to be an official cost estimate, but rather a  \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to estimating costs and potential savings focused  around the major design categories. Nevertheless, the Bureau considered  the estimate to be a budget-quality estimate and used it to inform the  fiscal year 2015 budget request. Bureau officials stated that the  preliminary 2020 census life-cycle cost estimate (including the Internet  response option estimate) will be updated once the preliminary design  decision is made in September 2015.", "Additionally, Bureau officials identified several ongoing efforts that the  Bureau has planned to improve its institutional cost estimating practices.  Specifically, Bureau officials stated that the Bureau established a new  centralized cost estimating office in August 2013 that is expected to,  among other things, issue guidance and policies for developing reliable  cost estimates and establish a standardized work breakdown structure for  censuses and surveys by the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, create a  cost estimating certificate program by the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2015, and conduct independent cost estimates, as needed. Bureau  officials also stated that they have certified four staff in cost estimation  techniques, moved the 2020 census estimate to a more robust cost  estimating tool, and planned actions to address competency gaps in cost  estimating. While these are important steps to institutionalizing good cost  estimating practices, until the Bureau updates the Internet response  option cost estimate to ensure that it conforms with best practices, the  estimate will continue to be unreliable.", "In addition to the $12.7 billion 2020 census rough-order-of-magnitude life- cycle cost estimate, the Bureau estimated potential cost savings for the  major design options, such as optimizing self-response, which includes  the Internet response option. The Bureau estimated that implementing all  design options could result in potential savings of up to $5 billion.  Potential cost savings were estimated by adjusting inputs for different  2020 census design scenarios and calculating the difference between  those estimated 2020 census costs and the cost of repeating the 2010  census design. For example, to estimate potential cost savings for the  optimizing self-response design option, the Bureau reduced the amount  of printing, postage, and infrastructure needed for processing paper  questionnaires based on the percent of responses expected via Internet.  The Bureau estimated that the optimizing self-response option could  result in potential savings of about $550 million to $1 billion. However,  the unreliability of estimated costs for the Internet response option  discussed above casts doubt on the reliability of estimated cost savings  associated with the optimizing self-response design option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Census Bureau Faces Scheduling, Task, and Capability Challenges in Planning for an Internet Response Option", "paragraphs": ["While efforts are under way to deliver an Internet response option for the  2020 census, significant challenges remain.

It further stated that the  Internet would not be the only response option offered in 2020  because individuals without access to, or desire to use, the Internet  will still be able to respond on paper, by phone, or in person with a  census interviewer. We agree that the differential Internet availability  among historically hard-to-count populations should not imply that the  introduction of an Internet response option would lead to reduced  coverage.
