A second computing facility processes and stores taxpayer data used by IRS in conducting certain compliance functions. There are also hundreds of other IRS facilities (e.g., regional and district offices) that support tax processing.

To adequately protect the data, IRS must ensure that (1) access to computer data, systems, and facilities is properly restricted and monitored, (2) changes to computer systems software are properly authorized and tested, (3) backup and recovery plans are prepared, tested, and maintained to ensure continuity of operations in the case of a disaster, and (4) data communications are adequately protected from unauthorized intrusion and interception.", "Also, Treasury requires IRS to have C2-level safeguards to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer data.

C2-level safeguards include all the requirements from the D and C1 levels and are required by IRS for all sensitive but unclassified data. These safeguards ensure need-to-know protection and controlled access to data, including a security policy that requires access control; identification and authentication that provide mechanisms to continually maintain accountability; operational and life-cycle assurances that include validations of system integrity and computer systems tests of security mechanisms; and documentation such as a security features user\u2019s guide, test documentation, and design documentation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Work on IRS Computer Security", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 3 years, we testified and reported numerous times on serious weaknesses with security and other internal controls used to safeguard IRS computer systems and facilities.

In this regard, we found that (1) IRS did not adequately control access given to computer support personnel over taxpayer data and (2) established controls did not provide reasonable assurance that only approved versions of computer programs were implemented.

We reported in September 1993 that IRS did not adequately (1) restrict access by computer support staff to computer programs and data files or (2) monitor the use of these resources by computer support staff and users. As a result, personnel who did not need access to taxpayer data could read and possibly use this information for fraudulent purposes.
