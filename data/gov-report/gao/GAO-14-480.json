GAO identified three reasons why monthly cash balances were above the maximum or below the minimum cash requirements. First, the cash balance began fiscal year 2009 above the maximum requirement and generally remained above the maximum requirement in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 because the AFWCF charged more than it cost for spare parts. Second, cash balances fluctuated each year because of the cyclical nature of events. For example, in the spring and summer months, the Air Force flies more training missions, which increases revenue for parts and thus the cash balance. Finally, large-dollar transactions caused cash balances to fluctuate above and below cash requirements. These transactions were used to increase cash to pay for costs such as fuel price increases or reduce cash if it was above the maximum requirement.", "AFWCF projected monthly cash balances are expected to fall within cash requirements about 25 percent of the time in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. In managing cash for those fiscal years, the AFWCF faces three challenges:", "The AFWCF plans to implement a Department of the Treasury initiative to provide daily cash balances, instead of monthly balances, in October 2014. Because daily balances are more volatile, the AFWCF faces a greater risk that a cash shortfall would occur. However, the Department of Defense (DOD) has not updated its regulation on receiving daily cash balances.", "Because airlift rates are set to compete with private sector rates, they do not cover the full cost. The difference between the full cost and revenue received is to be provided by the Airlift Readiness Account (ARA) funded by the Air Force. The projected cash balance declines in fiscal year 2015 because the Air Force did not fully fund the ARA by $927 million. If a cash shortfall materializes, the Air Force stated its intent to fund the requirement from other programs. Without sufficient ARA funding, the AFWCF cash balance is at risk of falling below the minimum cash requirement in fiscal year 2015.", "The AFWCF has included $620 million in savings from Air Force and United States Transportation Command initiatives in its fiscal year 2015 projected monthly cash balances.

Under the working capital fund concept,  the Air Force charges these customers for the anticipated full cost of  these goods and services. In fiscal year 2013, the AFWCF earned  revenue of $21.2 billion by, among other things, (1) repairing,  overhauling, and modifying aircraft, engines, missiles, and components;  (2) selling depot-level repairable and consumable inventory items to  customers; and (3) providing air, land, and sea transportation for DOD in  times of peace and war, with a primary focus on wartime readiness.", "The availability of cash in the AFWCF depends on the outcome of many  decisions made during DOD\u2019s budget process with regard to (1)  projecting workloads, (2) estimating costs, and (3) setting prices to  recover the estimated full cost of providing goods and services. The  AFWCF cash balance is directly affected by collections from the sale of  goods and services, disbursements for such items as salaries and the  purchase of inventory, appropriations passed by Congress and enacted  into law, and transfers in and out of the AFWCF. According to the DOD  Financial Management Regulation,7 to 10 days of operational cost and six months of capital   \u201ccash levels should be maintained at  disbursements,\u201d (hereafter referred to as the cash requirement). Thus,  the minimum cash requirement consists of cash that is sufficient to meet  6 months of capital requirements plus 7 days of operational cost. The  maximum cash requirement consists of 6 months of capital requirements  plus 10 days of operational cost. The Air Force may add certain  adjustments to the calculation if approved by DOD. A disbursement in  excess of available cash would potentially constitute an Antideficiency Act  violation.reduced budget requests by DOD, reduced appropriations from  Congress, or transfers from the AFWCF to other appropriation accounts.  For example, Congress reduced the Air Force\u2019s fiscal year 2010  Operation and Maintenance appropriation by $250 million because of  excess cash in the AFWCF.

We compared the minimum and maximum cash  requirements to end-of-month reported cash balances. If the cash  balances were above the maximum amount or were below the minimum  amount, we met with Air Force and United States Transportation  Command (USTRANSCOM) officials and reviewed AFWCF budgets and  other Air Force and USTRANSCOM documentation to ascertain the  reasons. Further, to determine the extent to which cash transfers for  fiscal years 2009 through 2013 resulted in the AFWCF cash balances  either falling below the minimum cash requirement or being above the  maximum cash requirement, we analyzed DOD budget and accounting  reports to determine the dollar amount of transfers made for the period.  We analyzed cash transfers to determine if any of the transfers resulted in  the cash balances falling outside the minimum or maximum cash  requirements and, if so, the amount that fell outside those requirements.

The AFWCF is intended to (1) generate  sufficient resources to cover the full cost of its operations and (2) operate  on a break-even basis over time\u2014that is, neither make a gain nor incur a  loss. Customers primarily use appropriated funds to finance orders placed  with the AFWCF. Cash generated from the sale of goods and services is  the AFWCF\u2019s primary means of maintaining an adequate level of cash to  sustain its operations. The ability to generate cash consistent with DOD\u2019s  regulations depends on (1) accurately projecting workload, such as the  number of aircraft, engines, missiles, and components needed to be  repaired during the year or annual transportation requirements needed to  move United States forces, equipment, and supplies around the globe,  and (2) accurately setting prices to recover the full costs of producing  goods and services. DOD policy requires the AFWCF to establish its  sales prices prior to the start of each fiscal year and to apply these  predetermined or \u201cstabilized\u201d prices to most orders received during the  year\u2014regardless of when the work is accomplished or what costs are  incurred. Stabilized prices provide customers with protection during the  year of execution from prices greater than those assumed in the budget  and permits customers to execute their programs as approved by  Congress.", "Developing accurate prices is challenging because the process to  determine the prices begins about 2 years in advance of when the work is  actually received and performed. In essence, the AFWCF\u2019s budget  development has to coincide with the development of its customers\u2019  budgets so that they both use the same set of assumptions. To develop  prices, the AFWCF estimates (1) labor, material, overhead, and other  costs based on anticipated demand for work as projected by customers;  (2) total direct labor hours for each type of work performed, such as work  related to aircraft, engines, and repairable inventory items; (3) the  workforce\u2019s productivity; and (4) savings because of productivity and  other cost avoidance initiatives. In order for the AFWCF to operate on a  break-even basis, it is extremely important that the AFWCF accurately  estimate the work it will perform and the costs of performing the work.  Higher-than-expected costs or lower-than-expected customer demand for  goods and services can cause the working capital fund to incur losses.  Conversely, lower-than-expected costs or higher-than-expected customer  demand for goods and services can result in profits. With sales prices  based on assumptions that are made as long as 2 years before the prices  go into effect, some variance between expected and actual costs is  inevitable.", "If projections of cash disbursements and collections indicate that cash  balances will drop below the minimum cash requirement, the AFWCF  may need to generate additional cash. One method that may be used is  to bill customers in advance for work not yet performed. Advance billing  generates cash almost immediately by billing AFWCF customers for work  that has not been completed. This method is a temporary solution and is  only used when cash reaches critically low balances because it requires  manual intervention in the normal billing and payment processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Description of the AFWCF", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2013, the AFWCF earned $21.2 billion in revenue.

The CSAG provides repairable supply items and  consumable supply items as well as maintenance services. The Air  Force operates two CSAG divisions: the supply division and the  maintenance division. The supply division is primarily responsible for  managing repairable and consumable spare parts unique to the Air  Force. The supply division issued about 1.7 million repairable or  consumable spare parts in fiscal year 2013. The maintenance division  is responsible for economically repairing, overhauling, and modifying  aircraft, engines, missiles, and components to meet customer  demands.

The Air Force\u2019s SMAG-R manages inventory items,  including weapon system spare parts, medical-dental supplies and  equipment, and other supply items used in non-weapon system  applications. It also procures material and makes spare parts  available to authorized customers. The SMAG-R comprises three  divisions: the General Support Division, the Medical-Dental Division,  and the United States Air Force Academy Division. The General  Support Division manages nearly 1.4 million items procured from the  Defense Logistics Agency  and the General Services Administration to support field and depot maintenance of aircraft, ground and  airborne communication, and electronic systems.

These adjustments would increase the minimum and maximum cash  requirements. First, a working capital fund may increase the minimum  and maximum cash requirements for the amount of accumulated  operating results planned for return to customer accounts. The working  capital fund returns accumulated profits back to its customers by reducing  future prices so it can operate on a break-even basis over time. The  second adjustment allowed by the revised DOD Financial Management  Regulation is an allowance for funds appropriated directly to a working  capital fund that are obligated in the year received but not fully spent until  future years. The adjustment allows the working capital fund to retain  these amounts as an addition to its normal operational costs. Finally, a  working capital fund may increase the minimum and maximum cash  requirements by the marginal cash required to purchase goods and  services from the commodity/business market at a higher price than was  submitted in the President\u2019s Budget.

Specifically, the Air Force changed the method for charging customers for  spare parts from (1) selling individual parts to customers on a transaction- by-transaction basis to (2) charging customers for spare parts based on  actual hours flown by aircraft. Because the Air Force did not have  historical data on applying the new method, the Air Force wanted to make  sure it charged customers enough for supply items so that the AFWCF  would have a sufficient cash balance. In doing so, the Air Force charged  more than it cost for spare parts, which resulted in a higher-than-expected  cash balance.

In analyzing these data, they noted the  following.", "The AFWCF\u2019s day-to-day cash balances are more volatile than cash  balances measured on a monthly basis and can fluctuate by hundreds  of millions of dollars on a given day. These fluctuations increase the  risk that the cash balance could become negative on a particular day.", "DOD systems generally bill customers once or twice a month. The  billing systems run in the middle of the month and at the end of the  month. Since disbursements are made daily, the daily cash balance is  generally at its lowest level at about the middle of the month before  the first billing cycle occurs for that month.", "Air Force and USTRANSCOM officials informed us that managing cash  daily rather than monthly will require them to take two actions. First, these  officials stated that the AFWCF will need to maintain a higher cash  balance to offset the day-to-day volatility of cash during the month. The  higher cash balance will reduce the risk that (1) the AFWCF daily cash  balance will become negative on a particular day during the month and  (2) the AFWCF will incur a potential Antideficiency Act violation. However,  the Air Force and USTRANSCOM have not determined how much the  minimum and maximum cash requirements should be increased to cover  the additional cash needed. Second, the Air Force is considering adding  another billing cycle for the work performed by depot maintenance to  increase collections during the early part of the month and offset  disbursements made during the same time period.", "The implementation of Treasury\u2019s initiative to provide daily cash balances  was planned for October 1, 2014 (beginning of fiscal year 2015).  However, according to Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) officials, DOD systems will not be ready to provide the  necessary data to meet the implementation date because (1) DOD has  multiple disbursing systems and nonintegrated disbursing locations and  (2) DOD has a requirement to protect classified or sensitive information.  As of May 2014, the officials stated that they have not established a new  implementation date.", "See DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Accounting for Cash and Fund  Balances with Treasury, vol. 4, ch. 2, p. 2-14 (December 2009). monthly basis, our analysis showed that this policy will need to be  updated to recognize that DOD has visibility over daily cash balances,  especially if the cash balances become negative during the month.  For example, if the cash balance becomes negative on a particular  day during the month, a reconciliation will need to be performed to  determine if the cash balance is actually negative or if an error had  occurred in determining the cash balance.", "While DOD realizes that the Financial Management Regulation needs to  be revised to effectively implement Treasury\u2019s initiative to provide daily  cash balances, DOD has not revised it to include guidance on (1)  Treasury\u2019s initiative to provide daily cash balances instead of monthly  cash balances, (2) maintaining sufficient cash balances on a daily basis  to avoid potential Antideficiency Act violations, and (3) the reconciliation  of daily cash balances to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data.  Further, DOD has not determined the full impact of Treasury\u2019s initiative to  provide daily cash balances for the AFWCF or developed an analytical  approach for calculating the minimum and maximum cash requirements  to adjust for the day-to-day volatility of cash balances in the AFWCF and  reduce the risk that the AFWCF may incur an Antideficiency Act violation.  Once the updated cash requirement is determined, this will affect whether  the projected AFWCF cash balances for fiscal year 2015 will be above,  between, or below the cash requirement. Internal control standards state  that policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms are needed to  enforce management\u2019s directives, such as the process of adhering to  requirements for budget development and execution.

To enable it to better  compete with commercial providers, USTRANSCOM\u2019s airlift rates are set  to compete with private sector rates and do not cover the full cost of the  Air Force\u2019s readiness requirements for military airlift operations. The  difference between the full cost and the revenue received from airlift  customers is to be provided to USTRANSCOM in the ARA through the  use of Air Force appropriated funds. This requirement exists in both  peacetime and contingency environments.", "USTRANSCOM officials stated that since they set rates that are  benchmarked to private sector rates, USTRANSCOM does not recover its  full cost of operations and the TWCF incurs losses that in turn result in a  lower cash balance. To recover these losses, the TWCF identifies the  peacetime and contingency airlift requirements and the customers include  these amounts in their budget requests. During the year of execution, the  TWCF bills the services once a month. Specifically, the TWCF receives  funding from (1) the Air Force to pay for the peacetime airlift requirement  (Air Force Operation and Maintenance appropriation) and (2) the military  services for the contingency airlift requirement (overseas contingency  operations appropriation). Over the last several years, the TWCF has  received hundreds of millions of dollars that has helped it maintain cash  solvency.", "According to the TWCF budget request, USTRANSCOM estimates the  fiscal year 2014 ARA funding requirement to be $150 million plus $691  million for the contingency airlift requirement, for a total of $841 million.  However, in the fiscal year 2015 TWCF budget, USTRANSCOM  estimates the fiscal year 2015 ARA funding requirement to be $1,077  million, while the fiscal year 2015 Air Force Operation and Maintenance  budget provides for $150 million for the ARA. This estimated shortfall of  $927 million could negatively affect the TWCF as well as the AFWCF  cash balances. Maintaining sufficient cash balances in the TWCF and  AFWCF while minimizing the overall ARA bill to the Air Force presents  major management challenges for Air Force and USTRANSCOM. If the  ARA is overfunded, the Air Force may not be using its resources  efficiently to fund other Air Force program priorities to meet mission  requirements. Alternatively, if the ARA is underfunded, reductions to Air  Force programs may be required to maintain adequate levels of cash in  the AFWCF.", "The Air Force and USTRANSCOM have had a history of problems with  the Air Force requesting full funding in the Air Force\u2019s budget for the  USTRANSCOM ARA requirement. For example, according to the TWCF  budget, USTRANSCOM included a requirement for $294 million to fund  the ARA in fiscal year 2013, but the Air Force did not include funding for  the ARA in the fiscal year 2013 Air Force operation and maintenance  budget request. Though the Air Force did not request funding for the ARA  in the fiscal year 2013 budget, the Air Force paid its fiscal year 2013 ARA  bill.", "In reviewing past AFWCF budgets, the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) has also been concerned with ARA funding issues.  To address its concerns on these funding issues, in February 2012, the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) directed (1) the Air  Force to ensure that both the AFWCF and TWCF cash levels are  adequate to support operational and mobilization requirements in fiscal  years 2013 and subsequent years; (2) the Air Force and USTRANSCOM  to determine the appropriate methodology for fully funding  USTRANSCOM, including the ARA, and estimating the funding sources  for fiscal year 2014; and (3) the Air Force to ensure that it funds its  responsibilities for USTRANSCOM, including the ARA, updated for more  current workload assumptions, in the fiscal year 2014 budget and all  future budgets.", "Although the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) has  previously raised concerns about ARA funding issues, the funding issues  are projected to continue into fiscal year 2015. As stated above, the  estimated funding shortfall of $927 million could negatively affect the  TWCF and AFWCF cash balances in fiscal year 2015. Air Force officials  stated that although the AFWCF projected cash balance is expected to be  above the projected maximum cash requirement at the beginning of fiscal  year 2015, they expect the cash balance to decrease to $853 million and  below the projected minimum cash requirement by fiscal year-end. This  decline is expected to occur because Air Force did not fully fund the  estimated ARA requirement in the fiscal year 2015 budget. Air Force  officials informed us that it did not fully fund the ARA requirement  because it funded other higher-priority requirements.", "Air Force officials are aware of the estimated funding shortfall and stated  that the ARA funding requirement will be best managed in fiscal year  2015 when they can better estimate the actual ARA funding requirement.  Air Force officials stated that Air Force and USTRANSCOM senior  leadership currently meet monthly to collaborate on AFWCF cash  challenges and will be evaluating the ARA funding during fiscal year  2015\u2014the year of execution. They stated that workload and cash levels  are monitored closely during the year of execution and that any potential  issues involving workload and cash levels, including ARA funding, would  be identified several months in advance and brought to senior  leadership\u2019s attention. If a shortfall in the AFWCF cash balance begins to  materialize in the year of execution because of the unfunded ARA  requirement, Air Force officials stated that they have several options,  including (1) reviewing ongoing programs funded by the Air Force  operation and maintenance appropriation accounts to identify where  requirements have changed that would allow the AFWCF to obtain  additional funds for the ARA or (2) reviewing their investment accounts for  excess funding to transfer to the AFWCF. Air Force officials believe any  potential cash shortfall would be identified in sufficient time to take action.  While USTRANSCOM officials understand the Air Force\u2019s position on  funding the ARA, USTRANSCOM officials informed us that they believe it  is more prudent for the Air Force to request a significant amount of  funding for the ARA in the Air Force budget. These officials further stated  that if a funding shortfall occurs, the Air Force faces the risk of  transferring large amounts in the year of execution to cover the unfunded  requirement.", "Because the Air Force plans to address potential ARA cash shortfalls in  the year of execution, the AFWCF projected cash balances are currently  expected to decline during fiscal year 2015 and be below the minimum  cash requirement by the end of fiscal year 2015, which could impair the  ability of the AFWCF to maintain adequate cash balances. The ARA  funding issue could affect the Air Force\u2019s efforts to build cash in  anticipation of the Treasury initiative to provide daily cash balances.  Because daily cash balances are more volatile, the lower projected cash  balance caused by the lack of funding for the fiscal year 2015 ARA  requirement increases the risk of a cash shortfall and the risk of a  potential Antideficiency Act violation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Expected Savings from AFWCF Initiatives Is Necessary to Meet AFWCF Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 Projected Monthly Cash Balances", "paragraphs": ["As stated previously, our analysis of fiscal year 2015 AFWCF budget  information that contains the AFWCF cash management plans for fiscal  years 2014 and 2015 showed that the projected monthly cash balances  are expected to be above the maximum cash requirement in fiscal year  2014 and decline in fiscal year 2015 and fall below the minimum cash  requirement in September 2015. According to Air Force and  USTRANSCOM officials, achieving the AFWCF projected monthly cash  balances for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 depends on the Air Force and  USTRANSCOM successfully implementing cost reduction and efficiency  initiatives for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.

If these savings are not  realized, it can put a further strain on the AFWCF cash balance, which is  already projected to be under the minimum cash requirement at the end  of fiscal year 2015. In managing the AFWCF projected cash balance in  fiscal year 2015, there are several factors that may affect these balances  and increase the risk of an Antideficiency Act violation, including (1) the  Treasury cash initiative that will require additional cash to cover the  volatility of cash on a day-to-day basis, (2) the lack of funding for the  fiscal year 2015 ARA requirement, and (3) initiatives to achieve savings.
