Implementing resilience measures creates additional up-front costs but could also confer benefits, such as a reduction in future damages from climate-related events. Key examples of vulnerable infrastructure and federal lands GAO has identified include:", "Department of Defense (DOD) facilities. DOD manages a global real-estate portfolio that includes over 555,000 facilities and 28 million acres of land with a replacement value DOD estimates at close to $850 billion. This infrastructure is vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change and related extreme weather events. For example, in May 2014, GAO reported that a military base in the desert Southwest experienced a rain event in August 2013 in which about 1 year's worth of rain fell in 80 minutes. The flooding caused by the storm damaged more than 160 facilities, 8 roads, 1 bridge, and 11,000 linear feet of fencing, resulting in an estimated $64 million in damages.", "Other large federal facilities. The federal government owns and operates hundreds of thousands of other facilities that a changing climate could affect. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) manages more than 5,000 buildings and other structures. GAO reported in April 2013 that, in total, these NASA assets\u2014many of which are in coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise\u2014represent more than $32 billion in current replacement value.", "Federal lands. The federal government manages nearly 30 percent of the land in the United States\u2014about 650 million acres of land\u2014including 401 national park units and 155 national forests. GAO reported in May 2013 that these resources are vulnerable to changes in the climate, including the possibility of more frequent and severe droughts and wildfires. Appropriations for federal wildland fire management activities have tripled since 1999, averaging over $3 billion annually in recent years.", "GAO has reported that improved climate-related technical assistance to all levels of government can help limit federal fiscal exposures. The federal government invests tens of billions of dollars annually in infrastructure projects that state and local governments prioritize, such as roads and bridges. Total public spending on transportation and water infrastructure exceeds $300 billion annually, with about 25 percent coming from the federal government and the rest from state and local governments. GAO's April 2013 report on infrastructure adaptation concluded that the federal government could help state and local efforts to increase their resilience by (1) improving access to and use of available climate-related information, (2) providing officials with improved access to technical assistance, and (3) helping officials consider climate change in their planning processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on reducing federal  fiscal exposures posed by climate change and extreme weather events.  Climate change affects the American people in far-reaching ways,  according to the National Research Council (NRC) and the United States  Global Change Research Program\u2019s (USGCRP) May 2014 National  Climate Assessment. Certain types of extreme weather events with links  to climate change have become more frequent or intense according to  NRC and USGCRP, including prolonged periods of heat; heavy  downpours; and, in some regions, floods and droughts. In addition,  according to NRC and USGCRP, warming causes sea level to rise, sea  ice to melt, and oceans to become more acidic as they absorb carbon  dioxide. While it is not possible to link any individual weather event to  climate change, these and other observed impacts of such events disrupt  people\u2019s lives and affect many sectors of our economy, including the  budgets of federal, state, and local governments.", "Extreme weather events have cost the nation tens of billions of dollars in  damages over the past decade. In 2012, for example, Superstorm Sandy  alone caused tens of billions of dollars in damages to buildings, utilities,  transportation systems, and other infrastructure. Heavy rainfall and  snowfall events (which increase the risk of flooding) and heatwaves are  generally becoming more frequent, consistent with theoretical  expectations for a warmer and moister atmosphere due to changes in the  climate, according to a February 2014 joint report by the U.S. National  Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society in the United Kingdom. The  federal budget, however, generally does not account for disaster  assistance provided in cases such as Superstorm Sandy\u2014for which  Congress provided about $60 billion in budget authority for such  assistance\u2014or the long-term impacts of climate change on existing  federal infrastructure and programs. Because of these significant  financial risks and the nation\u2019s fiscal condition, in February 2013, we  added Limiting the Federal Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better  Managing Climate Change Risks to our list of high-risk areas.", "One way to reduce the potential impacts of climate change is to invest in  enhancing resilience. The National Academies define resilience as the  ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more  successfully adapt to adverse events. As we reported in April 2013,  enhanced resilience results from actions to reduce potential future losses,  rather than waiting for an event to occur and paying for recovery  afterward. Enhancing resilience has begun to receive more attention  because greenhouse gases that are in the atmosphere could continue  altering the climate system into the future, regardless of efforts to control  emissions.", "Implementing resilience measures creates additional up-front costs but  could also confer benefits, such as a reduction in future damages from  climate-related events. Federal efforts have begun to focus on enhancing  resilience and providing information to state and local decision makers so  they can make more informed decisions about fiscal exposure to potential  climate-related events. Decisions to adapt infrastructure to climate  change can also depend on many other factors, such as the availability of  substitutes or the remaining useful life of existing infrastructure.", "My testimony today discusses (1) federal fiscal exposures resulting from  climate-related and extreme weather impacts on critical infrastructure and  federal lands, and (2) how improved federal technical assistance to all  levels of government can help reduce climate-related fiscal exposures.

Many of these changes  have already been observed on federally managed lands and waters and  are expected to continue, and one of the areas where the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure is expected to increase is in its role as the  manager of large amounts of land and other natural resources.
