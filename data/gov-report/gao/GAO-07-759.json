No officials from the offering companies participated in the evaluation and all offerors were evaluated based on the same criteria. Four proposals were evaluated and three were determined to be comparable in terms of cost and schedule. The winner--Raytheon--was chosen on technical merit, as being more likely to meet APS requirements although its design had less mature technology. The APS development contract required the source selection winner to perform a trade study to assess alternatives and select the best design for development, and the Raytheon design was chosen. The trade study applied a consistent methodology to all alternatives before selecting Raytheon's vertical launch design. While the role played by Raytheon in the trade study was in accordance with its contract, the rationale for having the trade study follow the source selection is not entirely clear. The purpose of the trade study was to select the best concept; yet the source selection process that preceded it had, in fact, chosen Raytheon primarily on the technical merits of its vertical launch design concept. Although the vertical launch technology is not mature, the Army estimated that it could be available for prototype delivery to current force vehicles in fiscal year 2009 and tested on a FCS vehicle in 2011. This may be an optimistic estimate, as the FCS vehicle is yet to be fully developed. The Army and Boeing were extensively involved in APS source selection and the trade study. FCS officials actively participated and concurred in the final selection of the APS developer. FCS officials and technical experts from Army research centers took part in the trade study and helped choose the vertical launch design. Boeing officials took part in various ways and, with the Army's concurrence, selected Raytheon as the APS developer, participated in the trade study, and recommended the vertical launch approach. In its pursuit of a different APS concept, OFT was responding to an urgent need statement issued by the Central Command with potential for near-term fielding. This evaluation centered on the results of physical testing of the most technically mature candidate system, the Trophy. Decisions on how to proceed with Trophy involved disagreement between OFT and the Army. While the Trophy tests were successful, the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell decided to defer fielding the APS system, based in part on the recommendation of Army officials, who believed that testing had not been realistic and integrating it on the platform would delay fielding other useful capabilities. OFT officials proposed additional testing of Trophy to answer these questions, but funding for further OFT testing of this system was discontinued after the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell's decision."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An Active Protection System (APS) is intended to protect a vehicle from  An Active Protection System (APS) is intended to protect a vehicle from  attack by detecting and intercepting missiles or munitions before they hit  attack by detecting and intercepting missiles or munitions before they hit  the vehicle.

Fundamentally, the FCS concept is to replace mass with superior  information\u2014allowing soldiers to see and hit the enemy first rather than  to rely on heavy armor to withstand a hit. The Army envisions a new way  of fighting that depends on networking the force, which involves linking  people, platforms, weapons, and sensors seamlessly together in a system  of systems.", "Within the FCS program, eight types of manned ground vehicles are being  developed, each having a common engine, chassis, and other components.  One of the other common components is a hit avoidance system that  features a set of capabilities to detect, avoid, and/or defeat threats against  the manned ground vehicles. One of its subsystems is the APS, which is  intended to protect a vehicle from attack by detecting a threat in the form  of an incoming round or rocket propelled grenade (threat) and launching  an interceptor round from the vehicle to destroy the incoming weapon. An  APS system consists of a radar to detect the incoming weapon, a launcher,  an interceptor or missile, and a computing system.", "The Army has employed a management approach for FCS that centers on a  lead systems integrator to provide significant management services to help  the Army define and develop FCS and reach across traditional Army  mission areas. Boeing, along with its subcontractor, the Science  Applications International Corporation (SAIC), serves as the lead systems  integrator for the FCS system development and demonstration phase of  acquisition, which is expected to extend until 2014. The lead systems  integrator has a close partner-like relationship with the Army and its  responsibilities include requirements development, design, and source  selection of major system and subsystem subcontractors. In the case of  APS, the first-tier subcontractors are the manned ground vehicle  integrators, BAE and General Dynamics Land Systems, who are  responsible for developing individual systems. BAE was designated the hit  avoidance integrator, a role that covers more than active protection, and  was responsible for awarding the subcontract to the APS developer. This  subcontract has three elements: a base contract, option A to support the  current force (the short-range solution) and option B to support the FCS  manned ground vehicles (short- and long-range solution). Figure  1illustrates these relationships.", "A separate initiative involving active protection resulted from a Joint  Urgent Operational Needs Statement, issued by Central Command and the  Multi-National Corps in Iraq in April of 2005, which requested 14 special- equipped vehicles with a host of distinctive capabilities, one of which was  an APS. The need statement called for a capability to field a combination  of near-term technologies that would be useful in conducting force  protection missions, reconnaissance and crowd control in Iraq and an  evaluation of an active protection capability against rocket-propelled  grenades as part of this suite of capabilities. To respond to this need  statement, the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, a group within the Office of  the Secretary of Defense (OSD) that seeks solutions to urgent needs and  focuses on near-term or off-the-shelf equipment to meet these needs,  provided funding to the Army, which worked with the OFT to evaluate  various technologies, including an APS, for inclusion on the vehicles. The  OFT was also an office within the OSD, and its role was to examine  unanticipated needs and experiment with innovative technologies that  could be used to meet warfighter needs.", "Both the process for evaluating APS sources and concepts to meet FCS  needs and the urgent needs of the Central Command occurred nearly  simultaneously, as shown in figure 3.", "As can be seen in figure 3, many events took place at the same time.

The subcontractor selected would support the hit avoidance  integrator in integrating APS technology into the FCS manned ground  vehicles and also apply this architecture to the Army\u2019s current force. The  contract included two options that were to supply the specific design for  the APS system: Option A for the short-range APS for the current force;  and Option B for the short- and long-range solution for the FCS.

Under normal circumstances, since the APS would be part of the hit  avoidance system of the FCS manned ground vehicles, the hit avoidance  integrator, BAE, would have had the primary responsibility to issue the  requests for proposals, conduct the source selection evaluation, and award  the contract. In this capacity, BAE issued a draft request for proposals for  the APS in April 2005. When the firm subsequently decided to submit a  proposal on the APS subcontract, it was required, under the FCS lead  systems integrator subcontract organizational conflict of interest  provisions, to notify the lead systems integrator, Boeing, of its intention.  BAE did so and the lead systems integrator reissued the request for  proposals for APS in September 2005 and assumed the source selection  responsibilities. BAE submitted its proposal but then had no further role in  the evaluation of proposals or the actual source selection. After the source  selection was complete, the lead systems integrator transferred contract  responsibility to BAE, and BAE assumed the responsibility for awarding  and administering the APS contract.", "From our review, the documentation from the APS source selection  process shows that (1) no officials from the offering companies  participated in the source selection process, and (2) all offerors were  evaluated based on the same criteria contained in the request for  proposals. In response to this request for proposals, four proposals were  received. Three proposals were considered competitive, while the fourth  was eliminated from consideration as it was considered \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d in  technical merit and its architectural approach did not meet the  requirements. Proposals from the remaining three companies\u2014BAE,  Raytheon, and General Dynamics Land Systems\u2014were evaluated in the  source selection process and no officials from these companies were on  the evaluating or selecting teams.

After evaluating each of the proposals  against the criteria spelled out in the request for proposals, the source  selection evaluation team made its recommendation to the lead systems  integrator source selection executive, who accepted itsrecommendation.", "Our review of the documentation shows that the criteria were ranked in  order of importance, with technical merit considered most important, then  cost, management/schedule and finally past performance. The technical  merit criteria were divided into six sub-factors: systems engineering and  architecture; expertise in APS technologies; simulation, modeling and test;  fratricide and collateral damage; specialty engineering; and integration  capability. Cost criteria were based on the realism, reasonableness,  completeness, and affordability of the proposal. Management/ schedule  criteria included such areas as expertise and experience in key positions.  The past performance risk rating category was based on whether the  respondents\u2019 past performance raised doubts about their being able to  perform the contract.", "Since all three proposals were deemed comparable in the areas of cost,  management/schedule, and past performance, the primary discriminating  factor became technical merit. According to the evaluation  documentation, the technical merit scores were assessed based on  whether the proposal demonstrated that the contractor understood the  requirements and on its approach to meeting these requirements in each of  the six technical merit sub-factors. Also, part of the technical score was a  proposal risk evaluation, defined as the degree any proposal weaknesses  could cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation in  performance.", "While the source selection\u2019s stated purpose was to choose the company  best able to develop the APS and not a specific design, each proposal used  a specific APS system as an \u201cartifact\u201d to illustrate how they intended to  meet the requirements. Even though, in theory, one company could have  been chosen as the APS developer while another company\u2019s preferred  design could have been selected for development, much of the source  selection assessment of technical merit was based on the \u201cartifact\u201d used  for illustration. For example, in the technical merit category of APS  expertise, the source selection evaluation of Raytheon states that \u201cthe  vertical launch concept solves several design and integration problems.\u201d  Similarly, the BAE evaluation in the criteria of APS expertise states that  \u201cthe proposed long-range countermeasure\u2026design has effectiveness  against the full spectrum of threats.\u201d The General Dynamics Land System\u2019s  evaluation discusses the relatively high technology readiness level (TRL)  of the \u201cproposed Trophy system.\u201d Therefore, while each company\u2019s  proposed solution was not the only aspect of the proposals to be  evaluated, the evaluation documentation shows that the technical merit  category was a key factor in the evaluation.", "The source selection evaluation team decided that the BAE and Raytheon  proposals had the highest technical merit. BAE had a lower-risk approach  and its solution had been tested in a relevant environment: however, the  source selection evaluation team stated that this low-risk approach could  prevent BAE from considering higher-risk options that would enable them  to meet the full range of the performance requirements, such as protection  from top-attack weapons. In addition, the source selection evaluation team  determined that, while both Raytheon and BAE could develop the design  presented in the BAE proposal, Raytheon would have the advantage if the  vertical launch design was chosen. The evaluation team concluded that the  Raytheon approach would have the best chance of meeting all the  requirements. Based on the team\u2019s recommendation, the lead systems  integrator selected Raytheon.

However, in our view, this possibility  appears remote given the selection of Raytheon as APS developer was  based largely on the technical merits of its vertical launch design and the  fact that it would be best able to develop that design.", "The development contract\u2019s terms required the source selection winner to  perform a trade study that would identify and assess APS alternatives and  select an APS design from among competing alternatives. Therefore, once  Raytheon won the development contract in March 2006, it was required to  conduct the trade study rather than simply develop its own design. Since  the trade study was not a source selection, FAR contract provisions  regarding organizational conflicts of interest did not apply and Raytheon  was free to participate in the study as the responsible contractor. The  trade study\u2019s specific objective was to choose a single short-range APS  architecture (launcher and interceptor) that best met active protection  requirements for FCS manned ground vehicles, with consideration for  application to the current force.

The APS trade study process  consistently applied such methodology to all APS alternatives by using  separate, independent roles for a technical team and stakeholders;  operating under a set of assumptions; using validated, protected technical  data on each alternative; having a screening process to filter out non- viable alternatives; and using a set of weighted criteria to assess  alternatives that survived the screening process.", "The trade study was performed by a technical team and stakeholders\u2014 each having separate roles and operating independently from one another.  The technical team provided technical input and expertise to the  stakeholders, who were the voting members of the study and made the  final selection. The technical team, 21 members from industry and  government as shown in table 1, included individuals who were subject  matter experts as well as those from organizations participating in  development of the short-range APS. Raytheon had 11 members on the  technical team\u2014the most from any single organization. The Army stated  that this representation included administrators and observers and  occurred because Raytheon had been designated APS developer, was thus  required to conduct the trade study, and could gain knowledge from  attending subject matter experts.", "The stakeholders made the final selection. The composition and number of  stakeholders are shown in table 2. The stakeholders were program leads  from the Army, lead systems integrator, and subcontractors responsible  for integrating the FCS manned ground vehicles. According to the Army,  Raytheon\u2019s APS program manager was included as a stakeholder because  Raytheon as developer had responsibility for developing the design chosen  by the trade study process.", "The technical team and stakeholders operated the trade study under  assumptions that set parameters for screening and evaluating each  alternative. These assumptions were tied to such areas as performance  and threat. Additionally, they conducted the study using data that was  previously validated and remained protected throughout the study\u2019s  course. The primary source of the data was the Army Research,  Development, and Engineering Command\u2019s APS database, which  contained data gathered and validated by the Command\u2019s subordinate  labs. This data was protected by third parties, including the Department of  Energy\u2019s Idaho National Lab, to ensure it was not changed during the  study.", "The technical team used initial screening processes to eliminate four  alternatives and identify seven viable alternatives for further assessment.  The screening process filtered out the four alternatives that could not  meet one or both of two criteria: (1) ability to grow to meet 360-degree  hemispherical requirements, and (2) ability to be procured within a  program schedule that would meet the need for prototype delivery of a  short-range solution to the current force in fiscal year 2009. The seven  alternatives that survived the screening process are shown in table 3, along  with the respective government organizations and industry associated with  each.", "The technical team assessed the seven alternatives against a set of five  weighted criteria. According to the Army, these were the same top-level  criteria mandated in all FCS trade studies, and their weights were assigned  by FCS chief engineers. Table 4 defines each of the criteria and provides  information on respective weights.", "The vertical launch concept scored highest in every category of criteria  except risk. The Army indicated that the concept had about one-third  better overall weighted performance than the other alternatives. Army  officials described the vertical launch design as having technical  advantages over the other alternatives\u2014including the need for less space,  weight, and power\u2014as well as cost benefits.", "The Army and lead systems integrator officials told us that the trade study  could have resulted in the selection of a design other than Raytheon\u2019s.  They also stated that, had this occurred, Raytheon as APS developer  would have been required to develop this design rather than the vertical  launch. While in theory the APS source selection chose a developer and  the trade study chose the design to develop, in reality it is difficult to  separate the trade study results and the source selection decision. In our  view, in both the source selection and trade study, criteria related to  technical aspects of the designs were deciding factors. Considering that  the source selection evaluation relied on artifacts representing specific  systems\u2014and Raytheon won the source selection based in large part on  the technical merit of its artifact\u2014it seems unlikely that the APS trade  study would have resulted in the selection of any system other than  Raytheon\u2019s vertical launch.", "Although the trade study concluded that vertical launch was a high-payoff  approach, it also noted that it was a high risk due to its low technology  maturity. At the time of the trade study, as shown in table 5, the vertical  launch was less technologically mature than the other alternatives except  for one.", "The Army expects the design to reach TRL 6 (system model or prototype  demonstration in a relevant environment) by August or September 2007.  The Army expects the vertical launch concept to be available for prototype  delivery to current force combat vehicles in fiscal year 2009 and for testing  on a FCS vehicle in 2011. These estimates appear optimistic. At a TRL 5,  the vertical launch will require additional technology development and  demonstration before it is ready for either application. Also, the FCS  vehicles have not been fully developed yet. Assuming all goes as planned,  most FCS vehicle prototypes are expected to be available in 2011 for  developmental testing.

In setting up FCS, Army leadership noted that  traditionally, once the Army hired a prime contractor, that contractor  would bring its own supplier chains. The Army was not very involved in  the choice of the suppliers. In FCS, the Army called for the lead systems  integrator to hold a competition for the next tier of contractors. The Army  had veto power over these selections. In addition, the Army directed that  the lead systems integrator employ integrators at lower levels in the  program, for high-cost items such as sensors and active protection  systems and the Army has been involved with these selections. These  integrators were also to hold competitions to select suppliers for those  systems. This strategy was designed to keep the first tier of contractors  from bringing their own supplier chains and pushed competition and Army  visibility down lower in the supplier chain.

A delay in its integration on the Platform would delay, by at least  6 to 14 months, demonstration of other potentially useful capabilities,that  could be immediately incorporated. Further, the Army estimated that it  would take 5 years to integrate and field Trophy on other current force  manned ground vehicles. The Army recommended to the Joint Rapid  Acquisition Cell that the Trophy APS be excluded from Spiral 1 of the Full- Spectrum Effects Platform. In lieu of putting this technology in the field,  the Army recommended that slat armor be incorporated on Spiral 1, since  it has been effective in defeating the current rocket-propelled grenade  threat. OFT officials disagreed, reasoning that although the use of slat  armor on the current force has seemed to mitigate the effects of the  rocket-propelled grenades currently in use, improved munitions will soon  be available, and the slat armor will no longer be effective against these  threats. They believed that the Trophy should be tested further in order to  answer the questions raised by the Army and to provide insight into its  capabilities. OFT officials based their position on the Trophy\u2019s success in  these tests, its high level of technical maturity when compared to other  active protection systems, and the criticality of the need.", "The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell presented this information to Central  Command and recommended slipping the active protection capability to a  later platform spiral, once it was more mature. Currently, there are no  plans for further evaluation of active protection for future platform spirals.  Upon the removal of the Trophy APS system from the Full-Spectrum  Effects Platform vehicle, the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell discontinued  funding for further testing and evaluation of the Trophy. The disagreement  between Army and OFT officials notwithstanding, we did not find  information that would challenge the decision to defer the introduction of  the Trophy on light-armored vehicles. On the other hand, the 5 years the  Army estimated would be needed to integrate the comparatively mature  Trophy system on the existing Stryker vehicle does not appear consistent  with its estimates that the less mature vertical launch system could be  ready for prototype delivery on Strykers in 2 years and on the yet-to-be  developed FCS prototypes in 3 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The FCS lead systems integrator, with support from the Army, followed a  consistent and disciplined process in both selecting Raytheon to develop  the APS for FCS and in conducting the trade study and followed the lead  systems integrator subcontract and FAR provisions for avoiding  organizational conflicts of interest. While the role played by Raytheon in  the trade study was in accordance with its contract and thus not improper,  the rationale for having the trade study follow the source selection is not  entirely clear. The purpose of the trade study was to select the best  concept; yet, the source selection process that preceded it had, in fact,  chosen Raytheon primarily on the technical merits of its vertical launch  design concept. It was thus improbable that the trade study would reach a  different conclusion. Both the Army and the lead systems integrator were  closely involved throughout the source selection and trade study  processes and concurred in the selection of Raytheon\u2019s APS concept.", "The process for evaluating the Trophy system to meet the urgent needs of  the Central Command was different. It centered more directly on the  results of physical testing, followed a less-disciplined decision-making  process, and was characterized by considerable disagreement between  OFT and the Army. While the decision to defer the use of the Trophy on  fielded vehicles appears prudent in light of the limited realism of the  testing, the promising results of the testing likewise appeared to warrant  additional testing of the Trophy system to either confirm or dispel  potential risks in the use of APS capabilities. Discontinuing all testing of  the Trophy systems may thus have been premature, particularly in light of  the need to better understand tactics, techniques and procedures and  concepts of operations for both near-term and long-term applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Because of the likelihood that the Army will introduce APS into its forces,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense support additional testing  and demonstration of near-term APS systems on the Full Spectrum Effects  Platform or similar vehicles to, at a minimum, help develop tactics,  techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations for both near-term and  long-term active protection systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report.

It stated that the original  decision in May 2006 that delayed delivering Full Spectrum Effects  Platform capabilities due to technical development and performance risks  remains true today.  DOD added that there are no active protection  systems mature enough at this time to integrate on a Full Spectrum Effects  Platform regardless of any additional testing and demonstration efforts.   This represents a much more decided opinion than was rendered at the  time of the OFT tests.  At that time, Army officials believed that the Trophy  would not be sufficiently tested for operational and safety issues in time  for the first spiral of the Full Spectrum Effects Platform.  OFT officials  believed that the Trophy should be tested further to answer the questions  raised by the Army and to provide insight into its capabilities.  Ultimately,  the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell recommended slipping the active  protection capability to a later spiral of the Full Spectrum Effects  Platform.  This was the basis for our recommendation for additional  testing of near-term active protection systems on the Full Spectrum  Effects Platform.", "DOD stated that it continues to pursue active protection, citing the Army\u2019s  vertical launch system for FCS.  As stated in our report, this system is  technically immature and the Army\u2019s estimates for testing it appear  optimistic.  According to the Institute of Defense Analysis, the vertical  launch system is ambitious, with much enabling technology not yet  demonstrated.  Given the criticality of active protection for the FCS  manned ground vehicles, additional testing of near-term active protection  systems could provide valuable insights into operations and tactics that  would benefit future applications, such as FCS.  DOD noted that the  Trophy system is being tested on the Wolf Pack Platoon Project, an OSD  Rapid Reaction Technology Office (formerly OFT) effort.  However, this  project is not directed toward development of APS tactics, techniques,  procedures, or concepts of operations.  In addition, it will not include  testing against live targets.", "Testing near-term active protection systems on the Full Spectrum Effects  Platform or similar vehicles is valuable for answering remaining questions  about such systems and to provide insights for the employment of future  systems.  This is particularly important given the likelihood that the Army  will field some form of APS to its forces. We have broadened our  recommendation to capture the value of continued testing of near-term  APS for tactics, techniques and procedures and concepts of operations.", "Please contact me on (202) 512-4841 if you or your staff has any questions  concerning this report.
