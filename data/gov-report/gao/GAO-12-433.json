One effort to reduce costs includes restructuring, or optimizing, the size of USPS\u0092s retail network and workforce. The network includes approximately 32,000 USPS-operated facilities, such as traditional post offices, as well as alternative non-USPS-operated locations that sell its products and services.

USPS also closed 631 of its post offices, but it did not have cost-savings estimates for these closures. Most of the facilities closed (500) were in response to a postmaster vacancy or the suspension of operations due to an expired lease or irreparable damage following a natural disaster. Fewer closures (131) have resulted from nationwide reviews that USPS initiated in 2009 and 2011.

USPS officials have said they are in the process of addressing these recommendations.", "USPS faces challenges, such as legal restrictions and resistance from some Members of Congress and the public, that have limited its ability to change its retail network. For example, USPS is supposed to be self-financing, but it is also restricted by law from making decisions that businesses would commonly make, such as closing unprofitable units. Additionally, some Members of Congress and the public have challenged USPS\u0092s plans to close retail facilities in their districts or communities. Certain policy issues remain unresolved related to what level of retail services USPS should provide, how the cost of these services should be paid, and how USPS should optimize its retail network. Pending legislation takes differing approaches to addressing these policy issues.

Currently, in addition to USPS-operated facilities,  customers can purchase postal products or services at over 70,000  locations, including non-USPS-operated facilities consisting of 3,700  contract postal units and community post offices, retailers that have  partnered with USPS to sell postal products and services, and on its  website.

It plans to review  approximately half of its retail facilities for possible closure, reduction in  hours, and alternative access, including transfer of services to a contract  unit or rural delivery service. In addition, USPS is exploring expansion of  alterative access through such things as franchising opportunities and use  of kiosks to create additional channels to access retail services. Some  Members of Congress have raised concerns about these plans and the  potential negative impact that closing post offices could have on affected  communities. Congress has been considering several postal reform bills to  put USPS on a path to financial viability, and some Members have asked  USPS to postpone retail facility closures so as not to pre-empt  congressional action on postal reform.

For example, at some public meetings we attended, staff from  some congressional offices spoke to community members about actions  they could take to challenge potential closures. For example, they  encouraged residents to write letters to their Members of Congress and  cite specific, negative impacts a potential closing might have. At one  community meeting, congressional staffers said they had received  several letters from community members. In response to such actions by  constituents, many Members of Congress have written letters to USPS  requesting that it not close post offices in their districts. In December  2011, 20 Senators signed a letter to Senate leaders requesting that they  consider including language in an appropriations bill that would prevent  USPS from closing any rural post offices until Congress has passed  reform legislation. USPS then placed a moratorium on all facility closures  until May 15, 2012, while Congress considers postal reform bills. USPS  has encouraged Congress to enact postal reform legislation that would  provide USPS with more flexibility to make retail closure decisions by  eliminating statutory restrictions. Further, USPS officials told us that in  response to resistance to closures, they are considering reducing post  office operating hours rather than closing some facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Policy Issues and Pending Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Pending postal reform legislation provides an opportunity for Congress to  address certain unresolved policy issues related to USPS\u2019s retail  restructuring plans. These policy issues include what level or type of retail services should USPS provide to meet  customers\u2019 changing use of postal services; how should the cost of these services be paid; how should USPS restructure its operations, networks, and workforce  to support changes in services; and how should Congress provide USPS with flexibility to restructure its  networks and workforce while still holding USPS accountable to  Congress and the public?", "Several bills related to postal reform have been introduced in the 112th  Congress, and two have been approved by the Senate and House  oversight committees\u2014S. 1789 and H.R. 2309. As seen in the following  two examples, these bills provide different approaches to addressing the  legal restrictions and resistance USPS faces to closing facilities and the  unresolved policy issues.", "S. 1789 requires USPS to establish retail service standards and  consider several factors before making a closure decision, including  consolidating with another facility, reducing hours of operation, and  procuring a contract to provide retail services within the community.  The bill also allows USPS to provide retail alternatives to dedicated  post offices but also puts in place considerations before closing post  offices.", "H.R. 2309 removes the statutory restriction on post office closures  \u201csolely for operating at a deficit\u201d and establishes a commission similar  to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. USPS would  submit a plan to the commission, which would then make closure  recommendations to Congress that would be implemented unless  Congress passed a joint resolution of disapproval.", "Table 5 summarizes several challenges to restructuring the retail   network and some options to address these challenges that are included  in these bills."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["USPS must carefully work to ensure a viable strategy to effectively size  its retail network to reduce costs to match declining mail volume while  maintaining access to retail services. It is clear that USPS cannot support  its current level of services and operations from its current revenues.  USPS\u2019s ability to continue providing its current level of services is in  jeopardy, and it is up to both Congress and USPS to construct solutions  that will either reduce the cost of services or increase revenues from  other sources. But it appears that USPS cannot restructure its retail  network unless Congress addresses USPS\u2019s financial instability and the  long-standing challenges that hinder its ability to change its retail network.  If Congress prefers to retain the current level of service and associated  network, decisions will need to be made about how USPS\u2019s costs for  providing these services will be paid, including additional cost reductions  or revenue sources. Because USPS is in the process of responding to  several retail restructuring recommendations that its OIG, the PRC, and  we have made, we are not making any additional recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["USPS provided written comments on a draft of this report by a letter dated  April 11, 2012. USPS agreed with our findings, noting limitations  management faces to restructuring. Further, it observed that its operating  model is unsustainable and that maintaining the same level of retail  services will require solutions to cover the costs of those services either  through cost reductions or revenue enhancements. USPS also provided us  with technical comments that were incorporated into the final version of this  report as appropriate.

This report discusses (1)  key actions USPS has taken to restructure its retail network over the past  5 years; (2) concerns raised by postal stakeholders, including Congress,  the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), USPS Office of Inspector  General (OIG), and postal business and residential customers, and  USPS\u2019s response to these concerns; and (3) the challenges that USPS  faces in changing its retail network.", "To determine what key actions USPS has taken to restructure its retail  network, we reviewed documents related to the Station and Branch  Optimization and Consolidation (2009 Retail Initiative) and Retail Access  Optimization (2011 Retail Initiative), retail alternatives, and individual  district-initiated discontinuances. We examined criteria and goals of the  initiatives, the number of facilities studied, and the number of facilities  closed. In describing trends in the number of USPS-operated facilities,  retail transactions, and other retail operating statistics, we  reviewed reports from USPS OIG and documents filed in several  dockets from PRC related to the 2009 and 2011 Retail Initiatives, and  other discontinuance procedures in general. We also reviewed past  GAO work on the development of retail alternatives.  reviewed USPS documents, including guidance for discontinuance  processes, background documents on major initiatives, and overall  goals for the retail network. Our review included examining rule  changes between old and new discontinuance procedures.  interviewed USPS officials who oversee retail network restructuring to  discuss background of initiatives, criteria used for closures,  discontinuance processes, and relevant data.  reviewed USPS data from fiscal years 2006-2011 on the facilities,  costs of the retail network, employees, and customer statistics to  show trends in number of retail facilities, retail revenues, and  operating costs over the past 5 years. We also requested estimates  and projections for fiscal year 2015.", "To understand the context of data provided by USPS, we spoke with  knowledgeable officials to get a more-detailed understanding of how  databases are used by officials and USPS\u2019s methodology for collecting  information. We observed a demonstration of USPS\u2019s Change Suspension  Discontinuance Center program, which contains all of the information used  during the discontinuance process. This demonstration gave us an idea of  how district officials would use the program in support of discontinuance  activities. We also interviewed USPS officials to discuss data we  requested, including how variables were collected, and the methodology for  cost-savings estimates and future projections. For customer visits and retail  transaction data, we used an extrapolation provided by USPS since it does  not collect data for some small post offices. We also reviewed variables  used to estimate cost savings for individual facilities and the overall cost  savings USPS provided us for the retail facility closures from fiscal years  2007 through 2011. We assessed the reliability of USPS data and noted,  where appropriate, the limitations of certain data. For example, we  requested annual cost-savings data related to USPS retail facility closures  for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. USPS initially provided us with  aggregate annual cost savings, but because it did not provide  disaggregated data, we were not able to assess the reliability of these data.  We also discuss in this report the problems with USPS data and analysis  as reported by PRC and the USPS OIG.", "To identify concerns raised by postal stakeholders and to determine what  challenges USPS faces in restructuring its retail network, we analyzed  past work by GAO, USPS OIG, and PRC as well as statutory  requirements regarding facility closures and access to retail services. We  also identified stakeholder concerns, both from communities and  Members of Congress, that contributed to resistance to closures and  reviewed proposed legislation to identify potential options for addressing  retail network restructuring. We also discussed challenges to retail  network restructuring with USPS and PRC officials. For example, when  PRC attempted to estimate the costs and savings of the 2011 Retail  Initiative, it reported it was unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the  financial impact of the 2011 Retail Initiative because USPS did not collect  facility-specific revenue and cost data or separate retail costs from other  operational costs. In addition to questions about the overall financial  impact of initiatives, the adequacy of USPS\u2019s cost-savings estimates for  individual facilities has also been questioned by PRC during the appeals  process.", "To obtain information on stakeholder issues raised by customers during  past facility closures and USPS\u2019s communication, we conducted an  analysis of the PRC appeals docket for fiscal year 2011. We examined  reasons why facility closures were appealed, alternatives given by  USPS to replace services provided at closed facilities, customer  concerns and USPS\u2019s responses to the concerns contained in the  administrative record, and PRC\u2019s analyses of the cases.", "To obtain information on stakeholder concerns for the ongoing 2011  Retail Initiative and recommendations for improving the initiative, we  conducted an analysis of the Nature of Service docket on the 2011  Retail Initiative and the resulting PRC advisory opinion. We examined  USPS testimony, briefs, and responses to interrogatories,  summarized major issues brought up by stakeholders (including  unions, postmaster groups, the National Newspaper Association, and  the Public Representative), and examined the PRC advisory opinion  to inform GAO findings on challenges to making progress in  optimizing the retail network.", "To obtain information on resistance to closing facilities, we observed  congressional hearings and community meetings, reviewed relevant  news articles about congressional resistance to closures, and  interviewed USPS and PRC officials.", "To observe stakeholder concerns firsthand, we conducted site visits to  USPS districts to attend public meetings and to obtain detailed  information on discontinuance procedures, including criteria for closures  and the 2009 and 2011 Retail Initiatives. We chose two sites to visit, the  Arkansas and Colorado/Wyoming districts, based on the following criteria: number of upcoming public meetings,", "2011 Retail Initiative study category,  time range of meetings, proximity of meetings to district offices or cities, and  cost and convenience of travel.", "After applying these criteria to choose site visit locations, we attended two  to three community meetings per location and met with various district  officials to discuss the district-level discontinuance review process and  challenges to closing retail facilities. District officials we met with included:  district discontinuance coordinators, managers of marketing, managers of  customer and industry, and managers of post office operations. When  possible, we met with other relevant stakeholders during the site visits to  further our understanding of issues to facility closures. In Arkansas, we  spoke with a small business owner who had filed a petition for appeal of a  closure in a suburban area. In Colorado, we spoke with senior postal  officials in USPS\u2019s Western area office.", "In addition to conducting site visits to areas that had predominantly small  post offices, we also attended community meetings in urban areas for  stations and branches.
