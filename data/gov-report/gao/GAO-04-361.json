For example, we estimate that Russia and the United States will not complete destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles until after the convention's deadline of 2012, if extended. Less than 40 percent of member states have adopted national laws to prosecute individuals that pursue CWC-prohibited activities. The Department of State also believes that China, Iran, Russia, and Sudan have not fully declared the extent of their chemical weapons programs. The OPCW faces resource challenges in addressing the proliferation threat posed by commercial facilities and inspecting an increased number of military facilities that destroy possessor states' chemical weapons. Although the OPCW has conducted nearly 1,600 inspections in 58 member states since April 1997, more than half have been conducted at military facilities. About 36 percent of OPCW commercial inspections have taken place at facilities producing the most dangerous chemicals identified by the CWC. The OPCW recognizes that it must increase the number of inspections conducted at facilities that produce dual-use chemicals. Some of these facilities may pose a proliferation threat. The lack of a credible Russian chemical weapons destruction plan has hindered and may further delay destruction efforts, leaving Russia's vast chemical weapons arsenal vulnerable to theft or diversion. As of September 2003, Russia had one operational destruction facility and had destroyed 1.1 percent of its 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons. Russia's destruction efforts rely heavily on international assistance. Since 1993 international donors, including the United States, have obligated about $585 million for Russian destruction efforts while Russia has spent about $95 million."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) entered into force in April 1997.  It is the only multilateral treaty that seeks to eliminate an entire category of  weapons of mass destruction within an established time frame and verify  their destruction through inspections and monitoring. Specifically, the  convention bans the production, possession, and use of chemical weapons  and requires the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles by 2007 with  possible extensions to 2012. The CWC also requires member states to adopt  national laws implementing the convention and to declare their military  chemical weapons facilities and commercial facilities producing dual-use  chemicals to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  (OPCW). As of March 2004, 161 countries are CWC members, including the  Russian Federation and the United States. At the CWC\u2019s first review  conference in spring 2003, some member states expressed concern that  many member states are not meeting their key CWC obligations.  For  example, Russia\uf8e7the world\u2019s largest possessor of declared chemical  weapons\uf8e7is experiencing delays in destroying its stockpile.", "In response to your request, we reviewed (1) member states\u2019 efforts to  meet key CWC requirements, (2) OPCW\u2019s efforts to conduct inspections to  ensure compliance with the convention, and (3) Russia\u2019s efforts to destroy  its chemical weapons stockpile.", "In conducting our work, we reviewed the CWC, analyzed verification and  program documents from the OPCW, and met with OPCW officials.  Additionally, we met with officials from the Departments of Commerce,  Defense, and State, as well as member states\u2019 representatives to the OPCW  at The Hague, the Netherlands. We also obtained information from Russian  government officials and visited the U.S.-funded chemical weapons  destruction facility site at Shchuch\u2019ye in Russia.  To assess the reliability of  the data used in the report, we reviewed relevant documents and obtained  necessary information from agency and government officials. For the  purposes of our work, we determined that the data are sufficiently reliable.

The CWC also monitors the production and  transfer of chemicals at declared commercial facilities. When the CWC  entered into force in April 1997, there were 87 member states.  As of March  2004, 161 nations are CWC member states, including Libya.  Twenty-one  countries are signatories but have yet to ratify the treaty. According to the  State Department, key nonsignatory states include North Korea and Syria,  which are believed to possess or are actively pursuing chemical weapons  capabilities.", "Upon ratification of the CWC, all member states are required to adopt  national laws that criminalize CWC-prohibited activities and establish a  national authority to serve as the national focal point for liaison with the  OPCW.  All members are required to submit initial declarations to the  OPCW no later than 30 days after entering into the convention and annual  declarations detailing transfer activities of all declared chemicals no later  than 90 days after the end of the year. Member states must also declare  chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities, relevant chemical  industry facilities, and other related information such as chemical exports  and imports.  Member states that possess chemical weapons stockpiles and  production facilities must destroy them by April 2007.

The Technical Secretariat  manages the organization\u2019s daily operations, including the implementation  of the convention\u2019s verification measures.  The Technical Secretariat serves  as the repository for all member states\u2019 declarations and relies upon  individual member states to submit accurate, timely, and complete  declarations. Based on these declarations, the Technical Secretariat  inspects and/or monitors member states\u2019 military and commercial chemical  facilities and activities to ensure their compliance with the CWC. Also, if a  member state suspects another member state of conducting activities  prohibited by the convention, it may request a challenge inspection of the  suspected site(s). As of December 2003, no member state has requested the  OPCW to conduct a challenge inspection.", "Technical Secretariat inspectors take inventories of the declared stockpiles  to verify the accuracy of the declarations and ensure that chemical  weapons are not removed. Inspectors continuously monitor the  destruction of chemical weapons at operating destruction facilities by  observing the receipt of chemical weapons at sites and checking the type  and quantity of chemical weapons destroyed. Inspectors also verify the  destruction or conversion of declared chemical weapons production  facilities by observing the destruction of applicable buildings and  production equipment. So that dual-use chemicals are not diverted from  their peaceful uses, the Technical Secretariat inspects declared commercial  production facilities based on three schedules, or lists of chemicals,  contained in the CWC. Commercial facilities that produce discrete organic  chemicals, above 200 metric tons, are also subject to inspections. OPCW  inspectors verify that the types of chemicals being produced are consistent  with the member states\u2019 declarations.", "Funding for OPCW inspections and other operations comes primarily from  the 161 member states\u2019 required annual contributions, which are based on  the United Nations\u2019 scale of assessments. The other major source of  funding comes from reimbursements of inspections costs paid by chemical  weapons possessor states.  The OPCW is partially reimbursed for  inspection costs incurred while conducting inspections at declared  chemical weapons facilities in those countries.

In addition, Libya became the sixth possessor  state in February 2004 when it became a member of the CWC and declared  that it possessed chemical weapons.

The stockpile includes 32,500 metric tons of nerve agent, the most toxic of  all known chemical agents, and 7,500 metric tons of blister agent. As we  have previously reported, DOD has installed security upgrades at  Shchuch\u2019ye and Kizner, the two sites with portable nerve agent munitions.   However, a large quantity of Russia\u2019s chemical weapons will remain  vulnerable to theft or diversion until they are destroyed.

In accordance with treaty provisions, Russia  requested and received an extension of its 1-percent and 20-percent  deadlines from the OPCW. In April 2003, Russia met the one percent  destruction deadline.  Based on information provided by DOD, we estimate  that Russia may not destroy its declared chemical weapons stockpile until  2027. Our analysis is predicated on Russia\u2019s complete destruction of its  approximately 7,500 metric tons of blister agent by the 2007 deadline and  destroying the remaining 32,500 metric tons of nerve agent at the U.S.  funded destruction facility at Shchuch\u2019ye.  In September 2003, Russia  agreed to complete the elimination of all of its nerve agent at the  Shchuch\u2019ye destruction facility, which is scheduled to begin operations in  2008.  According to DOD, the Shchuch\u2019ye facility may not be operational  until 2009. For Russia to meet an extended April 2012 deadline, Russia  would have to destroy about 9,100 metric tons of nerve agent per year.  Operating at maximum capacity, the facility is estimated to destroy about  1,700 metric tons of nerve agent per year. At that rate, unless the capacity  for destruction is increased or additional destruction facilities are built, the  complete destruction of Russia\u2019s stockpile may not occur until 2027.  (We  discuss other options for destroying Russia\u2019s nerve agent stockpile later in  this report.)", "The United States possesses the second largest declared chemical weapons  stockpile with 27,771 metric tons, which is stored at eight sites, as shown in  figure 2.  Currently, the United States is operating three destruction  facilities; three additional facilities will be operational in the near future  and two more will begin construction. As of December 2003, the United  States destroyed 24 percent of its declared stockpile and met the 1-percent  and 20-percent interim deadlines within the treaty time frames.  However,  the United States requested and received an extension of the 45-percent  deadline from April 2004 to December 2007. The United States will not  meet the 100-percent April 2007 destruction deadline and may not meet the  2012 deadline, if extended, based on the current schedule. According to  DOD, one U.S. chemical weapons destruction facility is not scheduled to  complete its destruction operation until 2014.  Persistent delays have  occurred due to plant safety issues, environmental requirements, and  funding shortfalls. We have previously reported on the significant  management challenges in the U.S. chemical demilitarization program, as  well as concerns over cost growth and schedule delays. As noted in our  prior work, the U.S. chemical weapons demilitarization program spent  $11.4 billion by the end of fiscal year 2003, which accounts for nearly half of  the program\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate of $24 billion.", "Ind.", "Colo.", "Ky.", "Md.", "Ark.", "Ala.", "Three other possessor states\uf8e7Albania, India, and A State Party\uf8e7account  for about 3 percent of the global declared chemical weapons stockpile and  are anticipated to meet the CWC complete destruction time line by April  2007.

Albania  declared its stockpile to the OPCW in 2003, and the United States is  providing assistance to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile.  Other  nations, including Canada and Italy, may also provide assistance. State  officials estimate that Albania will meet the 2007 destruction deadline.  According to Indian officials, India has the third largest stockpile after  Russia and the United States; however, information on its chemical  weapons destruction program is not publicly available.

The military sites that have not been  inspected are either chemical weapons production facilities destroyed  prior to CWC entry into force or sites having old or abandoned chemical  weapons.  Although the CWC requires that OPCW maintain a continuous  presence at member states\u2019 sites when chemical weapons are being  destroyed, it does not specify how many inspections are to be conducted  annually.  The Technical Secretariat determines how many inspections to  conduct annually based on the number of military facilities declared by  member states, member states\u2019 annual destruction plans, annual  declarations, and the annual OPCW budget documents.  The greatest  number of inspections has taken place at chemical weapons destruction  facilities\uf8e7primarily in the United States, Russia, and India. About one-third  of all inspections conducted by the Technical Secretariat have taken place  in the United States, mostly at chemical weapons destruction facilities.  Table 2 shows the number of inspections conducted at different types of  facilities at military sites from April 1997 through December 2003.", "Between April 1997 and December 2003, Technical Secretariat officials  conducted 634 inspections at 514 sites among the 5,460 commercial  facilities declared by member states (see table 3).  Because the CWC does  not specify the specific number of inspections to be conducted each year,  the Technical Secretariat selects the facilities it will inspect based on those  requiring initial inspections and the potential proliferation risk of facilities.  The annual budget document specifies the number of inspections to be  conducted.  Since April 1997, most OPCW commercial inspections have  taken place at facilities that produce chemicals listed on the CWC\u2019s three  schedules. Of the declared 4,492 facilities that produce discrete organic  chemicals (DOC), the organization has inspected 163. DOC facilities  produce a wide range of common commercial chemicals and may also be  capable of producing chemical weapons.  According to U.S. government  and OPCW officials, such dual-use DOC facilities may pose a proliferation  threat because they may conceal CWC-prohibited activities.  Most  significantly, these DOC facilities may be modified to produce scheduled  and other chemicals that are not specifically listed on current CWC  schedules but are still banned by the CWC, if intended for prohibited  purposes. In commenting on a draft of our report, the OPCW provided  clarification of this proliferation issue.

Concurrently, the OPCW  wants to increase the number of inspections it conducts at commercial  DOC facilities to address proliferation concerns.  However, the OPCW has  experienced financial difficulties over the past few years.  To better meet  the increased demand on its resources, the OPCW is working with member  states to find more efficient and cost-effective means of conducting its  inspection activities.", "The OPCW projects that the number of chemical weapons destruction  facilities that will require monitoring will increase from seven to nine by  2007.  Under the CWC, OPCW inspectors must maintain a continuous  onsite presence at chemical weapons destruction facilities to monitor and  verify the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles.

In 2004, the OPCW plans to  increase the number of DOC facility inspections to 70 out of a total of 150  inspections planned at commercial facilities.  Furthermore, OPCW and  member states are working to refine the current criteria used to select  DOC facilities for inspections to ensure that the selection process takes  into account all factors mandated by the CWC.", "Due to budget deficits in 2001 and 2002, the Technical Secretariat had to  reduce the number of inspections it planned to conduct at commercial  chemical facilities. Such deficits were mostly the result of member states\u2019  late payment of their annual assessments and reimbursements for military  inspections. When funding was limited, the OPCW could not reduce the  number of inspections at destruction facilities because inspectors are  required to continuously monitor these sites when operational. Instead, it  reduced the number of commercial inspections it conducted. In 2001, the  OPCW conducted 57 percent (75 of 132) of its planned inspections at  commercial sites.  For 2002, it conducted 64 percent (85 of 132) of its  planned inspections.  Although previous financial difficulties caused a  reduction in the number of inspections, the Technical Secretariat  completed its planned number of 132 commercial inspections for 2003.  Member states approved a more than 6-percent increase in the OPCW\u2019s  budget for 2004.

The  organization has reduced the size of inspection teams at military sites,  thereby lowering daily allowance and travel costs.  For example, the team  size for most inspections conducted at chemical weapons storage facilities  was reduced from eight in 2002 to six in 2003. The Technical Secretariat has  also devised new contracts for inspectors of chemical weapons destruction  facilities that permit hiring part-time inspectors for 1 year.  When  implemented, such contracts could reduce staff costs and provide for more  flexibility in assigning inspection teams.  The OPCW and member states are  also exploring greater use of monitoring and recording instruments at  chemical weapons destruction facilities to reduce the number of inspectors  needed on-site.

Russian officials have concerns about the costs and risks of transporting  the weapons from these sites to Shchuch\u2019ye, most of which are located  more than 500 miles away.  As a result, Russian officials have indicated that  Russia may construct three chemical weapons neutralization facilities for  the nerve agent stored at Maradykovsky, Leonidovka, and Pochep. Under  this option, Russia would neutralize the chemical weapons at the three  sites so the agent would be safe for transport, and then complete the  destruction process at Shchuch\u2019ye.  This would require the construction of  three neutralization facilities plus new destruction capacity at Shchuch\u2019ye,  because the neutralized agent would likely be destroyed using a different  process than the unneutralized agent from the Shchuch'ye and Kizner sites.

For example, Russian officials have stated that they expect the  Shchuch\u2019ye chemical weapons destruction facility to be operational in  2006, despite DOD estimates that it may take until July 2009. DOD officials  stated that additional time is needed to procure and install the equipment  needed for the destruction facility.", "In addition, Russia\u2019s plans need greater specificity. Russia has provided  some information to the United States regarding the following:  where the chemical weapons will be destroyed,  when they will be destroyed and the amounts at each location,   costs for each facility, and  how each facility will contribute to the destruction efforts.", "According to officials from State and DOD, the information provided does  not appear credible and lacks key elements.  Russia has not provided the  method, schedule, and cost for transporting its chemical weapons to the  destruction facility at Shchuch\u2019ye.

Russian officials indicated that the nerve agent may be neutralized at each  site but did not provide any details regarding what would be needed to  undertake such an effort, including a plan to dispose of the toxic chemicals  resulting from the neutralization process.", "Russia\u2019s chemical weapons destruction efforts at Pochep, Leonidovka, and  Maradovski may be further complicated by Russia\u2019s definition of  destruction, which differs from that of the United States and the OPCW.  The CWC defines destruction of chemical weapons as an essentially  irreversible process.  The United States and the OPCW maintain that  chemical weapons are not destroyed until the materials resulting from the  destruction process are essentially irreversible (i.e., can no longer be  reversed back to chemical weapons) and the remaining materials can be  inspected by the OPCW. The United States neutralizes some of its chemical  weapons in a two-phase process that first neutralizes the agent and then  transports the resulting hazardous waste to a commercial chemical facility  for final disposition. The OPCW inspects both phases of the neutralization  process. Russian officials maintain that chemical weapons should be  considered destroyed after the initial neutralization phase and not require  further processing or OPCW inspections. Russian officials argue that,  although toxic chemicals resulting from the neutralization process could be  reverted to chemical weapons, the cost to do so would be prohibitive.   Russia raised this issue at the May 2003 CWC Review Conference, but  OPCW member states maintained that complete destruction should be an  essentially irreversible process as specified in the CWC.

Nearly 7 years after entry into force, the CWC\u2019s  nonproliferation goals have proven more difficult to achieve than originally  anticipated. CWC member states and the OPCW face difficult choices in  addressing the delays in Russia\u2019s destruction program, the limited number  of inspections at dual-use commercial sites, and the slow progress in  passing laws criminalizing CWC-prohibited activities.  Decision-makers  will have to make some combination of policy changes in these areas if the  CWC is to continue to credibly address nonproliferation concerns  worldwide.", "First, the destruction of chemical weapons will likely take longer and cost  more than originally anticipated. Even with significant international  assistance, Russia may not destroy its declared chemical weapons until 15  years beyond the extended CWC deadline. Russia\u2019s large stockpile will thus  remain vulnerable to theft and diversion. Several options exist, however,  for the United States and other donors to reduce the proliferation risks  from Russia\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile. Such options may include (1)  increasing funding for security improvements at Russia\u2019s chemical  weapons storage sites, (2) deferring financing for Russia\u2019s chemical  weapons destruction effort until the Russian government develops a  credible destruction plan, or (3) financing the construction of additional  destruction facilities.", "Second, technical advancements in the chemical industry and the  increasing number of dual-use commercial facilities worldwide challenge  the CWC and the OPCW\u2019s ability to deter and detect proliferation. Member  states will need to determine the best policies for addressing potential  proliferation at dual-use commercial facilities.  CWC member states could  decide that the OPCW should conduct more commercial inspections,  which would require member states to provide more funding and subject  their national chemical industries to additional inspections. Alternatively,  member states may determine that the current level of commercial  inspections is sufficient to detect and deter activities prohibited by the  CWC.", "Third, many member states have not yet adopted national laws to fully  implement the convention, or have not submitted complete and accurate  declarations of their CWC-related activities. These problems undermine  confidence in overall treaty compliance. It is important for the OPCW and  member states to reinforce member states\u2019 obligations to adopt national  laws, enforce them accordingly, and submit accurate and timely  declarations.

In commenting on our draft report, State asserted that our  report was misleading, incomplete, and not balanced.  State did not   provide specific examples but instead claimed that the report omitted  positive CWC accomplishments such as growth in the number of member  states, correction of OPCW management inefficiencies, and OPCW  execution of the CWC inspection regime. In response, we agree that the  CWC has played an important role in reducing the threat posed by chemical  weapons and the report acknowledges this accomplishment.

Thirdly, the report  clearly articulates that the OPCW has established a credible inspection  regime and has conducted nearly 1,600 inspections in 58 member states.

DOD, however, does not offer what criteria one  would use to make a determination about which member states are more  important to CWC implementation.  As stated in the report, the CWC  requires all member states to adopt national implementing legislation. In  addition, DOD believes that the report is not conducive to providing a  balanced perspective because it does not acknowledge successes in  implementing the CWC.  For example, DOD cites that progress has been  made in eliminating former chemical weapons production facilities and  destroying category 2 and 3 chemical weapons related munitions.  Such  successes, however, remain secondary to the CWC\u2019s primary goal of  destroying actual chemical weapons.  As stated in this report, the CWC is  the only multilateral treaty that seeks to eliminate an entire category of  weapons of mass destruction under an established time frame and verify  their destruction through inspections.  DOD also asserts that the report  does not recognize the significant changes occurring within the OPCW. As  mentioned previously, this report does not assess OPCW functions or  performance because we conducted such a review of the OPCW in October  2002.

In response, we included additional  information in this report to acknowledge the growth in the number of  member states.  We also cite that Libya, the sixth possessor state,  acceded to the CWC in February 2004. This report does not discuss the  management of the OPCW, as we previously reported on the  management of the organization under the leadership of the former  Director-General, Jose Bustani. We did not review the management of  the OPCW under the current Director-General, Rogelio Pfirter but  acknowledge that he is committed to implementing management  reforms.  Finally, this report clearly articulates that the OPCW has  established a credible inspection regime. 2. State concluded that the entry into force of the CWC caused two  previously unknown stockpiles to be discovered and accelerated  chemical weapons destruction efforts.  In its comments, however, State  did not identify the member states that possess the unknown  stockpiles.  3. State cites that of the 158 member states, 56 of 61 member states with  CWC-declarable facilities have adopted national laws. This statement  implies that only countries with CWC-declarable facilities should adopt  national implementing laws.  As stated in the report, the CWC requires  all member states to adopt national implementing laws.  Assistant  Secretary of State for Arms Control stated in his remarks to the 2003  CWC Review Conference that the lack of national implementing laws  among member states is troubling \u201cin light of the efforts of Al Qaeda  and other terrorist organizations to acquire chemical weapons.\u201d 4. State indicated that Russia budgeted roughly $420 million for all of its  chemical weapons demilitarization-related activities between 2001 and  2003 and that Russia\u2019s approved 2004 budget requests about $180  million more.  We have included this additional information in the  report, as it was not previously provided to us. 5. State contends that our estimated deadline of 2014 for the complete  destruction of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile is unsubstantiated.  The department further asserts that our 2027 estimate for the  completion of Russia\u2019s chemical weapons destruction assumes a single  nerve agent destruction facility, at Schuch\u2019ye and that we omit the  possibility of constructing additional destruction facilities.  We have  clarified the 2014 deadline by adding information citing a U.S. chemical  weapons destruction facility schedule that indicates that the facility  will not complete its destruction operations until 2014. While we  acknowledge that Russia may construct additional destruction  facilities, our analysis is based on the destruction capacity of the one  nerve agent destruction facility currently under construction.  At this  time, there are no other nerve agent destruction facilities under  construction and no definitive plans for building additional facilities.   Furthermore, Russia has agreed to eliminate all nerve agent at  Shchuch\u2019ye, unless otherwise agreed in writing. In a March 2004  congressional testimony, the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for  Technology Security Policy and Counterproliferation stated that the  Shchuch\u2019ye facility \u201cwill destroy all of Russia\u2019s nerve agent inventory.\u201d  While Russian officials have indicated that Russia may construct  neutralization facilities at Pochep, Leonidovka, and Maradovski, a  detailed plan and/or cost estimates have yet to be provided.  6. State contends that the option of delaying further assistance to Russia  could result in a greater proliferation threat. State implies that we are  only presenting one option, when in fact this report provides numerous  options, including providing additional assistance for Russian chemical  weapons destruction.  Furthermore, Congress has previously exercised  the option of withholding U.S. assistance for Russian chemical  weapons destruction. 7. State claims that facilities that produce discrete organic chemicals  (DOC) are of little or no proliferation concern to the CWC.  However,  information we obtained from State, Commerce, DOD, and the OPCW,  contradicts this statement.  Officials and documents from all four  organizations clearly expressed concern over the potential  proliferation risks from DOC facilities.  This report, therefore, indicates  that these facilities produce a wide range of common commercial  chemicals and may be capable of producing chemical weapons.  8.
