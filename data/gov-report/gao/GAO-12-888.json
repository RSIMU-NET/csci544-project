In fiscal year 2010, almost 60 percent of confirmed fraud cases (9,200 out of 16,000) involved applicants from Brazil, China, Dominican Republic, India, and Mexico. Department of State (State) officials told GAO that fraud most commonly involves applicants for temporary visits to the United States who submit false documentation to overcome the presumption that they intend to illegally immigrate. Fraud is also perpetrated for immigrant visas and nonimmigrant visa categories such as temporary worker visas and student visas. In response to State efforts to combat visa fraud, unscrupulous visa applicants adapt their strategies, and as a result, fraud trends evolve over time.", "State has a variety of technological tools and resources to assist consular officers in combating fraud, but does not have a policy for their systematic use. For example, State recently implemented fraud prevention technologies such as a fraud case management system that establishes connections among multiple visa applications, calling attention to potentially fraudulent activity. Overseas posts have Fraud Prevention Units that consist of a Fraud Prevention Manager (FPM) and locally employed staff who analyze individual fraud cases. In 2011, the ratio of Fraud Prevention Unit staff to fraud cases varied widely across overseas posts, causing disproportionate workloads. The Kentucky Consular Center (KCC) is a domestic resource available to posts that verifies information on certain visa applications. However, KCC services are only provided on an ad-hoc basis, and State does not have a policy for posts to systematically utilize its resources. For example, an FPM at a high fraud post told GAO that the post would like to utilize KCC anti-fraud services for screening certain visa categories, but did not know how to request KCC assistance.", "Although State offers anti-fraud training courses at the Foreign Service Institute and online, it does not require FPMs to take them and does not track FPMs\u0092 enrollment. Consular officers receive limited fraud training as part of the initial consular course, and FPMs are not required to take advanced fraud training in new technologies. In addition, GAO found that 81 percent of FPM positions were filled by entry-level officers and 84 percent of FPM positions were designated as either part-time or rotational. Between October 2009 and July 2012, entry-level officers made up about 21 percent of the total students who registered for a course on detecting fraudulent documents, and State could not guarantee that FPMs were among them.

Globally, KCC screened 81,862 H-1B and L-1 applications for  fraud in calendar year 2011.

Additionally, KCC fraud analysts may also refer the case to  onsite Fraud Detection and National Security officers to request a visit to  the proposed employment site.

KCC employees conduct  research on visa applicants and petitioners, and provide this information  to consular officers overseas so that they have access to the information  prior to interviewing a visa applicant in person. For example, we  observed a KCC analyst conducting research on a summer work and  travel visa application that listed the sponsor business as a restaurant.

As a result, MLB prospects often falsify their ages and  sometimes their identities on visa applications to make them appear  younger than they truly are. To date, ARSO-I Santo Domingo has  facilitated the arrests of two MLB Dominican talent scouts, an MLB  Investigator, and an MLB pitcher, among others, for participating in  identity fraud. The pitcher, a Dominican citizen, assumed the identity of a  younger person and obtained a contract to play professional baseball as  a pitcher in the United States in 1999. The pitcher has since illegally  obtained at least 10 nonimmigrant visas in his assumed identity. ARSO-I  Santo Domingo confirmed the pitcher\u2019s true identity and coordinated with  the Dominican prosecutors\u2019 office to obtain a Dominican arrest warrant.  The pitcher later returned to the Dominican Republic and obtained travel  documents and a new nonimmigrant visa petition from the MLB in his true  identity, and applied for a nonimmigrant visa. The interviewing consular  officer found the pitcher ineligible for the nonimmigrant visa due to identity  fraud, and the ARSOI-I Santo Domingo subsequently facilitated his arrest  by the Dominican National Police, based on his outstanding Dominican  arrest warrant.", "In December 2010, Sao Paulo Civil Police arrested a Brazilian who  presented false documents in support of his U.S. visa application.
