While both help students meet current expenses, tax preferences also assist students and families with saving for and repaying postsecondary costs. While both serve students and families with a range of incomes, some forms of title IV aid--grant aid, in particular--provide assistance to those whose incomes are lower, on average, than is the case with tax preferences. While both require students and families to fill out forms, tax preferences require more responsibility on the part of students and families because they must identify applicable tax preferences, understand complex rules concerning their use, and correctly calculate and claim credits or deductions. While the tax preferences are a newer policy tool, the number of tax filers using them has grown quickly, surpassing the number of students aided under title IV in 2002. Some tax filers do not appear to make optimal education-related tax decisions. For example, among the limited number of tax returns available for our analysis, 27 percent of eligible tax filers did not claim either the tuition deduction or a tax credit. In so doing, these tax filers failed to reduce their tax liability by $169, on average, and 10 percent of these filers could have reduced their tax liability by over $500. One explanation for these taxpayers' choices may be the complexity of postsecondary tax provisions, which experts have commonly identified as difficult for tax filers to use. Little is known about the effectiveness of title IV aid or tax preferences in promoting, for example, postsecondary attendance or choice, in part because of research data and methodological challenges. As a result, policymakers do not have information that would allow them to make the most efficient use of limited federal resources to help students and families."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent decades, Congress has provided billions of dollars in assistance  each year to help the nation\u2019s students and families meet the costs of  postsecondary education.  In the past, this assistance has primarily been  provided through student grant and loan programs authorized under title IV  of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.  Much of this aid, called  need-based aid, has been provided on the basis of the difference between a  student\u2019s cost of attendance and an estimate of the ability of the student  and the student\u2019s family to pay these costs, called the expected family  contribution. More recently, however, postsecondary assistance has also  been provided through a range of tax preferences, including  postsecondary tax credits, tax deductions, and tax-exempt savings  programs.  For example, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allows eligible tax  filers to reduce their tax liability by receiving, for tax year 2005, up to a  $1,500 Hope tax credit and/or a $2,000 Lifetime Learning tax credit for  tuition and course-related fees paid.  Furthermore, the 2001 Economic  Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act created a new tax deduction for  tuition expenses, which eligible tax filers may use to deduct, in tax year  2005, up to $4,000 from their taxable income for tuition and course-related  fees paid.", "Providing federal financial assistance in these varied ways presents  students and their families with an array of tools that may help them pay  postsecondary education expenses. There is concern, however, that the  postsecondary tax preferences create opportunities that are difficult for  families to understand and use correctly.  Additionally, Congress has been  provided with little evidence concerning the effectiveness of assistance  provided under title IV or through tax preferences, such as whether student  assistance increases the rate at which students enroll in postsecondary  education or whether assistance increases the likelihood that students will  either earn a degree or continue their education (often referred to as  persistence).", "You asked us to explain how the federal government assists students and  families in meeting the costs of postsecondary education, and to examine  the opportunities and challenges associated with these policies.  To address  your interests, we answered the following questions: (1) How does title IV  grant and loan assistance compare with that provided through the tax  code? (2) To what extent are tax filers effectively using the opportunities  presented by postsecondary tax preferences? (3) What is known about the  effectiveness of federal assistance in promoting college attendance,  providing students with a wider range of choices among postsecondary  institutions, or encouraging students to persist in their studies?", "To compare title IV federal grant and loan assistance with that provided  through the tax code, we used Department of Education (Education) and  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, as well as agency documents and  statutory provisions describing federal student financial assistance  programs and tax preferences related to student financial assistance for  postsecondary education. For the purpose of this review, we focused on  federal grant and loan programs or tax preferences that served 500,000 or  more students and families. We also used two data sets, the 2003-2004  National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) from Education and  IRS\u2019s 2002 Statistics of Income (SOI) individual tax file. We analyzed SOI  data to determine, among other things, whether tax filers made effective  use of the Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits and the tuition  deduction.  However, information required to analyze whether tax filers  made effective use of the tax credits and deduction was not consistently  available for tax filers included in the SOI data.  Educational institutions  must provide IRS and students with Forms 1098-T, which document  students\u2019 enrollment status at the institution.  Educational institutions may  also, but are not required to, report on students\u2019 qualified tuition and  related expenses, scholarships, and grants.  Consequently, our analysis of  SOI data for this purpose was limited to the approximately 1.8 million tax  filers for whom Forms 1098-T reported such information.  We were unable  to determine whether these tax filers were representative of the  approximately 12.4 million tax filers for whom such information was  unavailable.  To address issues of complexity as students and families use  postsecondary tax preferences, we reviewed relevant statutes, regulations,  and IRS documents, government reports, and academic research. We  assessed the reliability of NPSAS and SOI data sets in light of our data  reliability standards and found them to be useful for the purpose of this  review. Details of our data reliability assessment and other aspects of our  scope and methodology can be found in appendix I. To learn what is known  about the effectiveness of federal grant and loan programs and tax  preferences, we reviewed the academic literature on financial aid and  education-related tax preferences.

While Pell Grants reduce the price paid by the student, student loans help  to finance the remaining costs and are to be repaid according to varying  terms. Stafford loans may be either subsidized or unsubsidized.  The  federal government pays the interest cost on subsidized loans while the  student is in school, and during a 6-month period known as the grace  period, after the student leaves school. For unsubsidized loans, students  are responsible for all interest costs.  Stafford and PLUS loans are  provided to students through both the Federal Family Education Loan  Program (FFELP) and the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program (FDLP).   The federal government's role in financing and administering these two  loan programs differs significantly.  Under FFELP, private lenders, such as  banks, provide loan capital and make loans, and the federal government  guarantees FFELP lenders a minimum yield on the loans they make and  repayment if borrowers default. Under FDLP, federal funds are used as loan  capital and loans are provided through participating schools.  The  Department of Education and its private-sector contractors jointly  administer the program.  Title IV also authorizes programs funded by the  federal government and administered by participating higher education  institutions, including the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant  (SEOG), Perkins loans, and federal work-study aid, collectively known as  campus-based aid.", "To receive title IV aid, students (along with parents, in the case of  dependent students) must complete a Free Application for Federal Student  Aid (FAFSA) form.  Information from the FAFSA, particularly income and  asset information, is used to determine the amount of money\u2014called the  expected family contribution (EFC)\u2014that the student and/or family is  expected to contribute to the student\u2019s education.  Statutory definitions  establish the criteria that students must meet to be considered independent  of their parents for the purpose of financial aid, and statutory formulas  establish the share of income and assets that are expected to be available  for the student\u2019s education.  Once the EFC is established, it is compared  with the cost of attendance at the institution chosen by the student.  The  cost of attendance comprises tuition and fees; room and board; books and  supplies; transportation; miscellaneous personal expenses; and, for some  students, additional expenses.  If the EFC is greater than the cost of  attendance, the student is not considered to have financial need, according  to the federal aid methodology.  If the cost of attendance is greater than the  EFC, then the student is considered to have financial need.  Title IV  assistance that is made on the basis of the calculated need of aid applicants  is called need-based aid.  Key characteristics of title IV programs are  summarized in table 1, below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Preferences", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 1990s, virtually all major federal initiatives to assist students  with the costs of postsecondary education were provided through grant  and loan programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act.   Since the 1990s, however, federal initiatives to assist families and students  in paying for postsecondary education have largely been implemented  through the federal tax code.  The federal tax code now contains a range of  tax preferences that may be used to assist students and families in saving  for, paying, or repaying the costs of postsecondary education.  These tax  preferences include credits and deductions, both of which allow tax filers  to use qualified higher education expenses to reduce their federal income  tax liability. The tax credits reduce the tax filers\u2019 income tax liability on a  dollar-for-dollar basis but are not refundable. Tax deductions permit  qualified higher education expenses to be subtracted from income that  would otherwise be taxable. To benefit from a higher education tax credit  or tuition deduction, a tax filer must use tax form 1040 or 1040A, have an  adjusted gross income below the provisions\u2019 statutorily specified income  limits, and have a positive tax liability after other deductions and credits  are calculated, among other requirements.", "Tax preferences also include tax-exempt savings vehicles.  Section 529 of  the tax code makes tax free the investment income from qualified tuition  programs.  There are two types of qualified tuition programs: savings  programs established by states, and prepaid tuition programs established  either by states or by one or more eligible educational institutions.  Another tax-exempt savings vehicle is the Coverdell Education Savings  Account.  Tax penalties apply to both 529 programs and Coverdell savings  accounts if the funds are not used for allowable education expenses.  Key  features of these and other education-related tax preferences are described  below, in table 2.", "Our review of tax preferences did not include exclusions from income,  which permit certain types of education-related income to be excluded  from the calculation of adjusted gross income on which taxes are based.

From 1981 through 1995 no new federal  grant or loan-financing vehicles were adopted; however, new financing  options, such as loan consolidation, and new delivery systems, such as  direct student lending, were introduced for student loan programs.  Since  1995, on the other hand, every federal initiative for the financing of  postsecondary education has been implemented through the federal tax  code, primarily through the Tax Relief Act of 1997 and the Economic  Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.  By 2002 the number of  tax filers claiming a tax credit or tuition deduction was broadly comparable  to the number of students aided through title IV programs: about 8.4 million  students received a title IV grant and/or loan, and about 9.6 million tax  filers filed returns claiming a Hope tax credit, Lifetime Learning tax credit,  or tuition deduction.

Title IV grant  and loan programs primarily provide aid to students and families while  students are in college, whereas tax preferences help both during the  college years and before and after college by assisting with saving for or  repaying college costs.  Additionally, although student aid programs and  tax preferences assist students and families across a wide range of income  levels, some title IV programs, such as the Pell Grant and subsidized  Stafford student loan programs, provide much of their financial assistance  to students and families whose incomes are lower, on average, than  students who receive unsubsidized Stafford loans, tax deductions, or make  use of tax-exempt saving vehicles.

Eligibility for title IV programs is generally established at the time  of enrollment and prior to each subsequent school year thereafter, and title  IV programs generally provide benefits to students while they are in school.  Education-related tax preferences reach widely across the life span. They  encourage saving for college, especially among families with dependent  children through tax-exempt saving; assist enrolled students and their  families in meeting the current costs of postsecondary education through  credits and a tuition deduction; and assist students and families repaying  the costs of past postsecondary education by allowing tax filers to claim a  deduction for student loan interest paid.  Thus, tax filers must determine  their eligibility for these preferences every year that contributions are  made to Coverdell Education Savings Accounts or every year that a former  student claims a student loan interest deduction. Table 3 shows a  comparison of the timing of title IV assistance and the assistance provided  through various tax preferences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiaries of Title IV Programs and Tax Preferences Differ", "paragraphs": ["While title IV programs and tax preferences assist many students and  families, a variety of program and tax rules affect students\u2019 and families\u2019  eligibility for such assistance.

Pell Grant awards are calculated by subtracting  the student\u2019s expected family contribution (EFC) from the maximum Pell  Grant award ($4,050 in academic year 2004-2005), or the student\u2019s cost of  attendance, whichever is less.  Because the expected family contribution is  closely linked to family income and circumstances (such as the size of the  family and the number of dependents in school), and modest EFCs are  required for Pell eligibility, Pell awards are received primarily by families  with modest incomes.  The maximum subsidized Stafford loan that a  student may obtain is based upon his or her cost of attendance, minus the  expected family contribution and the estimated financial assistance that  the student will receive. For a given cost of attendance, therefore, the  amount of a subsidized Stafford loan increases as EFC decreases.  In  contrast, the maximum unsubsidized Stafford loan amount is calculated  without direct consideration of financial need: students may borrow up to  their cost of attendance, minus the estimated financial assistance they will  receive.", "The different award rules for Pell Grants and subsidized and unsubsidized  Stafford loans result in different patterns of program participation among  students of different incomes, and different distributions of dollar support  among students.  As table 4 shows, 92 percent of Pell financial support in  2003-2004 was provided to dependent students whose family incomes were  $40,000 or below, and the 38 percent of Pell recipients in the lowest income  category ($20,000 or below) received a higher share (48 percent) of Pell  financial support.  With respect to subsidized Stafford loans, 67 percent of  recipients had family incomes of $60,000 or less and received a  proportional share of total subsidized loan volume.  In contrast, 65 percent  of unsubsidized Stafford loan recipients had family incomes above $60,000  and received 69 percent of total unsubsidized loan volume.", "Because independent students generally have lower incomes and  accumulated savings than dependent students and their families, patterns  of program participation and dollar distribution differ.  Participation of  independent students in Pell, subsidized Stafford, and unsubsidized  Stafford loan programs is heavily concentrated among those with incomes  of $40,000 or less: from 74 percent (unsubsidized Stafford) to 95 percent  (Pell) of program participants have incomes below this level.  As shown in  table 5, the distribution of award dollars follows a nearly identical pattern.", "Many education-related tax preferences have both de facto lower limits  created by the need to have a positive tax liability in order to obtain their  benefit and income ceilings on who may use them.  For example, the Hope  and Lifetime Learning tax credits require that tax filers have a positive tax  liability to use them and income-related phase-out provisions in 2004 that  begin at $42,000 and $85,000 for single and joint filers, respectively.  The  income-related phase-out provision for the tuition deduction, in  comparison, begins in 2004 at $65,000 and $130,000 for single and joint  filers, respectively. As a result, the majority of tax filers claiming the Hope  and Lifetime Learning tax credits in 2002 had incomes under $40,000.   Among those who claimed the tuition deduction, in contrast, 38 percent of  tax filers had incomes in this range, while 62 percent had incomes over  $40,000.

Families with higher than average incomes are  more likely to use tax-exempt savings opportunities for a range of reasons,  including, among others, that (1) these families hold greater assets to invest  in these vehicles; (2) these families have a higher marginal tax rate, and  thus benefit the most from the use of these vehicles; and (3) higher-income  families may gain a reduction in tax liability even if withdrawals are not  used for postsecondary expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Students and Families Have More Responsibility for Obtaining Benefits of Tax Preferences in Comparison to Title IV Aid", "paragraphs": ["The federal government and postsecondary institutions have significant  responsibilities in assisting students and families in obtaining assistance  provided under title IV programs but only minor roles with respect to tax  filers\u2019 use of education-related tax preferences.

For  example, while Coverdell Education Savings Accounts and section 529  Qualified Tuition Programs permit tax filers to include tuition, fees, books,  supplies, and equipment required for enrollment as part of their qualified  educational expenses, higher education tax credits permit only tuition and  fees required for enrollment to be counted as qualified higher education  expenses.

The  use of multiple education-related tax preferences is coordinated through  rules that prohibit the application of the same qualified higher education  expenses for the same student to more than one education-related tax  preference, sometimes referred to as \u201canti-double-dipping rules.\u201d  These  rules are important because they prevent tax filers from underreporting  their tax liability.  Nonetheless, anti-double-dipping rules are potentially  difficult for tax filers to understand and apply, and misunderstanding them  may have consequences for a filer\u2019s tax liability.", "Consider, for example, how the use of college savings programs and the  tuition deduction is affected by these rules. To calculate whether a  distribution from a college savings program is taxable, a tax filer must  determine if the total distributions for the tax year are more or less than the  total qualified educational expenses reduced by any tax-free educational  assistance, i.e., their adjusted qualified education expenses (AQEE). After  subtracting tax-free assistance from qualified educational expenses to  arrive at the AQEE, tax filers multiply total distributed earnings by the  fraction (AQEE / total amount distributed during the year).  If parents of a  dependent student paid $6,500 in qualified education expenses from a  $3,000 tax-free scholarship and a $3,600 distribution from a tuition savings  program, they would have $3,500 in AQEE.  If $1,200 of the distribution  consisted of earnings, then $1,200 x ($3,500 AQEE / $3,600 distribution)  would result in $1,167 of the earnings being tax-free, while $33 would be  taxable.  However, if the same tax filer had also claimed a tuition  deduction, anti-double-dipping rules would require the tax filer to subtract  the expenses taken into account in figuring the tuition deduction from  AQEE.  If $2,000 in expenses had been used toward the tuition deduction,  then the taxable distribution from the section 529 savings program would  rise to $700.  For families such as these, anti-double-dipping rules increase  the computational complexity they face and may result in unanticipated tax  liabilities associated with the use of section 529 savings programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interaction between Tax Preferences and Student Financial Aid", "paragraphs": ["Because the use of federal higher education tax preferences may affect a  student\u2019s eligibility for title IV federal student assistance\u2014and the receipt  of title IV federal student assistance may affect a student\u2019s ability to use  federal higher education tax preferences\u2014many students and families  must develop knowledge and skill sufficient to understand the relationship  between the two. For example, the Internal Revenue Code requires tax  filers to reduce the qualified higher education expenses they apply toward  higher education tax credits by the amount of nontaxable aid they receive,  including federal aid such as a Pell Grant.  As a result, receiving a Pell  Grant has the potential to reduce the amount of Hope or Lifetime Learning  tax credit for which a filer is eligible.  More generally, tax filers must take  care to reduce their qualified higher education expenses by the amount of  all nontaxable assistance that they receive\u2014federal and nonfederal\u2014 applying only adjusted qualified higher education expenses toward credits,  deductions, and distributions from tax-exempt savings vehicles.", "While some federal higher education tax preferences, such as tax credits,  have no effect on one\u2019s eligibility for title IV federal student assistance,  others do: like other family savings, assets held in tax-exempt savings  vehicles, such as a Coverdell Education Savings Account or a section 529  savings account, are included in the calculation of the expected family  contribution.

For families close to the  income limit for eligibility for need-based aid, a $1,000 pretax investment in  a Coverdell Educational Savings Account yielded a simulated final return  (net of income taxation and foregone student aid) of -$1,194, leaving the  family worse off than if they had not saved, or if they had saved using a  regular savings account (+$490) or a traditional individual retirement  account (+$844).  In response to recommendations contained in our 2002  report on student aid, the Department of Education modified its guidance  concerning federal financial aid methodology, announcing that Coverdell  assets would be treated as assets of the parent, rather than the student\u2014 and, therefore, result in the same reduction in need-based aid as 529  savings program assets.

Research on Pell Grants shows that they generally have little or no  impact on attendance, with the exception of one study that found Pell  Grants to have increased attendance for students from 22 to 35 years of  age.  The study attributed the program\u2019s impact to the fact that older  students generally attend less-expensive institutions where Pell Grants  represent a larger share of the cost of college than the same size grants  provided to students in general.  The study also suggests that the limited  impact of Pell Grants on attendance in general may be due to the fact that  institutional aid awards may decrease at the same time as Pell Grant  awards increase, creating a substitution effect that could diminish the  impact of Pell Grants on attendance.  According to the study, this occurs  less often for older students because they tend to go to institutions that  have less institutional aid for which Pell Grant awards might substitute.", "Some research has also found that Pell Grants, like other grant programs,  appear to increase students\u2019 persistence toward completing their studies.", "Student loans have been found to modestly increase college attendance,  persistence, and choice, but there are various limitations to consider.  Of  the three studies examining the effect of borrowing on college attendance,  only one focuses on lower-income students. The study estimates that a  $1,000 increase (in 1977 dollars) resulted in a 4.3 percentage point increase  in college enrollment among dependent students with family incomes  below $15,000.  However, given long-term changes in lending markets,  returns to schooling, and other conditions, students\u2019 behavioral responses  to equivalent changes in loan amounts may be different today from what  they were in 1977.  Findings about the impact of loans on persistence and  choice are each based on only one study, and focus only on middle-income  students.", "We found one study concerning how the Hope and Lifetime Learning tax  credits affect college attendance.  The study found the credits to have no  effect on college attendance.  This may be because the students who  receive these credits are likely to attend college anyway.   The author  acknowledges several limitations of the study.  For example, the study uses  income categories\u2014as opposed to actual income\u2014thereby introducing  measurement error and attenuating the estimated effects of the credits on  attendance.  We also note that the study measured eligibility for the credits,  rather than the receipt of tax credits.  Measuring eligibility rather than the  receipt of credits tends to underestimate the effect of credits on attendance  because many tax filers who appear to be eligible for the credits do not  claim them. This study did not examine whether federal student tax  credits affect persistence or choice.", "In addition to the research into the federal tax, grant, and loan programs  described above, a large body of research estimates the effects of both  tuition changes and non-title IV financial aid programs on postsecondary  attendance.  These studies all found either an inverse relationship  between the cost of tuition and level of enrollment or that financial  assistance increased enrollment.  One survey of this work concludes that  a $1,000 reduction in net costs (in 2001 dollars) would result in a 3 to 6  percent increase in college enrollment rates.  Federal Pell Grants and  postsecondary tax credits do not show similar effects in the studies we  examined.  Substitution effects caused by offsetting reductions in  nonfederal aid may diminish the enrollment effect of Pell awards.  Also, the  impact of tax credits on enrollment may be limited by the fact that tax filers  receive higher education tax credits the year following tuition outlays.   Program design and information may also account for some of these  differences: tuition information and many nonfederal aid benefits are  known when a person is choosing whether or not to attend college;  however, students may not be aware of tax credits and Pell Grants or their  effects on price until after they have already decided to go to college.", "While federal grants, student loans, and tax credits were created to result in  beneficial consequences, such as increasing college attendance, they have  also been found to result in the raising of tuition by institutions in some  circumstances.  One potential explanation is that institutions raise tuition  because federal aid increases the amount students are able to pay.   Alternatively, federal aid may increase the demand for education, and with  no offsetting factors, this drives the price of tuition up."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodological Challenges Hinder Research", "paragraphs": ["Gaps in the research-based evidence of federal postsecondary program  effectiveness may be due, in part, to data and methodological challenges  that have proven difficult to overcome. The relative newness of most of the  tax preferences also presents challenges because relevant data are just  now becoming available.  Additionally, to analyze the tax programs, actual  tax return data are preferred to indirect or processed data, but researchers  are often limited to publicly available data containing self-reported  information on income because of tax data confidentiality protections.", "Methodological challenges add to the difficulty of estimating the effects of  these programs.  In general, researchers can reliably identify the behavioral  effects of a program when one factor changes while all others remain  unchanged.  For example, if no other factors change, a researcher could  identify the impact of postsecondary tax credits on enrollment by  comparing enrollment rates before and after the tax credits are enacted.   Typically, however, many factors change simultaneously, either offsetting  or enhancing the effect of the policy intervention being studied.  For  example, tuition rates may rise at the same time that postsecondary tax  credits are introduced, or other sources of postsecondary assistance\u2014such  as federal, state, or institutional grants\u2014may decrease.  These changes  undermine researchers\u2019 ability to reliably isolate the behavioral effects of  the policy under study.  While researchers in some fields address this  problem through the use of experiments, few opportunities exist for  experimentation in the study of postsecondary education finance.   Alternatively, researchers may address this problem through the use of  quasi-experimental research designs, which attempt to approximate the  random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups by  matching participants to nonparticipants having similar characteristics. In  practice, however, data limitations often make this difficult to implement.   To isolate the impact of tax credits on college attendance, for example,  researchers may need to compare credit recipients with nonrecipients who  are similar in a range of ways\u2014including academic preparation, family  income and wealth.

Postsecondary tax preferences are widely thought to present challenges of  complexity to students and families.  As we have shown, tax filers appear  to have some difficulty in making fully effective use of some postsecondary  tax preferences now in the tax code.  Also, although millions of tax filers  are receiving billions of dollars in assistance with postsecondary costs  through both title IV programs and tax preferences, little is known about  the effectiveness of any of these forms of assistance in part because of data  and methodological issues.

To do this analysis we used IRS\u2019s SOI sample of  individual tax returns for tax year 2002 and all Form 1098-T information  returns for tax filers in the sample.

Because a person cannot claim the tuition deduction or the  Hope or Lifetime Learning credits if he or she is claimed as a dependent on  someone else's tax return, we excluded dependent tax returns in the SOI  sample from our analysis.  We also excluded the tax returns of tax filers  that received a Form 1098-T with no information concerning students\u2019  educational expenses because we could not analyze the tax returns without  these data.  This included the tax returns of individuals who received an  education tax credit or tuition deduction but did not receive a Form 1098-T.   These limitations excluded 87 percent of the returns in the sample.", "We considered different explanations for why those tax filers with  education expenses did not claim an education tax credit or tuition  deduction.
