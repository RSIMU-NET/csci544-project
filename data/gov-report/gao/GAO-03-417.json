As of December 31, 2002, the agency had completed most of its 3,047 planned personnel reductions in full-time positions. It accomplished this primarily by achieving efficiencies or eliminating vacant positions in the stores. Only 122 employees have been separated and 341 retired as a result of the personnel cutbacks. A major focus of DeCA's personnel reductions, as outlined in its strategic plan, was to reshape the workforce and develop a more efficient organization. We found that commissaries are making greater use of part-time employees because of the reductions. This has allowed some stores to increase their operating hours to better meet customer needs. It has also given store managers more flexibility in meeting workload fluctuations. However, DeCA's strategic plan does not include specific goals for achieving a certain full-time/part-time workforce mix in stores. As a result, the planned percentage of part-time positions varies widely by store. A recent customer satisfaction survey showed that commissary patrons expressed high satisfaction with their overall shopping experience, as well as with such key indicators as time waiting in line and convenient hours. However, the managers of the smaller commissaries reported concerns over balancing workload and maintaining store operations. We found that the Commissary Customer Satisfaction Survey methodology is reasonable. However, some improvements in the analysis of survey data could ensure that the findings are more complete and consistent. Such changes could include adjusting survey results for the volume of sales at individual stores or for the number of shoppers who refuse to fill out the questionnaire. Furthermore, the current survey does not collect information on the number of, and reasons why, potential customers do not shop at their local commissaries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2001, the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), which operates  276 stores in the United States and abroad for military personnel and  retirees, issued a strategic plan that outlined initiatives to reduce its unit  operating costs by 7 percent by fiscal year 2004. A major focus of the unit  cost reduction objective was to reshape the workforce by reducing  full-time positions and developing a more efficient organization. This plan  called for the elimination of over 3,000 full-time positions\u2014about 2,700  in stores through efficiencies, closures, and contracting out some  functions and about 350 through efficiencies in the regional offices and  headquarters. The agency expects these actions to save about $82 million  without any loss of service to its customers. As a result of these savings,  DeCA reduced its fiscal year 2003 budget request.", "In response to a requirement in the Committee on Armed Services House  of Representatives\u2019 report accompanying the Bob Stump National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, we reviewed DeCA\u2019s plan to reduce  personnel.

A  Commissary Operating Board, which is comprised of representatives  from each of the military services, has day-to-day operational oversight  responsibilities for DeCA. The Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel  and Readiness) exercises overall supervision of the commissary system.  DeCA operates four regional offices that oversee the management of its  commissaries. Commissaries are located in 46 states and 14 foreign  countries. As of November 7, 2002, the agency had 276 stores and more  than 16,000 employees under its purview. Its annual sales in fiscal year  2002 amounted to about $5 billion.", "In meeting its mission of providing groceries at a savings to the customer,  in the most efficient and effective manner possible, DeCA strives to  provide the lowest cost possible, charging patrons only for the cost of  goods plus a 5-percent surcharge. DeCA receives about $1 billion in direct  appropriations from Congress for its annual operating costs. These funds  pay for employees\u2019 salaries, transportation, some above-store-level  information technology, and other expenses. DeCA also operates a resale  stock fund for the purchase and sale of products. To the extent that  savings in operating costs occur, they reduce the need for appropriated  funds. The savings in store operating costs do not have an effect on the  cost of merchandise sold to customers.", "In January 2001, DeCA issued its current strategic plan. This plan included  objectives to reduce unit operating costs and reshape the workforce while  maintaining or improving customer service and satisfaction. A major focus  of the unit cost reduction objective was to reduce positions as well as  streamline operations and develop a more efficient organization. To  reshape the workforce, DeCA planned to determine the appropriate mix  of skills and expertise and the appropriate level of part-time employees  to carry out the reductions to reach a more efficient organization.", "DeCA conducts a biannual Commissary Customer Service Survey to  assess customer views of products and services. A team appointed by  each store director administers the survey. Customers are systematically  selected while waiting in checkout lines. A predetermined number of  questionnaires are collected during three periods (morning, midday, and  evening) each day for 10 consecutive days during May and November each  year. The survey questions are multiple choice with space available for  written comments. See appendix I for a copy of the questionnaire. The  completed forms are mailed to DeCA headquarters for analysis, and  customer service scores are calculated for DeCA overall and for each  region and store."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personnel Reductions Have Not Hampered Most Commissaries\u2019 Store Operations or Customer Satisfaction", "paragraphs": ["Despite the workforce reductions, store operations and customer service  have been maintained at the same level, and in some cases improved.  DeCA has used various measures to eliminate 2,602 full-time positions, or  85 percent of the planned reductions as of December 31, 2002; very few  employees have been separated from the agency. While downsizing and  reshaping were occurring, regional officials stated that they encouraged  store directors to use part-time positions to maintain store operations.  DeCA officials stated the use of part-time employees has enabled store  directors to better manage workload fluctuations, expand hours of  operation, and thereby improve customer service.

As table 2 indicates, most of the  planned store-level reductions (51 percent) are being achieved by  implementing efficiency measures within stores. Efficiencies are being  derived by implementing new staffing standards for each department  within a store based on sales volume and other measures. The remaining  reductions are accomplished by other methods, including eliminating  vacant positions, closing stores, and contracting out some functions.", "A breakdown of completed and planned workforce reductions at the store  level are as follows:    1,113 positions were eliminated by implementing the new store staffing  standards based on sales volume. The remaining 261 efficiency reductions  are planned in fiscal year 2003.    812 vacant positions were eliminated. A DeCA official stated that vacant  positions existed because stores had historically been funded at only  90 percent of their required staffing. The elimination of these positions  resulted in no personnel losses and produced no savings.    304 positions were eliminated as a result of 15 store closings. Closings can  stem from Base Realignment and Closure recommendations or Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) approval of DeCA\u2019s  recommendations from internal assessments. An additional 49 positions  will be eliminated at two stores scheduled to close in fiscal year 2003.    87 positions were eliminated by contracting out such store functions as  receiving, handling, and stocking. An additional 30 positions at various  stores will be eliminated in this way in fiscal year 2003. The remaining  26 planned reductions were canceled to provide positions for a new  computer-aided ordering function.", "Although DeCA had eliminated most of the planned 2,690 positions from  its stores by the end of 2002, only 122 store employees were separated  from the agency by a reduction in force and an additional 341 employees  retired.

For  example, the number of part-time employees rose by 8 percent in stores in  the Midwest region between April 2001 and October 2002. Store directors  told us that using part-time employees improved their ability to manage  fluctuations in store workloads more effectively. For example, a store  director said that part-time employees were used during weekends and  holidays to save money. Another store director pointed out that part-time  employees are available to work if there is work to do in a department or  cover a peak shopping period, but they can be sent home if the work is  completed. In addition, some store directors told us that a greater use  of part-time workers has allowed them to increase their store operating  hours. We found that 30 stores have increased their hours of operation by  relying more heavily on part-time employees. For example, one store with  a part-time workforce of nearly 60 percent increased its operating hours  by 6 hours a week.", "In addition, current individual store plans call for a growth in the number  of part-time positions in stores as of the end of fiscal year 2003. The  Eastern and Midwest regions estimate that about 56 percent of their store  positions will be part-time, and the Western Pacific region estimates  46 percent of its store positions will be part-time. Table 3 shows the range  in the percentage of part-time positions that stores within each sales band  plan to employ.", "As table 3 shows, the planned percentage of part-time positions varies  widely by individual store and region. For example, one Eastern region  store expects to convert all of its store positions to part time while another  store in the Western Pacific region plans to have only 7 percent of its  workforce as part time. While some stores are close to the 75 to 80 percent  industry average for part-time positions in commercial grocery stores,  the overall regional average of part-time positions indicates that there  are opportunities to achieve more efficiencies through greater use of  part-time positions.", "Store directors have the flexibility of changing the mix of full-time and  part-time positions in their stores. Some store directors told us they used  part-time positions primarily to meet their budget goals. One store director  said that part-time positions were created to meet the store\u2019s budget and  that there were no plans to increase part-time positions in the store once  the needed reductions were made. However, nearly all of the store  directors we interviewed said that they could operate their stores with  more part-time positions rather than full-time positions.

Some store directors said they typically  have to work more than 40 hours a week to perform all these duties.  Eighty-seven percent of these 15 band 1 stores are open more than  40 hours a week. Because DeCA policy requires that a manager be present  in the store when it is open for customers, when the second manager or  an employee is absent, the on-duty manager has to carry his/her own  workload and administrative functions, as well as the load of the absent  manager or employee, typically working over the usual 40-hour work  week.
