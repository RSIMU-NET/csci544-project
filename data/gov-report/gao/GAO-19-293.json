The policies fully reflect two of the leading practices because they require articulating a methodology for evaluating pilot performance and documenting lessons learned. The policies do not fully reflect the other three practices because they do not require: (1) linking pilot objectives to identified performance measures; (2) documenting conclusions based on pilot results; or (3) communicating with key external stakeholders, as appropriate. These policy gaps limit the extent to which USPS can ensure that it is making good resource allocation decisions based on pilot experiences. For example, GAO found that USPS did not document its conclusions based on the results of its pilots of same-day delivery, grocery delivery, and Informed Delivery. Documenting conclusions can be especially important when USPS continues to offer the product or service after the pilot has concluded, even though the pilot did not achieve all of its objectives, as was the case with these three innovations. Further, while USPS's policies require documenting lessons learned from its pilots, USPS did not do so for some pilots GAO reviewed.

According to the pilot proposal, this innovation was intended to  generate revenue for USPS by allowing it to leverage its existing  delivery infrastructure to capture part of the growing e-commerce  market. To determine the potential scalability of same-day delivery,  USPS first tested its operational feasibility and potential demand in  several major metropolitan areas, including San Francisco, New York,  and Phoenix. During the pilot, USPS delivered photos, chocolates,  water, electronics, and other goods from 38 participating mailers to  consumers in these areas. At the pilot\u2019s conclusion, USPS decided to  continue offering same-day delivery to interested participating mailers  under Priority Mail contracts.", "Grocery Delivery: From November 2014 to October 2017, USPS  piloted a grocery delivery product in nine selected metropolitan  areas. According to USPS, the innovation was intended to generate  additional revenue by taking advantage of the growing market for  grocery delivery. To test the innovation\u2019s operational feasibility, USPS  required the pilot\u2019s sole participating mailer to bring totes containing  groceries and other prepackaged goods ordered by customers directly  to post offices (see fig. 4). USPS was then responsible for sorting the  totes and delivering them to customers. According to its proposal for  this pilot, USPS expected grocery delivery to provide a substantial  revenue generation opportunity. At the pilot\u2019s conclusion, like same- day delivery, USPS decided to continue offering grocery delivery with  the participating mailer under a Parcel Select contract.", "Informed Delivery: From spring 2014 through July 2016, USPS piloted  a notification service called Informed Delivery in Northern Virginia and  New York. According to USPS, this innovation is intended to bridge  the gap between the physical and digital worlds by, for example,  emailing customers with a scanned image of the exterior address side  of letter-sized mail they should receive later that day (see fig. 5).  Informed Delivery can also allow mailers to conduct marketing  campaigns by integrating other elements\u2014such as hyperlinks to  mailers\u2019 websites\u2014into the email and other notifications that  customers receive. In its proposal to pilot Informed Delivery, USPS  stated the pilot was intended to help USPS understand the service\u2019s  business opportunity and increase the certainty of its potential  benefits, which included retaining mail volume and generating new  revenue from large advertisers. In addition, the pilot aimed to  generate \u201cstatistically valid data\u201d on how subscribers respond to  marketing campaigns that mailers conduct. According to USPS, more  than 70,000 customers were actively using the service at the pilot\u2019s  conclusion. In July 2016, USPS decided to end the pilot and launch  the service nationally.

The purpose of  the pilot is to assess the performance and use of the lockers and to  assess their performance. In October 2013, USPS began pre-testing  the technical performance of 10 prototype keyless parcel locker units  at post offices in New York City and Northern Virginia. Following this  pre-test, in February 2015, USPS approved the installation of 50  made-to-order locker units in selected post offices across the country.

Further, we found that USPS had not  consistently followed its policies to document lessons learned at the  conclusion of each pilot, as discussed below.", "Senior USPS officials acknowledged that gaps exist in its policies for pilot  design and evaluation because they were not developed by USPS to fully  reflect all leading practices. These policy gaps limit the extent to which  USPS can ensure that it is making good resource allocation decisions  based on pilot experiences. Below we further discuss the extent to which  USPS\u2019s policies reflect the five leading pilot practices we identified as well  as how USPS applied these leading practices among the four piloted  innovations that we reviewed.", "Establish appropriate and measurable objectives linked with identified  performance measures: We found USPS\u2019s policies do not fully reflect this  leading practice. While USPS policies require that project managers  establish pilot objectives and performance measures, they do not require  that each objective be linked with identified performance measures. As a  result, some pilots may have objectives without an associated  performance measure.", "For example, although USPS established both objectives and  performance measures for each of the four innovations we selected for  review, it did not consistently link each established objective to  performance measures. USPS\u2019s proposal to pilot same-day delivery, for  example, had objectives of generating new revenue and improving  customers\u2019 experience. However, while the proposal included  performance measures associated with generating new revenue\u2014i.e.,  package volume, gross revenue, and net revenue\u2014it did not identify and  link any performance measures with its objective of improving customer  experience. Similarly, USPS\u2019s proposal to pilot keyless parcel lockers  included improving customers\u2019 experience as one of its objectives.  However, while the proposal included a variety of performance  measures\u2014reduction in the number of missed deliveries to post office  boxes, locker rate utilization, and on-time locker installation\u2014it did not  identify and link any performance measures with its improving customers\u2019  experience objective. Absent such measures, USPS may not know  whether customers have experienced an improvement using keyless  parcel lockers compared to using manual, keyed parcel lockers. Linking  all objectives to performance measures could help ensure that USPS has  the performance information to assess the extent to which a pilot has  achieved all of its objectives.", "USPS officials told us that it can be difficult to measure performance for  some objectives related to customer experience. While measuring  customers\u2019 experience can be challenging, it is important to understand  the extent to which a pilot has achieved all of its objectives. Further,  USPS has demonstrated that it can measure improvement in customers\u2019  experience. For example, during its Informed Delivery pilot, USPS  conducted a consumer survey with approximately 5,500 Informed  Delivery subscribers to collect data on consumer adoption and  satisfaction. In the survey, USPS found that over 80 percent were  satisfied or very satisfied with the service. According to USPS officials,  this data helped USPS to measure the pilot\u2019s success in meeting its  objective of improving customers\u2019 experience.", "Articulate a methodology for evaluating pilot performance: We found that  USPS\u2019s policies fully reflect this leading practice because the policies  require officials to develop and communicate a methodology for  evaluating pilot performance. Articulating such a methodology helps  managers to identify the types and sources of performance information  necessary to evaluate the pilot. USPS\u2019s policies require project  managers to work with the pilot\u2019s cross-functional team to develop and  reach consensus on the methodology. These policies also require the  project manager and cross-functional team to identify data needs, data  sources, and how the data will be evaluated.", "For the four innovations we reviewed, we found that USPS articulated a  methodology for evaluating the pilot\u2019s performance. For example, for the  Informed Delivery pilot, USPS identified its customer registration system  as the method for tracking progress toward performance measures  related to the number of Informed Delivery subscribers. Similarly, in its  proposal to pilot keyless parcel lockers, USPS identified its central parcel  locker monitoring system as a method of tracking progress toward  performance measures related to utilization of keyless parcel lockers.", "Evaluate pilot performance and identify and document lessons learned:  We found that USPS\u2019s policies fully reflect this leading practice, but USPS  did not consistently follow its policy that requires documenting lessons  learned. Specifically, the policies require project managers to evaluate  performance and document lessons learned at the conclusion of each  pilot. Doing so can enable USPS to identify information needed to make  conclusions about the pilot\u2019s scalability and ensures that such information  will be accessible to inform future related efforts. However, among the  key innovations we selected for review USPS had not consistently  documented lessons learned (see table 2).", "USPS officials told us that they discussed lessons learned during ongoing  monitoring of pilot performance for these innovations, but had only  documented lessons learned for its Informed Delivery pilot. Specifically,  USPS identified lessons learned in its July 2016 proposal to launch its  Informed Delivery service nationally. In this proposal, we found that USPS  identified some lessons learned about the pilot related to user satisfaction  and adoption rates. USPS officials told us that this information helped to  inform USPS\u2019s decision to launch the service nationally. However, USPS  officials acknowledged that USPS did not document lessons learned for  the other two concluded pilots that we selected for review (same-day  delivery and grocery delivery).", "Senior USPS officials told us that USPS had not consistently documented  lessons learned at the conclusion of pilots across the 24 key innovations  because it had not developed tools, such as a template, or training that  could help ensure such consistency. Without consistently documenting  lessons learned for all of its pilots, USPS risks losing information  garnered during pilot implementation that could be relevant to future  innovation efforts. Doing so can be particularly important because,  according to a senior USPS official, officials responsible for pilot projects  sometimes retire or leave USPS for employment elsewhere, creating a  gap in knowledge of pilot experiences. Standards for internal control  underscore the importance of maintaining documentation in order to  retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having knowledge  limited to a few personnel.", "Draw and document conclusions about scalability based on pilot results:  USPS\u2019s policies do not fully reflect this leading practice. These policies  require that project managers draw conclusions based on the results and  lessons learned from the pilot. According to USPS officials, conclusions  may include determining scalability\u2014i.e., whether, how, and when to  integrate pilot activities into overall efforts. However, USPS\u2019s policies do  not specifically require that officials document these conclusions.  Documenting conclusions about scalability based on pilot results helps to  ensure retention of organizational knowledge related to the pilot that may  inform future decisions.", "Among the three innovations that we selected for review for which the  pilots had concluded (i.e., same-day delivery, grocery delivery, and  Informed Delivery), USPS officials told us that senior leadership  discussed the results and lessons of the pilots and made determinations  regarding whether, how, and when to launch them more broadly, but that  they did not document these decisions or the rationale for them. By not  documenting conclusions, USPS risks losing information that could affect  the success of future related efforts and that could inform future USPS  leadership of the rationale for maintaining investments in activities upon  which pilots were based.", "Documenting conclusions for innovation pilots can be especially important  in cases in which USPS decides to continue or expand pilot activities  even when the pilots do not meet all of their intended objectives. For  example, USPS\u2019s same-day delivery and grocery delivery pilots had  revenue objectives, along with associated performance measures;  however, neither pilot achieved these objectives. For the same-day  delivery pilot, costs exceeded revenue in 12 of the 13 fiscal year quarters  in which the pilot was conducted, according to data USPS reported to  PRC. Likewise, USPS data indicate it did not reach its annual revenue  target for its grocery delivery pilot. Similarly, USPS\u2019s pilot of Informed  Delivery was intended to generate \u201cstatistically valid data\u201d on how  consumers respond to mailer marketing campaigns. However, according  to a senior USPS official, the pilot did not generate the data as intended,  because no such campaigns were conducted during the pilot.", "As discussed earlier in this report, USPS did not discontinue any of these  three selected innovations when their pilots concluded. Although USPS  may have had good reasons to continue with, or more broadly launch,  these innovations despite the pilots not meeting all of their objectives, the  lack of documentation regarding its reasoning and decisions limits  information relevant to whether USPS is making judicious use of limited  resources.", "Ensure appropriate two-way communication at all stages of the pilot with  key internal and external stakeholders in order to understand and address  their views: USPS\u2019s policies do not fully reflect this leading practice.", "USPS\u2019s policies require the involvement of key internal stakeholders in  pilots. Specifically, USPS\u2019s policies require the involvement of cross- functional teams\u2014which include legal, finance, and other departments\u2014 and varying levels of review during the design and implementation of pilot  proposals. However, USPS\u2019s policies do not address communication with  key external stakeholders. According to USPS officials, some pilot  projects may be confidential or have limited or no direct effect on external  stakeholders and, thus, communication with external stakeholders may  not be appropriate. While external stakeholder communication may not be  appropriate with some pilots, such communication, as appropriate, can  help to ensure that issues critical to the success of a pilot activity are  identified and addressed.", "Among the innovations that we selected for review, USPS officials  explained various steps taken to involve internal stakeholders in the  design and evaluation of the pilots, such as the involvement of cross  functional teams to develop pilot proposals. Further, while USPS\u2019s  policies do not address external stakeholder communication, we found  that USPS employed strategies for some of the innovations we selected  for review to communicate with some external stakeholders\u2014i.e., industry  associations and mailers. For example, a representative of a postal  association told us that USPS shared information and sought input about  its Informed Delivery pilot during a quarterly meeting with industry groups.  Similarly, a mailer we interviewed told us that USPS had shared  information and sought input on the Informed Delivery pilot through direct  outreach with the mailer.", "However, USPS did not consistently employ strategies to communicate  with some key external stakeholders among the innovations that we  selected for review. Specifically, USPS did not design or implement  strategies to obtain feedback from consumers on its pilots for same-day  delivery, grocery delivery, or keyless parcel lockers, despite the fact that  each of these innovations directly affected consumers. In contrast, as  previously discussed, for its Informed Delivery pilot, USPS planned and  conducted a survey to obtain consumer feedback, the results of which  helped USPS project managers support the proposal to expand the  service nationally.
