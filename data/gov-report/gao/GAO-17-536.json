Of those that are offered, they are more common among employers with larger or technical and professional workforces, such as education, consulting, and high-tech, according to studies GAO reviewed (see table). Nine of 16 experts GAO interviewed explained that industries with skilled workers or with labor shortages are motivated to offer phased retirement because their workers are hard to replace.", "Formal phased retirement programs present design and operational challenges for employers, including compliance with provisions and laws related to discrimination, according to publications GAO reviewed and experts and employers GAO interviewed. For example, in one study GAO reviewed, 71 percent of large employers agreed that regulatory complexities and ambiguities involving federal tax and age discrimination laws impact their ability to offer phased retirement programs. Experts and employers said programs that target highly skilled workers, who are often highly paid, could violate rules that allow for favorable tax treatment that generally prohibit qualified pension plans from favoring highly compensated employees. Despite these challenges, most employers GAO interviewed who reported having phased retirement programs found them beneficial. For example, eight of the nine employers GAO interviewed said they were able to address various design and operational challenges and cited program benefits related to worker retention, knowledge transfer, transition into retirement, and workforce planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The retirement of the large baby boomer generation will lead to the  workforce losing much of its knowledge and experience.

These effects could be mitigated, to some  extent, if Americans were encouraged to continue to work at older ages.  According to retirement experts, one option available to accomplish this is  phased retirement. Phased retirement is when workers reduce their  working hours with their current employer in order to transition into  retirement.", "GAO was asked to review the work patterns of older Americans and  examine phased retirement programs. In this report, we examine (1)  recent trends in the labor force participation of older workers, (2) the  extent to which employers have adopted phased retirement programs and  what type of employers offer them, and (3) what challenges and benefits,  if any, exist to the design and operation of phased retirement programs.", "To describe the recent trends in labor force participation of older workers,  we analyzed nationally representative data from 2005 to 2016 in the  Current Population Survey (CPS) and the 2004-2014 Health and  Retirement Study (HRS), two datasets with information about the labor  force participation of older workers. We examined the reliability of these  data by reviewing documentation and conducting selected data checks  and found it sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To inform all sections of  this report, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and  conducted a literature review that included academic studies and industry  surveys and reports as well as relevant articles. We also interviewed  agency officials and 16 experts, such as consultants, representatives of  industry and interest groups, and academics. We identified these experts  through our review of relevant literature and through expert referral.  Finally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with nine employers  who offer or considered offering phased retirement programs. We  selected these employers to represent a variety of employer types by  location, size, and industry.

In contrast to formal programs, informal  phased retirement arrangements are not part of a formal program but are  alternate methods to ease into retirement with the same employer, such  as an ad hoc agreement or retirement followed by a term as a contractor.", "Employer goals for formal phased retirement programs vary, but may  include knowledge retention, skills transfer, workforce planning, and  retirement planning. Employers can use phased retirement as a human  resource tool not only to retain workers with essential skills or knowledge,  but also to provide an incentive for other workers to retire.

The initial monthly benefit amount depends on the worker\u2019s  earnings history and the age at which he or she chooses to begin  receiving benefits, as well as other factors. Social Security pays  unreduced benefits at the full retirement age, which has gradually  increased from 65 (for 1937 and earlier birth cohorts) to 67 (for 1960 and  later birth cohorts). Workers can elect to receive retirement benefits as  early as age 62, but the benefit amount is reduced compared to benefits  at full retirement age. Workers who retire after their full retirement age  receive a benefit increase for each month they delay claiming retirement  benefits, up to age 70.", "A worker may also choose to work and receive Social Security benefits.  However, depending on his or her earnings, those benefits may be  reduced until full retirement age, although any earnings in and after the  month a worker reaches full retirement age will not reduce retirement  benefits. Additionally, for workers who have income above a certain  threshold, their Social Security benefits may be taxed.", "Social Security faces significant financial challenges, as we have  previously reported. According to the 2016 report from the Social  Security Board of Trustees, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust  fund (from which Social Security retirement and survivors\u2019 benefits are  paid) is projected to be able to pay full benefits until 2035. The report  warns that unless action is taken to avert depletion of the trust fund,  continuing revenue is projected to be sufficient to cover about 75 percent  of scheduled benefits at that time. This projection raises the possibility of  changes to Social Security benefits, taxation, or both before 2035.", "Defined Benefit Plans: DB plans offer pension benefits in the form of an  annuity that provides a periodic payment for life, typically on a monthly  basis, and may offer a lump-sum distribution option. They are  employment-based and offer benefits determined by a formula that  includes factors specified by the plan, such as salary and years of  service. Specifics on how the calculation takes those factors into account  can affect the final benefit amount. For example, this amount may be  determined by the average of the worker\u2019s last 5 years of wages, or the  average of the worker\u2019s highest 5 years of wages. Workers may be able  to receive in-service distributions from their DB plan (i.e., draw a pension  benefit while they are still working), generally no earlier than age 62.", "Over the past several decades, private sector employers have shifted  from providing a large share of retirement benefits through DB plans to  relying much more heavily on DC plans, according to Department of  Labor data. In 1975, there were about 103,346 DB plans and 207,748  DC plans. By 2014, the number of DB plans had shrunk by more than half  (to 44,869) while the number of DC plans had more than tripled (to  640,334).", "Retirement Savings: Two primary types of retirement savings vehicles  are IRAs and employer-sponsored DC plans (such as 401(k) and 403(b)  plans). For both DC plans and IRAs, benefits accrue in the form of  account balances, which grow from contributions made by workers (and  sometimes by their employers) and investment returns. DC plans and  IRAs often place the primary responsibility on individuals to participate in,  contribute to, and manage their accounts throughout their working  careers and to manage their savings throughout retirement. Workers and  employers who contribute to retirement savings accounts generally  receive favorable federal tax treatment, such as tax deductions or  exclusions for contributions and tax-deferred or tax-free returns on  investment. A worker may start to withdraw, without a penalty, from  these types of retirement savings vehicles as early as age 59 \u00bd, if the DC  plan or IRA allows it.", "In prior work, we analyzed data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer  Finances and found that about half of households age 55 and older had  no retirement savings, such as in a 401(k) or an IRA. Moreover, we also  found that many older households without retirement savings had few  other resources, such as a DB plan or nonretirement savings, to draw on  in retirement.

These  nondiscrimination requirements would apply to qualified plans, including  those maintained by employers that offer phased retirement.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and GAO reports anticipated this  trend among older workers prior to the recession of 2007-2009, and the  negative effect of the recession on the income security of older workers  may have added an incentive for older workers to keep working.  Increases in labor force participation by women ages 55 to 64 and by  women and men age 65 and older were the primary contributors to the  overall increased labor force participation among older workers.

In all  years within this time period, more women than men in this age cohort  expressed willingness to accept lower pay for reduced work hours.", "However, over the period we analyzed, data indicate that fewer Early  Baby Boomers actually retired gradually than said they would be  interested in reducing their hours. Based on our analysis of HRS, in 2014,  as the Early Baby Boomer cohort approached retirement, the number of  individuals who were partially retired was about 11 percent. This  number was lower in 2004\u2014at about three percent\u2014when the cohort was  younger.

Specifically, four studies we reviewed  also used HRS to examine the percentage of older workers who gradually  retire. The most recent of these studies estimated that only 11 percent of  men and 6 percent of women in the Early Baby Boomer cohort gradually  retired from their full-time career jobs. It also found that those workers are  more likely to have higher-paying jobs. For example, among the Early  Baby Boomer cohort, an estimated 7 percent of men who earned up to  $50 per hour gradually retired, compared to 19 percent of men who  earned over $50 per hour. (For a discussion of what retirement is, see  sidebar.)", "While there may be unobserved barriers to a gradual reduction in hours,  there are concrete financial reasons why more workers may plan to retire  gradually than actually do. First, gradually retiring may have  consequences for employer-provided health and pension benefits and no  measures to address them. Our analysis of HRS data indicates that  among workers ages 61 to 66 in 2014 who said they could reduce their  work hours, about 33 percent said their health insurance benefits would  be reduced or eliminated and 23 percent said their eligibility for pension  benefits would be affected. Another factor that may affect individuals\u2019  ability to gradually retire is Americans\u2019 low savings leading into retirement  and a desire to maximize earnings prior to retiring fully. As we reported in  2015, most households approaching retirement have low savings.", "Further, many workers retire sooner than they thought they would and  therefore may not be able to carry out their plan to reduce work hours  leading into retirement.

In the HRS cohort approaching retirement  between 2004 and 2014, the average difference between planned  retirement year and actual retirement year was about 6 years.

For purposes of this report, formal phased  retirement is an employer-based program in  which older workers can reduce their working  hours in order to transition into retirement.  While studies we reviewed all used variations  on this definition, they all included programs  that employers offered to workers prior to full  retirement. For example, a 2016 Society for  Human Resource Management study most  closely described formal phased retirement as  we use the term, defining it as a formal  reduction in schedule and/or responsibilities  prior to full retirement. A study by the  Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies  the same year described phased retirement  as a work-related program to help workers  age 50 and older transition into retirement by  reducing hours and shifting from full time to  part time, and an earlier MetLife study  described such programs as part-time work  programs to help employees ease into  retirement.   In comparison, informal phased retirement  arrangements are situations in which a worker  remains with the same employer but eases  into retirement through an informal channel  rather than a program. For example, some  workers nearing retirement may be allowed to  have part-time status though there is no  formal policy (sometimes referred to as an ad  hoc arrangement). Alternately, an employee  may retire and then be rehired by the same  employer (known as retire/rehire).", "Informal phased retirement arrangements are generally more common  than formal phased retirement programs, according to the two studies we  reviewed that examined this topic and 10 of the 16 experts we  interviewed.

The SHRM study examined formal phased  retirement programs specifically, reporting that their prevalence has  remained relatively low among its members over the last decade. These  programs may be unlikely to increase, as SHRM reports less than one  percent of their members plan to begin offering such a program in the  next year. Two different studies examined a combination of formal and  informal phased retirement and found the prevalence unchanged in  recent years. One study looked at the time period between 2008 and  2014 and found no statistically significant difference over time in the  percentage of employers with 50 or more workers offering phased  retirement.

For example, one expert  we interviewed described a company with manufacturing staff who were  highly skilled in engineering or the complex manufacturing process. The  company saw a need to offer phased retirement to retain these staff, who  would be hard to replace.", "Certain employers may also choose to offer phased retirement to their  most skilled or higher ranking employees rather than to others. For  example, one study found that among large employers offering phased  retirement, a smaller percentage offered phased retirement to hourly  workers than offered it to executives and salaried workers. Another  article we reviewed described how technological advances have  increased the demand for skilled labor and that phased retirement may be  better to manage skilled workers, managers and professionals than  clerical and blue-collar workers.", "Some of the industries most likely to offer phased retirement already have  part-time opportunities for workers, which may have to do with how their  work is structured and the common practices in those industries. For  example, according to 2016 CPS data, an estimated 26 percent of  workers in education and health services work less than 35 hours per  week, compared to 11 percent in manufacturing. The nature of the job  likely also plays a role, as it may be logistically easier for a professor, for  example, to teach fewer courses than for an assembly-line worker to  reduce the hours on her shift. For instance, two of the publications we  reviewed explained that some employers feel phased retirement may not  be a good \u201cfit\u201d with their job structure.

Establishments more open to part-time work or flexible hours also  tended to be more open to phased retirement, according to the two  studies we reviewed that examined employer characteristics. One of  these studies also found that establishments that permitted informal or  formal phased retirement tended to have policies that were supportive of  part-time work, such as health insurance and paid vacations for part-time  workers.", "There are other reasons that employers may not be interested in phased  retirement or retaining older workers, according to four of 11 publications  we reviewed that described potential obstacles to phased retirement. For  example, two articles cited bias or beliefs among some employers that  older workers are less productive or less valued than younger workers.  One of these and another article described how health care costs can be  expensive for older workers.

One of the experts we interviewed described a general  sense of fear or uncertainty among employers about laws and regulations  and their possible application to phased retirement arrangements. Based  on employer and expert interviews and publications we reviewed, some  employers report facing challenges with Internal Revenue Code (IRC)  nondiscrimination provisions, employment-related discrimination laws, the  defined benefit pension formula, health care coverage, and in-service  distributions from pension and savings plans.", "IRC nondiscrimination provisions: According to experts, publications,  and employers, IRC provisions regarding discrimination can be a  challenge when designing phased retirement programs. These provisions  generally prohibit a qualified plan from discriminating in favor of highly  compensated employees. Failure to comply may result in loss to the  employer of the tax benefits of providing an ERISA qualified plan. In  addition, workers in a plan that is no longer qualified may lose tax benefits  and certain protections. Over the past several decades, private sector  employers have shifted from providing a large share of retirement benefits  through DB plans to relying much more heavily on DC plans. The  nondiscrimination rules apply to both DB and DC plans. The MetLife  survey found that an estimated 51 percent of large employers agreed that  \u201cthe retirement plan nondiscrimination rules can be an obstacle to an  effective phased retirement program for their organization.\u201d Of the 11  publications we reviewed, five reported the nondiscrimination provisions  in general were a challenge, as did seven of the 16 experts we  interviewed. However, of the eight employers we spoke with that had DC  plans and phased retirement programs, none identified the  nondiscrimination rules as a challenge to setting up a phased retirement  program in the context of their DC plan.", "In contrast, one employer we interviewed had seriously considered a  phased retirement program but ultimately did not implement one in part  because the employer believed it could fail the nondiscrimination testing.  It believed the IRS regulations limited its ability to provide the phased  retirement program it wanted. The employer explained their view that if  they offered phased retirement and gave partial service credits to phasing  workers who were participating in the DB plan, and the credits were  included in the nondiscrimination testing, it could fail the test due in part to  their older workforce\u2019s longer service and therefore higher salaries.", "According to eight of the 16 experts we interviewed, some employers,  such as those providing specialized services, would prefer to choose only  those workers with specific, difficult to replace skills for phased  retirement, and often it is those workers who are highly paid. This  potential challenge was also noted by four of the 11 publications we  reviewed. For example, one of the experts said in his view if an employer  wanted to incentivize phased retirement by offering additional 401(k)  matching contributions, it would be discriminatory if it were offered only to  highly compensated employees\u2014potentially those with the specific skills  the employer wanted to retain. Specifically, the IRC nondiscrimination  rules require that the group of employees who are eligible for phased  retirement not be constituted in a way that favors highly compensated  employees. This determination is made by comparing the extent to which  highly compensated employees are eligible for phased retirement with the  extent that other employees are eligible and takes into account the  business reason for the selection of the eligible group. One expert  observed that if a company does not have a business need to make all  workers eligible for phased retirement, it must have a business need for  selecting specific types of workers. He added that companies struggle to  decide and define who should be eligible for pension and other benefits  such as phased retirement.", "Employment-related discrimination laws: According to experts and  employers we interviewed, designing phased retirement programs for  older workers also potentially brings employers face-to-face with age- and  disability-related legal challenges. Of the 16 experts we interviewed, 10  noted as a challenge the potential of a phased retirement program  violating ADEA and/or ADA protections against employment-related age  or disability discrimination. The ADEA was also discussed in three of the  11 publications we reviewed. One article explained that deciding to offer  phased retirement only to employees who have essential skills could  expose the employer to ADEA claims, especially if the program denied  enrollment to relatively old employees. Another expert pointed out that it  could be considered discriminatory if it targeted the phased retirement  program only to workers who were younger than age 62. Two employers  commented that it is easier to allow an ad hoc agreement for a worker  who wants to work fewer hours or to become a contractor than it is to  have a formal phased retirement program.", "According to four of the employers we spoke with and six of the  publications we reviewed, the potential legal uncertainties and challenges  that surround both nondiscrimination provisions and employment-related  discrimination laws may discourage employers from establishing formal  phased retirement programs, even though they and their employees may  benefit from such programs. One expert we interviewed told us that  phased retirement is a grey area under the age discrimination laws.  Another told us there is a high level of concern about creating  discriminatory phased retirement programs.", "Calculation of defined benefit pensions: The benefit formula of some  DB plans can be a potential challenge to designing a phased retirement  program, according to seven of the 11 publications we reviewed.  According to those publications, depending on how the formula is  designed, it could have a negative effect on working longer and be a  disincentive for workers to participate in their employer\u2019s program. For  example, if the benefit formula calculation takes into account the last 5  consecutive years of wages, and the worker participates in a phased  retirement program that entails fewer work hours and lower wages, it  could have a permanent effect on the worker\u2019s DB pension amount.", "Seven out of 16 experts noted the potential challenge of determining how  the benefit for a DB plan is calculated. For example, one expert said a  major concern was that participating in phased retirement could reduce a  worker\u2019s lifetime DB pension benefit if the benefit is based on the last 3 or  5 years of service. Another told us that if the employer made changes in  the DB plan to accommodate the phased retirement participants, the  employer would have to be very careful to do this in a nondiscriminatory  way. Of the nine employers we interviewed, two had DB plans. One of the  two commented that when they designed their phased retirement  program, the DB plan was the most difficult piece to figure out.", "Health care coverage: The provision of health benefits to participants in  a phased retirement program can be a challenge, according to two of the  11 publications we reviewed. Employers may choose to offer group health  coverage to their workers who work less than full time. These employers  have to decide whether phasing workers will be covered. For active  workers over age 65, Medicare is generally the secondary payer. If an  employer provides health coverage to phasing workers, both older and  younger than age 65, the employer may have increased health care  costs. According to two articles we reviewed, some employers may see  this increased cost as a disincentive to implementing a phased retirement  program. These articles noted the potential cost of providing health  insurance for phasing workers.", "However, health care coverage was provided for both full-time and  phasing workers by all eight of the employers we interviewed who offered  phased retirement. One pointed out that their health insurance subsidy is  a major benefit to employees, and as a component of the phased  retirement program, shows that the company respects and values its  workers. Three of the eight employers required that the phasing worker  complete a designated number of work hours per week or pay period to  qualify for these health benefits. One of the three had two levels of  coverage differentiated by age, hours worked, and tenure requirements.", "In-service distributions: According to nine of the 16 experts we  interviewed and three of the 11 publications we reviewed, workers may  be unable to afford living on the reduced wage of phased retirement,  which may make the programs unattractive to such workers. To afford  living on the reduced wage of phased retirement, workers may need to  withdraw income from their retirement savings accounts or start receiving  DB benefits. However, in-service withdrawals are subject to age  requirements, and not all plans allow in-service withdrawals. DB plans  generally provide in-service distributions only to workers age 62 and  older.", "One article pointed out that DC plan participants generally may not  receive, without penalty, distributions from a DC plan until they reach age  59 and \u00bd. The article noted that because few workers can afford to  partially retire unless they receive retirement benefits, these provisions  effectively rule out phased retirement before age 59 \u00bd for DC plan  participants and age 62 for DB plan participants. Two of the experts we  interviewed said that age 62 was too old to make a difference in early  retirement decisions. One added this can be an issue in certain industries  where workers may want to retire before age 62.", "This can be challenging for employers who may want to provide phased  retirement to workers in their 50\u2019s. One article noted that employers with  DB plans may want to offer phased retirement to their younger workers,  preferably when they are eligible for early retirement under the plan  provisions. One expert said that phased retirement could be very helpful  for workers in physically demanding jobs, such as the service industry or  building trades, that tend to wear out workers\u2019 bodies by their 50s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts and Employers Interviewed Reported that Operating a Phased Retirement Program Requires On-going Compliance Activities and Attention to the Concerns of Managers", "paragraphs": ["According to our interviews with experts and employers, operational  challenges with phased retirement programs fall into two general  categories: 1) on-going compliance activities with IRC nondiscrimination  provisions and employment-related discrimination laws; and 2)  administrative issues including the needs and concerns of managers.", "IRC nondiscrimination provisions and employment-related  discrimination laws: According to five of the 11 publications we  reviewed and seven of the 16 experts we interviewed, compliance with  the nondiscrimination provisions can be an ongoing challenge.  Depending on a retirement plan\u2019s eligibility criteria under a phased  retirement program, there may be complaints of employee discrimination.  For example, one employer we interviewed said they did not advertise  their program partly because it is not offered in every business unit. Both  an expert and an employer told us that the paperwork required to stay in  compliance with the nondiscrimination provisions can be burdensome and  is easy to get wrong. According to two of nine employers and 10 of 16  experts we interviewed, ongoing activities related to compliance with  ADEA- and ADA-related discrimination laws can also be a continuous  challenge.", "Administrative and manager concerns: Seven of the nine employers  we interviewed told us that phased retirement programs present  administrative challenges. Six of them told us their managers were  concerned that they have to get the same amount of work completed with  fewer work hours from phased retirement participants. Administering the  payroll was also cited as an ongoing challenge by another employer, who  told us it can be difficult to track these workers\u2019 time and to account for  merit increases and bonuses. Another employer said it is a challenge  both to arrange workers\u2019 schedules and make sure clients\u2019 needs are  met. One employer said it takes managers extra time to help with  knowledge transfer and adjustments due to changes in workers\u2019  schedules.", "Two employers told us their managers also were concerned about the  phased retirement program in the context of their organization\u2019s financial  and personnel rules and processes because, ultimately, the program  could result in reduced budgets for the individual work units. One  employer explained that managers have to do their planning and  budgeting as if the phased retirement participants were working full time.  Another employer described a similar budget/staffing situation. This  employer told us that each division is funded by head count (number of  staff), so if the division has a phased retirement participant, the manager  will not necessarily have the budget to hire a full time replacement  because the head count remains the same."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employers We Interviewed Who Had Overcome These Cited Challenges Reported Benefits from Phased Retirement Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Approaches to Overcome Cited Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In light of these cited challenges, employers we spoke with who had  implemented phased retirement programs told us they were able to  address various design and operational challenges using different  approaches.", "IRC nondiscrimination provisions and employment-related  discrimination law approaches: Of the nine employers we interviewed,  five reported that they overcame potential IRC nondiscrimination  challenges applicable to their retirement plans by allowing all of their  workers who met basic age and years of service requirements to  participate in the phased retirement program. For example, one  employer opened phased retirement to all U.S. employees age 60 and  older with 5 years of service at the company. Another opened the  program to all workers age 55 and older with 10 years tenure and at least  \u201cachieved expectations\u201d on their performance evaluations. Three  employers had no eligibility requirements at all. One employer  commented that their program\u2019s open eligibility was in line with the  inclusive culture of the company.", "The three employers with specialized or highly skilled workers said they  overcame the challenge by making their phased retirement program  available to those workers they identified as meeting a \u201cbusiness need.\u201d  For example, one employer told us that eligibility for their phased  retirement program was up to management and management\u2019s  perception of the business need to retain staff, and the ability to fill the  phasing worker\u2019s position on a part-time basis. They said that some  positions require full-time staff, for example, customer service positions.  Another employer said they require the worker to submit an enrollment  form with the manager\u2019s signature both at initial application and every  year of program participation thereafter. According to this employer, this  procedure ensures there is a business need for the worker to participate  in the program.", "To allay employment-related discrimination concerns, employers reported  using different approaches. One employer told us managers have very  strict guidelines about what can and cannot be said in a discussion about  phased retirement. Specifically, a manager cannot offer advice or ask  leading or specific questions about age or retirement. Another employer,  who does not advertise their program, told us they wait for the \u201cwindows\u201d  when workers bring it up or at performance reviews to discuss the  program. Similarly, another employer said that when an employee tells  human resources they are interested in retirement, human resources  asks if phased retirement is an option. One of the employers, who does  not have a written policy on phased retirement, told us the individual  worker and the company representative work together on phased  retirement to \u201cmake it work.\u201d", "How One Employer Met the Challenge of  Defined Benefit Plan Accruals  One employer we spoke with told us it  calculates the benefit amount for its defined  benefit (DB) plan using a consecutive 5-year  average of wages. Because workers in its  phased retirement program only work four  days per week and receive 80 percent of their  full-time pay, they would risk getting less than  the targeted replacement level of full-time  income if the reduced pay level were used in  their DB benefit calculations. To meet the  challenge of lower DB pension accruals  during the phased retirement period, the  employer told us they pay workers in the  program a full-time salary and allow them to  purchase one day of vacation per week for 20  percent of their salary. Thus, phasing workers  effectively receive 80 percent of their full-time  salary for working four days per week, and a  full-time equivalent salary is used for  purposes of the DB pension calculation.", "Defined benefit plan approaches: One employer we spoke with said  they overcame the challenge of DB benefit formulas by making changes  to the calculation for phased retirement participants. Specifically, the  employer said they changed the way that benefits are accrued so there is  only a slight difference from the benefits a worker would have received if  they continued to work full-time (see sidebar). Another employer reported  avoiding any challenges to DB plans because the company had frozen its  DB plan prior to introducing phased retirement. Current trends show a  significant shift away from DB plans and toward DC plans, so there may  be less of a need in the future for approaches to overcome DB plan  challenges regarding phased retirement.", "Administrative and manager concern approaches: Employers we  interviewed said they overcame the challenges of managers\u2019 concerns  about working with a phased retirement program in ways that worked for  each individual organization. The human resources department at one  employer responded to the managers who objected to the phased  retirement program by promoting the program\u2019s benefits. That employer  said, for example, that managers would be reminded that having an  experienced part-time person was better than having no one, which could  be the case if the phased retiree had stopped working altogether.  Additionally, managers were reminded that a part-time experienced  worker could help train a new person for the job.", "Employers also reported making various program adjustments to help  with managers\u2019 concerns. According to one employer, work needed to be  completed even if some workers reduced their hours, so they set up a  \u201cflex team.\u201d This group of workers is available to fill in as needed  throughout the company, and managers can tap it to fill shifts of phased  retirement participants. Another approach taken by one employer we  interviewed is that when a request for phased retirement is made, they  look at the current staff roster to see if there is a part-time worker who  might want to work more hours or go full time to fill the gap left by the  phased retiree. They noted that because of the nature of their work, they  can set up different combinations of hours and shifts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Benefits of Phased Retirement Programs", "paragraphs": ["Employers we interviewed identified four primary, employer-focused  benefits of phased retirement: 1) the retention of knowledgeable, highly  skilled workers; 2) the transfer of knowledge to younger workers; 3) the  ability to transition older workers into retirement; and 4) the opportunity for  workforce planning.", "Worker retention: Seven of the nine employers we interviewed  suggested that allowing knowledgeable, experienced workers to phase  into retirement often means they will stay longer with their employer. One  employer said they are very satisfied with the phased retirement program  because it helps retain highly educated, specialized workers. Another  commented that their workforce is very valuable and if these employees  were not participating in phased retirement they would be retired.", "Knowledge transfer: Seven of the nine employers we interviewed said  that maintaining the company knowledge base is critical to employers.  One small employer told us their main challenge is the aging of the  workforce and succession. We were told by another employer that it is  expected a phasing worker will train and mentor his or her replacement,  thus maintaining the company knowledge base. Yet another employer  said that knowledge transfer is a large component of the phased  retirement program and it is expected that workers create a transfer plan.", "Transition to retirement: Six of the nine employers we interviewed said  providing a gradual pathway to retirement allows both employer and  worker to adjust. The culture of the company, one employer said,  facilitates the phased retirement program. Another employer noted that  phased retirement eases the transition for workers afraid of losing their  sense of professional belonging as they transition out of paid work. In this  same vein, an employer said that their program provides an attractive off  ramp, and added that it is a way to reward a worker for their years of  service. Another commented that phased retirement is a positive way for  those at or near retirement age to transition softly into retirement\u2014they  are participating, but at a reduced pace. Two companies conducted  surveys of phased retirement program participants and found that these  workers appreciated the ability to transition into retirement.", "Workforce planning: Five of the nine employers we interviewed said  knowing when workers will retire allows employers to plan for the future.  Providing a phased retirement program, one employer told us, makes  them aware of workers\u2019 retirement plans and thus able to plan for future  workforce needs.

For example, we used HRS to estimate the percentage  of older workers that can reduce their work hours, that plan to reduce  their work hours as they transition to retirement, that would like to reduce  hours even if their pay is also reduced, and the percentage that are partly  retired. We also used HRS to analyze other information for this cohort,  such as the percentage that said their pension or health benefits would be  affected by reducing their hours and the percentage that retired sooner  than expected.", "The University of Michigan\u2019s HRS is a longitudinal panel study that  surveys a representative sample of approximately 20,000 Americans over  the age of 50 every 2 years, with new cohorts being added to the sample  every 6 years.

For CPS, we  used weights provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. For HRS, we adapted  the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) method to develop and use  weights specific to the Early Baby Boomer cohort.

The employer has conducted  surveys of workers and managers, and feedback about the  phased retirement program is very positive.", "Eligible workers: All workers who have reached age 60 and who  have been at the company for five or more years and who have  permission from their managers and human resources, are  eligible.", "Hours reduction allowed: Participants must work at least 50  percent and no more than 80 percent. A participant may submit a  request to work less than 50 percent, though they lose eligibility  for health care benefits.", "Length of phased retirement: Phasing can last from six months  up to two years.", "Knowledge transfer: Knowledge transfer is a large component of  the program. The employer provides many tools and guidelines,  and it is expected that phasing workers create a transfer plan.", "Effect on health care benefits: The employer provides a subsidy  so that the health insurance rates for phased retirement  participants are the same as if they were working full time.", "Effect on pension benefits: There is no DB plan.

However, employer-provided  health benefits end at age 65\u2014the age at which workers become  eligible for Medicare.", "Effect on pension benefits: There is no DB plan. The employer  provides a dollar-to-dollar match for the DC plan. Since it is not  based on a proportion of the worker\u2019s salary, the match remains  unchanged regardless of participation in phased retirement.", "Features of phased retirement:", "Basics: In this formal phased retirement program, workers are  allowed flexibility within the program\u2019s basic rules. Workers can  retire fully at any point during phased retirement.", "Cited benefits/advantages: Phased retirement helps avoid a  retirement \u201ccliff.\u201d Instead, it is a ramp from 100 percent time to 0  percent time.

It also helps with workforce planning.", "Eligible workers: All who meet basic requirements of at least age  55, worked at least 10 years with the employer, have worked a  certain number of hours in one of the three prior calendar years  and per pay period are eligible to apply.

However, this  does not necessarily have an effect on the amount of the DB  pension benefit at full retirement because the current  calculation is based on the worker\u2019s highest years of earnings,  not the most recent.", "DC plan: For the DC plan, the contribution formula does not  change with phased retirement, but the amount of pay upon  which the contribution is based changes in proportion to the  worker\u2019s reduced salary.", "Features of phased retirement:", "Basics: This phased retirement program is not formalized but  otherwise meets our definition of a phased retirement program.  While there is no formal structure, the program can be set up in a  number of ways. A worker can switch out of duties that are on his  or her career track, to less stressful duties, or less complex duties;  or a worker could phase to part-time at their regular duties.", "Cited benefits/advantages: The organization is able to retain  people who do highly specialized work.
