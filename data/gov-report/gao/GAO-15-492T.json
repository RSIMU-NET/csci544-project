It is based on GAO reports on space programs and weapon system acquisition best practices over the past 6 years; space-related work supporting GAO's 2015 weapon system assessments and GAO's 2014 report on duplication, overlap, and fragmentation; updates on cost increases and improvements; and preliminary observations from ongoing work.

But other programs continue to face difficulties, both in technology development and in ensuring ground and user systems are delivered in time to maximize a satellite's capability. Specifically:", "GAO reported in 2015 that, while the most recent Global Positioning System (GPS) III satellite program took steps to avoid past problems with satellite acquisitions, it is facing more than a 2-year delay for its satellite launch due to development problems. A complete GPS III satellite has not yet been tested, and the program is now rebaselining its cost estimates as a result of the schedule delay and associated increased costs.", "The next-generation ground system needed to operate GPS satellites has experienced significant schedule delays and cost growth, and is still facing technical challenges. During development, the contractor encountered problems that led to significant rework, delaying the delivery of the ground system. As a result, as GAO's ongoing work for this committee is finding, some GPS satellite capability will likely go unused for several years while the capability of the ground system catches up to the functionality of the satellites.", "While new missile warning satellites are now on orbit after years of delays and significant cost growth, the ground system needed to operate the satellites is still in development, meaning the satellites cannot be fully utilized\u2014complete and usable data from the satellites will not be available until over 5 years after the first satellite was launched, based on recent updates.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) also faces challenges in providing future space-based capabilities. In October 2014, GAO reported that fiscal constraints and growing threats to space systems have led DOD to consider alternatives such as disaggregating\u2014or breaking up\u2014large satellites into multiple, smaller satellites or payloads, and introducing competition into the acquisition of launch services. DOD is assessing options for future capabilities in several key mission areas through analyses of alternatives, comparing multiple potential solutions to satisfy capability needs. However, the time frames for making decisions about the way forward are narrowing, and if not made in time, DOD may be forced to continue with existing approaches for its next systems, as GAO reported in April 2015. Implementing any new approaches will be difficult if DOD does not overcome long-standing leadership problems for its space programs, including cultural resistance to acquisition process changes and fragmented responsibilities. More recently, DOD has taken steps to address some of these leadership challenges, though it is too early to tell whether such efforts will be effective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Past GAO reports have generally recommended that DOD adopt best practices for developing space systems.

DOD\u2019s space systems provide critical  capabilities that support military and other government operations and  can take a long time to develop, produce, and launch. These systems can  also be expensive to acquire and field, amounting to billions of dollars  each year. Given the time and resource demands of DOD\u2019s space  systems and to ensure taxpayer dollars are used effectively, especially in  light of today\u2019s constrained government budget environment, it is  essential that DOD manage system acquisition carefully and avoid  repeating past problems.", "Major space system acquisition programs now in production have largely  overcome problems. But despite efforts to lower acquisition risk, newer  DOD space programs in development are encountering challenges and  issues with synchronizing the delivery of satellites, ground processing,  and user system capabilities remain. Further, the way forward for major  systems is uncertain. DOD is studying the future of several key mission  areas but has not yet made decisions on how to provide capabilities or  address leadership issues.", "My testimony today will focus on (1) the current status and cost of major  DOD space system acquisitions and (2) how DOD is preparing to address  future space-based mission needs. This testimony is based on GAO  reports issued over the past 6 years on space programs and weapon  system acquisition best practices. It is also based on work performed in  support of our annual weapon system assessments; space-related work  in support of our previous report on duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation across the federal government; updates on cost increases,  investment trends, and improvements in the last year; and preliminary  observations from ongoing work related to space system acquisition  efforts. To conduct these updates, we analyzed DOD funding estimates  from DOD\u2019s 2014 Selected Acquisition Reports for selected major space  system acquisition programs for fiscal years 2014 through 2019. Ongoing  work includes analyzing program status documents, such as acquisition  program baselines, delivery schedules, and program plans; reviewing  acquisition strategies; interviewing relevant DOD officials, contractors,  and experts; and comparing information with acquisition best practices  and DOD guidance. More information on our scope and methodology is  available in our related GAO products. We conducted the work on which  this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  DOD provided technical comments which were incorporated as  appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, DOD space system acquisitions have been  characterized by the long-standing problem of program costs increasing  significantly from original cost estimates. While some programs have  overcome problems with development, and actions have been taken to  better position programs for success, the large cost growth of space  systems continues to affect the department. As shown in figure 1, as of  December 2014, current annual estimated costs for selected major space  system acquisition programs have overrun and are projected to exceed  original annual estimates by a cumulative $16.7 billion\u2014186 percent\u2014 over fiscal years 2014 through 2019. The cost increases that DOD is  dealing with today are partly the result of management and oversight  problems, many of which DOD experienced before 2010. Other reasons  for cost increases include quantity increases and extensions for some  programs, such as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV)  program.", "The gap between original and current cost estimates represents money  the department did not plan to spend on the programs, and thus could not  invest in other efforts. Gaps between original and current estimates over  the 6-year period are slightly larger for some years. For example, the  gaps in 2016 and 2017 are in large part driven by significant annual cost  increases for the EELV program. Specifically, original annual estimates  for EELV were over $900 million and $600 million for 2016 and 2017,  respectively, but grew to over $2 billion for each year in the current  annual estimates. EELV cost increases are due primarily to an increase  in the number of expected launch services by 60 and an extension of the  program for 10 more years, in addition to increases in the cost of  acquiring launch services, which have recently been stemmed. Three  programs\u2014Global Broadcast Service, Space Based Infrared System  (SBIRS), and Wideband Global SATCOM\u2014did not estimate any annual  costs for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 originally, but current cumulative  estimates for these programs over that time frame total about $4 billion,  driven by cost growth and quantity increases. The overall declining  investment in fiscal year 2019 is in part the result of programs that have  planned lower out-year funding as they approach the end of production or  operational capability. However, this decline is mitigated by plans to  invest nearly $2.5 billion in launch services in 2019, and will be further  mitigated by new programs, which are still in the early stages of planning  and development. These new programs are not included in this figure  because they have not yet established official cost baselines.", "Our prior body of work has identified a number of causes of acquisition  problems in DOD programs. In the past, DOD tended to start more  weapon programs than was affordable, creating competition for funding  that focused on advocacy at the expense of realism and sound  management. In addition, DOD tended to start space system acquisition  programs before it had the assurance that the pursued capabilities could  be achieved within available resources and time constraints. There is no  way to accurately estimate how long it takes to design, develop, and build  a satellite system when key technologies planned for that system are still  in the relatively early stages of discovery and invention. Finally, programs  have historically attempted to satisfy all requirements in a single step,  regardless of the design challenges or the maturity of the technologies  necessary to achieve the full capability. DOD\u2019s past inclination to make  large, complex satellites that perform multiple missions has stretched  technology challenges beyond current capabilities, in some cases.", "To address the problems identified, we have recommended that DOD  take a number of actions. Broadly, we have recommended that DOD  separate technology discovery from acquisition, follow an incremental  path toward meeting user needs, match resources and requirements at  program start, and use quantifiable data and demonstrable knowledge to  make decisions about moving to next acquisition phases. We have also  identified practices related to cost estimating, program manager tenure,  quality assurance, technology transition, and an array of other aspects of  acquisition program management that could benefit space system  acquisition programs. DOD has generally concurred with our  recommendations and has undertaken a number of actions to establish a  better foundation for acquisition success. For example, we reported in the  past that, among other actions, DOD created a new office within the  Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics to focus attention on oversight for space programs and it  eliminated offices considered to perform duplicative oversight functions.  We have also reported that the department took actions to strengthen  cost estimating and to reinstitute stricter standards for quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Status and Cost of Space System Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["Most of DOD\u2019s major space programs are in the mature phases of  acquisition and are now producing and launching satellites. Cost and  schedule growth\u2014a significant problem for these programs in past  years\u2014is not currently as prevalent, though still a problem for some  programs. Table 1 describes the status of the space system acquisitions  we have been tracking in detail.", "Several of DOD\u2019s space system acquisitions have largely overcome  challenges\u2014such as matching resources to requirements, facilitating  competition, and parts quality issues\u2014and are in the process of  producing and launching satellites. Other programs, however, continue to  experience challenges, both in technology development and the optimal  timing of system component deliveries, meaning delivery of ground,  space, and end user assets may not be synchronized. When satellites are  placed on orbit without corresponding ground systems and limited user  equipment in place, their capability is effectively wasted, as a portion of  their limited lifespan is spent without being fully utilized. This has been a  significant problem for DOD given the high cost to develop satellites,  systemic delays in delivering ground and user components, and the  importance of maintaining continuity of service. Problems we have  identified with the development of satellites, ground systems, and user  components are highlighted below.", "In September 2010, we found that the Global Positioning System  (GPS) III satellite program took a number of steps to avoid past  problems with GPS satellite acquisitions, such as adopting higher  quality standards and better managing requirements. However, in our  more recent work from March 2015, we found that the first GPS III  satellite launch is facing a significant delay due to problems with the  development of its navigation payload. The payload has now been  delivered, but the first launch has been delayed 28 months. The  program office reports that early testing of a satellite prototype helped  identify problems sooner, but a complete GPS III satellite has yet to  be tested. As a result, additional issues could emerge. Though the  program had taken steps to include in its initial cost and schedule  estimates the impacts of addressing problems in development, it is  now rebaselining those estimates\u2014expected to be completed in July  2015\u2014as a result of this delay and associated increased costs. The  first satellite design will not be fully tested until May 2015 at the  earliest; meanwhile, an additional 7 satellites are in various stages of  production and DOD has authorized an additional 2 satellites to be  acquired. Additional delays or problems discovered during tests of the  first satellite could require rework to the remaining satellites in  production\u2014carrying the risk of further cost growth.", "In our ongoing work, we are finding that the GPS Next Generation  Operational Control System (OCX), the next ground system for GPS,  has experienced significant schedule delays and cost growth, and is  still encountering technical challenges. The program awarded a  development contract in February 2010, nearly 3 years before the  formal decision to begin system development, when requirements are  to be matched with resources. The contract was awarded early in  order to save money during the competitive phase, but the contractor  encountered problems completing software engineering and  implementing cybersecurity requirements, among other things, which  led to a higher-than-expected level of defects in the software, and  ultimately to significant rework and code growth. Significant work and  risk remain in the development of key upgrades, which are expected  to be delivered about 4 years later than planned. This means some  satellite capability will likely go unutilized for several years while the  capability of the ground system catches up to the functionality of the  satellites. Further, as of April 2015, contract costs have more than  doubled over initial estimates, from $886 million in February 2010 to  $1.98 billion, and DOD has delayed initial OCX capability from 2015 to  2019. The Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation has  stated that the delays to OCX pose risks to DOD\u2019s ability to sustain  the operational GPS constellation, since DOD may require use of the  GPS III satellites before OCX is available to control them. We are  examining OCX in greater detail, as mandated by this committee, and  expect to report on the results of our review in July 2015.", "Through our ongoing work, we are finding that DOD, building on a  troubled, lengthy 9-year effort to mature military-code (M-code)  receiver technology, initiated the Military GPS User Equipment  (MGUE) program in 2012 to develop M-code receiver cards for the  military services\u2019 respective ground, air, and sea weapon systems. In  2014, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics directed the Air Force to accelerate MGUE  development and fielding, as guided by a 2011 statutory requirement  instructing DOD to procure only M-code capable equipment after  fiscal year 2017. To that end, DOD expects to complete  developmental testing and operational assembly by July 2016 and  provide technical support to inform the military services\u2019 MGUE  production decisions. However, MGUE integration and performance  risks will not be fully known until the military services can complete  individual operational tests on their respective test platforms. The  completion of the first of those tests is scheduled for September 2017,  and the last in September 2019. We are reviewing these and other  issues within the MGUE program as part of our ongoing work, and  plan to report to your committee on the program in July 2015.", "In March 2015, we reported that the Family of Advanced Beyond Line- of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program, which is to deliver user terminals  for the AEHF satellite system and is a vital component of nuclear  command and control operations, is nearing the end of development  and anticipates entering production in late fiscal year 2015. In 2012,  following 10 years of continued cost and schedule growth developing  FAB-T, DOD competed and awarded a contract to develop a new  design for the program. At the time of our last review, the low-rate  production decision was expected in September 2014, but due to  delays in completing hardware qualification and system level testing,  among other things, the decision is now expected almost a year later,  in August 2015.", "The SBIRS ground system, which provides command and control and  data processing support, continues to experience development  delays. The delayed delivery of the initial block of the ground  system\u2014intended to facilitate processing of integrated data from  legacy Defense Support Program satellites, SBIRS GEO satellites,  and SBIRS sensors in highly elliptical orbit\u2014means complete and  usable data from a critical sensor will not be available until June 2016,  based on DOD\u2019s December 2014 Selected Acquisition Report, over 5  years after the first SBIRS GEO satellite was launched. The SBIRS  system will not be fully operational until 2018, when the final block of  the SBIRS ground system\u2014which adds processing capability to  mobile ground terminals\u2014is expected to be completed.", "The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program also faces  challenges that prevent full use of its satellite capabilities. Issues  related to the development of the MUOS waveform\u2014meant to provide  increased communications capabilities beyond those offered by the  legacy system\u2014have caused delays in the use of radios being  developed by the Army as the first operational terminals to incorporate  the waveform, as we reported in March 2015. Use of over 90  percent of MUOS\u2019 planned capability is dependent on resolving  problems with integrating the waveform, terminals, and ground  systems. The MUOS program extended testing to fix software and  reliability issues with the waveform integration and now plans to  complete operational testing by November 2015\u2014a 17-month delay  from the initial schedule estimate. As a result, the Army\u2019s plans to field  its MUOS-compatible radios have now slipped from 2014 to 2016,  roughly four years since the first MUOS satellite launched."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Faces Challenges and Uncertainty for Addressing Future Space-Based Mission Needs", "paragraphs": ["Fiscal constraints and growing threats to space systems have led DOD to  consider alternatives for acquiring and launching space-based  capabilities. These include disaggregating\u2014or breaking up\u2014large  satellites into multiple, smaller satellites or payloads, and introducing  competition into the acquisition of launch services. For some mission  areas, such as space-based environmental (or weather) monitoring,  protected satellite communications, and overhead persistent infrared  sensing, decisions on the way forward, including satellite architectures,  have not yet been made. For others, such as national security space  launch, plans have been decided, but implementation poses new  challenges. As DOD moves forward with changes to the acquisition  approaches for these mission areas, some with the potential to set off  cascading effects, strong leadership across DOD\u2019s space programs will  be critical.", "In 2014, we examined DOD\u2019s efforts to explore disaggregation as a  potential means to provide space-based capabilities in an increasingly  constrained budget environment and a threatened space environment.  We found that the effects of disaggregation are largely unknown, and  that, at the time of our review, DOD had not comprehensively assessed  the wide range of potential benefits and limitations in key areas, such as  affordability, capability, and resilience. Consequently, we recommended  DOD conduct a comprehensive examination of disaggregation, develop  common measures for resilience, and expand demonstration efforts to  assess its feasibility, before making decisions on whether to disaggregate  its space systems. DOD generally agreed with our recommendations.", "One way DOD is assessing disaggregation is through various analyses of  alternatives (AOA), or reviews that compare the operational effectiveness,  suitability, and life cycle cost of solutions to satisfy capability needs. DOD  has completed one AOA for the weather monitoring mission area and is  working to complete others for protected satellite communications and  overhead persistent infrared sensing. These AOAs have the potential to  dramatically shift DOD\u2019s approach to providing capabilities, affecting not  only satellite design, but also ground systems, networks, user equipment,  and the industrial base. To allow enough time to institute potential  changes in contracting and development approaches, and maintain  continuity of service, DOD is faced with making decisions over the next  several years about the way forward. Details about the AOAs, including  when acquisition decisions need to be made for follow-on systems, are  depicted in table 2.", "The longer DOD takes to complete the AOAs and come to a consensus  on how to proceed, the more its range of choices will be constrained.  Completing an AOA is the first in a series of important steps to providing  future capabilities. In addition, an approach must be selected\u2014whether it  is a disaggregated architecture, an evolved version of an existing system,  or some other variation\u2014funding must be programmed, and technology  development and acquisition strategies must be developed. If decisions  are not timely, DOD may be forced to continue with existing approaches  for its next systems, effectively continuing with legacy systems. While  doing so may offer benefits, such as lower likelihood of unexpected cost  and schedule problems, there are also risks associated with technology  obsolescence and likely continued risks to missions because of the  threats satellites on orbit face today.", "To date, DOD has not positioned itself to implement significant changes  into follow-on systems. For example, in a January 2014 assessment of a  DOD report on overhead persistent infrared technology, we noted that  although the need for a SBIRS follow-on AOA was determined in 2008, it  was not pursued until early 2014, at which time DOD began planning  efforts for the AOA study. Additionally, we reported in April 2015 that  DOD\u2019s minimal investment in planning for technology insertion on SBIRS  GEO satellites 5 and 6 limited the options available to upgrade  technologies on these satellites. At present, DOD is planning to address  technology obsolescence issues rather than upgrade the onboard  technologies. Additionally, we concluded in April 2015 that the current  lack of direction in the program\u2019s path forward could make it difficult to  develop a technology insertion plan before the next system is needed.  DOD concurred with our recommendation to establish a technology  insertion plan that identifies specific needs, technologies, and insertion  points, to ensure planning efforts are clearly aligned with the follow-on  system and that past problems are not repeated. In the case of the  weather monitoring mission area, DOD has passed the point where it  could consider new designs or approaches for certain capabilities. At  least one capability has an immediate need, requiring DOD to choose  among existing approaches.", "It is not certain disaggregation is a good approach. To the extent it may  offer a viable option for addressing the affordability and resilience  challenges that DOD is facing, it is not a simple solution and should be  decided on a case-by-case basis. The changes to satellite designs that  are being contemplated could have far-reaching effects on requirements,  supporting infrastructure, management and oversight of acquisitions,  industry, and other areas. DOD is taking good steps by assessing  alternatives thoroughly, but, as our work has found, it has not yet resolved  underlying challenges to space acquisition that could be exacerbated by  disaggregation. For example, disaggregating satellites may require  more complex ground systems and user terminals. However, we  consistently find ground systems and user equipment programs are  plagued by requirements instability, underestimation of technical  complexity, and poor contractor oversight. Clearly, these problems,  including the misalignment of satellites, ground systems, and user  equipment, will pose challenges to successfully implementing a  disaggregated approach.", "Once decisions are reached for future satellites and launch acquisitions,  DOD may still face hurdles in implementing the plan. For example, in  2012, DOD made a commitment to introduce competition into its EELV  program\u2014a shift of dramatic proportions from the longstanding status quo  of procuring launch services through a sole-source provider. Following  this decision, the department, in coordination with the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Reconnaissance  Office, and several private space launch companies, has been working to  certify new launch providers for national security space launches, but to  date, none have met the criteria to become certified, although DOD  expects SpaceX to be certified by June 2015. Additionally, the  department has faced unexpected complications, such as challenges to  its competitive process in the form of a private lawsuit that has been  settled, according to DOD officials; a foreign conflict that brought attention  to a Russian engine used on one of the sole-source contractor\u2019s launch  vehicles; and engine development demands requiring new technological  innovation.", "Without addressing leadership shortcomings, DOD space programs could  continue to face challenges in implementing new approaches. DOD\u2019s  culture has generally been resistant to changes in acquisition  approaches, as we have reported, and fragmented responsibilities in  DOD space programs have made it difficult to implement new processes  and coordinate and deliver interdependent systems. Such challenges  could, for example, hinder DOD\u2019s efforts to examine options for  acquisition efficiencies in military and commercial satellite  communications services. Historically, DOD has procured commercial  satellite communications services to augment military capacity and  became increasingly reliant on these services to support ongoing military  operations. DOD is looking for ways to better streamline procurements of  these services, but according to DOD officials, it has had difficulty  adhering to past policies that required centralized procurement, especially  during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, when efficiency was not a  priority. Similarly, DOD has been unable to align the delivery of space  system segments in part because budgeting authority for the segments is  spread across the military services and DOD lacks a single authority to  ensure programs are funded in a manner that aligns their deliveries. As  programs continue to face challenges in aligning components, the  warfighter cannot take advantage of full system capabilities, and the large  investments into these programs are not fully exploited.", "DOD has begun implementing efforts to address some leadership  challenges more recently. For example, increased use of shared satellite  control networks and leading practices within DOD could reduce  fragmentation and potential duplication associated with dedicated  systems, resulting in millions of dollars in savings annually. In response to  our recommendation, DOD has developed a department-wide plan,  currently in final coordination, to support the implementation of alternative  methods for performing satellite control operations to achieve optimal  systems. It has also taken actions to better coordinate and plan space  situational awareness activities\u2014efforts to detect, track, and characterize  space objects and space-related events\u2014an area where we identified  leadership disconnects in a 2011 report. However, in both cases, it is  too early to tell whether such efforts will be effective.", "In closing, we recognize DOD has made strides in recent years in  enhancing its management and oversight of space acquisitions and that  sustaining our superiority in space is inherently challenging, both from a  technical perspective and a management perspective. Further, to its  credit, DOD is looking for ways to provide more avenues for innovation,  competition, efficiency, and resilience. This is not easy to do in light of the  importance of space programs to military operations, external pressures,  and the complicated nature of the national security space enterprise. At  the same time, there are persistent problems affecting space programs  that need to be addressed if DOD is to be successful in introducing  change. Our past recommendations have focused on steps DOD can  take to address these problems. While DOD should not refrain from  considering new approaches, we continue to believe it should  complement these efforts with adequate knowledge about costs, benefits,  and alternatives; more focused leadership; and sustained dedication to  improving acquisition management, as we previously recommended. Not  doing so will likely mean a repeat of DOD\u2019s space system acquisition  history characterized by cost growth, inefficient operations, and delayed  capabilities to the warfighter. We look forward to continuing to work with  the Congress and DOD to improve military space system acquisition  efforts and outcomes.", "Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Donnelly, this completes my  prepared statement.
