In support of homeland security missions, OAM provides aircraft, vessels, and crew at the request of the its customers, primarily Border Patrol, which is responsible for enforcing border security, and tracks its ability to meet requests. GAO was asked to determine the extent to which OAM (1) met its customers\u0092 requests; (2) has taken steps to ensure its mix and placement of resources effectively met mission needs and addressed threats; and (3) coordinated the use of its assets with the USCG, which is to execute its maritime security mission using its assets. GAO reviewed DHS policies, interviewed OAM, Border Patrol, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and USCG officials in headquarters and in 4 field locations selected on factors, such as threats and operating environments. Results from these field visits are not generalizable. GAO analyzed OAM support request data for fiscal year 2010, and surveyed OAM and USCG officials at 86 proximately located units to determine the extent of cooperation between the two agencies. This report is a public version of a law enforcement sensitive report GAO issued in February 2012. Information deemed sensitive has been redacted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u0092s analysis of the Office of Air and Marine (OAM) data found that OAM met 73 percent of the 38,662 air support requests and 88 percent of the 9,913 marine support requests received in fiscal year 2010. The level of support differed by location, customers, and type of mission. For example, in its northern region OAM met air support requests 77 percent of the time and in its southeast region, it met these requests 60 percent of the time. The main reasons for unmet air and marine support requests were maintenance and adverse weather, respectively. OAM has taken actions, such as developing an aircraft modernization plan and purchasing all-weather vessels, to address these issues.", "OAM could benefit from taking additional steps to better ensure that its mix and placement of resources meets mission needs and addresses threats. GAO\u0092s analysis of OAM\u0092s fiscal year 2010 performance results indicate that OAM did not meet its national performance goal to fulfill greater than 95 percent of Border Patrol air support requests and did not provide higher rates of support in locations designated as high priority based on threats. For example, one high-priority Border Patrol sector had the fifth highest support rate across all nine sectors on the southwest border. OAM could benefit from reassessing the mix and placement of its assets and personnel, using performance results to inform these decisions. Such a reassessment could help provide OAM with reasonable assurance that it is most effectively allocating scarce resources and aligning them to fulfill mission needs and related threats. Additionally, OAM has not documented its analyses to support its asset mix and placement across locations. For example, OAM\u0092s fiscal year 2010 deployment plan stated that OAM deployed aircraft and maritime vessels to ensure that its forces were positioned to best meet field commanders\u0092 needs and respond to emerging threats, but OAM did not have documentation that clearly linked the deployment decisions in the plan to these goals. Such documentation could improve transparency to help demonstrate the effectiveness of its decisions in meeting mission needs and addressing threats.", "GAO\u0092s analysis of OAM and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) air and marine survey responses indicated that they coordinated with their proximately located counterparts more frequently for activities directly related to carrying out their respective agencies\u0092 missions (mission-related activities) than for mission support activities. For example, within mission-related activities, 54 percent of the 86 respondents reported sharing intelligence on a frequent basis and, within mission-support activities, about 15 percent reported that they frequently coordinated for maintenance requests. Survey respondents, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) analyses, and GAO site visits confirm that opportunities exist to improve certain types of coordination, such as colocating proximate OAM and USCG units, which currently share some marine and no aviation facilities. In addition, DHS does not have an active program office dedicated to the coordination of aviation or maritime issues. DHS could benefit from assessing actions it could take to improve coordination across a range of air and marine activities, including reconstituting departmental oversight councils, to better leverage existing resources, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enhance efficiencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that CBP reassess decisions and document its analyses for its asset mix and placement, and that DHS enhance oversight to ensure effective coordination of OAM and USCG resources, and DHS concurred."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the largest law  enforcement air force in the world and uses these resources to prevent,  detect, and interdict acts of terrorism and other unlawful activity of  persons approaching or crossing the United States borders. In 2004, DHS  consolidated most if its air and marine resources in the Office of Air and  Marine (OAM), a subcomponent of U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), which has primary responsibility for the management, control, and  protection of the nation\u2019s borders. As of September 2011, OAM had  approximately 267 aircraft, 301 marine vessels, and 1,843 personnel in  70 locations primarily on the southwest, northern, and southeast borders.  From fiscal years 2006 through 2011, OAM allocated about $1.3 billion to  modernize its fleet of aged aircraft and marine vessels with a smaller  variety of more flexible and sustainable assets equipped to support  homeland security missions. For fiscal year 2011, DHS allocated $814.5  million for OAM\u2019s overall operations.", "OAM carries out its mission to secure the nation\u2019s borders by providing  aviation and marine support to various DHS components and other  federal, state, and local law enforcement agency customers. Within DHS,  OAM focuses its capabilities on border enforcement support to CBP\u2019s  Office of Border Patrol (Border Patrol), which is primarily responsible for  enforcing border security between official ports of entry to the United  States; and investigative support to the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), which is the largest DHS investigative entity. OAM  also provides support to combat drug trafficking in the Caribbean and  other foreign areas; provides air and marine security at national events;  provides disaster relief support; and supports other federal, state, and  local law enforcement missions. To support its various customers, it is  critical that CBP has the right mix of air and marine assets located in the  right places for maximum effectiveness and use. This effectiveness can  be enhanced by coordination of its operations with other agencies that  operate air and marine assets in the same geographic area. One such  agency is DHS\u2019s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), which, among its statutory  missions, is responsible for executing its maritime security mission on or  over the major waterways, including the Great Lakes and 95,000 miles of  U.S. coastline and territorial seas, using its own air and marine assets.  We previously reported on opportunities to increase coordination of OAM  and USCG assets and DHS implemented our recommendations by,  among other things, providing guidance on relative roles and  responsibilities and how asset use should be coordinated to meet border  security needs.", "This report responds to your request that we review the extent to which  CBP has assessed that it has the right mix of air and marine assets in the  right locations to meet customer needs, and has coordinated with the  USCG. Specifically, we reviewed the extent that OAM:  (1) met air and marine support requests across locations, customers, and  missions;  (2) has taken steps to ensure that its mix and placement of resources met  its mission needs and addressed threats; and  (3) coordinated the operational use of its air and marine assets and  personnel with the USCG.", "This report is a public version of the prior law enforcement sensitive but  unclassified report that we provided to you. DHS has deemed some of the  information in the prior report as law enforcement sensitive, which must  be protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits  information describing the numbers of assets and personnel and the  types of activities at the OAM branch level and below, and the specific  operational locations we visited. Otherwise, this report addresses the  same questions and uses the same overall methodology as the sensitive  report.", "In conducting our work, we interviewed DHS headquarters officials,  analyzed DHS data and documentation, conducted site visits to selected  air and marine branch locations, and administered a web-based survey to  selected OAM and USCG air and marine units. We visited 4 of the 23  OAM branch offices. We chose these locations because they comprise a  mix of differences across border locations (northern, southwest, and  southeast), threats (terrorism, drug smuggling, and illegal immigration),  and operating environments for air (desert, forest, urban, rural) and  marine (Great Lakes, coastal, intracoastal waterways). In these locations  we interviewed OAM officials and their customers including officials from  Border Patrol, ICE, and some local law enforcement officials. We also  interviewed USCG officials in all locations except one, because a USCG  unit was not located nearby. We also visited OAM\u2019s principal radar center,  the Air and Marine Operations Center, at Riverside, California. While we  cannot generalize our work from these visits to all air and marine  branches, the information we obtained provides examples of the benefits  and challenges in providing air and marine support to customers for  various missions.", "To address the first and second objective, we obtained data on the  number and type of requests OAM received for air and marine assets  from OAM\u2019s Air and Marine Operations Reporting (AMOR) system for  fiscal year 2010, and analyzed the extent that OAM met requests for air  and marine support across locations, customers, and missions. We  assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing OAM officials  responsible for overseeing applicable quality control procedures and  reviewing available system documentation, such as user guides, among  other things. We concluded that these data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report, with one exception. We did not use data  showing marine support by customer because of missing entries and  inconsistent data entry practices, as discussed later in this report. We  discussed differences in the level of OAM support with OAM, Border  Patrol, and ICE officials at headquarters and field locations we visited. We  also assessed OAM\u2019s internal controls related to data management and  compared them against criteria in Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.", "To address the second objective, we interviewed DHS, CBP, Border  Patrol, and OAM officials and reviewed documentation available  supporting the mix and placement of assets. We reviewed the extent that  the documentation considered current and future mission needs and  relative threats defined by CBP-designated priority locations. We  analyzed AMOR data for fiscal year 2010 to determine the extent OAM  had provided air and marine support to CBP-designated priority locations,  and was able to meet their performance goal in these locations compared  to others. We also compared data from AMOR to information reported in  CBP\u2019s annual Performance and Accountability Report to determine the  extent that OAM\u2019s performance in providing air support to Border Patrol  was accurately reported.", "To address the first and third objective, we developed and administered a  web-based survey to each of 86 proximately located OAM air and marine  branches and units and USCG air and marine stations asking them about  the level of interagency coordination across various mission and mission  support areas, and any results in terms of performance effectiveness,  reduced duplication, and cost savings. Our survey went to senior officers  in 18 OAM air branches or units, 13 USCG air stations, 27 OAM marine  branches or units, and 28 USCG marine stations. Our response rate was  100 percent, although not all respondents answered each question. We  also reviewed past GAO and DHS analyses to identify opportunities for  increased coordination, and interviewed DHS officials and reviewed  documentation to determine the extent to which DHS headquarters  councils were in place to carry out oversight responsibilities outlined in  the council charters to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and  interoperability of air and marine assets.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 through February  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Considerations in OAM allocation decisions include historical  location, congressional direction, and differences in geography and  relative need for air and marine support to address threats. As of May  2011, OAM had placed about half of its air assets on the southwest  border region and the remainder on the northern and southeast regions,  while marine resources were distributed fairly evenly across the northern,  southwest, and southeast regions.

Our analysis of these data showed that  the percentage of air support requests OAM met differed by region or  branch location, and to a lesser extent, by customer and mission type.  Specifically, the percentage of air support requests met ranged by 29  percentage points across regions (from 60 to 89 percent) and ranged by  over 50 percentage points across branches (from 43 to 96 percent), while  the percentage of requests met across customers ranged by about 14  percentage points (from 76 to 90 percent) and the percentage of requests  met across mission types ranged by 24 percentage points (from 61 to 85  percent).", "OAM air support requests met differed by up to 29 percentage points  across five different OAM regional areas of responsibility (i.e., regions).

The overall percentage  of air support requests met across customers ranged from a low of 76  percent for Border Patrol and OAM to a high of 90 percent for all other  federal agencies, as shown in figure 3. Border Patrol has control over  OAM mission support priorities in the northern and southwest regions,  and OAM has control over its priorities in the southeast region. To  increase transparency of ICE support requests, OAM, Border Patrol, and  ICE established a process requiring that ICE requests that are denied at  the field level be elevated to management.

For example, the Director of Air Operations at a northern  border branch said that the branch was originally slated to have 60 pilots,  but instead had 20 pilots. In addition, officials from two branches in the  southwest region told us they lacked personnel due to staff being away  for such reasons as temporary duty assignments, military leave, sick  leave, and training, among other reasons; they said these shortages were  negatively affecting their ability to meet air support requests. Further,  the Deputy Director of Air Operations for one southeast region branch told  us that when they received the new DASH-8 maritime patrol aircraft, they  did not receive the necessary increases in personnel to operate them,  and as a result, the branch could not fully utilize the capabilities of these  technologically advanced aircraft. According to the branch officials,  personnel problems were further exacerbated by budget constraints.", "OAM reported that it had taken actions to increase aircraft availability, but  the results of these efforts have not yet been fully realized. OAM created  an aircraft modernization plan in 2006 to replace aging aircraft, and  updated this plan in 2007 with a model of projected investments over the  next 10 years. OAM officials told us that due to changes in mission needs  and changes in the aviation market, as well as limited funding, they have  had to modify the plan and continue to maintain older and less  supportable aircraft, which require more maintenance.

For example, while Border Patrol and  ICE officials in a northern border location said they were satisfied with the  marine support they received from OAM, the Director of Marine  Operations for an OAM branch in the northern region said that it was not  feasible to provide a sufficient number of vessels and crew to ensure full  coverage of the maritime border, and that the greatest need was for  marine radar to queue marine assets to perform interdictions. An OAM  branch official from the southeast region said that while the number and  type of vessels met their needs, for a period of time, they could use their  vessels only about half of each month due to budget constraints limiting  fuel.

For  example, an official at one OAM marine unit in the northern region said  that sometimes the lack of marine personnel affects operational readiness  and that allowing for training and leave are consistently concerns.  Similarly, OAM officials from a southwest branch said that sufficient  numbers of personnel were not always available due to training, sick  days, annual leave, and reservists being called to active duty; and an ICE  official in a southwest border location agreed that OAM needed additional  marine interdiction agents. Lastly, an OAM survey respondent from a  marine unit in the southeast region said that although marine staffing was  increased in the past few years for new locations, the pre-existing  locations were short on manpower and a realignment of personnel was  needed.", "OAM headquarters officials reported that they have taken actions to  address capability gaps due to adverse weather. For example, OAM  officials told us that they purchased \u201call-weather\u201d vessels with enclosed  cabins, and that along with additional vessels acquired from USCG, they  will have sufficient assets to meet mission needs. Officials said that while  enclosed cabins do not enable OAM to launch in rough sea states, they  do enable marine agents to operate in cold weather. They said that while  larger vessels could reduce the impact of adverse weather on marine  operations, these vessels would not be capable of achieving sufficient  speeds to conduct interdictions or, if they were capable of maintaining  sufficient speeds, would be cost prohibitive.said they purchased marine dry suits and cold weather gear to further  address their ability to operate in adverse weather.", "In addition, OAM officials  In regards to personnel, OAM officials told us that with the rapid growth in  the marine program during fiscal years 2008 and 2009, OAM will be able  to meet its immediate needs for marine agents, but some of those hired  were still in the process of being trained and certified.", "OAM headquarters officials said unmet requests due to other mission  priorities are often the result of exigent and unanticipated requests for  marine support that are outside of the normal mission-tasking process,  and that they continually evaluate the need to re-assign marine assets to  meet evolving mission needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OAM Could Benefit from Reassessing Its Mix and Placement of Resources to Better Address Mission Needs and Threats", "paragraphs": ["OAM has not documented its analyses to support its resource mix and  placement decisions across locations, and challenges in providing higher  rates of support to high priority sectors indicate that a reassessment of its  asset mix and placement may provide benefits.

According to DHS\u2019s Annual Performance Report for fiscal  years 2008 through 2010, the primary and most important measure for  OAM is its capability to launch an aircraft when a request is made for  aerial support. In addition, DHS\u2019s May 2010 policy for integrated risk  management stated that components should use risk information and  analysis to inform decision making, and a key component of risk  management is measuring and reassessing effectiveness. OAM  assessed its effectiveness through a performance goal to meet greater  than 95 percent of Border Patrol requests for air support in fiscal year  2010, excluding unmet requests due to adverse weather or other factors  OAM considered outside of its control.

This occurred at both the regional and sector  levels. For example, while the southwest border was Border Patrol\u2019s  highest priority for resources in fiscal year 2010, it did not receive a higher  rate of OAM air support (80 percent) than the northern border (85  percent). At the sector level, while Border Patrol officials stated that one  sector was a high priority based on the relative threat of cross-border  smuggling, our analysis showed that the  sector had the fifth highest  support rate across all nine sectors on the southwest border.

For example, at two of the four  locations we visited, we found that a number of unmet air support  requests were not entered properly prior to fiscal year 2010. We also  found that many of the data entries for unmet support requests identifying  which agency an activity (e.g., flight) supported were left blank for fiscal  year 2010, including 16 percent in support of requests for air enforcement  activities and 93 percent in support of requests for marine enforcement  activities. In interviews with OAM officials, they said these blank entries  represented unmet support requests most likely in support of OAM.  Based on these limitations, we did not report unmet support requests by  customer for marine activities.", "We used the 2010 Air data from Enforcement Support Report 02 and  Miscellaneous Report 01 to replicate OAM\u2019s performance measure  calculation by branch.

We asked OAM and  USCG headquarters points of contact to identify the USCG units that  were most likely to be coordinating their operations in some regard with  proximately located OAM air and marine units. A total of 86 OAM and  USCG units were identified by the headquarters\u2019 points of contact and  senior officers from these units were asked to respond.", "The survey questions, although nearly identical, were tailored specifically  to each type of unit\u2014OAM air, OAM marine, USCG air and USCG  marine. OAM air and OAM marine were asked about the sufficiency of  their assets to perform certain types of missions; this was not included in  the USCG questionnaires, as it was considered outside the scope of the  engagement. The survey questions and summary results are included in  appendix II. The questionnaire was pre-tested with two OAM air units and  two OAM marine units. In addition, draft versions were reviewed by  cognizant OAM and USCG headquarters\u2019 personnel, and by a survey  methodologist at GAO.
