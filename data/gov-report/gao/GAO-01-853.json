The Navy, recognizing the shift in strategy from a focus on the global threat of the Soviet Union to a focus on regional challenges, developed a new strategic direction in the early 1990s, shifting its primary focus from open ocean, \u201cblue water,\u201d operations to littoral, or shallow water, operations closer to shore. The 1999 Maritime Concept added a new thrust, emphasizing the role that Navy combat power could play in ensuring access of joint forces to littoral areas.", "The Navy has made a concept known as network centric warfare the centerpiece of its efforts to transform its forces. Under this concept, a data network of advanced communications and computer technologies would be developed to connect different and widely dispersed forces into an effective, coordinated team. The Navy\u2019s transformation also means (1) using innovations to introduce new technologies and advanced concepts, doctrine, and organizations to increase the Navy\u2019s capabilities and (2) conducting organized events (experiments) to explore and validate the major force and operational aspects of those innovations.", "Because of the importance of military transformation and of the changing threats faced by the United States, we assessed the Navy\u2019s plans, processes, and initiatives to transform its forces to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

We are addressing this report to you based on your role in overseeing military programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The need to transform the military services has been widely recognized in a number of DOD policy papers, reports, and strategy documents. The national security strategy, the national military strategy, the Secretary of Defense\u2019s guidance to the services, the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s Joint Vision statements (2010 and 2020) all cite the need to transform U.S. armed forces to maintain military dominance in the new security environment.", "Over the last several years, the Navy has undergone some reorganization, shifted its science and technology funding, and undertaken a wide range of experiments and innovation activities. A key organization for carrying out the Navy\u2019s transformation has been the Navy Warfare Development Command, which was established in June 1998 to develop new operational and warfighting concepts to plan and coordinate experiments based on new concepts and to develop doctrine. The Command has been preparing a capstone concept based on network centric warfare that is to serve as a guide for future naval operations. The Command has also planned and coordinated a series of major experiments involving the fleets to evaluate many of the concepts and technologies associated with network centric warfare. Before it established the Command, the Navy did not have an organization dedicated to operational experimentation. The Command\u2019s fiscal year 2000 and 2001 budgets are about $45.3 million and $44 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2002, the Command\u2019s budget is projected to decline to about $41.7 million. Almost half of each annual budget is allocated to experimentation-related activities.", "Two other organizations important to transformation are the Naval War College and the Chief of Naval Operations\u2019 Strategic Studies Group. The college conducts war games that test concepts and potential technologies.Its close working relationship with the Navy Warfare Development Command provides an avenue for new concepts to be further evaluated and integrated into experimentation efforts. The Strategic Studies Group, comprised of a small group of senior Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard officers, generate and analyze innovative and revolutionary naval warfighting concepts and reports directly to the Chief of Naval Operations. Recent studies have centered on attacking land targets from the sea, future surface ship deployments, new crewing concepts, and multitiered sensor grids.", "In 1999 the Navy reorganized its science and technology resources into 12 future naval capabilities to focus more sharply on the capabilities needed over the next 10-15 years. Senior Navy and Marine Corps officials lead integrated product teams that prioritize individual efforts in the capability areas. The Navy\u2019s science and technology budget has remained relatively static over the last decade and has decreased as a percentage of its total budget. The Navy currently allocates about 35 percent of its science and technology budget to support its future naval capabilities. The Navy plans further refinements to its science and technology structure, including the possibility of adding or subtracting individual future naval capabilities. Appendix I provides further information on the future naval capabilities.", "Since March 1997, the Navy has also conducted nine fleet battle experiments. The experiments are assessed to determine which new operational concepts, tactics, and technologies prove workable and what follow-on experimentation to pursue. The Navy Warfare Development Command is also coordinating with other military organizations to jointly lease one or more dual hulled high-speed ships for a broad range of experiments. For 18 months starting in September 2001, the Navy will conduct a series of experiments to explore potential uses for such vessels, including amphibious lift, armament configuration, and helicopter operations. Appendix II provides examples of issues explored in the fleet battle experiments.", "Finally, the Navy conducts a wide range of innovation activities. For example, the Third Fleet has set aside a portion of its command ship, the U.S.S. Coronado, to test innovations related to command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence concepts. Appendix III provides some examples of these innovation activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Being Made, but Key Issues Require Attention", "paragraphs": ["The Navy is conducting a variety of transformation activities: it is experimenting with new technologies, it has made some organizational changes, it has introduced the new network centric warfare concept, and it is pursuing a wide range of innovations. However, the Navy has not developed an overarching, long-term strategy that integrates these activities or that clearly defines transformation goals, organizational roles and responsibilities, timetables for implementation, resources to be used to achieve its transformation goals, and ways to measure progress toward those goals. In other words, the Navy does not have a strategic plan and roadmap for its transformation that shows where it wants to go; how it proposes to get there; and how transformation will be managed, funded, implemented, or monitored. The lack of a plan and roadmap has contributed to confusion within the Navy and DOD about what constitutes the Navy\u2019s transformation.", "The adoption of an evolutionary approach to transformation has so far not led the Navy toward careful and full consideration of all the strategic, budgetary, and operational elements of transformation. Additionally, the Navy\u2019s progress has been adversely affected by insufficient support for new organizations responsible for leading transformation efforts, limited conduct of long-term experiments, and a variety of Navy-wide innovation activities that are not well coordinated and tracked."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Navy Does Not Have a Defined, Integrated Strategy for Transformation", "paragraphs": ["There is no clear consensus on the precise definition, scope, or direction of Navy transformation. In discussions with Navy and DOD officials and outside defense experts, we found there was some confusion about what constitutes transformation and about the role of the network centric warfare concept, which is the centerpiece of the Navy\u2019s transformation efforts.", "The Navy has not developed a plan that clearly identifies what transformation is and what its goals or components are. For example, although network centric warfare is clearly a fundamental concept for the Navy\u2019s future operations, the Navy still has not made it clear how the concept fits in with its many ongoing transformation activities or with its overall transformation efforts, what effects the concept will have on the types and composition of forces, or how the concept\u2019s many components will be integrated with each other or with those of the other services. The Navy plans to soon publish a capstone concept document for its future force. The concept document is expected to apply the tenets of network centric operations to the Navy\u2019s vision statements and identify some of the capabilities required to implement these tenets. Navy Warfare Development Command officials believe the concept document is critical to the success of the Navy\u2019s transformation, and they expect the concept document to be approved by the Chief of Naval Operations in the near future.", "Good management practices and the advice of defense experts both inside and outside the Navy suggest that a clear strategy is central to the success of transformation efforts. DOD and Navy officials and outside defense experts identified a number of benefits that can be obtained from strategic planning. Navy officials at headquarters and several commands stated that establishing an agreed-upon definition of transformation would be vital for explaining what constitutes transformation. Most Navy officials we spoke with believe that a strategic plan and roadmap would bring greater coherence to the Navy\u2019s transformation efforts. A strategic plan and roadmap would also provide the Congress with a means to evaluate and make optimal decisions on the Navy\u2019s transformation. The need for a strategic plan when attempting major organizational and operational changes, such as those the Navy is undertaking, has also been long recognized in the private sector as a best business practice.", "We discussed the need for a strategic plan and roadmap with a wide range of DOD and Navy officials and with outside defense experts, many of whom have been directly involved in advising DOD on military transformation. These individuals agreed that such a plan should clearly articulate the Navy\u2019s transformation goals and objectives, priorities, specific responsibilities, and linkages with other organizations, as well as the scope of activities and the resources necessary to carry them out. These management tools should also identify the challenges and obstacles that need to be addressed and should include understandable, simple, and reasonable metrics to provide ways to gauge progress, provide information to decisionmakers, and make necessary changes. Some Navy officials expressed caution that such a plan should not dictate a particular force structure but rather provide the elements of the process to guide the transformation efforts. Appendix IV provides additional information on the key factors for successful transformation planning and management.", "The same officials and experts said that further complicating Navy transformation planning efforts is the absence of clearly articulated transformation guidance from the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the military services. The Secretary and the Chairman have provided only broad guidance on the direction and progress of military transformation and on the types of future capabilities required for transforming the military. The responsibility for clearly identifying priorities and developing an implementation plan for their transformations has been left to the individual services. However, it is widely recognized that the success of future joint operations requires careful joint planning and integration. Various organizations, including the Defense Science Board, have cited the need for the Secretary of Defense to provide clear guidance on transformation. In 1999, the Board called for an explicit strategy, or a master plan; a roadmap; and outcome-related metrics to assess progress.", "In its annual performance plan, issued pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, DOD identified the transformation of U.S. forces among its performance goals. The act requires federal agencies to clearly define their missions, set goals, link activities and resources to goals, prepare annual performance plans, measure performance, and report on accomplishments. However, we recently reported that two of the transformation\u2019s three underlying metrics\u2014 procurement spending and defense technology objectives\u2014do not provide a direct link toward reaching that performance goal. Without such metrics, DOD cannot adequately assess its progress toward transforming its forces for the 21st century. The Navy would be expected to provide input to such a DOD effort and should therefore have its own clearly articulated transformation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approach Does Not Adequately Address Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has adopted what it calls an evolutionary approach to transformation, meaning that its effort is more about incremental changes in its force posture than in its force structure. The Navy believes that this is an appropriate path to follow since it already is an expeditionary, self- sustaining, and mobile force with worldwide reach. What it needs to do, the Navy asserts, is to improve its expeditionary capabilities by focusing less on the types of ships in its force structure and more on linking them together through data networks\u2014hence the network centric warfare concept.", "This evolutionary approach, however, has so far not led the Navy toward careful and full consideration of all the strategic, budgetary, and operational elements of transformation. Through its approach, the Navy has also allowed almost a decade to pass with slow progress in a number of key transformation areas. Without the benefit of an overarching strategic plan and roadmap, the Navy has not taken the steps necessary to explore the possibilities of long-term changes to its force structure and operations to adequately address near- and long-term security requirements within existing and projected fiscal parameters.", "There are at least three reasons why the Navy may need to adopt a more far-reaching and considered approach to its transformation: (1) it may not be able to recapitalize its existing forces at current shipbuilding rates, which might necessitate more fundamental changes in force structure and operations than it currently plans; (2) new operational concepts and technologies needed to operate in littoral areas may be coming into the force too slowly, given the increased importance of littoral operations recognized by the Navy; and (3) there are substantial technological challenges presented by network centric warfare that could take a long time and considerable effort to overcome. DOD in its comments to a draft of this report, stated that the evolutionary approach followed by the Navy for transformation was prudent and allowed the Navy to continuously improve its combat capabilities. It also stated that Navy transformation efforts, such as the Navy\u2019s fleet battle experiment program, have not excluded consideration of innovative force structures.

The high costs of supporting the current force, the time needed to acquire new ships, and the prospect of a continued mismatch between fiscal resources and force structure requirements increase the urgency of planning for and carrying out transformation. Although we did not make an independent assessment of the funds needed to maintain a force of 300 ships and its associated inventory of aircraft and supporting infrastructure, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Navy would require roughly $17 billion more each year for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 than it is currently expected to receive to sustain this force level. If current construction rates and funding levels remain the same, the Navy\u2019s force could decrease to approximately 260 ships or lower after 2020. Navy officials believe they face even bigger challenges. As part of DOD\u2019s July 2000 report on naval vessel force structure requirements, the Navy reported that its force needed to increase to about 360 ships over the next 15 to 20 years to better meet its total operational requirements and the national military strategy.", "The recent establishment of an Office of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs may help focus the Navy\u2019s attention on analyzing the potential for changes that might be needed to address fiscal concerns as well as current and future force structure requirements. In addition, the President of the Naval War College was recently chosen by the Chief of Naval Operations to lead a task force to analyze the force structure implications of operating the Navy on approximately the same budget level it now has.", "A senior Navy headquarters official agreed that the shortfall in funding and the mismatch between requirements and resources are major drivers for transformation.

We also found that unless current efforts can be accelerated or alternatives developed, it will be another 10 to 20 years before the naval services have the capabilities they say they need to successfully execute littoral warfare operations against a competent enemy.

Some elements such as the Cooperative Engagement Capability have recently deployed, while others are in the early stages of research and development and are years away from practical use. Most will rely on interoperability (compatibility with equipment used by the Navy and the other services) for their ultimate success.

For example, it is pursuing a comprehensive review and reorganization of the Navy\u2019s doctrine structure, and it is coordinating all major Navy fleet battle experiments as well as the Navy\u2019s participation in joint experiments. Its work on the capstone concept document based on network centric warfare\u2014the centerpiece of the Navy\u2019s transformation activities\u2014is nearing completion.

Atlantic and Pacific Fleet officials said that while they appreciate the intent of the Command\u2019s work, fleet personnel sometimes see the Command\u2019s experiments as disruptions to their everyday operations and do not fully understand how the experiments can benefit them. They explained that the fleets are focused more on immediate issues affecting operations and are therefore less receptive to activities that might be aimed at the Navy\u2019s longer term interests. A number of senior Navy officials said that the Command has had difficulty promoting its concepts to the fleets because some fear that new concepts could threaten support and funding for existing programs.", "Part of the difficulty of building relationships with other Navy organizations is that the Command is just 3 years old, and its mission is not well known throughout the Navy. During our fleet visits, we found that with the exception of fleet battle experiments, the Command\u2019s overall role, responsibilities, and relationships were not fully understood. Several senior Navy officials noted that the Command has not been afforded a high priority for staffing. For example, only 46 of its 60 authorized positions for military personnel were filled as of June 2001. The Command\u2019s detachments at the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets have several important responsibilities, including providing support for experimentation, innovation activities, and concept and doctrine development and acting as the liaison between joint and fleet organizations and the Command. However, they have only a skeletal number of authorized staff to carry out these responsibilities, and even these positions have not always been fully staffed. An official of the Command\u2019s Pacific Fleet detachment said that lack of personnel prevents the detachment\u2019s staff from attending key meetings and making visits to Navy organizations throughout the region. Officials at the Command\u2019s Atlantic Fleet detachment expressed similar limitations to involvement with organizations in that area. Additionally, the Command has been unable to assign a permanent representative to the U.S. Joint Forces Command to represent the Navy on joint experimentation issues.", "The Command has also had some difficulties with funding needed to support its activities. An official in the Command\u2019s Pacific Fleet detachment told us the detachment has had to rely on other Navy organizations, such as the Third Fleet, to provide funds for basic support such as office space, telephones, heating, and lighting. Plans for prototyping of ships and other weapon systems will require additional funds over the Command\u2019s current funding. Navy Warfare Development Command officials expressed concern that about 75 percent of the Command\u2019s research and development budget for fiscal year 2002 will be spent to support its portion of one single experiment\u2014the U.S. Joint Forces Command\u2019s Millennium Challenge.

The office\u2019s responsibility for balancing warfighting requirements with available resources could also provide a better means for the Navy to assess its resource priorities and make the necessary budget trade-offs between current and future needs. The Navy is also considering establishing \u201cmission capability packages.\u201d Rather than focusing on individual platforms (ships, submarines, or aircraft), the packages would examine requirements in terms of all the capabilities needed to perform a specific mission.

The Navy is also considering changing the Command\u2019s link to the fleet to provide the Command with more visibility and influence. One possibility under consideration is to place the Command under the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Fleet.

An example of this type of effort is the Navy\u2019s current plan to begin at-sea experimentation with a high-speed ship concept.", "Resource priorities also affect the Navy\u2019s ability to experiment and address long-term issues. The Navy has stated that operating a smaller force in a period of increased level of overseas operations has limited the number of ships it can assign to experimentation. It has worked around this limitation by conducting its experimentation, such as fleet battle experiments, as part of its major fleet exercises. Another resource issue is the limited staff available to support the Navy experimentation program. Since 1997, the Navy has conducted fleet battle experiments at the rate of two each year. In addition to drawing heavily on the staff and resources of the Navy Warfare Development Command and the fleets, the Navy believed this pace did not allow sufficient time to plan and prepare for experiments beforehand and assess the results afterward.

We reviewed the concept of network centric warfare with Navy officials at several organizations and offices responsible for developing and implementing the concept. To ascertain the Navy\u2019s experimentation and innovation efforts, we discussed the plans, content, and results with officials at the Navy Warfare Development Command, Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, and research and development organizations. To obtain information on the Navy\u2019s participation in joint experimentation efforts, particularly Millennium Challenge 2002, we met with officials at the U.S. Joint Forces Command and the Joint Staff\u2019s Joint Vision and Transformation Division. To be cognizant of the security environment in which the Navy is likely to operate its forces through 2020, we obtained an intelligence briefing from the Defense Intelligence Agency. To attain information on the Navy\u2019s investment in research and development to support transformation, we met with officials at the Office of Naval Research, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Although we did not include a review of Marine Corps transformation activities in our review, we did meet with a senior Marine Corps official responsible for the service\u2019s transformation to discuss coordination and joint transformation- related efforts between the two services.

These experiments have also enabled the Navy to assess how new technologies and approaches could enhance fleet capabilities and operations with joint and allied forces. The experiments rotate among the Navy\u2019s fleets and are scheduled to coincide with a major fleet exercise. Roughly $5 million is dedicated to each fleet battle experiment. This amount does not include the operation and maintenance funds expended by a fleet during the actual experiment.
