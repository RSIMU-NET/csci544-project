Wireless networks are generally composed  of two basic elements: access points and other wireless-enabled devices,  such as laptops. Both of these elements rely on radio transmitters and  receivers to communicate or \u201cconnect\u201d with each other. Access points are  physically wired to a conventional network, and they broadcast signals  with which a wireless device can connect. The signal broadcast by the  access point at regular intervals\u2014several times per second\u2014includes the  service set identifier, as well as other information. Typically, this identifier  is the name of the network. Wireless devices within range of the signal  automatically receive the service set identifier, associate themselves with  the wireless network, and request access to the local wired network.", "Wireless networks are characterized by one of two basic topologies,  referred to as infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode.", "Infrastructure mode\u2014By deploying multiple access points that  broadcast overlapping signals, organizations can achieve broad wireless  network coverage. Commonly used on campuses or in office buildings,  infrastructure mode enables a laptop or other mobile device to be  moved about freely while maintaining access to the resources of the  wired network (see fig. 1).", "Ad hoc mode\u2014This type of wireless topology allows wireless devices  that are near one another to easily interconnect.

Figure 3 depicts a sample of the saturation of  wireless networks we detected during our brief test.", "Wireless networks offer connectivity without the physical restrictions  associated with building wired networks. Though generally developed as  an extension to an existing wired infrastructure, a wireless network may be  stand-alone as well. The key reason for the growth in the use of wireless  networks is the increased bandwidth made possible by the 802.11 standard  and its successors. The implementation of the 802.11 family of standards  increased the data transfer rates offered by wireless networks, making  them comparable to those available in the wired environment.", "The 802.11 standard was first approved by the Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1997. IEEE\u2019s goal was to develop and  establish a technology standard that insured global interoperability among  wireless products, regardless of their manufacturers. This initial wireless  standard was useful for certain applications, but the data transfer rate it  specified was far slower than that of wired networks. Responding to the  data transfer rate limitations set by the initial standard, the IEEE released  several additional standards with the intent of increasing the transfer rates  and making wireless functionality comparable to that of wired networks.

In November 2002, NIST released Wireless  Network Security: 802.11, Bluetooth and Handheld Devices (Special  Publication 800-48), which is intended to provide agencies with guidance  for establishing secure wireless networks. The guidance recognizes that  maintaining a secure wireless network is a continuous process requiring  additional effort beyond that required to maintain other networks and  systems. Accordingly, NIST has recommended that federal agencies   perform risk assessments and develop security policies before  purchasing wireless technologies and anticipate that their unique  security requirements will determine which products should be  considered for purchase;  wait to deploy wireless networks for essential operations until after  agencies have fully assessed the risks to their information and system  operations and have determined that they can manage and mitigate  those risks;  assess risks, test and evaluate security controls more frequently than  they would on a wired network.", "Currently, NIST is in the process of developing a follow-up to this  publication, which will reflect the recent updates to the 802.11 network  standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wireless Networks Provide Benefits and Present Challenges to Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Wireless networks offer federal agencies two primary benefits: increased  flexibility and easier installation. Because wireless networks rely on radio  transmissions, federal employees can work in a variety of ways. For  example, users can take laptops to meetings, create ad hoc networks, and  collaboratively develop products or work on projects. In addition, if a  federal agency has installed a wireless infrastructure, users with wireless- enabled devices can work throughout the agency\u2019s facilities without having  to be in a particular office. Finally, an agency employee traveling with a  wireless-enabled device may be able to connect to an agency network via  any one of the many public Internet access points or hotspots found in  hotels or in commercial, retail, or transportation centers. This ability to  connect to the agency\u2019s systems via wireless networks can increase  employee productivity.", "Ease of installation is commonly cited as a key attribute of wireless  networks. Generally, deployments of wireless networks do not require the  complicated undertakings that are associated with wired networks. For  example, the ability to \u201cconnect\u201d the network without having to add or pull  wires through walls or ceilings or modify the physical network  infrastructure can greatly expedite the installation process. As a result, a  wireless network can offer a cost-effective alternative to a wired network.  In addition to their increased ease of installation, wireless networks can be  easily scaled from small peer-to-peer networks to very large enterprise  networks that enable roaming over a broad area. For example, an agency  can greatly expand the size of its wireless network and the number of users  it can serve by increasing the number of access points."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wireless Networks Present Additional Challenges for Federal Information Security", "paragraphs": ["Wireless networks face all of the information security risks that are  associated with conventional wired networks, such as worms and viruses,  malicious attacks, and software vulnerabilities, but there are significant  challenges that are unique to the wireless network environment.

For example,  wireless communications that are not appropriately secured are vulnerable  to eavesdropping and other attacks. Poorly controlled wireless networks  can allow sensitive data, passwords, and other information about an  organization\u2019s operations to be easily read by unauthorized users. In  addition, wireless networks can experience attacks from unauthorized  parties that attempt to modify information or transmissions. Table 1  provides examples of the different types of attacks that can threaten  wireless networks and the information that they are transmitting.", "Physical control of wireless-enabled devices takes on new importance in  maintaining information security. Areas of physical risk include the  placement and configuration of wireless access points and control of the  wireless-enabled device that connects to the agency\u2019s network. For  example, it can be difficult to control the distance of wireless network  transmissions, because wireless access points can broadcast signals from  150 feet to as far as 1,500 feet, depending on how they are configured. As a  result, wireless access points can and do broadcast signals outside building  perimeters. Figure 4 illustrates how poorly positioned or improperly  configured wireless access points may radiate signals beyond the physical  boundaries of the agency\u2019s facility or the range within which the agency  desires to send its signal. Wireless signals broadcast from within an  agency\u2019s facility that extend through physical walls, windows, and beyond a  building\u2019s perimeter\u2014commonly known as \u201csignal leakage\u201d\u2014can increase  an agency\u2019s susceptibility to the various attacks described in table 1 above.", "In addition to the challenge of signal leakage, it can be difficult for wireless  network administrators to track the physical location of wireless-enabled  devices. For example, in conventional wired networks, users are required  to physically plug in to the agency\u2019s networks via cable. This allows  administrators to determine where each device is connected. However,  with a wireless network, pinpointing a wireless-enabled device\u2019s location  can be difficult because the device is mobile.

Because of the affordability and  availability of wireless network equipment, well-meaning individuals might  install unauthorized wireless-enabled devices or wireless access points into  an agency\u2019s traditional wired network environment without the approval of  the agency\u2019s chief information officer. As a result, agency information  security officials might be unaware that wireless networks are being used  and would therefore be unable to take the appropriate mitigating actions\u2014 such as protecting against potential wireless attacks or preventing signal  leakage.", "The second challenge stems from the increasing availability and integration  of wireless technology into products such as laptops. For example,  agencies that are not seeking to install a wireless network may find that as  they purchase new equipment they are buying wireless-enabled devices. In  some instances, these devices are not available without wireless  technology. As a result, an agency may inadvertently procure wireless  network components that could pose risks to its enterprise.
