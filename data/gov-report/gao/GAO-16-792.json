GAO submitted, or attempted to submit, 18 fictitious applications by telephone and online. Ten applications tested controls related to obtaining subsidized coverage available through the federal Marketplace in New Jersey and North Dakota, and through state marketplaces in California and Kentucky. GAO chose these states based partly on range of population and whether the state had expanded Medicaid eligibility under PPACA. The other 8 applications tested controls for determining Medicaid eligibility. The results, while illustrative, cannot be generalized.

The federal Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace) or selected state marketplaces approved each of 10 fictitious applications GAO made for subsidized health plans. Although 8 of these 10 fictitious applications failed the initial online identity-checking process, all 10 were subsequently approved. Four applications used Social Security numbers that, according to the Social Security Administration, have never been issued, such as numbers starting with \u201c000.\u201d Other applicants obtained duplicate enrollment or obtained coverage by claiming that their employer did not provide insurance that met minimum essential coverage.", "For eight additional fictitious applications, initially made for Medicaid coverage, GAO was approved for subsidized health-care coverage in seven of the eight cases, through the federal Marketplace and the two selected state marketplaces.", "Three of GAO's applications were approved for Medicaid, which was the health-care program for which GAO originally sought approval. In each case, GAO provided identity information that would not have matched Social Security Administration records. For two applications, the marketplace or state Medicaid agency directed the fictitious applicants to submit supporting documents, which GAO did (such as a fake immigration card), and the applications were approved. For the third, the marketplace did not seek supporting documentation, and the application was approved by phone.", "For four, GAO was unable to obtain approval for Medicaid but was subsequently able to gain approval of subsidized health-plan coverage. In one case, GAO falsely claimed that it was denied Medicaid and was able to obtain the subsidized health plan when in fact no Medicaid determination had been made at that time.", "For one, GAO was unable to enroll into Medicaid, in California, because GAO declined to provide a Social Security number. According to California officials, the state marketplace requires a Social Security number or taxpayer-identification number to process applications.", "For both sets of testing, GAO submitted fictitious documentation as part of the application and enrollment process. According to officials from the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS), California, Kentucky, and North Dakota, the marketplace or Medicaid office only inspect for supporting documentation that has obviously been altered. Thus, if the documentation submitted does not show such signs, it would not be questioned for authenticity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) provides  subsidies to those eligible to purchase private health-insurance plans who  meet certain income and other requirements. With those subsidies and  other costs, the act represents a significant, long-term fiscal commitment  for the federal government. According to the Congressional Budget  Office, the estimated cost of subsidies and related spending under the act  is $56 billion for fiscal year 2017, rising to $106 billion for fiscal year 2026,  and totaling $866 billion for fiscal years 2017\u20132026.", "While subsidies under the act are not paid directly to enrollees,  participants nevertheless benefit financially through reduced monthly  premiums or lower costs due at time of service, such as copayments.  Because subsidy costs are contingent on who obtains coverage,  enrollment controls that help ensure only qualified applicants are  approved for subsidized coverage are a key factor in determining federal  expenditures under the act. In addition, PPACA provided for the  expansion of the Medicaid program. Under the expansion, states may  choose to provide Medicaid coverage to nonelderly adults who meet  income limits and other criteria. Under PPACA, the federal government is  to fully reimburse states through calendar year 2016 for the Medicaid  expenditures of \u201cnewly eligible\u201d individuals who gained Medicaid eligibility  through the expansion. According to the Office of the Actuary of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), federal expenditures  for the Medicaid expansion are estimated at $430 billion from 2014  through 2023.", "PPACA provides for the establishment of health-insurance marketplaces  to assist consumers in comparing and selecting among insurance plans  offered by participating private issuers of health-care coverage.

In July 2015, we testified on the final results of that work,  including the maintenance of the fictitious applicant identities and  extension of coverage through 2014 and into 2015, payment of federally  subsidized premiums on policies we obtained, and the Marketplace\u2019s  verification process for applicant documentation. You asked us to  continue to examine enrollment and verification controls of the federal  Marketplace and state marketplaces as well, for the 2015 coverage  year\u2014the second under the act. We testified in October 2015 on the  preliminary results of our undercover testing of the federal Marketplace  and selected state marketplaces, for application, enrollment, and  eligibility-verification controls, for both qualified health-care plans and  Medicaid, during the act\u2019s second open-enrollment period ending  February 2015. This report provides the final results of that testing and  includes formal comments from the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) and a marketplace in the selected states in response to  our findings.

We then observed the outcomes of the document  submissions, such as any approvals received or requests to provide  additional supporting documentation.", "Because the federal government, at the time of our review, operated a  marketplace on behalf of the state in about two-thirds of the states, we  focused part of our work on two states using the federal Marketplace\u2014 New Jersey and North Dakota. We chose these two states because they  had expanded Medicaid eligibility and also delegated their Medicaid  eligibility determinations to the federal Marketplace at the time of our  testing. In addition, we chose two state marketplaces, California and  Kentucky, for our undercover testing. We chose these two states, in part,  based on the states having expanded Medicaid eligibility and differences  in population.", "For our first objective, we used 10 applicant scenarios to test controls for  verifications related to qualified health-plan coverage. We stated income  at a level eligible to obtain both types of income-based subsidies  available under PPACA\u2014a premium tax credit, to be paid in advance,  and cost-sharing reduction. For our second objective, we used 8  additional applicant scenarios to test controls for verifications related to  Medicaid coverage.

We offered to brief Medicaid officials from New Jersey but they  declined our offer. To protect our undercover identities, we did not provide  the marketplaces with specific applicant identity information.

Based, in part, on that information, the  Marketplace will calculate the maximum allowable amount of advance  premium tax credit. An applicant can then decide if he or she wants all,  some, or none of the estimated credit paid in advance, in the form of  payment to the applicant\u2019s insurer that reduces the applicant\u2019s monthly  premium payment.", "Marketplaces are required by PPACA to verify application information to  determine eligibility for enrollment and, if applicable, determine eligibility  for the income-based subsidies or Medicaid. These verification steps  include validating an applicant\u2019s Social Security number, if one is  provided; verifying citizenship, status as a U.S. national, or lawful  presence by comparison with Social Security Administration or  Department of Homeland Security records; and verifying household  income and family size by comparison with tax-return data from the  Internal Revenue Service, as well as data on Social Security benefits  from the Social Security Administration.", "PPACA requires that consumer-submitted information be verified, and  that determinations of eligibility be made, through either an electronic  verification system or another method approved by HHS. To implement  this verification process, CMS developed the data services hub, which  acts as a portal for exchanging information between the federal  Marketplace, state-based marketplaces, and Medicaid agencies, among  other entities, and CMS\u2019s external partners, including other federal  agencies. The Marketplace uses the data services hub in an attempt to  verify that applicant information necessary to support an eligibility  determination is consistent with external data sources.", "In February 2016, we issued a report addressing CMS enrollment  controls and the agency\u2019s management of enrollment fraud risk for the  federal Marketplace. Based on our 2014 undercover testing for qualified  health plans and related work, this report included eight  recommendations to HHS to strengthen oversight of the federal  Marketplace. HHS concurred with our recommendations; however, it is  too early to determine whether HHS will fully address the issues we  identified. Our recommendations addressed issues also relevant to our  2015 testing described in this report, including studying changes to  improve eligibility determinations and the data services hub process;  tracking the value of subsidies terminated or adjusted for failure to resolve  application inconsistencies; implementing procedures for resolving Social  Security number inconsistencies; and conducting a comprehensive fraud  risk assessment of the potential for fraud in the process for applying for  qualified health plans through the federal Marketplace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Undercover Attempts to Obtain Qualified Health-Plan Coverage from the Federal Marketplace and Selected State Marketplaces", "paragraphs": ["Our undercover testing for the 2015 coverage year found that the health- care marketplace eligibility determination and enrollment process for  qualified health plans remains vulnerable to fraud. As shown in figure 1,  the federal Marketplace or selected state marketplaces approved each of  our 10 fictitious applications for subsidized qualified health plans. We  subsequently paid premiums to put these policies into force.", "As figure 1 shows, for these 10 applications, we were approved for  subsidized coverage\u2014the premium tax credit, paid in advance, and cost- sharing reduction subsidies\u2014for all cases. The monthly amount of the  advance premium tax credit for these 10 applicants totaled approximately  $2,300 per month, or about $28,000 annually, equal to about 70 percent  of total premiums. For 4 of these applications, we used Social Security  numbers that could not have been issued by the Social Security  Administration. For 4 other applications, we said our fictitious applicants  worked at a company\u2014which we also created\u2014that offered health  insurance, but the coverage did not provide required minimum essential  coverage under PPACA. For the final 2 applications, we used an identity  from our prior undercover testing of the federal Marketplace to apply for  coverage concurrently at two state marketplaces. Thus, this fictitious  applicant received subsidized qualified health-plan coverage from the  federal Marketplace and the two selected state marketplaces at the same  time.", "For 8 applications among this group of 10, we failed to clear an identity- checking step during the \u201cfront end\u201d of the application process, and thus  could not complete the process. In these cases, we were directed to  contact a contractor that handles identity checking. The contractor was  unable to resolve the identity issues and directed us to call the  appropriate marketplace. We proceeded to phone the marketplaces and  our applications were subsequently approved. The other two applicants  were accepted by phone.", "For each of the 10 fictitious applications where we obtained qualified  health-plan coverage, the respective marketplace directed that our  applicants submit supplementary documentation. The marketplaces are  required to seek postapproval documentation in the case of certain  application \u201cinconsistencies\u201d\u2014instances in which information an applicant  has provided does not match information contained in data sources that  the marketplace uses for eligibility verification at the time of application, or  such information is not available. If there is an application inconsistency,  the marketplace is to determine eligibility using the applicant\u2019s  attestations and ensure that subsidies are provided on behalf of the  applicant, if qualified to receive them, while the inconsistency is being  resolved using \u201cback-end\u201d controls. Under these controls, applicants will  be asked to provide additional information or documentation for the  marketplaces to review in order to resolve the inconsistency. As part of  our testing, and to respond to the marketplace directives, we provided  counterfeit follow-up documentation, such as fictitious Social Security  cards with impossible Social Security numbers, for all 10 undercover  applications.", "For all 10 of these fictitious applications, we maintained subsidized  coverage beyond the period during which applicants may file supporting  documentation to resolve inconsistencies. In one case, the Kentucky  marketplace questioned the validity of the Social Security number our  applicant provided, which was an impossible Social Security number. In  fact, the marketplace told us the Social Security Administration reported  that the number was not valid. Nevertheless, the Kentucky marketplace  notified our fictitious applicant that the applicant was found eligible for  coverage. For the four fictitious applicants who claimed their employer did  not provide minimum essential coverage, the marketplace did not contact  our fictitious employer to confirm the applicant\u2019s account that the  company offers only substandard coverage.", "In August 2015, we briefed CMS, California, and Kentucky officials on the  results of our undercover testing, to obtain their views. According to these  officials, the marketplaces only inspect for documents that have obviously  been altered. Thus, if the documentation submitted does not appear to  have any obvious alterations, it would not be questioned for authenticity.  In addition, according to Kentucky officials, in the case of the impossible  Social Security number, the identity-proofing process functioned correctly,  but a marketplace worker bypassed identity-proofing steps that would  have required a manual verification of the fictitious Social Security card  we submitted. The officials told us they plan to provide training on how to  conduct manual verifications to prevent this in the future. Further,  California officials told us in June 2016 that the marketplace is upgrading  its system in an effort to prevent use of impossible Social Security  numbers. In the case of applicant identity verification in particular,  Covered California officials told us they believed it was likely our  applicants had their identities confirmed because they ultimately  submitted paper applications, signed under penalty of perjury. That  attestation satisfied identity verification requirements, the officials said.", "As for our employer-sponsored coverage testing, CMS and California  officials told us that during the 2015 enrollment period, the marketplaces  accepted applicants\u2019 attestation on lack of minimum essential coverage.  As a result, the marketplaces were not required to communicate with the  applicant\u2019s employer to confirm whether the attestation is valid. In June  2016, California officials further told us the marketplace is updating its  application process to provide tools to consumers to help them determine  whether their employer-sponsored insurance meets minimum essential  coverage standards. They also told us the marketplace is updating  policies and procedures for sending notices to employers and developing  longer-term plans for an automated system to send notices to employers.  Kentucky officials told us after our 2015 testing that applicant-provided  information is entered into its system to determine whether the applicant\u2019s  claimed plan meets minimum essential coverage standards. If an  applicant receives a qualified health-plan subsidy because the applicant\u2019s  employer-sponsored plan does not meet the guidelines, the Kentucky  marketplace sends a notice to the employer asking it to verify the  applicant information. The officials told us the employer letter details,  among other things, the applicant-provided information and minimum  essential coverage standards. However, our fictitious company did not  receive such notification.", "After our 2015 testing, CMS, California, and Kentucky officials also told us  there was no process to identify individuals with multiple enrollments  through different marketplaces. California officials noted in June 2016 that  the federal government has not made data available that would allow  California to identify duplicate enrollments through different marketplaces.  CMS officials told us it was unlikely an individual would seek to obtain  subsidized qualified health-plan coverage in multiple states. We  conducted this portion of our testing, however, to evaluate whether such a  situation, such as a stolen identity, would be possible. CMS officials told  us the agency would need to look at the risk associated with multiple  coverages.", "Kentucky officials told us that in response to our 2015 findings, call-center  staff were retrained on identity-proofing processes, and that they are  improving training for other staff as well. They also said they plan to make  changes before the next open-enrollment period so that call-center  representatives cannot bypass identity-proofing steps, as occurred with  our applications. Further, they said they plan to improve the process for  handling of applications where employer-sponsored coverage is at issue.  Also in response to our findings, California officials said they are  developing process improvements and system modifications to address  the issues we raised.", "Finally, in the case of the federal Marketplace in particular, for which, as  noted, we conducted undercover testing previously, we asked CMS  officials for their views on our second-year results compared to the first  year. They told us the eligibility and enrollment system is generally  performing as designed. According to the officials, a key feature of the  system, when applicant information cannot immediately be verified, is  whether proper inconsistencies are generated. This is important so that  such inconsistencies can be addressed later, after eligibility is granted at  time of application. CMS officials noted to us in June 2016 that PPACA  and federal regulations provide for instances when an individual who is  otherwise eligible can receive coverage while an inconsistency is being  resolved. CMS officials told us the overall approach is that CMS must  balance consumers\u2019 ability to effectively and efficiently select Marketplace  coverage with program-integrity concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Undercover Attempts to Obtain Medicaid Coverage through the Federal Marketplace and Selected State Marketplaces", "paragraphs": ["For our additional eight fictitious applications for Medicaid coverage in  2015, we were approved for subsidized health-care coverage in seven of  the eight applications.

We also used publicly  available hardware, software, and materials to produce counterfeit or  fictitious documents, which we submitted, as appropriate for our testing,  when instructed to do so. We then observed the outcomes of the  document submissions, such as any approvals received or requests to  provide additional supporting documentation.", "Because the federal government, at the time of our review, operated a  marketplace on behalf of the state in about two-thirds of the states, we  focused part of our work on two states using the federal Marketplace\u2014 New Jersey and North Dakota. We chose these two states because they  had expanded Medicaid eligibility and also delegated their Medicaid  eligibility determinations to the federal Marketplace at the time of our  testing. In addition, we chose two state marketplaces, California and  Kentucky, for our undercover testing. We chose these two states based  on factors including Medicaid expansion; population size (selection of  California allowed inclusion of a significant portion of all state-based  marketplace activity); differences in population (California is about nine  times as populous as Kentucky); and progress made in reducing the  percentage of uninsured residents. Our testing included only applications  through a marketplace and did not include, for example, applications for  Medicaid made directly to a state Medicaid agency.", "For our first objective, we used 10 applicant scenarios to test controls for  verifications related to qualified health-plan coverage. Specifically, we  created application scenarios with fictitious applicants claiming to have  impossible Social Security numbers; claiming to be working for an  employer that offers health insurance, but not coverage that meets  \u201cminimum essential\u201d standards; or already having existing qualified  health-plan coverage. We made 4 of these 10 applications online and the  other 6 applications by phone. In these tests, we also stated income at a  level eligible to obtain both types of income-based subsidies available  under PPACA\u2014a premium tax credit, to be paid in advance, and cost- sharing reduction.", "For our second objective, we used 8 additional applicant scenarios to test  controls for verifications related to Medicaid coverage. Specifically, our  fictitious applicants provided invalid Social Security identities, where their  information did not match Social Security Administration records, or  claimed they were noncitizens lawfully present in the United States and  declined to provide Social Security numbers. In situations where we were  asked to provide immigration document numbers, we provided impossible  immigration document numbers. We made half of these applications  online and half by phone. In these tests, we also stated income at a level  eligible to qualify for coverage under the Medicaid expansion, where the  federal government is responsible for reimbursing the states for 100  percent of the Medicaid costs in 2015. In cases where we did not obtain  approval for Medicaid, we instead attempted, as appropriate, to obtain  coverage for subsidized qualified health plans in the same manner as  described earlier.", "To protect our undercover identities, we did not provide the marketplaces  with specific applicant identity information. CMS and selected state  officials generally told us that without such information, they could not  fully research handling of our applicants. We created our applicant  scenarios without knowledge of specific control procedures, if any, that  CMS or other federal agencies may use in accepting or processing  applications. We thus did not create the scenarios with intent to focus on  a particular control or procedure.", "Overall, our review covered the act\u2019s second open-enrollment period, for  2015 coverage, as well as follow-on work after close of the open- enrollment period. We shared details of our work with CMS and the  selected state marketplaces. We had additional discussions with federal  and state marketplace officials in June 2016.", "For both objectives, we also reviewed statutes, regulations, and other  policy and related information.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We conducted our related  investigative work in accordance with investigative standards prescribed  by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from Covered California", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Matthew Valenta, Philip Reiff,  and Gary Bianchi, Assistant Directors; Maurice Belding, Jr.; Mariana  Calder\u00f3n; Ranya Elias; Colin Fallon; Suellen Foth; Maria McMullen;  James Murphy; George Ogilvie; Ramon Rodriguez; Christopher H.
