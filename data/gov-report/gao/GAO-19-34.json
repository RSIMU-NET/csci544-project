Overall, most of the 72 surveyed agencies (85 percent) indicated that they have started planning how they will meet FRDAA requirements, and about 78 percent indicated that they have also started taking steps to implement the requirements.", "To assist agencies in implementing fraud risk management activities, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established FRDAA-related guidelines and a working group, as required by the act. However, agencies experienced challenges with OMB's guidelines and the working group, among other things, according to GAO's survey and roundtable discussion results (see figure below).", "Implementation guidelines. To meet FRDAA requirements, OMB updated Circular No. A-123 guidelines that govern executive agencies. However, this update included limited information on the methodologies agencies can use to assess, document, and report on internal controls required by FRDAA, according to GAO's review of the guidelines. Surveyed agencies had mixed perspectives on the usefulness of OMB's guidelines for implementing FRDAA controls. Similarly, agencies identified the lack of clear requirements and guidance as top challenges in GAO's roundtable discussion with 14 selected agencies.", "Reporting on implementation progress. Although not required by FRDAA, OMB updated annual financial report guidelines to include FRDAA requirements, but GAO found that the guidelines did not contain enough information to aid agencies in producing complete and detailed progress reports in 2017, the first year of reporting. Additional guidelines from OMB could help agencies produce more complete and detailed reports for 2019, the final year of required reporting. Without a longer reporting period, however, Congress may not have the useful information for continued oversight of agencies' progress.", "Working Group. OMB has taken steps to establish the working group, but GAO found the working group did not fully meet FRDAA requirements.

It is a contributor to financial and  nonfinancial risks that waste taxpayer dollars, threaten national security,  or put consumers at risk. Fraud\u2014which involves obtaining something of  value through willful misrepresentation\u2014continues to add to the improper  payments made by the government. In fiscal year 2017, agencies  government-wide reported $8.8 billion in confirmed fraud, although the  deceptive nature of fraud makes it difficult to detect, prevent, and  measure in a reliable way. We have previously identified indicators of  financial and nonfinancial fraud in a wide range of programs including the  Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Lifeline program, the Department  of Energy\u2019s contractors, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019  oversight of Medicare Part D, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives\u2019 firearm applications. Managers of federal  programs have the primary responsibility for reducing these risks and  ensuring program integrity. In addition, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) plays a key role in issuing guidance to assist federal  managers with combating government-wide fraud, waste, and abuse.", "To aid agencies and OMB in their efforts to reduce fraud risks, in June  2016 Congress enacted the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of  2015 (FRDAA), which created requirements for agencies to establish  financial and administrative controls for managing fraud risks. These  requirements are aligned with leading practices outlined in GAO\u2019s A  Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk  Framework), issued July 2015. FRDAA also requires agencies to report  to Congress on the status of efforts to implement fraud controls, identify  fraud risks, and establish strategies to mitigate both financial and  nonfinancial fraud risks. In support of agencies\u2019 efforts to establish these  financial and administrative controls, FRDAA required the Director of the  OMB, in consultation with the Comptroller General, to issue guidelines  that incorporate leading practices from GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework and  to form a working group to share practices, among other things. In  addition, as agencies take steps to implement FRDAA, they are doing so  in the context of other, related OMB guidance for enterprise risk  management (ERM) and memorandums directed at reducing burden and  the federal civilian workforce.", "You asked us to review agencies\u2019 and OMB\u2019s efforts to implement  FRDAA. Specifically, we examined: (1) federal agencies\u2019 progress and  challenges in implementing fraud risk management practices, including  those required by FRDAA, and (2) the extent to which OMB has taken  steps that complied with FRDAA requirements and that facilitated  agencies\u2019 implementation of the act.", "To determine federal agencies\u2019 progress and challenges in implementing  fraud risk management practices, we (1) sent information requests to 93  federal entities to determine whether their organization met the definition  of \u201cagency\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)\u2014and were thus subject to FRDAA\u2014and  then surveyed the 72 agencies that responded affirmatively; (2) held a  roundtable discussion with 14 agencies, selected from those that  responded to our survey; and (3) conducted a content analysis of  information reported in the fiscal year 2017 annual financial reports for  the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies. We report  information gathered from agencies in aggregate and do not attribute  survey, annual financial report, or roundtable responses to individual  agencies. We used this approach to better ensure agencies\u2019 participation  and candor in their survey responses and roundtable discussion. For  additional details on our scope and methodology, including a list of  agencies determined to be subject to FRDAA, see appendix I.  1.  We surveyed the 72 agencies subject to FRDAA from January 2018  through March 2018 to determine the status of their fraud risk  management planning and implementation efforts; challenges they  face in managing fraud risks and implementing FRDAA; and the  extent to which they followed fraud risk management practices  outlined in FRDAA, GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, and the fraud  risk principle (Principle 8) of the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government (Standards for Internal Control). All 72  agencies completed our survey, resulting in a 100 percent response  rate. Appendix II contains the survey questions with response  frequencies for each question.  2.  We held a roundtable discussion with 14 agencies\u2014selected  randomly within type and size categories described below\u2014to obtain  agency officials\u2019 perspectives on the strategies and activities they  used to establish fraud controls and related fraud risk management  activities and on the guidance and resources used to facilitate the  implementation of FRDAA, among other things. The selected  agencies represented a variety of organizational types and sizes,  such as executive-department agencies, independent agencies, CFO  Act agencies, and Small Agency Council members. The selected  agencies also varied in their FRDAA implementation status, based on  their responses to our survey. Through facilitated discussions, we  gathered information on the selected agencies\u2019 strategies and  practices. Roundtable participants also indicated their top challenges  while implementing FRDAA by ranking the challenges with votes, and  discussed potential solutions for those challenges. These results are  not generalizable to agencies beyond those that participated.  3.  We conducted a content analysis of fiscal year 2017 annual financial  reports for the 24 CFO Act agencies to assess the completeness and  level of detail these agencies provided about their progress with  FRDAA implementation. We selected these 24 agencies because,  among other things, these agencies met the definition of \u201cagency\u201d in 5  U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1) at the time of our selection and were therefore subject  to FRDAA, and were estimated to account for over 99 percent of the  government-wide improper payments in fiscal year 2015.  Specifically, we reviewed (1) the content and length of agencies\u2019  fraud-reporting reports and (2) the overall level of detail provided.  While the reporting requirements in FRDAA list three categories of  information, we broke out the unique requirements in each category  for our assessment into 11 reporting elements specified by FRDAA.  Each annual financial report was independently coded by one subject- matter expert familiar with fraud risk management and by a second  subject-matter expert familiar with each agency\u2019s efforts.", "We assessed each annual financial report\u2019s completeness by placing  it in one of four categories representing FRDAA\u2019s 11 reporting  elements: (1) fully complete when all 11 elements were present, (2)  mostly complete when 6 to 10 elements were present, (3) partially  complete when 1 to 5 elements were present and (4) not at all  complete, when no elements were present. We examined the extent  to which our independent reviews of the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 annual  financial reports were consistent between coders and found over 99  percent agreement on identification of reporting elements, reconciled  the 1 percent difference, and considered all coded material complete  when assessing the completeness and detail of the annual financial  reports.", "To determine the extent to which OMB has taken steps that complied with  FRDAA requirements and facilitated agencies\u2019 implementation of the act,  we (1) interviewed OMB staff and reviewed relevant memorandums,  circulars, and other documents related to FRDAA implementation and (2)  evaluated agencies\u2019 perspectives and experiences using OMB\u2019s  guidelines and other initiatives to implement the act.  1.  We reviewed relevant memorandums, circulars, and other OMB  documents such as Circular A-123 and compared these with the  requirements for OMB outlined in FRDAA. Additionally, we  interviewed staff from OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Financial Management  and Office of Personnel and Performance Management regarding  their development of guidelines, the FRDAA working group, and any  challenges they may have experienced implementing the act\u2019s  requirements.  2.  We obtained agencies\u2019 perspectives on and experiences with OMB\u2019s  guidelines and the FRDAA working group in order to assess the  usefulness of these actions for agencies\u2019 implementation efforts.  Collectively, we used information from our survey, annual financial- report reviews, and roundtable discussions, as described above, to  inform our assessment of the quality of OMB guidelines and other  efforts. We also interviewed officials from the CFO Council and  Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to get a  broader opinion about the effectiveness of OMB and agency efforts to  implement FRDAA.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Fraud risk exists when  individuals have an opportunity to engage in fraudulent activity, have an  incentive or are under pressure to commit fraud, or are able to rationalize  committing fraud. Although the occurrence of fraud indicates there is a fraud risk, a fraud risk can exist even if actual fraud has not yet been  identified or occurred. When fraud risks can be identified and mitigated,  agencies may be able to improve fraud prevention, detection, and  response. Managers of federal programs maintain the primary  responsibility for enhancing program integrity and managing fraud risks.

Most agencies (about 86  percent) indicated they use the results of monitoring, evaluation, audits,  and investigations to manage fraud risk. Fewer agencies (about 63  percent) indicated they collect fraud-related data for prevention. Agencies  also varied in the frequency with which they perform certain activities. For  example, of the agencies that indicated that they collect fraud-related  data for prevention, 44 percent indicated they do so regularly, while 18  percent indicated that they do so but not on a regular basis.

See appendix I (table 2) for additional information about these reporting  elements.", "The 24 CFO Act agencies each included fraud-reduction sections in their  annual financial reports as FRDAA requires but, at times, the  completeness and detail of reporting was limited because some reports  did not completely address all of the elements specified in the act.

In addition, some agencies did not report on their  progress in identifying risks and vulnerabilities with respect to payroll,  beneficiary payments, and other elements specified in the act.  Specifically, 12 of the CFO Act agencies did not report on payroll, 11 did  not report on beneficiary payments, 5 did not report on grants, 9 did not  report on large contracts, and 7 did not report on purchase and travel  cards. See figure 6 for an analysis of the inclusion of required FRDAA  reporting elements in agency reports.", "Variation in reporting on progress in identifying specific risks and  vulnerabilities could result from some agencies\u2019 determinations about  their applicability to the agency. For example, some agencies that  participated in our roundtable discussion noted that grant risks are not  applicable to their agency because they do not have grant programs.  However, this would not explain some areas of risk that are applicable to  all agencies, but were not reported, such as payroll. As discussed later in  this report, variation in reporting on progress in identifying specific risks  and vulnerabilities may also be partly due to some agencies\u2019 uncertainty  about what information must be reported.", "The reports also varied in terms of detail provided about agencies\u2019 efforts,  including specific actions taken to implement elements of FRDAA. For  example, one agency reported that its efforts to comply with the fraud risk  principle in the Standards for Internal Control included implementing  enterprise risk management (ERM) and establishing a policy for having a  common risk assessment tool to ensure consistency across the agency  and to determine appropriate mitigation strategies for risks identified in all  programs. Conversely, another agency reported that it updated an annual  entity-level control assessment to comply with this principle, but the  agency did not describe how this update achieved compliance. Without  this detail in the report, it is not possible to determine the extent of the  agency\u2019s implementation progress, as we describe later in the report.", "Further, most (16 of the 24 CFO Act agencies) included details about  financial fraud risks but did not address nonfinancial fraud risks. For  example, one agency reported it had low fraud risk and, as such, did not  implement any new controls in response to FRDAA. As support, the  agency provided examples of identifying no or limited financial fraud risks,  and concluded that it did not have fraud risks to address. The agency did  not discuss nonfinancial fraud. However, a 2016 GAO report identified  this agency as having vulnerabilities to nonfinancial fraud that present  national security risks. In addition, a 2017 report recommended that two  agencies responsible for a program with national security\u2013related  responsibilities conduct joint fraud risk assessments to obtain  comprehensive information on inherent fraud risks that may affect  program integrity; provide reasonable assurance that their controls  mitigate those risks; and ensure that fraud-prevention efforts target the  areas of highest risk. However, one of these agencies did not mention  nonfinancial fraud in its report. Further, neither agency identified this  program in their report. As mentioned in the Fraud Risk Framework,  nonfinancial fraud, such as fraudulently obtained credentials, can  potentially facilitate other crimes related to national security such as  international terrorism and drug trafficking. In addition, a leading practice  of the Fraud Risk Framework is that managers consider nonfinancial  effects of fraud, such as those related to the program\u2019s reputation and  compliance with laws, regulations, or standards.

Some roundtable participants also noted strategies for  mitigating some of these challenges. The factors agencies most  frequently indicated as great or moderate challenges in undertaking fraud  risk management activities include the following:", "Availability of resources. Agencies most frequently noted the  availability of resources, such as staffing and funding to conduct fraud  risk management activities, as a challenge to managing fraud risk.  About 75 percent of agencies indicated in their surveys that this was a  great or moderate challenge. Agencies that participated in our  roundtable discussion identified similar \u201cbandwidth\u201d concerns related  to staffing. For example, one agency noted the ability of staff to  manage multiple responsibilities\u2014such as conducting fraud risk  management activities in addition to daily program-related activities\u2014 as a top challenge, especially within smaller units of the agency.  Some agencies at the roundtable discussion told us that having the  authority to use program-integrity funding for fraud risk management  would help provide necessary resources to undertake fraud risk  management activities required by FRDAA. However, one agency  noted that this may not be a viable solution for all agencies, since not  all agencies may receive additional program-integrity funding to  conduct fraud risk management activities.", "Limited tools and techniques for data analytics. Most agencies  (about 68 percent) indicated that limitations in having and using tools  and techniques for data analytics were a great or moderate challenge,  according to our survey. Using data analytics to manage fraud risk is  a leading practice in the Fraud Risk Framework. While one agency at  our roundtable discussion told us that the agency does not have  software to assist staff in performing data analytics, other agencies  suggested leveraging free or existing resources to gain access to and  use data tools. For example, one agency representative described the  usefulness of the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Do Not Pay Business  Center. This agency representative noted that the Department of the  Treasury can proactively analyze agency data it has received and  share it with agencies. Another agency suggested that agencies ask  their shared service providers to provide data analytics, provide  insight, and benchmark against other agencies.", "Lack of available expertise. The availability of staff with expertise to  conduct fraud risk management activities also presents challenges for  agencies. Leading practices in the Fraud Risk Framework include  designating an antifraud entity that serves as the repository of  knowledge on fraud risks and controls and increasing managers\u2019 and  employees\u2019 awareness of potential fraud schemes through training  and education. About 56 percent of agencies we surveyed, however,  identified availability of staff expertise as a great or moderate  challenge. Agencies that identified this as a challenge also more  frequently indicated that they experience some other challenges  associated with FRDAA implementation, such as understanding  FRDAA requirements and implementation time frames; reporting on  implementation progress in the annual financial reports; and  sufficiency of other information or tools to aid in implementation.  During the roundtable discussion, some agencies also described  having a staffing gap where data-analytic skills were concerned. In  response to this challenge, one agency moved its centralized  antifraud unit to a newly created, more-experienced unit within the  agency to increase the antifraud unit\u2019s capacity to conduct data- analytics reviews.", "Access to data and information. A majority of agencies also  identified having access to data to look for fraud or fraud indicators as  a challenge. About 55 percent of agencies indicated that access to  data is a great or moderate challenge to their ability to implement  fraud risk activities. Agencies that participated in our roundtable  discussion also told us that access to data is a key challenge  associated with implementing FRDAA requirements. For example,  one agency stated that the Privacy Act presents a challenge to data  matching that may limit agencies\u2019 ability to share data with one  another, such as Social Security numbers involved in potentially  fraudulent activity that could cut across multiple agencies. This  challenge is not new. In our July 2013 report on using data analytics  for oversight and law enforcement and in our March 2017 report on  using data analytics to address fraud and improper payments, we  reported on similar perceived challenges from other agencies and  organizations regarding data sharing among agencies.", "Some agencies at the roundtable discussion also stated that they did  not receive information from their respective Office of Inspector  General that would help them manage fraud risks and implement  FRDAA. The Fraud Risk Framework highlights the role of the Office of  Inspector General in agencies\u2019 fraud risk management activities.  According to the framework, the Office of Inspector General itself  should not lead or facilitate fraud risk assessments, in order to  preserve its independence when reviewing the program\u2019s activities.  However, the framework notes that program managers and their  Office of Inspector General should collaborate and communicate to  help improve understanding of fraud risks and identify emerging fraud  risks, in order to proactively enhance fraud-prevention activities. While  one agency at the roundtable discussion identified the lack of  information from their Office of Inspector General limiting their ability  to address fraud risks, some agencies appear to be reaching out to  their respective Offices of Inspector General for this information.

Our  analysis of survey responses, roundtable discussion results, and  agencies\u2019 annual financial reports indicates that (1) agencies had mixed  perspectives on the usefulness of OMB\u2019s guidelines for agencies to  establish controls; (2) limited details in OMB\u2019s reporting guidelines  contributed to CFO Act agencies\u2019 incomplete and insufficiently detailed  annual financial reports; and (3) agencies had challenges implementing  FRDAA in part due to their lack of involvement in and lack of  communication from the working group. In addition to FRDAA, OMB has  issued guidance on other government-wide reform and burden-reduction  initiatives that could shape how agencies address FRDAA  implementation, such as reforms that may change the structure of  agencies and related programs or how agencies collect data used in  managing fraud risks. While it is still too early to determine the effect of  these broader initiatives on agencies\u2019 efforts to implement FRDAA, we  have previously reported that broader reform efforts can be leveraged by  OMB and agencies to address the high-risk areas and government-wide  challenges that present vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB Updated Existing Guidelines to Meet FRDAA Requirements, but Agencies Have Mixed Perspectives on the Guidelines\u2019 Usefulness", "paragraphs": ["To comply with FRDAA, OMB updated existing guidelines for agencies to  establish financial and administrative controls to manage fraud risks, but  agencies indicated having challenges with the usefulness of these  guidelines, according to our survey and roundtable discussion results.  Specifically, OMB incorporated guidelines to meet FRDAA requirements  into its July 2016 update of Circular A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility  for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control, within 90 days of  enactment, as required by the act. This particular update of Circular  A-123 introduced requirements for agencies to implement ERM and  integrate with existing internal control capabilities to improve mission  delivery, reduce costs, and focus corrective actions on key risks. The  update to Circular A-123 also included a discussion of the Fraud Risk  Framework and aligned internal control processes with the 2014 update  to the Standards for Internal Control\u2014such as the reference to the fraud  risk principle (Principle 8)\u2014which OMB staff stated provided agencies  with a broad context for why fraud risk management is expected of  agencies.", "According to OMB staff, including the reference to the Fraud Risk  Framework in the circular met the FRDAA requirement to issue guidelines  for agencies to establish financial and administrative controls to identify  and assess fraud risks. The guidelines have a section on \u201cManaging  Fraud Risks in Federal Programs\u201d that encourages agencies to develop  the same financial and administrative controls that are listed in FRDAA  requirements. This section also directs agencies to adhere to the leading  practices described in the Fraud Risk Framework as part of their efforts to  effectively design, implement, and operate an internal control system that  addresses fraud risks. However, based on our review of the guidance,  because FRDAA is never mentioned in the guidelines, there is a risk that  agencies may not be aware that the guidelines directly apply to  implementing FRDAA\u2019s requirement to establish financial and  administrative controls.

However, 40 percent of the agencies surveyed also identified the  sufficiency of OMB\u2019s guidelines as a great or moderate challenge in  implementing the act. Among other things, these challenges included  agencies\u2019 uncertainty about how ERM and FRDAA requirements differ,  given that OMB included the guidelines for managing fraud risk as a  subsection of ERM requirements.

Some agencies indicated that using  OMB guidelines for FRDAA implementation was a challenge, according to  our analysis of survey responses.

For example, some roundtable participants stated that  clearer requirements, such as information on what activities would be  considered compliant with the act, would be helpful to better implement  FRDAA. In particular, two agencies identified grants and contracts as an  area where additional guidance on managing fraud risks would be helpful.", "In contrast, a theme of the roundtable discussion was that there were  trade-offs in having clarity on the objectives and having the flexibility to  tailor requirements to different programs. One roundtable participant said that agencies had different definitions of fraud and that it would be difficult  to create standardized tools that met every agency\u2019s needs. In order to  better understand what steps they should take to implement the controls  required by FRDAA, two roundtable participants sought out alternative  sources of information to determine whether they were complying with  Circular A-123, such as a previously issued GAO report on the Fraud  Risk Framework. Other roundtable participants described using non-OMB  guidance to implement FRDAA, such as the ERM playbook developed by  the CFO Council and Performance Improvement Council, and materials  developed by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. While relying  on other sources of information can be helpful, agencies that do not have  knowledge of or access to additional resources such as these may not  have sufficient information to effectively implement the act. This point is  underscored by the 40 percent of agencies that identified the sufficiency  of OMB\u2019s guidance as a great or moderate challenge to their  implementation of FRDAA.", "Selected Agency Officials\u2019 Perspectives on  Office of Management and Budget Fraud  Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015  (FRDAA) Guidelines  \u201cI would like some clarification on the intent of  , like what will it achieve that the  other  A-123 or ERM [enterprise risk  management] is not achieving?\u201d", "Uncertainty about the difference between ERM and FRDAA  requirements. Many agencies are leveraging existing ERM processes to  implement fraud risk activities, according to our survey results, but OMB  guidelines were unclear on the relationship between FRDAA and ERM  requirements, according to our review of the guidelines and roundtable  discussion responses. Under ERM, agencies are required to assess the  full spectrum of an organization\u2019s risks, and identify those that are  enterprise-level risks. For enterprise risks, agencies are expected to rate  those risks in terms of impact and build internal controls to monitor and  assess the risk developments at various time points and incorporate risk  awareness into the agencies\u2019 culture and operations. Our survey results  indicate that more agencies (56 percent) are currently incorporating fraud  risk activities into broader ERM compared with before FRDAA enactment  in June 2016 (34 percent). Additionally, some roundtable participants  stated that they leveraged their existing ERM process and teams to  implement FRDAA\u2019s control requirements. While Circular A-123 directs  agencies to assess fraud risks as part of a broader assessment of  enterprise risk, it does not provide information on how ERM and fraud risk  management requirements differ. For example, it does not clarify that  FRDAA encompasses a broad set of actions that agencies must take to  manage fraud risks, regardless of whether the fraud risk is identified as  an enterprise risk.", "Additionally, Circular A-123 does not specify how to implement the  strategies identified in the Fraud Risk Framework within the context of  ERM. According to the circular, managers should adhere to the leading  practices identified in the framework and are responsible for determining  the extent to which the leading practices are relevant to their program.  Managers are also responsible for tailoring the practices to align with the  program\u2019s operations. While the Fraud Risk Framework does state that  the leading practices can be tailored, it enumerates four components and  overarching concepts that are necessary for an effective risk  management approach. These four components of the framework\u2014 commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt\u2014 collectively encompass the control activities for managing fraud risks and,  as outlined in the framework and Standards of Internal Control, should be  present in some form to be effective. Therefore, even if agency officials  identify fraud risks in a particular program that are not determined to be  enterprise-level risks, the officials are still responsible for designing and  implementing controls to address them and evaluating and adapting  improvements to these controls over time, in line with the Fraud Risk  Framework requirements. However, OMB staff informed us that if a fraud  risk does not rise to the level of an enterprise risk for an agency in the  ERM process, the agency may not go through all of the steps outlined in  the Fraud Risk Framework or required by FRDAA to assess and respond  to that risk. The Fraud Risk Framework acknowledges that agencies may  use initiatives like ERM efforts to assess their fraud risks, but it does not  eliminate the separate and independent fraud risk management  requirements of FRDAA.", "In response to our draft report, OMB staff stated that other parts of  Circular A-123 helped to fulfill their requirement to establish guidelines for  agencies to establish financial and administrative controls. According to  OMB, if agencies identify fraud risks that are not discussed in ERM, they  will still be addressed by the broader risk management requirements in  Circular A-123. These other sections of Circular A-123 existed prior to  FRDAA and therefore, were not developed in response to FRDAA\u2019s  requirement that OMB establish guidelines for agencies. However, our  review of Circular A-123 found that there are some references to  managing fraud risks that are in alignment with the spirit of the financial  and administrative controls identified in FRDAA. For example, other sections of Circular A-123 describe requirements for agencies to develop  a risk profile and state that agency risk profiles must include an  operational objective related to administrative and major program  operations, including financial and fraud objectives. Further, agencies  should identify the existing management process that will be used to  implement and monitor proposed actions to address the risks. However,  according to Circular A-123, these sections of the document define  management\u2019s responsibilities for ERM, which is focused on enterprise  level risks.

According to OMB staff, Circular A- 123 and its focus on ERM is the appropriate place for the FRDAA  guidelines because fraud is one type of risk an agency might face.  However, OMB staff noted that it is the agencies\u2019 responsibility to  determine how to implement the act\u2019s requirements in a way that aligns  with the agency\u2019s mission, and accordingly does not have immediate  plans to update Circular A-123 to provide more-detailed guidelines for  agencies to implement the financial and administrative controls required  by FRDAA.", "The Standards for Internal Control state that management should  implement control activities through policies.

In this case, OMB staff has  not provided evidence that it consulted with agencies on whether the  update to Circular A-123 met their needs in implementing FRDAA. While  OMB staff stated they held three solicitations for agency comments on a  draft update of Circular A-123 prior to FRDAA\u2019s enactment, they did not  obtain input from agencies on whether the updates provided the guidance  agencies needed to implement the controls in FRDAA\u2019s final enacted  requirements.", "Without input from agencies, OMB does not have the information it needs  to determine what additional guidance agencies need to effectively  implement the controls required by the act.

For  example, as previously mentioned, 12 of the 24 CFO Act agencies did not  report on payroll fraud risks, which are applicable to all agencies, and 16  did not report on nonfinancial risks such as effect on reputation and  compliance with laws, regulations, or standards. The agency reporting  requirement was intended to help Congress monitor the progress made  by agencies in addressing and reducing fraud risk, including the success  or failures of the guidelines created by OMB as a result of the act.  Similar to reporting requirements for improper payments, agencies\u2019  reports on their progress implementing FRDAA serve as important  oversight tools that can be used to evaluate agency efforts to make  needed changes to their processes and policies.

As required, OMB established  a working group within 180 days of enactment to improve the sharing of  financial and administrative controls and other best practices for  detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, including improper  payments, and the sharing and development of data-analytics techniques.  OMB also submitted to Congress\u2014but not within 270 days of  enactment\u2014a plan for the establishment and use of a federal interagency  library of data analytics and data sets to facilitate fraud risk management.  However, OMB did not initially include the CFO of each agency in earlier  working-group meetings, or, according to OMB, meet four times per year  in 2017 as required. The working group also did not effectively facilitate  the sharing of controls, best practices, and data-analytics techniques,  according to our survey results and roundtable discussion.

However, OMB did not do so within 270 days of  enactment, as required by FRDAA. According to OMB\u2019s letter, the  working group is taking a phased approach to develop the plan to  establish an interagency data library and took some steps, but identified  challenges in the process. When developing the plan, the working group  identified two challenges to developing the interagency data library: (1)  standardizing how agencies define fraud in their programs, and (2)  developing a fraud taxonomy to accurately compile fraud risks and  categories. According to the letter, to address these challenges, the  working group is creating a fraud-classification system that leverages the  existing Association of Certified Fraud Examiners fraud-classification  system. OMB\u2019s letter also states that the working group performed an  initial inventory of existing tools and materials that will be used to  populate the first phase of the library, which is currently located in the  OMB MAX Information System. According to the letter, the working  group is partnering with agencies to identify a permanent location for the  library as well as to develop future enhancements based on the needs of  agencies. OMB stated in the letter that it plans to provide Congress  additional information once the next phase of the library is implemented.", "Working-group composition. FRDAA requires the working group to  include the CFO of each agency.

In addition to the statutory  requirement, we have previously reported that early outreach to  participants to identify shared interests is a key practice for enhancing  interagency collaboration. However, OMB\u2019s initial working-group efforts  in particular did not include some CFO Act agencies or most non\u2013CFO  Act agencies subject to FRDAA, representing missed opportunities to  share practices and collaborate on ways to advance federal efforts to  reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. While the May 2017 letter to Congress  states that the CFO from every agency was invited to participate in the  working group, OMB staff later noted that only the 24 CFO Act agencies and the Small Agency Council representative from the CFO Council were  invited to the working-group meetings. OMB staff indicated that they did  not independently reach out to non\u2013CFO Act agencies to invite them to  participate because they believed the Small Agency Council  representative was responsible for communicating this information to its  members. Nevertheless, FRDAA requires the working group to include  the CFO of each agency subject to the act, as well as other parties  determined to be appropriate by OMB.", "According to our survey results, about half of the agencies subject to  FRDAA were not at all familiar with the working group and about two- thirds did not have an entity responsible for participating in it.

In particular, OMB and agencies provided  conflicting information about which agencies attended the working-group  meetings. For example, according to one CFO Act agency roundtable  participant, the representative was invited to the first meeting and not  invited to the next. The participant further stated that the agency recently  started to receive information from OMB.

Most CFO and non\u2013CFO Act  agencies indicated that their lack of involvement was a moderate or great  challenge to implementing FRDAA (see fig. 9). Agencies that indicated  having these challenges also more frequently reported challenges with  sharing best practices and data-analytics techniques about fraud with  other agencies, which was the purpose of the working group. The need  for this coordination underscores the importance of identifying shared  interests and developing collaborative solutions to help achieve  outcomes.", "OMB and the working group did consult with the Offices of Inspector  General on fraud risk matters, as required by FRDAA, by including them  in working-group meetings. In OMB\u2019s May 2017 letter to Congress, the  agency reported that the working group coordinated with the Council of  the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency and other interagency  working groups to discuss and share best practices in mission-specific  areas. In addition, two agencies\u2019 Offices of Inspector General are listed as  having attended the first four working-group meetings. This coordination  between the working group and Inspectors General\u2014who often identify  and investigate instances of fraud in agencies\u2014is a positive step for the  working group. Inspectors General may be able to provide agencies with  information that can assist the agencies in analyzing data for potential  fraud, such as fraud indicators.

FRDAA  requires the OMB Controller to serve as the chairperson of the working  group, but as of October 2018 the Senate has not made a confirmation  for this position. During the roundtable discussion, one participant shared  that there was a period when there was no OMB leadership and the  working group was largely silent for months. According to OMB staff, it  has also been difficult to establish agency membership of the working  group due to the lack of confirmed CFOs at some of the 24 CFO Act  agencies. As of September 2018, 7 of the 24 CFO Act agencies did not  have a CFO. However, OMB and the working group could have held the  required minimum number of meetings regardless of OMB and agency  vacancies, as evidenced by the seven meetings that were held in the  midst of these vacancies. Further, according to OMB staff, aside from the  first meeting led by the former Controller, all working-group meetings  have been led by the Deputy Controller and other OMB staff, while the  Controller position was vacant.", "Information sharing about controls, best practices, and data- analytics techniques. It is unclear whether OMB, as chair of the working  group, documented working-group meetings or any work products that  were developed to facilitate sharing information about financial and  administrative controls, best practices for fraud management, and data- analytics techniques. OMB staff stated that they do not have documented  minutes or notes from working-group meetings, but in August 2018 stated  that they uploaded work products to the FRDAA federal community site  on the MAX Information System website. However, apart from two  screenshots of the MAX website provided to us in February 2018, which  indicated that a fraud taxonomy was among the materials produced by  the working group, we were not able to obtain documentation of these  work products. We have previously reported that one key practice for  enhancing and sustaining agency collaboration is using plans and reports  to reinforce accountability for collaborative efforts. Without documented  discussions, plans, or reports for these collaborative meetings, OMB is  unable to share the lessons learned from the meetings with those who  cannot attend, and does not have a record of the plans and actions that  the working group has agreed to take. This documentation is also  important to maintaining the continuity of the working group\u2019s initiatives  when leadership changes occur within the agencies and OMB.", "With respect to the information that was shared at some of the initial  working-group meetings, roundtable participants stated that the topics  discussed were related to the interagency data library and the working- group plan required to be submitted to Congress, as OMB described in  the May 2017 letter. For example, some participants confirmed that the  first few meetings were spent discussing ways to establish a standard  definition of fraud, the implementation plan due to Congress, and the  difficulties agencies experience in sharing data. Our survey results  indicate that most agencies identified the sufficiency of information  coming from the working group as a great or moderate challenge in their  efforts to implement FRDAA (see fig. 10).", "Roundtable participants also identified data access and sharing, and  inter- and intra-agency communication and collaboration, as top  challenges for implementing FRDAA. We have previously reported that  collaborative mechanisms can be used for a range of purposes such as  information sharing. Without participation in appropriately recurring  working-group meetings and documentation to facilitate information  sharing, agencies will continue to miss opportunities to learn from each  other\u2019s experiences and share solutions for establishing financial and  administrative controls to prevent, detect, and respond to fraud risks in  their programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FRDAA Implementation during Broader Reforms", "paragraphs": ["OMB has recently issued guidance on other government-wide reform and  burden-reduction initiatives that could shape how agencies address  FRDAA implementation, such as reforms that may change the structure  of agencies and related programs or how agencies collect data used in  managing fraud risks. These changes may present challenges and  opportunities in establishing the fraud risk management practices outlined  in the FRDAA. As examples of these recent reforms, in March 2017 the  President issued an executive order requiring a proposed plan to  reorganize executive branch agencies. In April 2017, OMB provided  guidance to federal agencies for developing their reform and workforce- reduction plans, as required by the President\u2019s executive order. Executive  Order 13781\u2014Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive  Branch\u2014and other recent administration actions prompted OMB to issue  a memorandum (M-17-22), that required agencies to submit an agency  reform plan to OMB by September 2017. These reform plans were part  of the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2019 budget submission to OMB that included  long-term workforce reductions. In addition, OMB issued a memorandum  (M-17-26) that required agencies to streamline reporting requirements\u2014 an initial effort at removing duplicative, outdated reporting requirements,  with the goal of making the federal government more efficient and  effective.", "In March 2018, OMB released the President\u2019s Management Agenda,  which provided updated information on the status of government  reorganization efforts and is connected with these reform efforts. The  President\u2019s Management Agenda also identified a set of cross-agency  priority goals, required under the GPRA [Government Performance and  Results Act] Modernization Act of 2010, to target those areas where  multiple agencies must collaborate to effect change and report progress  in a manner the public can easily track. One of these collaborative  efforts is focused on reducing the amount of dollars lost to taxpayers  through improper payments, including payments resulting from fraud. In  addition to the President\u2019s Management Agenda, OMB was required by  the March 2017 executive order to develop a comprehensive  government-wide reform plan, including, as appropriate,  recommendations for both legislative proposals and administrative  actions based on agency reform plans, OMB-coordinated crosscutting  proposals, and public input.", "In June 2018, OMB released the government-wide reform plan, which  consists of government-wide reorganization and reform proposals with  the goal of increasing focus on integrated mission, service, and  stewardship delivery. While it is too early to tell whether or how all of  these reforms will affect agencies\u2019 efforts to implement FRDAA, we have  previously reported that OMB and agencies can leverage these broader  reform efforts to address the high-risk areas and government-wide  challenges that present vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement, or are in need of transformation. We surveyed the 72  agencies about whether their plans to implement reforms have had an  effect on their efforts to implement FRDAA. About 83 percent of the  agencies surveyed reported that they did not address aspects of their  fraud risk management in their agency reform plans. Further, OMB  reported to us that these plans are still evolving, and have not yet been  finalized. However, as we have previously reported, OMB and agencies  can consider whether (1) the agency has addressed ways to decrease  the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse of programs as part of its proposed  reforms and (2) the size of the workforce or resources dedicated to fraud  risk management activities may be affected by any of the organizational  reforms or efforts to reduce burden, and to make decisions with these  considerations in mind."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Fraud is one contributor to financial and nonfinancial risks that cost  taxpayers dollars, threaten national security, or put consumers at risk.  Therefore, agencies must take a more-rigorous preventive approach to  managing the risk of fraud in their programs. Compliance with FRDAA  provisions can support these efforts. We recognize that effective  implementation of the act will take time, and each program and agency  may evolve at a different pace. While a small number of agencies  reported being mature in their implementation of FRDAA activities, most  are in the process of developing key fraud risk activities, and others have  yet to start developing them. Wherever agencies fall on this spectrum, it is  important that they continue taking actions to enhance their ability to  prevent, detect, and respond to fraud risks in their programs and  operations.", "OMB plays an important role in supporting agencies\u2019 efforts to manage  fraud risks by providing clear guidelines and facilitating agencies\u2019  involvement with the working group. OMB has taken steps to assist  agencies, such as updating ERM guidelines and chairing working-group  meetings, but improvements to these efforts could better facilitate  agencies\u2019 abilities to implement the act. Specifically, agencies reported  the need for additional guidance and clarity on the actions they should  take to effectively establish the required controls and report their progress  on implementation of the act\u2019s requirements, uncertainty about the  difference between ERM and FRDAA requirements, and the need for  more involvement and information from the working group.

However, the  progress reports submitted by agencies as part of their annual financial  reports were incomplete and lacked detailed information to effectively  inform Congress of agencies\u2019 implementation status. Further, agencies  are only required to report their progress in implementing the  requirements of FRDAA through fiscal year 2019. However, it is not clear  that more-complete information will be reported by then. Until OMB  provides additional guidelines directing agencies to report more-complete  and more-detailed information related to both financial and nonfinancial  risks, agencies may continue to produce incomplete information on their  fraud risk management activities.

OMB  staff provided oral comments that disagreed with our three  recommendations, which we summarize below. OMB staff also provided  technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "OMB disagreed with our first recommendation that it should enhance the  guidelines for agencies to establish the controls required by FRDAA by  clarifying the difference between FRDAA and ERM requirements, and  through collaboration with agencies to determine what additional  information agencies need to implement the controls. According to OMB  staff, Circular A-123 incorporates all of the guidance that agencies need  to implement FRDAA and, outside of the current guidance in Circular A- 123 which OMB staff stated incorporates both GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control and GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, agencies are in the  best position to make decisions about how they should implement  FRDAA.  Further, OMB staff stated that they did not believe that our  survey of the 72 agencies and the roundtable with the 14 agencies  provided sufficient evidence that a change in their guidance is needed  because these responses are based on agencies\u2019 opinions.", "While Circular A-123 contains a section on Managing Fraud Risks in  Federal Programs, we identified important limitations to that section of  guidance in our report. In its comments on our report, OMB staff stated  that other parts of Circular A-123 provide guidance on FRDAA  requirements. These sections of Circular A-123 existed prior to FRDAA  and therefore, were not developed in response to FRDAA\u2019s requirement  that OMB establish guidelines for agencies. Our review of Circular A-123  found that there are some references to managing fraud risks that are in  alignment with the financial and administrative controls identified in  FRDAA, and therefore we incorporated that additional information into our  report. However, as we reported, agencies stated that they needed  additional guidance on how to effectively establish the controls required  by FRDAA. OMB was required by FRDAA to establish guidelines.  Specifically, lack of guidance and unclear requirements were identified as  top challenges during the roundtable discussion, and the sufficiency of  OMB\u2019s guidelines was a challenge for 40 percent of the agencies we  surveyed. OMB staff stated that they did not believe that our survey and  roundtable results are sufficient evidence to warrant a change in their  guidance because these responses are based on agencies\u2019 opinions.  However, because the purpose of OMB\u2019s guidance is to assist agencies  in implementing the administrative controls required by FRDAA, agencies\u2019  experiences and perspectives on the sufficiency of the guidance is an  essential part of assessing its effectiveness. Therefore, we reiterate the  positions expressed by many agencies that they do not have sufficient  guidance on implementing FRDAA requirements related to the  establishment of financial and administrative controls. As a result, our  recommendation on improving this guidance is still warranted.", "OMB also disagreed with our second recommendation that it should  enhance FRDAA reporting guidelines by directing agencies to report  complete and detailed information on each of the reporting elements  specified by FRDAA, which should include information related to financial  and nonfinancial fraud. According to OMB staff, Circular A-136 is  sufficient guidance because it includes the requirements stated in  FRDAA, and incorporating this guidance into Circular A-136 was not a  requirement of the act. Although not required by FRDAA, OMB\u2019s  guidance to agencies on FRDAA reporting is important because these  reports can be used to evaluate agency efforts to make changes to their  processes and policies. OMB Circular A-136 establishes reporting  guidance for executive branch entities required to submit agency financial  reports, among other things. Agencies were required to report on their  progress implementing FRDAA in these reports. However, FRDAA  provides high-level information on what should be included in agency  reports, not operational guidance on how to address the reporting  requirements, which is typically outlined in executive guidance to  agencies. Consequently, the initiative that OMB took to provide guidance  on FRDAA in Circular A-136 was an important step in the right direction.  However we found that the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 annual financial reports  for 2017 were incomplete and lacked details, which can be attributed in  part to the limited guidance provided by OMB. We found that 31 percent  of surveyed agencies indicated that reporting on FRDAA progress was a  great or moderate challenge. The agency reporting requirement was  intended to help Congress monitor the progress made by agencies in  addressing and reducing fraud risks, including the success and failures of  the guidelines created by OMB as a result of the act. Therefore, our  recommendation to improve OMB\u2019s reporting guidelines is still  appropriate.", "OMB also disagreed with our third recommendation that it should ensure  that the FRDAA working group\u2019s composition meets the act\u2019s  requirements by involving the CFO of all agencies subject to the act by  inviting them to participate or otherwise providing access and input into  the working group, and ensuring mechanisms to share controls, best  practices, and data-analytics techniques are in place. According to OMB  staff, they disagreed because they believe that OMB provided an  opportunity for all agencies to attend the working group meeting and they  have held four working group meetings in 2018. However, evidence  submitted by OMB throughout our review and agencies\u2019 responses to our  survey indicate that not all agencies had the opportunity to participate in  the working group. The working group was required to include the CFOs  of every agency subject to FRDAA, including those that are not subject to  the CFO Act. However, 71 percent of non\u2013CFO Act agencies were not at  all familiar with the working group, and ninety percent did not have a  designated person or entity that participated in the working group,  according to our survey. Moreover, 21 percent of CFO Act agencies,  which represent the largest federal agencies, were not at all familiar with  the working group, and 29 percent did not have a designated person or  entity that participated in it, according to our survey results, as of March  2018. To ensure that we obtained information from the right contacts  regarding agency participation, we surveyed the CFO or the CFO\u2019s  designee of each agency subject to FRDAA. During our audit, OMB  indicated that it did not have a list of CFO contacts for all agencies  subject to the act, and requested that we share our list of contacts. We  have agreed to do so consistent with our protocols, upon public release of  the report. Given our findings, our recommendation for OMB to ensure  that every agency is then given the opportunity to participate is still  warranted.", "Our survey results also indicated that most agencies identified the  sufficiency of information coming from the working group as a great or  moderate challenge in their efforts to implement FRDAA. Further, OMB  staff stated that they do not have documented minutes or notes from  working-group meetings. As we stated in our report, without documented  discussions, plans, or reports for these collaborative meetings, OMB is  unable to share the lessons learned from the meetings with those who  cannot attend, and does not have a record of the plans and actions that  the working group has agreed to take. This documentation is also  important to maintaining the continuity of the working group\u2019s initiatives  when leadership changes occur within the agencies and OMB.

Therefore, we  believe that our recommendation on ensuring mechanisms are in place to  share controls, best practices, and data-analytics techniques is still  warranted. Finally, although OMB did not hold the required number of  meetings per year in 2017, it has done so for fiscal year and calendar  year 2018, as of November 2018.

Agreement among coders  exceeded 99 percent across all of the coding categories. On the basis of  this high level of agreement between coders, we are confident that our  content analysis represents an objective, accurate, and consistent  assignment of these coding categories.
