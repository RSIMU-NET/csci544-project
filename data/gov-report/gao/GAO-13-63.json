The bureau has long used some form of automation to tabulate the data it collects. Critical to the bureau\u0092s ability to perform these duties are its information systems and the protection of the information they contain. A data breach could result in the public\u0092s loss of confidence in the bureau\u0092s and could affect its ability to collect census data.", "Because of the importance of protecting information and systems at the bureau, GAO was asked to determine whether the agency has effectively implemented appropriate information security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support its mission. To do this, GAO tested security controls over the bureau\u0092s key networks and systems; reviewed policies, plans, and reports; and interviewed officials at bureau headquarters and field offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the Census Bureau has taken steps to safeguard the information and systems that support its mission, it has not effectively implemented appropriate information security controls to protect those systems. Many of the deficiencies relate to the security controls used to regulate who or what can access the bureau's systems (access controls). For example, the bureau did not adequately: control connectivity to key network devices and servers; identify and authenticate users; limit user access rights and permissions to only those necessary to perform official duties; encrypt data in transmission and at rest; monitor its systems and network; or ensure appropriate physical security controls were in place. Without adequate controls over access to its systems, the bureau cannot be sure that its information and systems are protected from intrusion.", "In addition to access controls, implementing other important security controls including policies, procedures, and techniques to implement system configurations and plan for and manage unplanned events (contingency planning) helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. While the Census Bureau had documented policies and procedures for managing and implementing configuration management controls, key communication systems were not securely configured and did not have proper encryption. Further, while the bureau has taken steps to implement guidance for contingency planning such as developing plans for mitigating disruptions to its primary data center through the use of emergency power, fire suppression, and storing backup copies of data for its critical systems offsite at a secured location, it only partially satisfied other requirements for contingency planning such as distributing the plan to key personnel and identifying potential weaknesses during disaster testing. Without an effective and complete contingency plan, an agency's likelihood of recovering its information and systems in a timely manner is diminished.", "An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that the Census Bureau has not fully implemented a comprehensive information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained. Specifically, the Census Bureau had begun implementing a new risk management framework with a goal of better management visibility of information security risks, but the framework did not fully document identified information security risks. Also, the bureau had not updated certain security management program policies, adequately enforced user requirements for security and awareness training, and implemented policies and procedures for incident response. Until the bureau implements a complete and comprehensive security program, it will have limited assurance that its information and systems are being adequately protected against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, disruption, or loss."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 13 recommendations to the Census Bureau to enhance its agencywide information security program and, in a separate report with limited distribution, making an additional 102 recommendations.

For  nearly 100 years, census data were tabulated by clerks who made tally  marks or added columns of figures with a pen or a pencil. As the nation  grew and there were more people, items, and characteristics to count,  speedier tabulation methods had to be invented or the results of one  census would not be processed before it was time for the next one. In  1880, the bureau used a \u201ctabulating machine\u201d\u2014a wooden box in which a  roll of paper was threaded past an opening where a clerk marked the  tallies in various columns and then added up the marks when the roll was  full\u2014which made tabulating at least twice as fast as the previously-used  manual processes.", "By 1950, mechanical tabulating improved to 2,000 items per minute. In  1951, the bureau used the first large-scale electronic computer, UNIVAC  I, designed and built specifically for its use. This machine was able to  tabulate 4,000 items per minute. Beginning in 1970, the bureau took  advantage of new high-speed equipment that converted data on  computer tape directly to words and numbers on off-set negative film  used in publishing. Then, in the mid-1980s, statistics were made available  on diskettes for use in microcomputers and users were able to obtain  statistics online. In the later 1980s, the bureau began testing CD-ROM  (compact disc/read-only memory) laser disks as a medium for releasing  data.", "The 2000 census demonstrated probably the biggest leap forward in the  use of technology for collecting and disseminating data. The bureau\u2019s  previous response scanning system (which dated to the 1950s) was  replaced with optical character recognition technology, allowing the  bureau to design a respondent-friendly (instead of machine-friendly)  questionnaire in which write-in responses could also be captured  electronically. In addition, the bureau\u2019s previous online data system from  the 1990s evolved into online data available through the Census Bureau\u2019s  website.

The 2010 Decennial Census, at $13 billion, was the most  expensive U.S. census in history. One reason for this was the greater- than-anticipated use of paper-based processing due to performance  issues with key IT systems, which increased the price of the census by  almost $3 billion. Based on these past trends, the cost of the next  decennial census could reach approximately $25 billion, although, thus  far, the bureau is planning to spend roughly $12 to $18 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title 13 Protects Sensitive Census Bureau Information", "paragraphs": ["For many years, each decennial census was conducted pursuant to a  specific act of Congress. In 1954, that body of acts was brought together  in Title 13 of the United States Code, the laws under which the Census  Bureau operates. Title 13 spells out the basic scope of the censuses and  surveys, the requirements for the public to provide information as well as  for the Census Bureau to keep that information confidential, and the  penalties for violating these obligations. Specifically, the bureau may not  disclose or publish any private information that identifies an individual or  business, such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and  telephone numbers. Other federal laws, including the Confidential  Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 and the  Privacy Act of 1974, reinforce these protections.", "According to bureau documentation, the bureau takes several steps to  protect the public\u2019s personal information. For example, it displays its data  protection and privacy principles on its website, pledges to remove  personally identifiable information\u2014such as names, telephone numbers,  and addresses\u2014from data files, and uses various approaches to protect  personal information, including computer technologies, statistical  methodologies, and security procedures. For example, according to the  bureau, names and addresses are removed from forms, the remaining  information is transferred to a machine readable form, and the original  questionnaires are then destroyed. Before any census tabulation is  published, it is checked to make certain that no individual, household, or  organization can be identified, and that information cannot be inferred by  reading the table or by analyzing the figures it contains. Every person  who works with the bureau\u2019s confidential information takes an oath to  uphold the law.

Unnecessary connectivity to an organization\u2019s  network increases not only the number of access paths that must be  managed and the complexity of the task, but also the risk of unauthorized  access in a shared environment. NIST guidance states that agencies  should provide adequate protection for networks and employ information  control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of  information between designated sources and destinations within  information systems. The National Security Agency (NSA) provides  leading practices that agencies may adopt for securing and configuring  information systems. These practices include establishing a dedicated  management network, also called an out-of-band network, to provide  several benefits, such as allowing parallel management of all devices,  fault analysis, and recovery and recommend against the use of  unencrypted protocols to manage IT infrastructure.", "The Census Bureau had taken steps to protect network boundaries. For  example, the bureau used firewalls to protect its network from unwanted  Internet intrusions. The bureau had also implemented an intrusion  detection system on key network segments to monitor for malicious  network activity.", "However, the bureau did not sufficiently control connectivity to key  network devices and servers. Specifically, the bureau did not protect  access to its network devices and servers by using a separate dedicated  network for centralized management and administration of many network  devices and servers. Rather, various bureau management activities were  on the general network and therefore were more vulnerable to  compromise because of the broader access to the general network. In the  event that the bureau\u2019s general network is compromised, there is an  increased risk that the bureau may not be able to manage its systems or  even detect an attack. In addition, the bureau was using insecure  protocols to manage its IT infrastructure, placing sensitive data such as  administrative user accounts and passwords at risk of compromise.", "A computer system must be able to identify and authenticate different  users so that activities on the system can be linked to a specific  individual. When an organization assigns a unique user account to a  specific user, the system is able to distinguish that user from another\u2014a  process called identification. The system must also establish the validity  of a user\u2019s claimed identity by requesting some kind of information, such  as a password, that is known only by the user\u2014a process known as  authentication. The combination of identification and authentication\u2014such  as a user account/password combination\u2014provides the basis for  establishing individual accountability and for controlling access to the  system. NIST 800-53 guidelines recommend that information systems  uniquely identify and authenticate all users (or processes on behalf of  users) and that systems be set to establish complex passwords to reduce  the likelihood of a successful attack. Census Bureau policy also requires  minimum standards for password parameters such as complexity,  minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions, reuse, and account lock out.", "Furthermore, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines direct  federal agencies to use multifactor authentication for remote access to  agency systems and NIST guidelines recommend that when using  cryptographic keys for authentication, the authentication process prove  possession and control of the encryption key. Typically, this requires that  the key be encrypted using some form of activation data such as a  password. Additionally, bureau policy states that encryption keys should  be changed periodically. NIST guidelines also recommend that, before  devices establish a connection, they should be identified and  authenticated.", "Finally, in February 2011, OMB directed agencies to issue  implementation policies for personal identity verification cards (PIV), used  to verify employee identity, by March 31, 2011. Agencies were required  to use PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for  physical and logical access to agency facilities, networks, and information  systems. A PIV card must contain the personally identifiable information  for the employee or individual to which it is issued and allow identification  to be verified by both a human and an automated system.", "However, the Census Bureau did not identify and authenticate all its  systems and devices and its implementation of PIV cards was not  complete.

For example, operating systems have  some built-in authorization features such as permissions for files and  folders. Network devices, such as routers, have access control lists that  can be used to authorize a user who can access and perform certain  actions on the device. A key component of granting or denying access  rights is the concept of \u201cleast privilege.\u201d Least privilege is a basic principle  for securing computer resources and information. This principle means  that a user is granted only those access rights and permissions needed to  perform official duties.

NSA network security leading practices  recommend prohibiting the root account from logging directly into a  remote system and creating a set of filtering rules, also known as an  access control list, which permits the traffic identified on the list and  prohibits other traffic. NSA leading practices also recommend disabling  the use of insecure protocols that permit excessive access.", "Although the Census Bureau had established an access control  requirement based on least privilege and need-to-know principles, the  bureau did not always limit user access rights and permissions to only  those necessary to perform official duties. For example, unneeded  administrative privileges had been granted to certain users on a key  bureau infrastructure system and several of the system\u2019s infrastructure  devices were also missing access control lists to protect them from  potential exploit. Such lists can be used to establish access rules that limit  access to resources such as ports used to connect to the network or to a  sensitive network used for system administration. However, these lists  were not being used on several of the infrastructure devices we reviewed.  In addition, the bureau had allowed excessive privileges to default  accounts on several databases and used an insecure protocol that  permitted excessive access to sensitive system files. The result of these  weaknesses is an increased risk of unauthorized access to Census  Bureau systems and information.", "Cryptography underlies many of the mechanisms used to enforce the  confidentiality and integrity of critical and sensitive information.  Cryptographic tools help control access to information by making it  unintelligible to unauthorized users and by protecting the integrity of  transmitted or stored information. A basic element of cryptography is  encryption. Encryption is the conversion of data into a form, called a  cipher text, which cannot be easily understood. Encryption can be used to  provide basic data confidentiality and integrity by transforming plain text  into cipher text using a special value known as a key and a mathematical  process known as an algorithm. NIST SP 800-53 states that agencies  should use encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access  sessions and they should encrypt sessions between host systems. The  NIST standard for an encryption algorithm is Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2. NIST SP 800-52 also  recommends the use of secure socket layer certificates that are signed by  a trusted certificate authority, as a means of ensuring authenticity of  servers within a network.", "However, Census Bureau encryption controls were not consistently  implemented in accordance with these guidelines. Specifically,", "Weak password encryption algorithms were used on several devices  and for protocols used for the bureau\u2019s network. The use of these  weak algorithms increases the risk of passwords being compromised  by brute force attacks.", "Several databases did not use encryption to appropriately protect  data, either while being stored or in transmission.

Agencies can accomplish this by implementing system or security  software that provides an audit trail (a log of system activity) that is used  to determine the source of a transaction or attempted transaction and to  monitor a user\u2019s activities. Audit and monitoring, key components of risk  management, involve the regular collection, review, and analysis of  auditable events for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, and  the appropriate investigation and reporting of such activity. Automated  mechanisms may be used to integrate audit monitoring, analysis, and  reporting into an overall process for investigation and response to  suspicious activities. Use of such mechanisms may enable near real-time  continuous monitoring of critical or volatile security controls. Audit and  monitoring controls can help security professionals routinely assess  computer security, perform investigations during and after an attack, and  even recognize an ongoing attack. Audit and monitoring technologies  include network and host-based intrusion detection systems, audit  logging, security event correlation tools, and computer forensics. NIST  guidelines state that agencies should retain sufficient audit logs to allow  monitoring of key activities, provide support for after-the-fact investigation  of security incidents, and meet agency information retention  requirements.", "NIST and OMB guidelines emphasize the use of continuous monitoring to  improve information security. Continuous monitoring of security controls  employed within or inherited by the system is an important aspect of  managing risk to information from the operation and use of information  systems.

Such monitoring is intended to assist in maintaining an ongoing  awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to  support agency risk management decisions. The monitoring of security  controls using automated support tools can help facilitate continuous  monitoring.", "Although the Census Bureau used various tools to help detect security  breaches, such as intrusion detection systems, it did not consistently  implement integrated and effective audit and monitoring controls. For  example, vulnerability scans of its systems and network devices were  performed in an unauthenticated manner, thus limiting the bureau\u2019s  visibility of system configurations and the usefulness of the scans. The  network intrusion detection system also did not cover several key  segments of the network and was running at or beyond its design  capacity, which causes loss of key forensic data and an inability to detect  potential events. Centralized logging of critical network services was not  being performed, thus limiting the effectiveness of audit and monitoring  activities. In addition, the bureau did not use real-time automated  mechanisms to monitor its security posture and check for unauthorized  connections of rogue devices to its network. Modern malware can spread  in a matter of minutes instead of weeks or months. By not implementing a  complete audit and monitoring program, the bureau faces an increased  risk that it will not be able to identify weaknesses and remediate them in a  timely manner, thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of sensitive data.

However, the bureau did not always  implement configuration management controls. For example, patch  management practices lacked centralized oversight and control to  effectively administer patches and several database servers had not been  patched or were running outdated software. In addition, key  communication systems were not securely configured and did not have  FIPS 140-2-validated encryption and network devices were configured in  a way that allowed unencrypted logins, which could allow user IDs and  passwords to be compromised. Further, the bureau had not implemented  the routine monitoring of its configurations for its infrastructure  applications and did not document emergency changes before making  them. According to the bureau, changes are verbally approved and then  documented after implementation.

NIST guidelines also recommend that agencies  develop, document, and implement plans and procedures to support  contingency planning, such as a continuity of operations plan, for  information systems that support the agency\u2019s operations and assets.", "The Census Bureau has satisfied several, but not all NIST contingency  planning practices. For example, the bureau provided evidence that it had  taken steps to actively mitigate disruptions to its primary data center  through the implementation of emergency power, fire suppression, and  flood mitigation measures. Additionally, the bureau stored backup copies  of data for its critical systems off site at a secured location. However, the  Census Bureau did not satisfy many of the other practices for contingency  planning.

That  framework should include an assessment of the impact those risks could  have on organizational operations and an analysis of the acceptable level  of risk under which the agency could absorb the resulting loss while still  maintaining operation of its systems (a risk impact analysis). In addition,  to monitor the effectiveness of its security controls, the agency should  conduct a vulnerability assessment of its systems to ensure that security  requirements for the system are being met. The results of the risk impact  analysis and the effectiveness of security controls should be documented.  Finally, NIST and OMB specify that federal agencies should develop  remedial action plans, also known as plans of action and milestones  (POA&M) that describe specific tasks and milestones for correcting  security weaknesses in information systems and are used to set priorities  and monitor progress in correcting the weaknesses.", "The bureau\u2019s risk management program emphasizes the following  capabilities:", "Risk profiles/scoring\u2014 Risk profiles are developed based on  standardized questionnaires containing business and technological  factors, and a risk scoring methodology to identify appropriate security  controls and determine the level of risk for each control.

Specifically, the bureau\u2019s policies and NIST guidelines direct the bureau  to consider both individual system controls and common controls  (controls shared by multiple systems) in assessing system risk. However,  the bureau\u2019s security assessment report for its pilot system did not  include an assessment of the risks associated with the specified common  controls; instead, it stated that the data were not finalized and not  available. Census Bureau officials said that the assessment of the  common controls had not been completed under the new strategy, and  thus was not reflected in the security assessment report for the system.  Until the bureau clearly documents its assessment of common controls  for its information systems, it may not have an accurate understanding of  the risks these systems are subject to.", "In addition, although the Census Bureau\u2019s system security plans listed  more than 1,200 security controls for each of the seven components of  the pilot system, the assessments of those controls and the related  security assessment report did not fully identify and document several  vulnerabilities identified during our review. For example, the bureau was  not fully enforcing session inactivity time outs for remote users and was  allowing remote users to simultaneously access internal bureau networks  and the Internet. Risks for these vulnerabilities were not accepted in the  security assessment report used to authorize operation of the system,  although the time out vulnerability was identified and accepted in a later  document.", "Furthermore, documentation supporting both risk-based decisions and  closure of remediation plans was missing or unclear. Both NIST and  Census Bureau guidance state the importance of documenting in  sufficient detail whether implementation of a control effectively addresses  the control requirement and the rationale for any accepted risks.  However, the bureau\u2019s documentation of key decisions was not always  available, clear and complete. For example, we reviewed seven system  security plans for seven pilot system components and identified 48 cases  where security controls did not pass their respective control assessments,  known as exceptions. Of these exceptions, the bureau chose to accept 23  exceptions and attempted to remediate 25. Of the 23 exceptions the  bureau chose to accept, documentation was not provided for 7.", "For the 25 exceptions the bureau attempted to remediate, the bureau  initially created a POA&M for each exception to monitor the progress in  correcting the weaknesses. Five of these POA&Ms remained open as of  May 2012 and 20 had been closed. However, 17 of the 20 closed  POA&Ms did not have documentation that demonstrated that the  weaknesses had been addressed. For example, the documentation for 6  of the closed POA&Ms stated that integrity scans had been performed to  address the weaknesses but the supporting evidence did not indicate that  the scans had been completed. Census Bureau officials stated that the  authorizing official for the pilot system chose to accept the risk from these  weaknesses, but this had not been documented as part of the POA&M  closure. In addition, 11 of the 20 closed POA&Ms were closed because  the risk was accepted and approved by the system owner, information  security representative, and authorizing official on a risk acceptance form  but there was no evidence documented that mitigating controls were in  place. In many cases, the bureau listed compensating controls in the risk  acceptance form that mitigated the risk, but did not provide evidence that  it had tested these compensating controls to assess their effectiveness.  For example, an exception related to encryption stated that the system  relied on the underlying operating system and network infrastructure to  mitigate the issue but did not clearly explain how this was to occur.", "While the bureau\u2019s new program for risk management may produce  potential benefits to the bureau, the effectiveness of its remediation  efforts cannot be known unless the bureau ensures that its actions have  been documented.", "An entitywide information security management program is the foundation  of a security control structure and a reflection of senior management\u2019s  commitment to addressing security risks. Per FISMA, the security  management program should establish a framework and a continuous  cycle of activity for assessing risk, developing and implementing effective  security procedures, and monitoring the effectiveness of these  procedures. Without a well-designed program, security controls may be  inadequate; responsibilities may be unclear, misunderstood, or improperly  implemented; and controls may be inconsistently applied.", "The Census Bureau\u2019s 2010 IT Security Program Policies referenced the  18 control areas that address FISMA requirements for a security  management program at a high level, with the intent that detailed  guidance and requirements are included in the underlying system-level  documentation, according to bureau officials. However, although the  bureau requires that its IT security program and policies be revised at  least annually, it has not been updated since April 2010. According to  bureau officials, a revision had been drafted, but its approval had been  delayed, in part due to the bureau\u2019s efforts to implement its new risk  management framework. Until the Census Bureau\u2019s IT Security Program  Policies are updated and finalized, the bureau may not have assurance  that controls over its information are appropriately applied to its systems  and operating effectively.", "FISMA mandates that federal employees and contractors who use  agency information systems that support agency operations and assets  be provided with training in information security awareness. Furthermore,  OMB guidance states that personnel should have this training before they  are granted access to systems or applications. According to FISMA and  OMB, the information security awareness training should inform  personnel, including contractors and other users of information systems  supporting the operations and assets of an agency, of information  security risks associated with their activities and their roles and  responsibilities to properly and effectively implement the practices that  are designed to reduce these risks. FISMA also includes requirements for  training personnel who have significant responsibilities for information  security. Depending on an employee\u2019s specific security role, training  could include specialized topics such as incident detection and response,  physical security, or firewall configuration. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 3 further  recommends that agencies require refresher training for security  awareness and role-based on an agency-defined basis, and document  users\u2019 completion of required training.
