At that time, as a key part of Japan\u2019s efforts to promote rapid industrial recovery, the government instituted legal reforms that created pronounced specialization in banking that persists to some degree to the present day. Although the Japanese banking industry remains segmented and specialized, deregulation and liberalization since the 1970s have eliminated many functional distinctions among the different types of banks and the separate, specialized markets they formerly served.

As part of the nation\u2019s postwar economic and industrial recovery reforms, the Japanese government restricted banks from engaging in activities outside of banking, such as securities activities, and it limited their ownership of shares in other Japanese companies, particularly industrial companies. The result was a segmented banking structure, which even today retains some of its highly specialized character.", "Japanese banks currently may accept deposits or installment savings, lend money, conduct exchange transactions, and certain ancillary activities. Allowable ancillary activities include purchasing, lending, and selling securities; underwriting government bonds; and the safekeeping of securities and precious metals. In addition, through associated companies, banks can provide venture capital, consulting services, leasing, housing finance, and loans. Industry deregulation initiated in the early 1980s that culminated with the 1992 Financial System Reform Law also now allows banks to compete in securities underwriting activities through subsidiaries, albeit with certain restrictions on those activities. In addition, there is to be a clear separation of banking and securities activities.

The 1915 amendment to the Savings Bank Act prohibited ordinary banks from engaging in similar savings activities until World War II, when the expansion of savings became a national policy goal. At that point, ordinary banks were allowed to conduct the same business activities as savings banks and, as a result, savings banks began to disappear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1927 Banking Law", "paragraphs": ["In response to a nationwide financial panic in 1927, which heightened concerns about the stability of the Japanese banking industry, the government enacted the Banking Law of 1927.

The government became the majority stockholder of the bank, while voting rights were denied to all stockholders.", "The 1942 law, according to BOJ officials, provided BOJ a legal basis to foster and maintain a sound financial system. In particular, BOJ believes that the law provided a stronger statutory basis for conducting its safety and soundness examinations of client banks, which began in 1928. In addition to on-site examinations, BOJ relies on frequent contacts to ensure that financial institutions follow sound practices.

Under the main bank system, banks and companies were closely tied to each other through practices such as cross shareholdings and exchanging senior management personnel (usually from main banks to companies). As a result, companies enjoyed stable funding regardless of their health, while main banks maintained solid market share by supplying loans to companies.

To fund the public debt, the government issued an increasingly large volume of government bonds. In 1979, 6 years after the 1973 oil crisis, the government issued bonds worth a record total of 15.3 trillion yen ($70.5 billion). However, as the deficit increased, financial institutions became less willing to help the government absorb the debt at above-market prices. Businesses also became less dependent on bank credit and services, such as bank loans. As a result of these developments, banks began to seek out new markets outside the traditional financial marketplace. To expand their market share and increase their competitiveness, banks and securities companies became advocates of financial liberalization, and banks began to diversify their loans and funding.", "The resulting liberalization, which began in the late 1970s, has continued over the course of succeeding decades and has primarily affected three areas: interest rates, scope of business, and foreign exchange controls. The relaxation of restrictions on interest rates began in 1979, with the introduction of negotiable certificates-of-deposit, followed soon after by the emergence of money market certificates of deposit paying interest rates linked to money market accounts. By October 1994, interest rates had been liberalized on all time deposits except for checking accounts. Over the same period, the relaxation of lending regulations had enabled banks to increasingly set their short-term prime rates relative to the official discount rate.", "The enactment of the 1980 Foreign Exchange Law eased the regulation of banks\u2019 foreign exchange activities, except during times of crisis.

After years of rapid appreciation, banks experienced rapid depreciation of asset prices. The value of nonperforming loans held by Japanese financial institutions as of March 1996, according to MOF, was 34.8 trillion yen ($326 billion), a condition considered unacceptable by the Japanese government. Nonperforming loans, which have caused several credit cooperatives and regional banks to fail, have also called into question the financial soundness of other financial institutions. As a result, Japanese officials recently undertook an analysis of the nonperforming loan problem, which has led to changes in the supervisory process.", "The Japanese government\u2019s attention has also been directed toward devising supervisory responses to the problems of one particular type of institution, housing loan companies\u2014called jusen\u2014which have experienced heavy losses. Japan\u2019s eight jusen, which were established in the 1970s by Japanese banks and other financial institutions such as insurance companies and securities firms, have been especially hard hit in recent years with the steep decline of the Japanese real estate market. Although their original intended function was to supplement home mortgage lending, jusen became heavily involved in commercial real estate and housing development lending, which contributed to their losses when the Japanese real estate market declined sharply in early 1992.", "As of March 1996, nonrecoverable problem loans of jusen were estimated at 6.3 trillion yen ($59 billion). In Japan, there was widespread concern that the failure of one or more jusen could spark public panic and lead to a chain reaction of withdrawals from other financial institutions, since many financial institutions had provided financing to jusen companies. To avert such a crisis, the Japanese government designed a plan aimed at rebuilding public confidence and protecting depositors, including establishing a jusen account in the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC) with a governmental contribution of 680 billion yen ($6.4 billion).", "In the summer of 1995, Daiwa reported that a securities trader in its New York office had initiated improper trades over an 11-year period that had gone undetected.

Also in October, banking regulators in the United States issued cease and desist orders against Daiwa requiring a virtual cessation of trading activities in the United States. In November 1995, MOF identified and took action intended to correct inappropriate management practices at Daiwa Bank. MOF also ordered Daiwa Bank to reduce its international operations, including the amount of loans outstanding, the amount of securities holdings, and market-related activities. MOF and BOJ also committed themselves to strengthening their oversight of overseas branches and offices of Japanese banks.", "In the last 2 years alone, DIC has provided financial assistance totaling 643.3 billion yen ($6 billion) to assist in the resolution of troubled credit cooperatives and regional banks, which has come close to depleting the deposit insurance fund.
