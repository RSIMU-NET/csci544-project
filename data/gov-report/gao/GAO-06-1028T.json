The individual income tax has long been the largest source of federal revenue--amounting to $927 billion (7.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) in 2005. (Total revenues that year amounted to 17.5 percent of GDP.) Income tax policy, including existing tax expenditures, such as the exclusion of employer-provided health insurance from individual income, and enforcement approaches, need to be key elements of a multipronged approach that reexamines federal policies and approaches to address our nation's large and growing long-term fiscal imbalance. Concerns regarding the complexity, efficiency, and equity of the individual income tax have contributed to calls for a substantial restructuring of the individual income tax or its full or partial replacement with some form of consumption tax. The widely recognized complexity of the tax results in (1) significant compliance costs, frustration, and anxiety for taxpayers; (2) decreased voluntary compliance; (3) increased difficulties for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in administering the tax laws; and (4) reduced confidence in the fairness of the tax. The tax also causes taxpayers to change their work, savings, investment, and consumption behavior in ways that reduce economic efficiency and, thereby, taxpayers' well-being. Taxpayer noncompliance with the current individual income tax is another factor that could motivate reform. For tax year 2001, IRS estimated that noncompliance with the individual income tax accounted for about 70 percent of the $345 billion gross tax gap, which is the difference between the taxes that should have been paid voluntarily and on time and what was actually paid. Reducing this gap can improve the nation's fiscal stability, as each 1 percent reduction in the tax gap would likely yield about $3 billion annually. Reducing the tax gap within the current income tax structure will require exploring new and innovative administrative and legislative approaches. In moving forward on tax reform, policymakers may find it useful to compare alternative proposals along some common dimensions. These include, in part, whether proposed tax systems over time will generate enough revenue to fund expected expenditures, whether the base is as broad as possible so rates can be as low as possible, whether the system meets our future needs, and whether it has attributes that promote compliance.

For example, the IRS publication Tax Benefits for Education  outlines 12 tax expenditures, including 4 different tax expenditures for  educational saving. The use of one of these tax expenditures can affect  whether (or how) a taxpayer is allowed to use the other tax expenditures.  Adding to the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to select the best educational tax  benefit, the use of one of these tax expenditures may affect a student\u2019s  eligibility for other forms of federal assistance for higher education, such  as Pell grants and subsidized loans.", "The tax benefits, or tax expenditures, available under the income tax are  usually justified on the grounds that they promote certain social or  economic goals. They grant special tax relief (through deductions, credits,  exemptions, etc.) that encourages certain types of behavior by taxpayers  or aids taxpayers in certain circumstances. Tax expenditures can promote  a wide range of goals, like encouraging economic development in  disadvantaged areas, financing postsecondary education, or stimulating  research and development. For example, a wide range of tax provisions  are intended to help individuals save for their retirement. These include  traditional and Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) and various  plans administered by employers or available to self-employed individuals.  Again, individuals face complex choices to select the best options as well  as complex rules to stay in compliance once they select a retirement  savings option. From a public policy perspective, all of this complexity and  the burden it imposes on taxpayers would most likely be worthwhile if the  tax incentives are successful in achieving their intended purposes.  However, in many cases this is questionable or unknown. Although  research results vary, many studies suggest that IRAs result in little actual  increase in retirement saving.

These costs include the time and  money spent complying with the computational, reporting, planning, and  recordkeeping requirements of the tax system. Estimates of compliance  costs are uncertain because taxpayers generally do not keep relevant  records documenting their time and money spent complying with the tax  system and many important elements of the costs are difficult to measure  because, among other things, federal tax requirements often overlap with  recordkeeping and reporting that taxpayers do for other purposes.", "The available compliance cost estimates do not represent the potential  cost savings to be gained by replacing the current federal individual  income tax. Any replacement tax system will impose significant  compliance costs of its own. Moreover, given that many state and local  government income taxes depend upon the same compliance activities as  the federal income tax does, taxpayers would still bear the costs of those  activities unless those other governments replaced their own taxes to  conform to the new federal system. In addition, if some of the subsidies,  such as the earned income tax credit and child tax credit, which are  provided by the current federal tax system, are replaced by spending  programs under a reformed system, tax compliance costs may be reduced,  but only as a result of their being shifted to those new programs.

This change in behavior can cause a reduction  in taxpayers\u2019 well-being that, for example, may include lost production (or  income) and consumption opportunities. One important behavioral change  attributable to the income tax arises from the fact that investment in  housing is given more favorable treatment than investment in business  activities. Economists generally agree that this differential tax treatment  reduces the amount of money available to businesses for investment in  productivity-enhancing technology. This in turn results in employees  receiving lower wages because increases in wages are generally tied to  increases in productivity. The tax exclusion for the exclusion of employer- provided health insurance from individuals\u2019 taxable income, discussed in  text box 1, is another example of an income tax provision that clearly  reduces economic efficiency. The exclusion encourages more extensive  insurance coverage, but introduces a well-known problem with health  insurance. Because much of the cost of medical treatment is paid for by  the insurer, patients and doctors are generally unaware of, or  disconnected from, the total costs of health care and have little incentive  to economize on health care spending.", "Efficiency costs, along with the tax liability paid to the government and  the costs of complying with tax laws, are part of the total cost of taxes to  taxpayers. However, this does not mean that taxes are not worth paying.  One reason people bear taxes is they desire the benefits of government  programs and services. (The government does deliver some services  effectively and often provides services that otherwise would not be  available.) Taxpayers implicitly or explicitly balance the costs of taxes  with the benefits of government.", "Nevertheless, minimizing efficiency costs is one criterion for a good tax.  Economists agree that taxes with broad bases and low rates generally  cause lower efficiency costs than do taxes with narrow bases and high  rates. The goal of tax policy is to design a tax system that produces  revenue needed to pay current bills and deliver on future promises while  at the same time balancing economic efficiency with other objectives,  such as equity, simplicity, transparency, and administrability. Moreover, as  noted earlier, the failure to provide sufficient tax revenues to finance the  level of spending we choose as a nation gives rise to deficits and debt.  Large, sustained deficits could ultimately have a negative impact on  economic growth, productivity, and potentially our national security.  Large structural deficits also raise serious stewardship and  intergenerational equity issues.", "Text Box 1: Tax Expenditure for Employer-Provided Medical Insurance Premiums and  Medical Care  The current U.S. tax system excludes employer-provided health insurance from  individuals' taxable income even though such insurance is a form of income (noncash  compensation).

Including forgone  federal social insurance taxes, an estimated $177.6 billion in revenue was forgone due  to this exclusion.", "The tax exclusion increases the proportion of the population covered by health  insurance. In 2004, nearly 46 million Americans were without health insurance. The  tax exclusion encourages employers to offer and employees to participate in health  insurance plans, increasing the proportion of workers covered. Because individuals  may be better able to anticipate their health care needs than insurers, health care  plans may attract customers with higher risk of poor health, resulting in higher  premiums. By encouraging the pooling of high-and low-risk individuals, the tax  exclusion may help to reduce premiums below those that individuals would face if they  purchased insurance on their own.", "However, some question whether the tax subsidy for health insurance is the best way  to increase health insurance coverage. For example, the tax exclusion provides the  most assistance to taxpayers who have high marginal tax rates (those with high  incomes)\u2014the exclusion saves those taxpayers more in taxes owed than it saves  those with lower marginal tax rates.", "The tax exclusion for health insurance also contributes to higher health care costs.

Estimates from the second study indicate that  the efficiency cost of the individual income tax was on the order of  2 percent of GDP in 1997. Efficiency cost estimates such as these are  often quite sensitive to the assumed magnitude of key behavioral  responses and those assumptions are often based on empirical research  that continues to evolve over time or, in other cases, has yet to be  undertaken.

One factor that some believe contributes to the  difficulty of achieving compliance is the complexity of our tax system. The  complexity of, and frequent revisions to, the tax system make it more  difficult and costly for taxpayers who want to comply to do so and for IRS  to explain and enforce tax laws. Complexity also creates a fertile ground  for those intentionally seeking to evade taxes, and often trips others into  unintentional noncompliance. Likewise, the complexity of the tax system  challenges IRS in its ability to administer our tax laws.", "Whether under our current income tax system or a reformed one,  enforcement tools, particularly information reporting and tax  withholding, are key to high levels of compliance.

Taxpayers tend to report income subject to tax withholding or  information reporting with high levels of compliance because the income  is transparent to the taxpayers as well as to IRS. For example, employers  report most wages, salaries, and tip compensation to employees and IRS  through Form W-2. Also, banks and other financial institutions provide  information returns (Forms 1099) to account holders and IRS showing the  taxpayers\u2019 annual income from some types of investments. Findings from  IRS\u2019s recent study of individual tax compliance indicate that nearly  99 percent of these types of income are accurately reported on individual  tax returns. For types of income for which there is little or no information  reporting, individual taxpayers tend to misreport over half of their income.", "Ensuring that significant resources are devoted to enforcement also has  the potential to minimize the tax gap for our current income tax system as  well as for reformed systems Congress may adopt. For the current system,  devoting more resources has the potential to reduce the tax gap by billions  of dollars in that IRS would be able to expand its enforcement efforts to  reach a greater number of potentially noncompliant taxpayers.  Importantly, expanded enforcement efforts could reduce the tax gap more  than through direct tax revenue collection, as widespread agreement  exists that IRS enforcement programs have an indirect effect through  increases in voluntary tax compliance. However, determining the  appropriate level of enforcement resources to provide IRS requires taking  into account many factors, such as how effectively and efficiently IRS is  currently using its resources, how to strike the proper balance between  IRS\u2019s taxpayer service and enforcement activities, and competing federal  funding priorities.", "Generally, when holding IRS accountable for the use of resources, it is  also desirable to focus on the outcomes achieved rather than on how IRS  allocates the resources it receives. Results are really what counts. If IRS,  or any other agency, can figure out how to more cost effectively achieve a  result, then reallocation of resources to other problem areas could be an  appropriate strategy, within the restrictions applying to appropriation  accounts, for making the best use of limited resources. In sum, regardless  of the tax system, Congress needs to assure itself that the revenue agency  has sufficient resources and reasonable flexibility to achieve desired  outcomes and hold the agency accountable for those outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparing Proposals on Common Dimensions", "paragraphs": ["In moving forward on tax reform, policymakers may find it useful to  compare proposals on common dimensions. These comparisons can be  helpful whether reform is of the individual income tax, the current tax  system more broadly, or in considering new systems altogether.", "First, is the tax base as broad as possible? Broad-based tax systems with  minimal exceptions have many advantages. Fewer exceptions generally  means less complexity, less compliance cost, less economic efficiency  loss, and by increasing transparency may improve equity or perceptions of  equity. In terms of the individual income tax, this suggests that eliminating  or consolidating the myriad of tax expenditures must be considered. We  need to be sure that the benefits achieved from having these special  provisions are worth the associated revenue losses just as we must ensure  that outlay programs\u2014which may be attempting to achieve the same  purposes as tax expenditures\u2014achieve outcomes commensurate with  their costs. To the extent tax expenditures are retained, consideration  should be given to whether they are better targeted to meet an identified  need. Many tax expenditures are broadly available and, in fact, provide  greater \u201cassistance\u201d to those that most would consider least in need. This  is broadly true of any tax expenditure that is worth more to higher income  taxpayers than to lower income taxpayers, like the exclusion for the value  of employer-provided health insurance and the mortgage interest  deduction.", "Broad based tax systems can yield the same revenue as more narrowly  based systems at lower tax rates. The combination of less direct  intervention in the marketplace from special tax preferences, and the  lower rates possible from broad based systems, can have substantial  benefits for economic efficiency. For instance, some economists estimate  that the economic efficiency costs of tax increases rise proportionately  faster than the tax rates. In other words, a 50 percent tax increase could  more than double the economic efficiency costs of a tax system.", "Does the proposed system raise sufficient revenue over time to fund our  expected expenditures? As I mentioned earlier, we will fall woefully short  of achieving this end if current spending and/or revenue trends are not  altered. The economic efficiency costs of our current tax system likely will  become an even more important issue as we grapple with the nation\u2019s  long-term fiscal challenges. Although we clearly must restructure major  entitlement programs and the basis of other federal spending, it is unlikely  that our long-term fiscal challenge will be resolved solely by cutting  spending. If we must raise revenues, doing so from a broad base and a  lower rate will help minimize economic efficiency costs.", "In this regard, the President\u2019s Advisory Panel on Tax Reform has taken a  useful step forward for tax reform, helping, for example, to focus the  debate on specific proposals. Those proposals incorporate broader bases,  with lower rates. However, the Panel acted within the guidance it was  given, and one result is that the proposed reforms, if implemented as  proposed, appear to provide much less than the necessary revenue to fund  expected government spending. Although we have not evaluated the  revenue effects of these proposals, other respected analysts have and they  point to future revenue yields that would worsen the already difficult fiscal  challenges the nation faces.", "Does the proposal look to future needs? Like many spending programs,  the current tax system was developed in a profoundly different time. We  live now in a much more global economy, with highly mobile capital, and  investment options available to ordinary citizens that were not even  imagined decades ago. We have growing concentrations of income and  wealth. More firms operate multi-nationally and willingly move operations  and capital around the world as they see best for their firms.", "Do the revenues for the proposed system hold up in the future? As an  adjunct to looking forward when making reforms, the revenue  consequences of all major tax changes should be estimated well into the  future. Such long-term projections undoubtedly will be subject to  uncertainty, but at the very least we should have the best estimates  possible of whether the revenue trend is likely to shift up or down over the  long-term.", "Does the proposed system have attributes associated with high  compliance rates? Because any tax system can be subject to tax gaps, the  administrability of reformed systems should be considered as part of the  debate for change. In general, a reformed system is most likely to have a  small tax gap if the system has few tax preferences or complex provisions  and taxable transactions are transparent. Transparency in the context of  tax administration is best achieved when third parties report information  both to the taxpayer and the tax administrator.", "What transition issues exist and have they been dealt with in an equitable  fashion that minimizes additional complexity and any adverse effects on  the benefits to be gained from the new tax system? Under the current  individual income tax system, citizens have made fundamental life choices  based at least in part on the incentives in the tax system. For many, the  favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing has led to choices to  invest disproportionately in housing. Others have made long-term  investments in tax-favored college savings plans. Thus, changes to the tax  system can materially affect citizens\u2019 futures. Still others make their livings  advising taxpayers, helping them understand tax provisions and complete  their tax returns, and helping them devise investment and other financial  plans taking into account current tax rules.", "Our publication, Understanding the Tax Reform Debate: Background,  Criteria, and Questions, may be useful in guiding policymakers as they  consider tax reform proposals. It was designed to aid policymakers in  thinking about how to develop tax policy for the 21st century. While not  designed to break new conceptual ground, this report brings together a  number of topics that tax experts have identified as those that should be  considered when evaluating tax policy. It attempts to provide information  about these topics in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner  for a non-technical audience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The problems that I have reviewed today relating to the compliance costs,  efficiency costs, equity and tax gap associated with the current individual  income tax system\u2014many of which arise from the complex accumulation  of tax preferences in that system\u2014would seem to make an overwhelming  case for a comprehensive review and reform of our tax policy. Further, we  live a world that is profoundly different than when the individual income  tax and many of its provisions were adopted. Despite numerous and  repeated calls for such reform, progress has been slow. One reason why  reform is difficult to accomplish is that the provisions of the tax code that  generate compliance costs, efficiency costs, the tax gap and inequities also  benefit many taxpayers and the individuals and companies that advise  taxpayers and help them with their tax filing obligations. Reform is also  difficult because, even when there is agreement on the amount of revenue  to raise, there are differing opinions on the appropriate balance among the  often conflicting objectives of equity, efficiency, and administrability. This,  in turn, leads to widely divergent views on even the basic direction of  reform.", "Fiscal necessity, prompted by the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path, will  eventually force changes to our spending and tax policies. We must  fundamentally rethink policies and everything must be on the table. Tough  choices will have to be made about the appropriate degree of emphasis on  cutting back federal programs versus increasing tax revenue.", "Tax reform, if it broadens the tax base, could reduce the costs of raising a  given amount of revenue by reducing the associated efficiency costs. Such  a reform also likely would reduce inequities, compliance burden, and  administrative costs. The recent report of the President\u2019s Advisory Panel  on Federal Tax Reform recommended two different tax reform plans.  Although each plan provides for significant simplification, neither of them  addresses the growing imbalance between federal spending and revenues  that I highlighted earlier. One approach for getting the process of  comprehensive fiscal reform started would be through the establishment  of a credible, capable, and bipartisan commission, to examine options for  a combination of entitlement and tax reform.", "As policymakers consider proposals to reform the current individual  income tax, or the entire tax system, they may find it useful to compare  the proposals on common dimensions.
