Most federal aid as well as some state and institutional aid is awarded based on the student's cost of attendance less the student's and/or family's ability to pay these costs--known as the expected family contribution (EFC). The allowance, which accounts for the amount of state and other taxes paid by students and families, effectively reduces the EFC. Given the potential impact of the allowance on the awarding of aid, we determined what factors have affected the updating of the tax data on which it is based, the effects the proposed 2003 update would have had on financial assistance for aid applicants, any limitations in the method for deriving the allowance, and strategies available to address them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While Education has been required to revise the allowance annually since 1993, prior to 2004 it attempted to update the allowance only twice--in 1993 and again in 2003--but the latter update was suspended. As a result, the 1988 IRS tax data used for the 1993 update remained in effect. The lack of updates is primarily because Education did not annually seek data needed to update the allowance or establish effective internal control to guide the updating process. Also, Education did not consider alternatives when data were not readily available. Had the update been implemented in 2004-2005, the allowance would have decreased for most states; as a result, the EFC would have increased by about $500, on average, for a majority of aid applicants. Of those with an EFC increase, 38 percent would either have received less in Pell Grants ($144 less on average) or would have become ineligible for them; the percentage of recipients affected would have varied by income. Overall Pell Grant expenditures would have decreased by $290 million. Increases in EFCs could also have affected other forms of aid, including state aid; these effects in turn could have affected Stafford loans and Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students. The impact of the proposed update on Campus-Based, state, and institutional need-based aid would likely have varied based on state and institutional aid awarding policies and changes in state allowances. Due to certain limitations of the IRS dataset with respect to calculating the allowance, and problems with how Education uses this dataset, the current allowance may not reflect the amount of taxes paid by students and families. The dataset is limited because the taxpayers included in it are generally not representative of aid applicants, it does not include all state and other taxes paid by students and families, and the tax data are several years older than the income information reported by applicants on aid applications. In addition to these limitations, Education does not make full use of the dataset to better reflect the varying tax rates paid by taxpayers in different income groups. Strategies we identified for addressing the limitations of the tax allowance include (1) using IRS data with revisions to the method for calculating the allowance, (2) substituting IRS data with one of several alternative data sources, (3) using a standard allowance for all aid applicants irrespective of state of residence, or (4) collecting tax information directly from aid applicants. These could require modest to substantial changes, would differ in their impact on applicants and federal costs, and could require legislative changes"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2003\u20132004, an estimated $98 billion in financial aid was awarded to  students for postsecondary education through the Title IV federal student  aid programs, as well as state and institutional grant programs. Title IV aid  is currently awarded based on a formula specified in the Higher Education  Act (HEA); many states and postsecondary institutions also use this  formula to award their own student aid. A substantial portion of this aid is  awarded based on the difference between a student\u2019s cost of attendance  and an estimate of the student\u2019s and/or family\u2019s ability to pay these costs\u2014 called the expected family contribution (EFC)\u2014determined by this  formula. To apply for Title IV aid, students submit a Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on which they report their own and/or their  families\u2019 income, assets, and federal income tax expenses. State and other  tax expenses, on the other hand, are not collected on the FAFSA form.  Rather, Education uses a rate specified in law, subject to revision by  Education\u2014called the state and other tax allowance\u2014to estimate such  taxes.", "Congress incorporated the state and other tax allowance as a part of the  formula by including in the Higher Education Act a series of tables listing  the applicable allowance for students and families by state. The tables list  specific percentage values, or rates, that are used to exclude a portion of  students\u2019 and families\u2019 incomes in determining their EFC. Thus, under the  formula, the state and other tax allowance effectively reduces the EFC for  students and families. The allowances were originally developed based on  information compiled by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS)\u2013Statistics of Income (SOI) Division, specifically state and  other taxes paid by taxpayers and reported on their federal income tax  returns.", "While the Department of Education (Education) is required by law to  update the state and other tax allowance, its proposal to do so in 2003 was  met with substantial concern because it was the first update in a number  of years and because the update would likely affect the EFC for students  and families and the amount of student aid received. In view of the  uncertainty and controversy that followed Education\u2019s proposed update  and Congress\u2019 decision to suspend the update for 1 year, you asked us to  shed light on issues associated with the tax allowance question and the  department\u2019s proposed 2003 update. This report examines (1) what tax  data form the basis of the current tax allowance and what factors have  affected regular updates, (2) the effect Education\u2019s proposed 2003 update  would have had in award year 2004\u20132005 on financial assistance for  students and families, (3) the extent to which current methods for  determining the allowance accurately measure how much students and  families have paid in state and other taxes, and (4) the strategies available  to address any problems in deriving the allowance.", "To do our work, we reviewed federal laws governing how Education is to  update the state and other tax allowance and examined documents  pertaining to this process. We used Education\u2019s aid applicant sample file  from the 2002\u20132003 award year to estimate changes to the expected family  contribution and Pell Grant awards nationally that would have resulted  from Education\u2019s proposed update. We analyzed Education\u2019s Cost  Estimation and Analysis Division\u2019s Statistical Abstract (CEAD STAB) data  to estimate the proportion of financial aid recipients who could have  experienced a change in their federal loans as a result of the proposed  update. We assessed the reliability of the aid applicant and CEAD STAB  data and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our review. To  obtain estimates on changes in state-provided need-based aid programs,  we contacted two states, one with a likely high level of impact (Wisconsin)  and the other with a likely low level of impact (Tennessee). To illustrate  changes in students\u2019 receipt of Title IV aid and need-based aid provided by  schools, we relied on estimates from four schools\u2014two public institutions  (University of Wisconsin-Madison and Middle Tennessee State University)  and two private nonprofit institutions (Marian College of Fond du Lac and  Carson-Newman College). To develop strategies to address the  allowance\u2019s limitations in measuring students\u2019 and parents\u2019 state and other  tax payments, we identified and analyzed alternative data sources that  have state and local tax information. Finally, to gain further perspective on  our objectives, we interviewed officials from the Advisory Committee on  Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) and other federal officials, along  with state, school, and national association officials as well as other  student financial aid experts.", "We conducted our review from October 2003 through November 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The EFC is  defined as the household financial resources that are considered available  to help pay for the student\u2019s postsecondary education expenses and is  calculated by reducing the household financial resources reported by aid  applicants on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid by certain  expenses and allowances, including a state and other tax allowance. A  student is classified as either financially dependent on his or her parents  or independent in the financial aid process. This classification is important  because it affects the factors used to determine a student\u2019s EFC. For  dependent students, the EFC is based on both the students and parents\u2019  income and assets, as well as whether the family has other children  enrolled in college.

For students who see decreases in their  Perkins loans, the decrease would have been about $1,200 on average but  would have varied significantly by school due to differences in eligibility  criteria. Table 5 shows the case study results of changes in these three  school-administered federal programs.", "The majority of states use the federal need analysis methodology to  allocate state need-based aid; as a result, the proposed update could have  affected the amount of and the extent to which students receive state  grants. The effect would have varied by state due to, among other factors,  differences in changes to the tax allowance by state and differences in  state award policies. In Wisconsin, for example, we estimate that over  50 percent of state aid award recipients in our case study would have seen  a decrease in their state award. In contrast, in Tennessee, just over 10  percent of recipients in our case study would have seen a decrease in their  state award. The average reduction for Wisconsin students would have  been less than that for Tennessee students due to the differences in how  the states compute awards: Wisconsin's computation decreases aid for  each dollar increase in EFC by less than Tennessee's computation. (See  table 6.)", "As with state aid, the effect of the proposed update on the need-based aid  provided by schools themselves would have varied significantly across  schools due to, among other factors, differences in institutional award  policies and changes in the EFC of students attending the institutions.  However, the impact would be limited to schools that use the federal  methodology to award aid. Since institutional aid may change as a result of  both changes in the EFC and changes in other aid awarded, the effect of  the increased EFC on institutional aid cannot be easily determined. For  example, a school that bases its award solely on EFC might decrease its  award as a result of an EFC increase, while a school that bases  institutional aid on other aid awarded might increase the institutional  award for some students. At the two private nonprofit schools included in  our case studies, our results show that while more than 20 percent of  students at each school would have faced a decrease in institutional need- based aid under the proposed allowance, more than 10 percent of students  at these same schools would have received more institutional aid. Overall,  case study students attending one private nonprofit school would have  seen a decrease in institutional aid of almost $800 on average, whereas  students at the other school would have seen a decrease of over $425 on  average."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Current Allowance May Not Capture the Taxes Paid Due to the Type of Data and Methodology in Use", "paragraphs": ["As a result of certain limitations of the SOI dataset for the purpose of  calculating the allowance and problems with how Education uses this  dataset, the current state and other tax allowance may not reflect the  amount of taxes paid by students and families.

Although Education has  taken some recent steps to update the allowance, these efforts have not  been successful. An inaccurate allowance could yield adverse effects for  the federal government and students and their families. On the one hand,  students and families could erroneously gain eligibility, which would  cause federal funds to be misdirected.

Additionally, we show that Pell Grant recipients with household  income over $25,000 would have been significantly more likely to have  either received less in Pell Grants or become ineligible for them.

To do this,  the 2002\u20132003 aid applicant sample file was converted to better reflect aid  applicants in the 2004\u20132005 award year by adjusting all income and asset  amounts for inflation and changing the weights assigned to each sample  applicant so that the sample takes into account projected changes in the  number and type of applicants. We reviewed Education\u2019s approach to  converting the sample file to the 2004\u20132005 award year and calculating  EFC and Pell awards for accuracy and interviewed Education officials  about the approach\u2019s reliability.

Using the aid applicant sample file, we estimated the percentage of  applicants in award year 2004\u20132005 who would have had their EFC  changed because of the proposed update for each combination of  dependency status, state of residence, and specified income group.  2.  We used the resulting percentages to estimate the likelihood that each  CEAD-STAB sample borrower\u2019s EFC would have been changed due to  the update.  3.  We estimated the likelihood that each individual borrower would have  had his or her Stafford subsidized and unsubsidized loan award  affected as equal to this percentage if the recipient borrowed less than  the maximum allowed by law. We estimated as zero the likelihood that  each individual borrower would have had his or her Stafford  subsidized and unsubsidized loan award affected if the recipient  borrowed the maximum allowed by law.  4.  For PLUS recipients, the likelihood that each recipient would have had  his or her aid award affected was estimated as equal to the percentage  who would have had their EFC changed because of the proposed  update that we estimated from our analysis of the aid applicant sample  file.", "Estimating whether students would have seen a change in their loan  amounts because of the proposed update is complex largely because these  loan amounts depend on the extent to which all other financial aid  awards\u2014including Campus-Based, state, and institutional aid\u2014would  have been affected, and no complete information is available on the  specific awarding policies of all states and institutions for these types of  aid. To compensate for this lack of information, we made several  assumptions regarding how Stafford and PLUS loans would have been  affected, which may either over- or underestimate what the actual changes  would have been. However, these assumptions may somewhat offset each  other, and we believe our estimates are informative of the percentage of  borrowers whose loan awards could have been affected.", "Stafford and PLUS loan estimates may be biased upward for the following  reasons. Stafford loan estimates may be biased upward because we  assumed that all borrowers who currently receive less than the maximum  allowed and whose EFC would have changed under the proposed update  would have had their loan award amount changed as well, yet this is not  always the case. For example, because the subsidized loan award equals  the cost of attendance less EFC and other financial aid awards, subject to  the loan limits, subsidized Stafford loan amounts would not have been  affected if the decrease in other financial aid awards exactly offset the  EFC increase resulting from the proposed update. Because the  unsubsidized Stafford loan award equals the cost of attendance less other  financial aid awards (including subsidized loan awards), subject to the  loan limits, unsubsidized loan amounts would not have been affected if  other aid awards did not change because of the update. Furthermore, we  assumed that all PLUS borrowers whose EFC would have changed  because of the update would have had their loan award affected, but,  similar to unsubsidized Stafford loans, this would not have occurred had  other aid awards not changed because of the update. It is difficult to know  the size of this upward bias because the dataset does not include  information on the extent to which other financial aid awards would have  been affected.", "Our estimates for Stafford loans may be biased downward because we  assumed that all borrowers who receive the maximum allowed would not  have had their loan award affected, which also is not always the case. For  unsubsidized Stafford loans, this bias appears to be very small because  unsubsidized loans would only decrease if students have a cumulative net  increase in their other financial aid awards, which case studies and expert  interviews show to be unlikely. For subsidized Stafford loans, this bias  may be larger, yet we believe that it is still relatively small. Subsidized  Stafford loan awards that are currently at the maximum would only  decrease when the EFC plus other aid increase enough to cause the  student to lose eligibility for the maximum loan amount, and analysis of  the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS) shows that most  students are not likely to face this circumstance.", "We also assumed that the borrowers in award year 2004\u20132005, the year of  the proposed update, are from the same states, have the same incomes,  and have the same costs of attendance as the most recent CEAD-STAB  borrowers, and the extent to which they differ would cause our estimates  to be less accurate. For example, if we underestimate the number of  students in likely high-impact states, our estimates would likely  underestimate the overall proportion of students who could face a change  in their loan award.", "To complement this national-level loan analysis, we determined the  percentage of students at our case study schools who would have  experienced a change in their subsidized and unsubsidized loans, along  with the size and direction of the changes. We could not determine this  information for PLUS loans for our case study schools since the schools  did not package PLUS loans for the purpose of estimating potential  impacts of the proposed update."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Institutional Need-Based Aid and Campus-Based Aid", "paragraphs": ["To provide illustrative examples of how the proposed update can affect  state and institutional need-based aid and Campus-Based aid, we worked  closely with two states\u2014Wisconsin and Tennessee\u2014and four colleges,  including one public and one private nonprofit institution in each of the  two states. We chose these states because they use the Higher Education  Act (HEA) federal methodology to disburse state aid, are geographically  dispersed, and represent high- and low-impact states, based on an index  we calculated for the following components: (1) the average EFC change  resulting from Education\u2019s update, (2) the percentage of full-time  undergraduates receiving grant aid, and (3) the average state need-based  grant per undergraduate. We averaged the three components to generate  an index of the overall average impact. The 44 states and the District of  Columbia that use the federal methodology were then sorted in  descending index order and separated into three groups of 15, with the  highest index group being designated \u201chigh-impact states,\u201d the next group  being designated \u201cmedium-impact states,\u201d and the last group being  designated \u201clow-impact states.\u201d For the components and index value we  estimated for each state, see appendix II. The institutions we chose  include the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s Marian  College, Middle Tennessee State University, and Tennessee\u2019s Carson- Newman College. We chose schools within the two selected states based  on the following criteria: (1) use of the HEA federal methodology to  disburse aid, (2) participation in the federal Campus-Based aid program,  (3) provision of institutional need-based aid, (4) number of students with  household income between $25,000 and $75,000, and (5) willingness and  capacity to calculate estimated impacts on need-based aid.", "For each of these two states and four institutions, we generated a  subsample from Education\u2019s aid applicant sample file that reflects the  students who attended school in these two states and the students who  attended school at the four institutions in the 2002\u20132003 award year. For  each student, the dataset contained information on the student\u2019s estimated  EFC under the current and proposed allowance and the student\u2019s  dependency status. Using these subsamples, examples of the effect of the  proposed update on state, institutional, and Campus-Based aid were  calculated. While the aid applicant sample file is a nationally  representative sample, it may not be representative of the aid applicants  who attend school in these specific states or at these specific institutions.  The subsamples had the following number of observations:     Wisconsin: 7,469,     Tennessee: 8,385,     University of Wisconsin at Madison: 580,     Wisconsin\u2019s Marian College: 54,     Middle Tennessee State University: 533, and     Tennessee\u2019s Carson-Newman College: 62.", "We estimated the impacts on Wisconsin\u2019s state need-based aid using the  Wisconsin subsample, along with the state aid award methodologies  provided to us by the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board.

While the focus was on need-based institutional aid and Campus-Based  aid, three institutions also calculated the effect on Stafford loans. To  check the validity of these simulations, we checked (1) the order in which  different forms of aid were awarded to see if they were consistent with  common aid packaging protocols, (2) the formulas used to calculate  remaining need at each stage of the award packaging process to make sure  they were accurate, (3) the range of aid levels awarded to make sure they  fell within bounds defined by regulation, (4) the total aid awarded to make  sure it did not exceed financial need, and (5) the relationship between aid  awarded and EFC levels to make sure that those with lower EFCs were  provided more aid than those with higher EFCs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Estimated Tax Rates from Alternative Data Sources", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["For the purposes of this report, we define \u201cfamilies\u201d to include parents of  dependent children (students) and independent students with dependents  other than a spouse, and we define \u201cindividuals\u201d to include dependent  students and independent students without dependents other than a  spouse.
