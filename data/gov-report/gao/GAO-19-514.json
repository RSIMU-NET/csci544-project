Airlines are responsible for operating and maintaining their IT systems.", "GAO was asked to review airline IT outages. GAO examined: (1) DOT's and FAA's roles related to airline IT outages and (2) what is known about these outages and their effects on passengers. GAO identified relevant federal laws and responsibilities and interviewed DOT and FAA officials. In the absence of DOT and FAA data to identify airline IT outages, GAO identified outages using open source documents for the 12 airlines reporting to BTS from 2015 through 2017 and validated these outages using a multi-step process with publicly available airline information, interviews with airline representatives, and FAA and DOT data. GAO also reviewed airlines' contracts of carriage, which are legally binding contracts between airlines and passengers, to understand how airlines accommodate passengers inconvenienced by IT outages, as well as 140 consumer complaints related to airline IT outages received by DOT from 2015 through June 2018."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Transportation (DOT) and, within it, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have limited roles overseeing or addressing the effects of outages from information technology (IT) systems that airlines rely on to schedule and transport passengers (e.g., reservation or flight planning systems).", "FAA's operations and oversight. At an airline's request, FAA may halt the operation of all or part of that airline's flights during an outage and work with the airline to reintegrate flights upon recovery. FAA does not directly oversee airline IT systems but works with airlines to ensure that airline data interfaces correctly with FAA's operational systems.", "DOT's consumer protection. Airline IT outages are not specifically addressed in DOT's consumer protections for passengers, although other protections may apply, such as restrictions on tarmac delays if a passenger is held on a flight during an outage. DOT oversees airlines' adherence to their contracts with passengers. These may include specific provisions such as refund procedures and responsibility for delayed flights, among other things. DOT also receives consumer complaints and uses complaint data to initiate investigations that may result in fines or enforcement actions.", "DOT's data collection. DOT requires large airlines to report information about on-time performance to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), including the causes of flight delays and cancellations in several broad categories (e.g., airline caused, weather, and late-arriving aircraft).", "Using multiple sources, GAO identified 34 IT outages from 2015 through 2017, affecting 11 of 12 selected airlines. No government data were available to identify IT outages or determine how many flights or passengers were affected by such outages. BTS data provide information to consumers about airline performance broadly but are not designed to identify the effects of individual events, such as the number of flight delays and cancellations resulting from IT outages. According to GAO's validation of multiple sources, however, about 85 percent of the identified outages resulted in some flight delays or cancellations. Because of limited data, information about how passengers have been inconvenienced from outages is largely anecdotal (see figure for examples of inconveniences). Further, airlines vary in what they provide to these passengers (e.g., food, hotel, or rebooking on another airline) when IT outages occur. Consumer complaints stemming from IT outages accounted for less than one percent of all complaints received by DOT from 2015 through June 2018, and according to agency officials, these complaints raised concerns similar to complaints resulting from other causes of flight disruption. Complaints reviewed by GAO included the lack of food, a hotel, or compensation, among other things."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, several information technology (IT) system outages at  U.S. airlines have drawn public attention to the resulting widespread  disruption to air travel.

We determined that these  data were not designed, and could not be used, to comprehensively  identify airline IT outages. However, these data provided some insight  into flight disruptions (i.e., flight delays or cancellations) and ground stops  caused by outages once we had identified outages through other sources  and could look at data for specific dates.", "In the absence of DOT or FAA data to identify airline IT outages, we  validated a preliminary list of such outages that we developed using open  source material from 2015 through 2017 for the 12 airlines that were  required to report on-time performance information to BTS during this  time period and two leading third-party IT providers (Amadeus and Sabre)  that provide airlines with the types of IT services included in our scope.  This validation was done using publicly available airline information (e.g.,  on websites and in press releases) and interviews with representatives  from 11 of the 12 airlines, Amadeus, and Sabre.

With thousands of employees and  hundreds of aircraft, network airlines support large, complex hub-and- spoke operations, which provide service at various fare levels to many  destinations. Low-cost airlines generally operate under a low-cost  business model, which typically includes providing point-to-point service  using fewer types of aircraft. Regional airlines typically operate small  aircraft\u2014turboprops or regional jets with up to 100 seats\u2014and generally  provide service to smaller communities on behalf of network airlines.", "Airlines rely on a wide variety of IT systems to schedule and transport  passengers; some of these IT systems interface with networks operated  by travel-booking sites, other airlines, and the FAA. These IT systems  touch all phases of a passenger\u2019s travel experience, including booking,  check-in, boarding, and baggage, as well as airline operations behind the  scene, including flight planning, crew scheduling, and flight dispatch,  according to FAA. In addition, aviation stakeholders explained that airline  IT systems operate in a dynamic, data-intensive environment that  demands around-the-clock availability and real-time information. In recent  years, the introduction of new mobile applications and  telecommunications infrastructure has added to the myriad systems and  network connections now critical to an airline\u2019s operations.", "Airlines face challenges in maintaining or enhancing their IT systems. For  example, some airlines operate a web of IT systems that were developed  over many years as manual systems transitioned to electronic and  computer-processed functions. Replacing software and upgrading these  older systems, such as reservations and crew scheduling, can be  complicated undertakings as airlines serve millions of travelers and need  to keep data flowing across their networks. For example, in its financial  filings, Southwest pointed to the significant challenges and costs involved  in introducing new IT capabilities while managing existing systems.  Increasingly dependent on the use of IT systems to run its ongoing  operations, the company recently completed a multi-year initiative to  transition to a new third-party reservation system through Amadeus,  among other investments.", "In addition, a wave of industry consolidation stemming from airline  bankruptcies in the late 2000s has affected airline IT systems, requiring  significant sustained focus among airlines on merging different IT  infrastructures necessary to support worldwide flight operations without  interruption. For instance, we previously found that United struggled to integrate computer and reservation systems following its merger with  Continental in 2010, although the airline has subsequently completed this  transition, according to airline representatives. Likewise, in 2015  American pointed to its reliance on technology when discussing principal  risks posed by the integration of its computer, communications, and other  technology systems with those of US Airways following the merger of the  two airlines.", "Additionally, some airlines rely on regional partners or third-party IT  providers to help manage certain IT systems, such as reservations, crew  scheduling, and flight dispatch, further adding to the variety of systems  that airlines depend on to run their operations. Moreover, the airline  industry is going through a transformation as it shifts to digital  merchandizing and retailing to better serve consumers, a process which  requires access to real-time information, according to an industry  stakeholder. Finally, the speed of technology evolution has accelerated,  making it a constant and iterative process to keep systems refreshed and  operating in sync, a situation that poses additional challenges, according  to a stakeholder.", "Passengers may be affected by an airline IT outage in different ways  depending, in part, on the type and severity of the outage\u2014for example,  whether the outage stems from a software glitch or a hardware failure\u2014 and the system affected. (See fig. 1.) Effects can range from standing in line to be checked in by a ticket agent instead of using a mobile  application to delayed and canceled flights if a hardware failure forces the  airline to ground all of its flights until the system is back online. System  failures may have cascading effects across other airline IT systems or  operations, as well. For example, an outage in a flight dispatch system  could cause hours-long delays for subsequent flights. Likewise, aviation  stakeholders noted that crew positioning can hinder recovery from an  outage as delayed flight crews \u201ctime out,\u201d further extending the effects of  an outage. In addition to these effects, passengers and airlines can also  face higher costs from delayed or canceled travel, including increased  operational expenses facing airlines as crews and aircraft sit idle, as well  as indirect costs, such as those faced by travelers as their itineraries are  delayed or canceled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA and DOT Have Limited Roles in Overseeing Airline IT Systems and Addressing Effects from Outages on Passengers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Role Is Primarily Initiating Traffic Management Initiatives Requested by Airlines", "paragraphs": ["FAA plays a key, but limited, operational role in responding to airline IT  outages.

As a result, FAA officials explained  that if flights are delayed or canceled because of an airline IT outage, the  NAS is often less congested for those that remain flying.", "However, in managing the air-traffic control system, FAA is responsible  for initiating and administering traffic management initiatives (such as a  ground stop) if requested by an airline experiencing an IT outage. For  example, an airline might request that FAA initiate a ground stop if the  airline is unable to report flight dispatch information to the FAA, such as  the weight and balance of aircraft. FAA works with airlines to  accommodate flights back into the NAS when the outage is over. Once an  airline recovers from an outage, FAA may also need to initiate traffic  management initiatives if demand exceeds capacity in the system\u2014 potentially causing delays both for the airline that experienced the outage,  as well as others.", "FAA does not routinely collect data about airline IT outages\u2014which fall  outside of its management of the NAS, according to agency officials\u2014 although it does collect data on NAS operations, which could include  some information about these events.

This  preliminary list was validated through a combination of interviews with the  airlines and third-party IT providers and a review of publicly available  airline information, FAA NTML log entries, and DOT consumer  complaints. Through our validation process, airline representatives and  others identified additional airline IT outages that had not been reported  or acknowledged publicly by airlines or third-party IT providers, reflecting  the variation in quantity or quality of information available regarding these  events. For example, we found more information about IT outages that  had nationwide or multi-day consumer or operational effects because  these incidents garnered more coverage\u2014and often an official airline  response\u2014as compared to those that were of shorter duration or affected  a regional carrier or smaller number of flights, passengers, or airports.  Additionally, we found less or incomplete information on outages at third- party IT providers and regional carriers because their effects were  dispersed across multiple airlines.", "We found that the number and severity of flight disruptions associated  with the airline IT outages we identified varied widely. About 85 percent  (29 of 34) of our identified outages resulted in some flight disruptions,  including 5 outages we identified that caused over 800 delays or  cancellations. However, we were unable to verify the exact number of  disrupted flights caused by each outage. At least 14 outages resulted in a  ground stop, some of which lasted for several hours, according to a  review of FAA\u2019s NTML logs. We identified seven outages that had no  associated flight disruptions, although they inconvenienced customers in  other ways. For example, during these incidents customers experienced  problems buying tickets online, checking into flights on an airline\u2019s  website, or using frequent flier benefits.", "Because no comprehensive data are available on airline IT outages and  their related effects, we could not compare these incidents with the  effects on flights caused by other disruptive events, such as severe  weather like hurricanes or snowstorms. However, FAA analysis of two of  the IT outages that caused over 800 flight disruptions found that the  number of delays or cancellations resulting from these outages was on  par with or worse than those caused by severe weather in the same  months the outages occurred. Likewise, representatives from one airline  stated that operational effects from airline IT outages are comparable to  severe weather events, although outages occur much less frequently. An  aviation industry representative noted that these events are typically  unexpected, hindering the ability of airlines to react and recover. By  contrast, disruptions from weather may be forecast ahead of time,  allowing airlines to prepare for predicted disruptions, including  accommodating customers, adjusting flight crews and schedules, and  pre-positioning aircraft, according to the same representative.", "The airline IT outages we identified were caused by a range of IT and  infrastructure issues, according to airline representatives we interviewed  and official press statements. These issues included hardware failures,  software outages or slowdowns, power or telecommunications failures,  and network connectivity issues, among others. In several instances, an  IT issue in one airline system had cascading effects across other systems  not affected by the initial outage. For example, a large volume of online  traffic shut down an airline\u2019s website and subsequently disrupted the  airline\u2019s reservations and check-in systems. Representatives from six  airlines, an IT expert, and four other aviation industry stakeholders  pointed to a variety of factors that could contribute to an outage or  magnify the effect of an IT disruption. These factors ranged from  underinvestment in IT systems after years of poor airline profitability,  increasing requirements on aging systems or systems not designed to  work together, and the introduction of new customer-oriented platforms  and services.", "Representatives from airlines we interviewed also described some of their  IT system investments and risk mitigation efforts undertaken in response  to an outage or to address potential disruptions, such as investing in new  backup systems or technologies. For example, five airlines have sought  to reduce vulnerability by expanding IT operations beyond a single data  center or moving them to the cloud, which allows for the delivery of  computing services through the Internet. Likewise, two airlines described  efforts to ensure connectivity and reduce the effects of IT disruptions by  using multiple telecommunications network providers. Several airline  representatives and an IT expert said that these airline IT investments are  aimed at enhancing overall system functionality as well as revenue.  However, the IT risk expert we spoke with noted that carrying out major  upgrades to their IT systems can be challenging because these systems  are always in use. Additionally, according to stakeholders we interviewed,  airlines employ a variety of contingency planning and recovery strategies  to respond to unforeseen technical issues, including IT outages. For  example, one airline described incorporating routine system testing,  artificial intelligence, and outage drills into planning for system disruptions  to avoid outages or speed recovery. Airline efforts to increase the  resiliency of their IT systems, such as those described above, could  prevent or lessen the impact of such outages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BTS Data Broadly Capture Flight Delays and Cancellations", "paragraphs": ["BTS data capture the causes of flight delays and cancellations in several  broad categories, which do not isolate flight disruptions resulting from  airline IT outages and do not reflect the root cause of flight disruptions.

On a  monthly basis, certain airlines are required to report at least one cause of  delay (in minutes) for each flight delayed 15 minutes or more from the  following five categories: air carrier, extreme weather, NAS, security, and  late arriving aircraft. Similarly, for each flight that was canceled, airlines  are required to report the cause from one of four categories: air carrier,  extreme weather, NAS, and security. BTS guidance instructs airlines to  report flight delays that are within the control of the airlines in the air- carrier category. Also included in the air-carrier category, according to the  guidance, are more than 40 other potential causes of delays or  cancellations, such as aircraft maintenance, baggage, terminal  operations, and crew matters. As a result, flight disruptions from IT outages are indistinguishable from other airline-caused issues within this  category.", "Additionally, delays caused by airline IT outages may be captured in a  category other than air carrier because of how airlines can report the  causes of flight delays based on BTS guidance.

Airlines have the option to report either  just the main cause or all the causes for a flight delay as long as the  airline consistently applies the same method in its monthly report to  BTS. Also, if there is more than one cause for a flight delay that starts  at the same time, airlines are required to report the cause that lasted  the longest. As a result, delays caused by an airline IT outage may be  attributed to other categories if they happen at the same time as other  issues affecting an airline\u2019s operations, such as poor weather or  airport conditions.", "Late arriving aircraft delays. Airlines can report a flight delay in the  late arriving aircraft category if the previous flight arrived late and  caused the next flight (on the same aircraft) to depart late. Airlines are  not required to provide additional information on the cause of the  delay for the previous flight (air carrier, NAS, security, or extreme  weather). As a result, delays from incidents that can cause ripple  effects on an airline\u2019s operations, such as an IT outage or severe  thunderstorms, may be attributed to the late arriving aircraft category.", "NAS delays. Airlines can report delays in the control of the FAA,  airport operators, or state and local officials in the NAS category,  which includes ground stops, flight volume delays, and air traffic  control issues, among others. However, BTS guidance does not  specify how airlines should report delays caused by ground stops  requested by the airlines, including after an IT outage.

In addition, we reviewed BTS data for the 5 outages  we identified where the airline involved delayed or canceled at least 800  total flights and found that airlines spread the causes of flight delays and  cancellations across several categories, primarily air carrier, late arriving  aircraft, and NAS for the first day of these outages. For example, we  found that airlines attributed 44 percent of all reported flight delays to late  arriving aircraft for these days. (See fig. 4).", "DOT officials did not see a need for additional reporting requirements on  flight delays and cancellations caused by airline IT outages given the  effects of such events are not unique when compared to other causes of  flight delay and because these incidents involve a small portion of  consumer complaints received by DOT. Aviation stakeholders we spoke  to told us that airlines track flight disruptions for internal purposes such as  managing operations and scheduling. For example, representatives from  one airline said that the airline tracks delays and cancellations associated  with IT outages and other issues internally to identify patterns and  reoccurring issues that need improvement, such as scheduling, staffing,  and maintenance. DOT officials noted that obtaining more detailed  information on the causes of flight delays and cancellations would require  a cost and benefit analysis to determine whether the benefit from  collecting the data would exceed the airlines\u2019 cost to report the data.  Officials also noted that the agency has undertaken efforts to provide  additional information to consumers. Notably, to provide more insight  into the underlying causes of delay attributed to late arriving aircraft, BTS  began calculating the original causes of delays in the late arriving aircraft  category and providing these data on its website in response to a  recommendation made by the DOT Inspector General in 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on the Effects on Passengers Is Largely Anecdotal and Illustrates Varied Passenger Experiences", "paragraphs": ["No data are publicly available to quantify with any degree of precision the  number of passengers affected by airline IT outages, and only one airline  provided this type of information to us.

For example, passengers may be affected by the  complexity of the NAS and their individual circumstances. According to an  airline representative we spoke with, an airline may be able to quickly  rebook affected passengers on a different airline for one destination, for  example, but may have difficulty rebooking passengers for another  destination if other flights are full. Further, while network airlines have  hub-and-spoke networks that include a number of route options or  frequent service between cities, others\u2014particularly point-to-point or low- cost carriers\u2014may have more limited service, further constraining the  ability to rebook individual passengers.

Beyond these requirements, however, airlines are not obligated to  provide accommodations for flight disruptions such as cancellations and  delays unless specified in an airline\u2019s contract of carriage, according to  DOT. These contracts govern what, if anything, a passenger is entitled  to, although airlines may offer additional accommodations to  inconvenienced passengers. Generally accommodations received by  inconvenienced passengers could include rebooking on the same airline  or alternate travel; refunds or compensation in the form of money or other  benefits (e.g., credit for later travel); and amenities such as hotel stays  and food, according to their contracts of carriage. Airlines can\u2014and in  some cases do\u2014go above and beyond the obligations set forth in their  contracts of carriage, as illustrated by some examples below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accommodations Included in Airlines\u2019 Contracts of Carriage Vary", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the accommodations that passengers may have  received as the result of airline IT outages, we reviewed airlines\u2019 contracts  of carriage for the airlines in our scope with applicable contracts. None  of these contracts addressed IT outages directly, but flight disruptions  caused by outages would be covered under the broader contract terms  addressing cancellations and delays. We found that the contracts vary in  terms of what accommodations are provided for, as well as the extent to  which airlines have discretion in providing them. For example, while  several airline contracts include provisions to provide hotel vouchers,  transportation to the hotel, or meals, other airlines\u2014notably several low- cost carriers\u2014do not. Likewise, some airlines establish set time  thresholds for when they are obligated to provide a certain  accommodation (e.g., after a delay of at least 4 hours), while others do  not. Specific accommodations we identified in our review of airline  contracts of carriage are discussed below, and table 1 further details  some of the variation that we found.", "Alternate transportation. All nine airlines in our analysis provide for  rebooking on their own airline in the event of a flight delay or  cancellation such as might be caused by an airline IT outage,  although Frontier includes certain airports near a passenger\u2019s original  destination as acceptable alternatives in its contract of carriage.  Under this exception, for example, Frontier could rebook a passenger  on a flight to Tampa if he or she had originally planned to travel to  Orlando, or vice versa, in the event of a flight disruption. Three of the  airline contracts of carriage we reviewed provide for travel on a  different airline\u2014or the use of alternate ground transportation\u2014 typically at their discretion, and a fourth airline provides for alternate  transportation if a passenger\u2019s flight has been diverted to a different  airport. Airline representatives with two low-cost carriers described  their unsuccessful efforts to develop agreements with network airlines  to facilitate the rebooking of passengers on another airline.", "Refunds for cancellations. If a flight is canceled and no alternative is  available\u2014or if available flights are not acceptable to the passenger\u2014 all nine airlines in our analysis provide for refunds, although three  airlines may instead reroute passengers to nearby cities. Under their  contracts of carriage, airlines typically provide refunds for the unused  portion of a ticket in the event of flight disruptions. If, for example,  passengers have already completed the outbound portion of a  roundtrip ticket, they would receive a partial refund for the unused,  return portion, rather than the entire ticket. Finally, three airlines  (Hawaiian, Southwest, and United) offer passengers the option of  travel credits in lieu of a refund in their contracts of carriage.", "Refunds for delays. The majority of airlines in our review provides  refunds or flight credit for flight delays, although refunds in some  cases could be contingent on the absence of an acceptable  alternative, such as being rebooked on a subsequent flight or to an  alternate airport. As mentioned above, DOT requires airlines to  provide refunds for flights that are \u201csignificantly delayed\u201d but does not  define how long such a delay is and instead relies on a case-by-case  determination. Four of the contracts we reviewed establish a specific  timeframe for the delay after which a passenger is entitled to a refund,  while the others do not establish such a threshold. For example, a  passenger flying on Alaska Airlines could request and receive a  refund for a flight disruption lasting at least 2 hours, and passengers  on Delta are entitled to a refund, if requested, after a 90 minute delay.  By contrast, airlines without a defined threshold for a delayed flight  have discretion for when passengers would be eligible for refunds,  particularly with regard to nonrefundable tickets.", "Hotel stay. The majority of airlines in our review provide for hotel  stays in their contracts of carriage (and ground transportation to the  hotel), to varying degrees, although two low-cost carriers (Frontier and  Southwest) do not. The contracts of carriage for seven airlines include  a hotel stay for passengers inconvenienced by flight disruptions, and  of these  four stipulate that passengers have to be away from home or from  their points of origin or destination;  five require that the flight disruption span certain hours (e.g., 10pm  to 6am); and one includes credit for a long-distance phone call.", "Four of the contracts we reviewed include additional provisions for  hotel stays (or other accommodations) to passengers with disabilities  or other needs. For example, under its contract of carriage, American  will provide amenities to maintain the safety and welfare of certain  passengers if they are delayed (e.g., customers with disabilities,  unaccompanied children, the elderly, or others with special needs or  circumstances).", "Food. Three airlines in our review provide for meals for passengers  inconvenienced by flight disruptions in their contracts of carriage. For  example, JetBlue\u2019s contract of carriage provides for meal vouchers or  pizza for flight delays of 6 or more hours. In addition, airlines may  deliver meals or offer other amenities to passengers waiting for  delayed or canceled flights, even in the absence of the promise of  food in the contract of carriage. In these cases, additional  accommodations may be publicly announced on airline websites, by  social media accounts, or through statements to the press, or they  may be provided directly to individual flights or passengers at the  airport. For example, in response to severe thunderstorms in 2017,  Delta had pizza delivered to passengers waiting in airports across the  Southeast.", "Monetary compensation or travel credit. Inconvenienced  passengers are not entitled to monetary compensation in the case of  a flight delay or cancellation in the United States, and none of the  airlines in our review includes such compensation in their contracts of  carriage. Nevertheless, two airline contracts of carriage include  provisions for travel credit\u2014above and beyond a refund\u2014for flight  disruptions. JetBlue\u2019s contract of carriage provides for travel credit for  canceled or delayed flights with several tiers, depending on the timing  of the cancellation or length of the delay. For example, passengers  delayed over 6 hours are entitled to $250 credit for future travel on  JetBlue. Likewise, Alaska\u2019s contract provides for a discount code for  future travel (and a letter of apology) for passengers delayed longer  than 2 hours. Although not included in Delta\u2019s contract of carriage, the  airline provided $200 in travel vouchers to all customers with flight  disruptions lasting at least 3 hours for two of the IT outages we  identified, according to airline representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumer Concerns Stemming from Airline IT Outages", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned above, collecting and analyzing passenger complaints is  one way DOT helps ensure that an airline fulfills its obligations included in  its contract of carriage and customer service plan, as well as any  additional accommodations that may be publicly offered. Our review of  passenger complaints filed with DOT stemming from airline IT outages  found that they included complaints related to the lack of monetary  compensation for delayed or canceled flights and refusals to refund other  expenses, such as rental cars or missed hotel or cruise reservations,  among other concerns. For example, complaints related to a Southwest  outage in 2016 included several related to lack of compensation or other  amenities, such as food or hotel stays offered by the airline. As noted  above, Southwest\u2019s contract of carriage does not provide for  compensation, food, or hotel stays in the event of a delay or cancellation.  Complaints filed after the Delta outage of 2016 acknowledged receipt of a  $200 travel voucher in compensation or a hotel voucher, but pointed to  other non-refunded expenses incurred or difficulties in redeeming these  vouchers.", "The three consumer or passenger advocacy groups with whom we spoke  raised several concerns with regard to passengers inconvenienced by  airline IT outages. Stakeholders we spoke with responded to these  concerns and addressed how airlines respond to IT outages.", "Passengers may not receive the same accommodations. In the  absence of requirements for accommodations or compensation,  passengers are dependent on whether or not the affected airline  chooses to be generous, according to the consumer advocates we  interviewed. They also noted that mileage plan or first class  passengers may receive more accommodations than others, even  when passengers are affected by the same underlying outage, as  may be true in other circumstances, as well. Representatives from  one airline told us that they attempt to promptly address the needs of  all of their passengers but acknowledged that accommodations may  vary depending on passenger circumstances, including passenger  status (e.g., frequent-flyer program members or VIP travelers).", "Airline obligations toward affected passengers may be confusing for  passengers. According to consumer advocates we spoke with, even if  a passenger understands that an airline\u2019s contract of carriage lays out  its obligations to passengers affected by an IT outage, these contracts  are often lengthy and difficult to understand. As noted above, our  review of DOT complaints stemming from airline IT outages found that  many passengers expected to receive compensation or other  accommodations in response to these events, although such  accommodations were not included in contracts of carriage. We  reported in 2017 that airlines committed to reviewing their contracts of  carriage to see if they could be simplified.", "Contracts of carriage may not clearly exclude IT outages from force  majeure events, according to consumer advocates. Flight disruptions  caused by extreme weather, terrorism, and other events that are seen  as being beyond the control of the airline are typically treated as  special situations in airline contracts of carriage, and as a result,  inconvenienced passengers may not receive accommodations that  they otherwise might. Consumer advocates voiced concerns that  airline IT outages might be treated as events outside the airline\u2019s  control (i.e., Acts of God or force majeure events) given ambiguity in  how these exceptions are defined. We found that IT outages were not  explicitly included among the force majeure events identified in the  contracts of carriage we reviewed. In interviews and written  statements, representatives with four of the airlines in our review  varied in the extent to which they characterized airline IT outages as  incidents in the control of the airline, but generally indicated that  passengers would be accommodated as if the outages were."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Department of Transportation (DOT) with a draft of this  report for review and comment.

Our scope excluded IT systems involved in avionics (such as  aircraft navigation systems); in-flight operations (such as passenger WiFi  networks); and internal operations (such as company email systems). Our  analysis included the 12 airlines that were required to report on-time  performance information to DOT\u2019s Bureau of Transportation Statistics  (BTS) from 2015 through 2017, including network carriers (Alaska,  American, Delta, and United); low-cost carriers (Frontier, JetBlue, Spirit,  Southwest, and Virgin America); regional carriers that provide service for  partner airlines (ExpressJet and SkyWest); and Hawaiian, which provides  a niche service. Given the role of third-party IT providers, we also  included Amadeus and Sabre in our scope.", "To identify relevant DOT and FAA authorities and responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis  airline IT outages in several areas, including operations, oversight, and  data-collection, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and  guidance, as well as prior GAO work addressing agency roles.

These two offices are responsible for programs related to air traffic control  systems and assessing the performance of the NAS, respectively.", "Through our review of relevant plans and an interview with officials in  DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary, we determined that airline IT systems are  not included in federal plans for critical infrastructure protection.  According to DOT officials, outages in these systems do not have the  potential to reach established thresholds for potential casualties or  damages. By contrast, air traffic control systems and airports are  included in sector-specific plans addressing critical infrastructure  protection in the case of a terrorist attack or other natural or manmade  disaster.", "To determine what is known about airline IT outages, we reviewed DOT  data sources, including BTS and FAA performance and operations data,  as well as passenger complaints received by DOT in response to airline  IT outages from 2015 through August 2018. We also conducted  interviews with or received written responses from 11 (of 12) airlines in  our scope, and interviewed other stakeholders, including third-party IT  system providers Amadeus and Sabre; an IT risk expert (Robert  Charette); industry associations, including Airlines for American (A4A),  the Regional Airline Association (RAA), and Airports Council International  (ACI); and employee union representatives with the Air Line Pilots  Association (ALPA).", "We determined that DOT and FAA data were not designed, and could not  be used, to comprehensively identify airline IT outages. To identify airline  IT outages in the absence of detailed DOT or FAA data, academic  literature, or internal (proprietary) airline data on these incidents, we  validated a preliminary list of such outages developed using open source  material that included media coverage and publicly available airline  sources for outages from 2015 through 2017. Specifically, we  searched GAO subscription databases (e.g., ProQuest, Nexis, and  EBSCO) to create a preliminary list of 37 airline IT outages from  media coverage; performed additional searches of articles and official airline websites  to collect more information on and corroborate incidents identified; provided our list of identified IT outages to the 12 airlines in our scope  and two third-party IT providers (Amadeus and Sabre) for  confirmation; and  corroborated 20 of the identified IT outages with FAA\u2019s National  Traffic Management Log\u2019s (NTML) log entries and DOT\u2019s consumer  complaint data.", "Through this process, we were able to corroborate 34 airline IT outages  from 2015 through 2017, and we are confident that our list of outages  includes all of the outages large enough to garner national-level, multi- day media coverage and an official response from an airline executive.  While accurate, our list is not comprehensive because three airlines and a  third-party IT provider identified additional outages that we did not find in  our preliminary search, including one airline that shared information on  more than 20 additional outages. We did not include these additional  outages in our count to ensure that our methodology was consistent.", "To account for outages that may have occurred subsequent to our review,  we identified an online listing of airline IT outages and validated 9 of 11 of  the outages included from 2018 through January 2019 using publicly  available airline or airport information or coverage in at least 3 media  sources. This list and our validation process provides evidence that  airline IT outages continued to occur during this timeframe, but does not  match the rigor applied to the identification of outages we identified from  2015 through 2017. As a result, we are not confident that this list  identified all of the outages large enough to garner national-level, multi- day media coverage and an official response from an airline executive.", "Once we had identified airline IT outages through other sources and  could look at data for specific dates, we were able to use DOT and FAA  data to provide additional insight into flight disruptions (i.e., flight delays or  cancellations) and ground stops caused by outages. For example, we  requested that FAA conduct analysis on 3 of the 34 outages we had  identified to determine what FAA operational data could reveal about the  effects of these outages. We selected these 3 outages to reflect a range  of flight disruptions for comparative analysis, including variations in size  and cause of the outage. We also assessed the extent to which the  effects on passengers could be seen in the BTS on-time performance  data reported by airlines. For these data, we sought to determine the  cause and magnitude of delays and cancellations for each outage. We  also reviewed NTML log entries for the dates of known outages to further  identify potential information, including incidents of ground stops. Finally,  to obtain more information about the potential effects on passengers  resulting from these events, we reviewed consumer complaints to DOT  stemming from airline IT outages. These complaints were provided to us  by DOT\u2019s Aviation Consumer Protection Division and include reference to  the associated outage.", "To understand how airlines accommodate inconvenienced passengers,  we reviewed airline contracts of carriage for 9 of the 12 the airlines in our  scope.
