GAO surveyed state child care administrators, interviewed HHS, Department of Education (Education), and other federal and state officials; interviewed ECCE experts and researchers; analyzed Census Bureau and Head Start data; conducted a literature search; and reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The paid early child care and education (ECCE) workforce was made up of approximately 1.8 million workers in a range of positions, most of whom had relatively low levels of education and income, according to Census\u0092s 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) data. For example, nearly half of all child care workers had a high school degree or less as did 20 percent of preschool teachers. Average yearly income ranged from $11,500 for a child care worker working in a child\u0092s home to $18,000 for a preschool teacher. Experts and government officials that we spoke with said, in general, better educated and trained ECCE workers are more effective than those with less education and training. They also noted the need for more comprehensive workforce data\u0097such as on workers with specialized ECCE training. While existing ECCE workforce data provide valuable insight into worker characteristics, critical data gaps exist. For example, these data omit key segments of ECCE workers, such as some caregivers who provide child care in their own homes, and also do not separately identify preschool teachers working in elementary schools. HHS and Education have taken steps to improve ECCE workforce data, such as providing guidance and funding to states to encourage the collection of state-level data and working with federal agencies to improve workforce data collected nationally.", "HHS, Education, and the states use training, scholarships, and other activities to improve ECCE worker quality, but program and funding data are scarce. For example, HHS funded online training to help Head Start teachers meet new teacher credentialing requirements. Both HHS and Education have collaborated on initiatives to improve ECCE worker quality, such as the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge Grants. For the most part, however, neither HHS nor Education track expenditures on worker quality improvement. In our survey, states reported that the most common workforce improvement activities were in-service training, coaching, and mentoring for current workers (all 37 state survey respondents) and scholarships to workers enrolled in higher education programs (34 states). Of those who knew funding sources for these activities, states reported relying primarily on state and federal child care funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

Research indicates that a critical component of  a high-quality ECCE program is qualified caregivers and teachers. A  child\u2019s successful development depends on sensitive and stimulating  relationships with adults, and well-trained and skilled ECCE caregivers  and teachers are better able to develop such relationships. Yet the  qualifications of this workforce vary due to differences in professional  requirements across states and ECCE programs, and challenges in  attracting and retaining well educated and trained workers. While  improving the quality of ECCE is important for all children, experts and  government officials say it is especially critical for children from low- income families because research shows the existence of academic  achievement gaps, at or before kindergarten, between children living in  poverty and their more affluent peers. Access to high-quality child care  and early learning programs, research finds, can improve these children\u2019s  cognitive, social-emotional, and language development, and resultant  academic performance.", "The federal government helps to improve access to high-quality ECCE  programs by subsidizing program costs. The two largest federal efforts  are the Head Start program, funded at approximately $7.2 billion, and the  Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), funded at approximately $5.0  billion in fiscal year 2010. These funding sources, as well as billions of  dollars in other ECCE federal funding, are overseen by the Departments  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (Education) and the  relevant state agencies to which these monies are allocated. For Head  Start, the federal government allocates funding directly to local  organizations that run the program; for CCDF and many other ECCE  programs, federal monies go to the relevant state agencies that  administer the programs. The state agencies must follow applicable laws  and regulations when spending these funds. Such laws and regulations  can be broad and this results in state discretion in how the funds are  used. Depending upon the funding stream, for example, federal law either  allows or requires that states or local grantees set aside portions of these  funds for activities to improve the quality of ECCE programs, including  worker quality through education, training, wage incentives, and other  activities. Little is known, however, about how states and local grantees  use such funding. Further complicating an assessment of how well these  funds are used to improve worker quality is the fact that national data  gaps exist about the composition and characteristics of this workforce,  making it difficult for policymakers to have a reliable baseline from which  to determine if effective activities are being used and if the workers who  would most benefit from them are being targeted.", "You asked us to examine issues associated with ECCE worker quality  and efforts to improve it. We addressed the following questions: (1) What  is known about the composition, education, and income of ECCE workers  and how these characteristics relate to quality? and (2) What activities are  HHS, Education, and the states financing to improve ECCE worker  quality? For our review, we focused on paid ECCE workers who care for  and educate infants to prekindergarten and school-age children in before-  and after-school programs. We used the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s (Census)  American Community Survey (ACS), an annual survey of approximately 3  million households to obtain information on these workers, because of its  large sample size and detailed information on the education level of  respondents. We also analyzed data pertaining to Head Start and Early  Head Start teachers and teaching assistants from HHS\u2019s Head Start  program for the 2008-2009 program year. We assessed the reliability of  these data and found them sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  describing the ECCE workforce. In addition, we surveyed state child care  directors in the 50 states and District of Columbia about activities and  spending to improve ECCE worker quality. We requested the state lead  agency child care administrators obtain data and information from their  counterparts in their state educational or other agencies on activities or  funding not under their purview. We obtained responses from 37 states, a  73 percent response rate; the results of this online survey are not  generalizable to all states. The responding states accounted for  approximately 86 percent of children under the age of five in 2010,  according to Census data. We interviewed HHS, Education, and state  child care officials, and representatives of academic and research groups  about activities used and challenges faced to improve education, wages,  training, and other aspects of ECCE worker quality, and reviewed  relevant federal laws and regulations. We also conducted a literature  search and consulted experts in the field to learn about the characteristics  and quality of ECCE caregivers and teachers, and the relationship  between the two. (For more information on our methodology, see  appendix I.) We conducted this performance audit from June 10, 2010,  through February 15, 2012, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

Combining these two groups is a concern,  according to ECCE experts and researchers, because the needed skills  are different. For example, one expert told us that after-school workers  need training in how to manage the behavior of older children and in  strategies that help connect after-school activities to school-day curricula.  ECCE workers who work with young children, in contrast, may benefit  more from training in how to stimulate early language and math skills.", "Classification of workers as preschool teachers or child care  providers: ECCE experts frequently express concern that the  distinction ACS and other federal statistical surveys make between  child care workers and preschool teachers is not necessarily  meaningful because both of these occupations include tasks related  to educating children.", "ACS data on workers\u2019 education levels are also limited.

It requires120 hours of training in  early childhood education and passing an assessment by the Council for  Professional Recognition.

These cycles consist of federal  interagency committees investigating if and how such codes should be  revised, with the public and government agencies not part of these  committees providing input through the public comment process  published in the Federal Register. BLS chairs the interagency committee  to revise the occupational codes, and this committee completed its most  recent revision cycle in March 2009. According to BLS officials, Education  actively participated in this revision cycle, successfully showing that the  tasks special education preschool teachers perform are sufficiently  different from the tasks general preschool teachers perform; and this in  turn justified creating a new occupational code specific to special  education preschool teachers. The next revision cycle is expected to start  in 2013, with revisions issued by 2018.

Not knowing the true size of this workforce and its education and training  levels inhibits research needed to link worker characteristics to worker  quality, and to positive outcomes, including academic achievement of  children, particularly those from low income families. Lack of data also  hinders development of targeted support for these workers. However,  data collection can be expensive and burdensome to both the agency  conducting the collection effort as well as the public responding to these  efforts. Hence careful consideration is needed when thinking through  options, costs, and the resultant value of the data to be collected. The  federal government is uniquely positioned to improve national data  collection, while balancing these considerations, because of its  experience in conducting nationwide household and business surveys  and its administration of programs and grants and accompanying  reporting requirements. HHS and Education have taken a number of  steps to improve data collection, such as funding a survey of caregivers  and teachers, and beginning to work with BLS and Census to determine  how best to improve federal statistical surveys, which include data on  ECCE workers across program settings; however, it is too early in the  process to assess the impact of these changes on federal data collection  efforts in general, let alone their ultimate success in improving federal  data on the ECCE workforce iin particular."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Health and  Human Services and Education for review and comment.

Technical comments from both agencies were  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "In their written comments, both Education and HHS generally agreed with  the report\u2019s conclusions, namely that data on the ECCE workforce need to  be improved. Both agencies also provided additional information in their  comments that gave us cause to reconsider a recommendation put forth in  the draft report that they reviewed. This additional information was not  provided to us at the time of our study or at exit meetings held with the  agencies when we discussed the findings to be included in our draft report.  It outlined how HHS and Education are working with or plan to work with  OMB, BLS and Census to improve national data on the ECCE workforce  currently available through the American Community Survey and other  federal statistical surveys. Our draft report contained a recommendation to  this effect, but in light of the new information, we have deleted it. The  additional information is contained in HHS and Education\u2019s written  comments and has been incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "HHS\u2019s comments suggested that GAO develop a recommendation  related to the capacity of the higher education system to provide  adequate professional development opportunities for all ECCE workers  who may want them, noting the information we present in the report about  the percentage of ECCE teachers without college degrees. While we  acknowledge that this is an important concern for HHS, our study\u2019s  objective was to describe what we knew about the characteristics of this  workforce, which in turn led to a discussion about the data limitations and  problems. To develop a recommendation such as the one suggested by  HHS would require us to delve into more depth about the characteristics  of the ECCE workforce, such as why education levels are low, which was  outside the scope of our study.", "HHS objected to our statement used in the Highlights page that said,  \u201csome research indicated that ECCE workers who are better educated  and trained are more effective teachers, but other research did not find as  clear a link.\u201d Due to space considerations on the Highlights page, this  sentence truncated the details laid out in the report, and as such, we have  revised it to more closely reflect the report text. That said, we stand by  our conclusions about the research as presented in the report, which is  based on interviews with experts\u2014including HHS officials\u2014as well as our  own review of the literature.", "HHS also objected to the statement in our report that HHS and Education  do not have complete information on all program workforce improvement  activities, including how they are funded. In its comments, HHS noted that  it was developing such information and provided the example of the  CCDF. For example, HHS stated that the Office of Child Care has asked  states about their professional development activities using CCDF,  including new information to be submitted beginning in December 2012.  The statement in our report, however, reflects the workforce improvement  activities across six ECCE programs pursued at both HHS and Education,  not just CCDF and we have clarified this in the report. Moreover, we  mention the new CCDF reporting requirements in the report as an  example of how some information is being gathered on workforce quality  improvement activities.", "Lastly, HHS outlined other efforts that they have undertaken over the past  2 years to improve ECCE workforce data. Many of these examples were  already in the report, although we did incorporate some additional details  on them from HHS\u2019s comments where appropriate.", "In its comments, Education cited concerns that not all data limitations  raised in the report could be solved through improving ACS or other  federal statistical data. We agree with this perspective and do not believe  that we suggest this in the report. We highlight the ACS and the other  federal surveys because they are the current vehicles by which the  federal government is collecting ECCE data through agencies such as  BLS and Census. We assume that any effort among the various federal  agencies about how to improve the data would delve more explicitly into  what data were needed by the agencies and which changes, if any, made  sense for any particular database. Education also cited the balance that  Census in particular has struck between the need for more data and the  public burden of responding to such data collection efforts. Again, we fully  agree with the need to balance data collection and public burden and  have cited the need for this balance in our concluding observations.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, the Secretary of Education, the appropriate  congressional committees, and other interested parties.

We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing the  composition, education level, and income of the ECCE workforce.", "We also examined Head Start and Early Head Start PIR data. Head Start  grantees report on the Head Start and Early Head Start programs they  administer annually to HHS using HHS\u2019s PIR reporting system; we used  data from the 2008-2009 program year. We assessed the reliability of  these data by reviewing available documentation, discussing the  strengths and limitations of the data with HHS Head Start officials, and  conducting computerized reliability tests on the data that we used. We  determined that the fields relating to education and salary of Head Start  and Early Head Start teachers, as well as teaching assistants, were  sufficiently reliable to include in this report. Because salary data for  teachers and teaching assistants were reported as an average by position  for each Head Start or Early Head Start program, we averaged these data  across all programs and weighted them by program size and numbers of  teachers and teaching assistants in order to report them as an average  for all programs by Head Start position.", "Although PIR data contain education and salary information on Head  Start program directors, we did not report these data for two reasons.  First, PIR data do not uniquely identify program directors and this can  result in double counting because one director can oversee multiple  programs, according to HHS Head Start officials. Second, HHS officials  also told us that Head Start program directors often oversee programs  that are much larger and more varied than a typical child care or  preschool program, thus they are not necessarily comparable to directors  of these other program types.", "We also interviewed ECCE experts and federal officials to obtain their  perspectives on ECCE worker quality and on the availability and limitations  of ECCE workforce data. We identified experts and government officials by  reviewing studies and policy papers, attending two conferences, and  reviewing applicable websites.

Our discussions on ECCE worker quality covered such  topics as perspectives on quality of the ECCE workforce as a whole, as  well as for workers in particular ECCE workplace settings (e.g., child care,  preschools, or Head Start programs) and if and how education and income  levels relate to worker quality.

We sent the  survey to state lead agency child care administrators because they are  responsible for managing government child care programs and subsidies  in their states, including the administration of CCDF. To get as complete  information as possible, these child care administrators were requested to  contact the state educational agencies in their states and other relevant  departments about funding for activities in their states. We developed  protocols that facilitated coordination between the state lead agency child  care administrators and state departments of education to encourage full  participation in the survey. We pretested the survey in five states and  made appropriate revisions to the survey in response to these pretests.  The survey also contained questions about the reliability of the state data  systems that housed the funding data reported in the survey.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors.

We took steps in the development of the questionnaire, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize such errors. For example, a  GAO social science survey specialist designed the questionnaire, in  collaboration with GAO staff with subject-matter expertise. As we  mentioned earlier, the draft survey was pretested and was reviewed by a  second GAO social science analyst. When data were analyzed, an  independent GAO analyst verified the statistical program used for the  analysis.
