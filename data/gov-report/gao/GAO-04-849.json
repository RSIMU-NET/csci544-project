In light of the issues surrounding the debate, GAO reviewed (1) the underlying concerns that have prompted the credit union industry's interest in making changes to the current capital requirements, (2) the issues associated with the potential use of secondary capital in all federally insured credit unions, and (3) the issues associated with the potential use of risk-based capital in all federally insured credit unions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The credit union industry's interest in making changes to the current capital requirements for credit unions appears to be driven by three primary concerns: (1) that restricting the definition of net worth solely to retained earnings could trigger PCA actions due to conditions beyond credit unions' control; (2) that PCA in its present form acts as a restraint on credit union growth; and (3) that PCA tripwires, or triggers for corrective action, are too high given the conservative risk profile of most credit unions. Despite these concerns, available indicators suggest that the credit union industry has not been overly constrained as a result of the implementation of PCA. As a group, credit unions have maintained capital levels well above the level needed to be considered well-capitalized and have grown at rates exceeding those of other depository institutions during the three calendar years that PCA has been in place for credit unions. Allowing credit unions to use secondary capital instruments to meet their regulatory net worth requirements would raise a number of issues and concerns, with perhaps the most important issue centering on who would purchase the secondary capital instruments. While outside investors would provide market discipline, this would raise concerns about the potential impact on the member-owned, cooperative structure of credit unions. Inside investors, however, could impose less discipline and raise systemic risk concerns if it resulted in a situation where weaker credit unions could bring down stronger credit unions due to secondary capital investments. Other issues relate to the specific form of the capital instruments for credit unions. The credit union industry itself appeared divided on the desirability or appropriate structure of secondary capital instruments. Conceptually, the use of risk-based capital to address the concerns some in the credit union industry expressed about PCA is less controversial. Though two risk-based capital proposals were put forward, neither has garnered industry consensus and both lacked details of key components upon which to base any assessment of their merits. Risk-based capital is intended to reflect the unique risk profile of individual financial institutions; however, there are other factors that can affect an institution's financial condition that are not easily quantified. In recognition of the limitations of risk-based capital systems, bank and thrift regulators use leverage and risk-based capital requirements in tandem. GAO is aware that NCUA is constructing a more detailed risk-based capital proposal that incorporates both risk-based and leverage requirements; however due to the lack of formalized details, GAO could not perform a meaningful assessment of the proposal."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Credit unions, which have approximately 82 million members across the  United States, historically have occupied a unique niche among depository  institutions. Credit unions are member-owned cooperatives that are  exempt from federal income taxes. They do not issue capital stock; rather,  they are not-for-profit entities that build capital by retaining earnings.  Recent debate about and support for changes to the existing capital  requirements for credit unions\u2014which establishes the percentage of net  worth to total assets that they must maintain\u2014has raised concerns about  potential safety and soundness implications. These implications derive  from the many important purposes a depository institution\u2019s capital serves.  From a regulatory perspective, capital acts as a buffer against unexpected  operating losses or other adverse financial results. From a depository  institution\u2019s perspective, capital serves as a basis to generate long-term  growth. Capital is also commonly viewed as a measure of financial  strength.", "Prior to 1998, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which  regulates federally chartered credit unions and certain aspects of federally  insured state-chartered credit unions, did not impose any net worth  requirement on federally insured credit unions. Instead, as noted by  NCUA, Section 116 of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA) required credit  unions to make a periodic reserve transfer until reserves reached 6 percent  of risk-assets (10 percent for credit unions with under $5 million in assets).  Then in 1998, the Credit Union Membership Access Act (CUMAA)  established a capital-based supervisory framework called prompt  corrective action (PCA) that requires NCUA to classify federally insured  credit unions into five categories\u2014well-capitalized, adequately capitalized,  undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically  undercapitalized\u2014based on net-worth-to-total-assets ratios. Under PCA,  credit unions that are less than well-capitalized must take actions  prescribed by statute and discretionary actions developed by NCUA based  on the institutions\u2019 capitalization category.", "Since the implementation of PCA for credit unions, some sectors of the  credit union industry have been calling for changes to the capital  requirements for credit unions. The changes called for generally include (1)  amending the definition of net worth to include alternative forms of capital,  such as unsecured subordinated debt instruments\u2014known as secondary  capital instruments; (2) moving to risk-based capital standards; and (3)  some combination of the changes discussed above.", "As agreed, you asked us to describe (1) the underlying concerns that have  prompted the credit union industry\u2019s interest in making changes to the  current capital requirements, (2) the issues associated with the potential  use of secondary capital in all federally insured credit unions, and (3) the  issues associated with the potential use of risk-based capital in all federally  insured credit unions.", "To identify and describe concerns regarding the current capital  requirements for credit unions, we interviewed credit union industry  groups, several credit union chief executive officers, credit union  regulators and two banking regulators.

We also conducted a literature search to identify studies on the potential  use of secondary capital by credit unions and spoke with academics and  other industry observers. Appendix I provides additional details on our  scope and methodology. We are aware that NCUA is constructing a more  detailed risk-based capital proposal that incorporates both risk-based and  leverage requirements; however due to the lack of formalized details, we  could not perform a meaningful assessment of the proposal.

The Basel Accord established the  widespread use of capital ratios that bank and thrift regulators could use as  a starting point for assessing the financial condition\u2014that is, safety and  soundness\u2014of internationally active banks and thrifts. In the United  States, U.S. bank regulators applied the Basel Accord to all banks, rather  than just internationally active ones. In 1991, GAO recommended a tripwire  approach\u2014incorporating capital and safety and soundness standards, or  levels at which supervisory actions would be triggered\u2014based on our  findings that regulatory discretion and a common philosophy of trying to  resolve the problems of troubled institutions informally and cooperatively  resulted in enforcement actions that were neither timely nor forceful  enough to prevent or minimize losses to the deposit insurance fund.  Moreover, acting in response to the large number of bank and thrift failures  in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which included  a capital-based regulatory structure known as PCA. Specifically, FDICIA  categorizes depository institutions into five classifications on the basis of  their capital levels and imposes increasingly more severe restrictions and  supervisory actions as an institution\u2019s capital level deteriorates.", "CUMAA required NCUA to adopt a system of PCA comparable with that of  FDICIA for use on federally insured credit unions, which NCUA initially  implemented in 2000. CUMAA defined the net worth ratio for PCA  purposes as net worth to total assets. Under CUMAA, net worth is defined  as the retained earnings balance of the credit union at quarter end, as  determined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).   NCUA regulations provide four alternative methods that credit unions can  use to calculate total assets for use in the net worth ratio: (1) average of  quarter-end balances of the current and three preceding calendar quarters,  (2) average of month-end balances over the three calendar months of the  calendar quarter, (3) average daily balance over the calendar quarter, or (4)  quarter-end balance of the calendar quarter as reported on the credit  union\u2019s call report. NCUA regulations state that for each quarter, a credit  union must elect a measure of total assets from these four alternatives to  apply for all PCA purposes, except for the risk-based net worth  requirement.", "CUMAA prescribes three principal components of the PCA system for  credit unions: (1) a comprehensive framework of actions, including actions  prescribed by statute and discretionary actions to be developed by NCUA,  for credit unions that are less than well-capitalized; (2) an alternative  system of PCA to be developed for credit unions that NCUA defines as  \u201cnew\u201d; and (3) a risk-based net worth requirement to apply to credit unions  that NCUA defines as \u201ccomplex.\u201d Table 1 summarizes the PCA capital  requirements for regular and complex credit unions.", "CUMAA imposes up to four mandatory supervisory actions\u2014an earnings  transfer, submission of an acceptable net worth restoration plan, a  restriction on asset growth, and a restriction on member business  lending\u2014depending on a credit union\u2019s capital classification, as  determined by net worth ratios. Credit unions that are not well-capitalized  are required to take an earnings transfer. Credit unions that are  undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically  undercapitalized are subject to all four actions. In addition, CUMAA  requires NCUA to appoint a conservator or liquidation agent within 90 days  of a credit union becoming critically undercapitalized unless the NCUA  Board of Directors determines that other action would better achieve PCA\u2019s  purpose. Pursuant to CUMAA, NCUA also developed discretionary  supervisory actions, such as the dismissal of officers or directors of an  undercapitalized credit union, to complement the prescribed actions under  the PCA program.", "While CUMAA required NCUA to implement a system of capital-based  tripwires, capital-based safeguards of insurance funds are inherently  limited because capital does not typically show a decline until an  institution has experienced substantial deterioration in other components  of its operations and finances. Deterioration in an institution\u2019s internal  controls, asset quality, and earnings can occur years before capital is  adversely affected. Financial regulators recognize that, though essential, a  capital requirement is only one of a larger set of prudential tools used to  protect customers and ensure the stability of financial markets they  regulate. For depository institutions, the key or critical tool that financial  regulators use to ensure the adequacy of an institution\u2019s capital levels and  its safety and soundness is the on-site examination process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about PCA Appear to Drive Industry Interest in Secondary Capital", "paragraphs": ["The credit union industry\u2019s recent interest in using alternative forms of  capital appears to be associated primarily with three concerns about PCA  for credit unions.

To assist credit unions that fall  marginally below \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d primarily because asset growth  has outstripped income growth, NCUA proposed the use of an abbreviated  net worth restoration (NWRP) plan. According to an NCUA official, the  proposed rule was not pursued further because it was considered too  complicated, would only benefit a very small number of credit unions, and  did not appear to provide material relief. Second, other credit union  officials contended that PCA acts as a restraint on credit union growth. Our  analysis of credit union and bank data indicates that credit unions have  been growing faster than banks in the 3 years credit union PCA has been in  effect. Finally, several credit union officials are concerned that the PCA  tripwires for credit unions are too high, given the conservative risk profile  of most credit unions. It should be noted that, according to Treasury,  Congress established the capital level 2 percentage points higher because 1  percent of a credit union\u2019s capital is deposited in NCUSIF and another 1  percent of the typical credit union\u2019s capital is invested in a corporate credit  union."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\u201cFlight to Safety\u201d Raised Concerns about PCA, Although Net Worth Ratios Generally Remained above Well-Capitalized Levels", "paragraphs": ["As investors sought high-quality (that is, safe) investments due to weak  performance by the stock and other investment markets in the early 2000s,  credit unions experienced significant growth in member share deposits.

Under the proposal, a credit union would have been  eligible to file an abbreviated NWRP if it satisfied three criteria: historical  net worth, performance, and growth.", "There were three principal differences between the content requirement of  a standard NWRP and the abbreviated NWRP proposed by NCUA. First, the  proposed abbreviated NWRP would require only 4 quarters of pro forma  projections of total assets, shares and deposits, and return on average  assets, while the standard NWRP required complete pro forma financial  statements covering a minimum of 2 years. Second, the abbreviated NWRP  would not require a credit union to specify what steps it would take to meet  its schedule of quarterly net worth targets, which is required for a standard  NWRP. Finally, a standard NWRP requires those steps to extend beyond the  term of the plan to ensure that the credit union remains at least adequately  capitalized for 4 consecutive quarters thereafter. In contrast, the proposed  abbreviated NWRP did not address the credit union\u2019s net worth after the  end of the term of the plan. NCUA\u2019s proposed rule also detailed the criteria  for approval of the abbreviated NWRP and the circumstances in which a  credit union that would otherwise be eligible to file an abbreviated NWRP  would have been required to file a standard NWRP instead.", "According to an NCUA official, the proposed rule was not pursued further  because it was considered too complicated, would benefit only a very small  number of credit unions, and did not appear it would provide material relief  since some form of NWRP (albeit somewhat abbreviated) was still required  by statute. NCUA officials stated that the credit union industry supported  the proposal for an abbreviated NWRP but the credit union industry was  advocating a proposal that would be automatically approved if it met a  fixed set of objective criteria. However, NCUA officials explained that  CUMAA requires a case-by-case determination by NCUA that a plan \u201cis  based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net  worth of the credit union.\u201d", "Although NCUA\u2019s proposal to assist certain credit unions that fall  marginally below \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d was not pursued further, we  found that despite a recent inflow of member share deposits, the credit  union industry as a whole has been able to maintain net worth ratios well  above the PCA threshold for well-capitalized credit unions. Moreover,  current data suggest that the \u201cflight to safety\u201d may be over, as investors  appear to be returning to the investment markets.

While some of the larger credit union CEOs with  whom we spoke stated that PCA is not causing capital constraints  currently, they told us the potential exists for share growth to outstrip their  ability to retain earnings, thus triggering net worth restoration plans and  other supervisory actions under PCA. On the other hand, according to  some CEOs of small and midsize credit unions, these constraints are  affecting them currently. While the constraints noted above may have  occurred to some extent in a limited number of credit unions, we did not  find evidence of widespread net worth problems for federally insured  credit unions during the period PCA has been in place.

This exceeds the 4 percent  tier 1 leverage ratio applicable for banks and thrifts (and is statutory, as  opposed to regulatory). In its 2001 report, Treasury stated that Congress  determined that a higher ratio was appropriate because credit unions  cannot quickly issue capital stock to raise their net worth as soon as a  financial need arises. Instead, credit unions must rely on retained earnings  to build net worth, which necessarily takes time. Moreover, Treasury stated  that Congress established the capital level 2 percentage points higher, a  level recommended by Treasury in its 1997 report on credit unions, because  1 percent of a credit union\u2019s capital is deposited in NCUSIF and another 1  percent of the typical credit union\u2019s capital is invested in a corporate credit  union.

For example, banks may  obtain credit under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) for their  investment in low income credit unions. In addition, many foundations  and philanthropic organizations also are involved in providing secondary  capital to low income credit unions in an effort to ensure that the credit  unions are able to provide needed financial services to areas traditionally  underserved by mainstream financial institutions.", "Moreover, as of December 31, 2003, less than 6 percent of all low income  credit unions had secondary capital accounts. Additionally, low income  credit unions that had secondary capital accounts represented less than 1  percent of all federally insured credit unions.

According to  NCUA, corporate credit unions have been allowed to use secondary capital  instruments to meet their regulatory capital requirements since 1992 in  recognition that the ability of corporate credit unions to build capital is  limited by the combined effects of (1) conservative investment standards  imposed by NCUA and (2) the competitive markets in which corporate  credit unions vie for credit unions\u2019 investment funds. Capital for corporate  credit unions is defined as the sum of a corporate credit union\u2019s retained  earnings, paid-in capital (both member and nonmember), and membership  capital. NCUA refers to this paid-in capital and membership capital as  corporate credit union secondary capital; among other things, these two  types of capital are not insured by NCUSIF and are generally longer-term  investments. As of December 31, 2003, 18 out of all 31 corporate credit  unions had member paid-in capital accounts, 30 out of 31 had membership  capital accounts, and none had nonmember paid-in capital accounts.  However, taking into account that (1) corporate credit unions and natural  person credit unions are not comparable given their member base, and (2)  there are far fewer corporate credit unions compared with the total number  of federally insured credit unions, those 18 corporate credit unions with  member paid-in capital and 30 with membership capital do not provide a  representative or sufficient sample that can be used as a model to  demonstrate how secondary capital could be used for all federally insured  credit unions.

For example, an adequately  capitalized credit union would be defined as having a risk-based net worth  ratio of 6 percent or greater and a net worth ratio of 4 percent or greater.  Under this proposal, if a credit union\u2019s net worth ratio falls into different  categories by risk and total assets, the lower classification would apply.

Under this proposal, the risk weights could be set by  NCUA based on the Basel system. According to the second proposal, it is  likely that NCUA could choose to adopt some credit-risk weights that are  different from those currently in use by bank and thrift regulators under the  Basel system because some of the weights would be assigned on the basis  of interest-rate risk. The proposed risk-based ratio requirements for each  PCA category would parallel the current total risk-based requirement for  banks and thrifts.

Available indicators suggest that the credit union industry as a whole has  not been overly constrained as a result of the implementation of PCA.  Notably, credit unions were able to maintain capital levels well in excess of  the PCA requirements during a period of rapid share or deposit growth.  One of the inherent weaknesses in PCA is its focus on capital, which  typically is a lagging indicator of a financial institution\u2019s health. As such, it  will be important for NCUA to distinguish between capital deterioration  that occurs because of fundamental weaknesses in the institution\u2019s  structure or management versus temporary capital shortfalls due to  constraints beyond a credit union\u2019s control. While we do not find the  arguments for using secondary capital instruments to be compelling, to the  extent that well-managed and -operated credit unions do experience  temporary capital constraints, NCUA may want to revisit the concept of an  abbreviated net worth restoration plan for marginally undercapitalized  credit unions. Consideration of changes such as this seem to be more  consistent with the notion that the problems some credit unions may be  facing are temporary and, therefore, best tackled with temporary, not more  permanent, solutions, such as secondary capital instruments.", "Allowing credit unions to use secondary capital instruments to meet their  regulatory net worth requirements would raise a number of issues and  concerns. One of the key issues is who would be allowed to invest in the  secondary capital instruments of credit unions. While allowing credit  unions to sell secondary capital instruments to investors outside of the  credit union industry would provide market discipline, this would raise  concerns about the potential impact on the member-owned, cooperative  nature of credit unions. Some have proposed limiting potential investors to  credit union members, other credit unions, and corporate credit unions;  however, in-system investors could impose less discipline and raise  systemic risk concerns if it were to create a situation where weaker credit  unions brought down stronger credit unions due to secondary capital  investments. Other issues relate to the specific form of the capital  instruments, and how they would be incorporated into the regulatory net  worth requirement for credit unions. The credit union industry itself  appeared divided on the desirability or appropriate structure of secondary  capital instruments.", "Conceptually, the potential use of a risk-based capital system for all credit  unions appears less controversial. Risk-based capital is intended to require  institutions with riskier profiles to hold more capital than institutions with  less risky profiles. However, not all of the risks that credit unions face, such  as liquidity and operational risk, can be quantified. In recognition of the  limitations of risk-based capital systems, the bank and thrift regulators use  both risk-based and nonrisk weighted (leverage ratio) capital requirements  for PCA purposes. The requirements are used in tandem to better ensure  safety and soundness in banks and thrifts. Among the numerous issues that  would need to be addressed in a risk-based capital proposal, given the  unique nature of credit unions, would be the appropriate risk weights and  categories into which assets fall and the appropriate risk-based and  nonrisk-based capital ratios for each PCA category.

In addition, NCUA noted that not  all credit unions belong to corporate credit unions or hold this form of  investment; therefore, using a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to trigger PCA  supervisory actions based on this assumption is inherently unfair. Finally,  NCUA stated that PCA tripwires are too high, penalizes institutions with  conservative risk profiles, and allows higher risk earnings strategies  without commensurate net worth levels. While we did not perform an  evaluation of PCA, which would include a discussion of the thresholds, we  note that the NCUSIF deposit is not liquid and, therefore, not immediately  accessible for credit unions to use as a capital buffer.

Specifically, NCUA stated that the  adjustments should move PCA to a more fully risk-based system, with a  lower leverage ratio required of a credit union to meet the well-capitalized  levels. NCUA believes that a well-capitalized leverage requirement in the  range of 5 percent would be more than sufficient to meet the safety and  soundness goals of PCA. However, NCUA did not provide evidence that the  current 7 percent net worth requirement has been a hardship to the credit  union industry. As noted in this report, credit unions cannot quickly raise  their capital through the issuance of capital stock when a financial need  arises, they must rely on retained earnings to build sufficient capital\u2014 which necessarily takes time. Further, we believe that the generally  favorable economic climate for credit unions coupled with the relatively  short amount of time that PCA has been in place for credit unions do not  provide a sufficient testing of the current system of PCA for credit unions  to determine if changes are warranted.", "NCUA stated that it recognized that, as our draft report indicated, the  efficacy of a risk-based system is highly dependent on the details of the risk  categories and weights, as well as the complementary relationship between  the risk-based and leverage requirements. However, NCUA stated that the  draft report suggested that a risk-based system would result in risk assets  being lower than total assets for most credit unions, resulting in a given  amount of capital producing a higher net worth ratio. NCUA stated that  such a result was not a foregone conclusion. NCUA indicated that a  proposal under consideration included risk categories with weights at and  above 100 percent. The statement in the draft report was based on our  discussion with representatives of the credit union industry. As we noted in  our draft report, no detailed proposals regarding a risk-based system for all  credit unions was available for our analysis, including that being developed  by NCUA. In the absence of details, we cannot comment on the ultimate  effect of a proposal that is in the process of being developed on the  required capital levels for credit unions.

While we  agree that there are different types of growth, institutions still need to hold  sufficient capital regardless of the type of growth experienced. As noted in  this report, PCA was intended to curb aggressive growth, since  uncontrolled growth was one of the common attributes of banks and thrifts  that failed during the banking crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Moreover, our analysis of aggregated credit union data indicated that credit  unions have been able to maintain a rate of growth that has exceeded that  of banks and thrifts in the three full calendar years that PCA has been in  place for credit unions.", "NCUA noted that our draft report suggested that NCUA revisit the concept  of an abbreviated NWRP for marginally undercapitalized credit unions for  situations involving temporary capital shortfalls.

NCUA stated that it supported a statutory  change to provide NCUA the regulatory authority to waive the requirement  to submit a NWRP for credit unions that have a temporary, marginal drop in  their net worth ratio below adequately capitalized, as determined on a case- by-case basis. While NCUA put forth a proposed rule on an abbreviated  NWRP, NCUA did not pursue it further. We believe it is important that  NCUA explore and use all of the available options and discretion provided  by CUMAA.

NCUA also believes it  should be provided with the authority to set the remaining elements of  the risk-based PCA system by regulation.", "With the exception of being able to set by regulation a minimum level of  net worth in relation to total assets (for example, 4 percent or 5 percent,  tied to the credit union\u2019s CAMEL rating) to be considered adequately  capitalized, NCUA believes the current thresholds (but in relation to risk  assets) are acceptable and best left established by statute.  However,  NCUA wants to keep the parity provision in the current statute, which  provides the authority to change the thresholds by regulation,  commensurate with any changes to the banks\u2019 PCA thresholds.", "With regard to the net worth ratio numerator, NCUA also supports a  statutory definition for net worth, but the current definition should be  expanded beyond retained earnings under generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP). NCUA believes a better definition of net  worth is equity of the credit union as determined under GAAP and as  authorized by the NCUA board. NCUA believes this would provide the  NCUA board with the authority through regulation to subtract from net  worth balance sheet items (such as goodwill that have no value in the  event of a payout) the NCUA board deems appropriate. Additionally,  NCUA believes that this definition preserves the requirement to comply  with GAAP and limits statutorily what can be included in net worth,  while providing NCUA with the flexibility to reduce assets that count  toward net worth for PCA purposes but that do not have value to the  insurance fund.", "With regard to the net worth ratio denominator, NCUA advocates having  the regulatory flexibility to set the risk weights for assets and adjust  them, as it deems appropriate.", "In cases where there is a marginal drop in net worth below adequately  capitalized, NCUA advocates having the regulatory flexibility to  temporarily waive a credit union\u2019s requirement to submit a net worth  restoration plan if:  (a) the credit union is CAMEL-rated 1 or 2 with a net  worth ratio in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent, (b) the credit union\u2019s  book of business does not present a safety and soundness issue, and (c)  the credit union\u2019s assets are well managed. In addition, NCUA desires  the regulatory flexibility to revisit the credit union after a specified time  to determine if the temporary waiver is still appropriate and, if not,  require the credit union to submit a net worth restoration plan. NCUA  believes that this would reduce the burden placed on credit unions  experiencing a small, temporary decline in the net worth ratio due to  circumstances such as unsolicited, robust share growth that do not pose  a safety and soundness concern. Further, NCUA believes such a  provision would still provide NCUA with adequate authority to address  any concerns on a case-by-case basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the National Credit Union Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Heather T.
