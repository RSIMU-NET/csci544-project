This approach has been widely criticized for being costly, inflexible, and ineffective in addressing some of the nation's most pressing environmental problems. The states have used several methods to obtain EPA approval for innovative approaches to environmental protection. Among the primary approaches cited by the state environmental officials GAO interviewed are EPA's Project XL and the Joint EPA/State Agreement to Pursue Regulatory Innovation. Officials in most states told GAO that they faced significant challenges in submitting proposals to EPA, including resistance from within the state environmental agency and a lack of adequate resources to pursue innovative approaches. EPA recognizes that it needs to do more to encourage innovative environmental approaches by states and other entities. As a result, EPA has (1) issued a broad-based draft strategy entitled \"Innovating for Better Environmental Results\" and (2) adopted the recommendations of an internal task force, which advocated the consideration of innovative alternatives as new regulations are developed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under the existing federal approach to environmental protection, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), pursuant to statutes such as the  Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, prescribes regulations with which  states, localities, and private companies must comply.  The approach has  been widely criticized in recent years for being costly, inflexible, and  ineffective in addressing some of the nation\u2019s most pressing environmental  problems.  For example, the National Academy of Public Administration  recently concluded that although traditional regulatory approaches can  keep most forms of industrial pollution in check, they cannot reach many  other sources of pollution and environmental degradation, such as diffuse  sources of water pollution from urban and agricultural runoff.  Even where  existing approaches have succeeded in curtailing pollution from major  industrial sources, they have often been costly or have provided regulated  entities with little incentive to reduce pollution below mandatory  compliance levels.", "EPA responded to such concerns during the 1990s with a variety of  initiatives intended to encourage innovative regulatory strategies that  could streamline environmental requirements while encouraging more  effective means of protecting the environment.  Among the agency\u2019s  \u201cflagship\u201d programs was Project XL, which encouraged individual  regulated facilities to propose projects to EPA that would test whether  alternative approaches could achieve compliance at lower cost and  produce greater environmental benefits.", "Many sponsors of innovation, however, have expressed disappointment  over the effectiveness of Project XL and similar initiatives intended to  encourage creative improvements in environmental regulation.  Some have  also contended that the states could be key to a more effective and efficient  approach to environmental policy.  Citing states\u2019 closer proximity to  environmental problems and central role in enforcing federal regulation,  they have advocated that EPA show greater flexibility in allowing states to  pursue innovative environmental regulatory approaches.  Others, however,  have cautioned that unless these alternative approaches are carefully  designed, they could impair EPA\u2019s ability to achieve protection of human  health and the environment\u2014the ultimate purpose of the programs\u2014and  may not be permissible under federal environmental statutes.", "As agreed with your offices, this report identifies (1) the major avenues  that states have utilized to obtain EPA\u2019s approval of innovative approaches  to environmental protection and (2) the major obstacles that impede states  from pursuing innovative approaches needing EPA\u2019s concurrence.  The  report also discusses EPA\u2019s recent efforts to facilitate innovative  approaches to environmental protection.  To address these issues, we  sought detailed information from a diverse group of 15 states on their  experiences in pursuing innovation.  In selecting these states, we sought  variation in size, location among EPA\u2019s 10 geographic regions, and the  degree of their participation in environmental regulatory innovation.Among other steps, we conducted detailed, structured interviews with  environmental officials from these states, and analyzed in detail 20  initiatives they cited as being among the key initiatives they have pursued.We also interviewed officials in the corresponding eight EPA regional  offices and at EPA\u2019s headquarters, and obtained from them pertinent EPA- state agreements and guidance documents.  A more detailed explanation of  our scope and methodology is included at the end of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal environmental policy is shaped by numerous federal statutes,  including The Clean Air Act, The Clean Water Act, and The Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act.  These laws charge EPA with protecting  the environment through such activities as setting standards for air and  water quality, issuing permits, and taking enforcement actions.  The laws  also allow states to assume many of these responsibilities.  As states\u2019  responsibilities have grown, they have applied for and received the lead  role in performing these activities.  Consequently, the operational  responsibility for most of EPA\u2019s major programs currently lies with the  states, and EPA routinely relies on states to implement the full range of  environmental responsibilities associated with these programs.", "In recent years, a number of organizations have emphasized the need to  supplement or significantly modify the existing prescriptive, command- and-control approach toward environmental protection established under  current federal laws.  For example, in 1998, Resources for the Future (an  environmental policy research organization) noted that while the current  federal approach has many noteworthy achievements, it is also flawed in  several respects. It noted in particular that federal laws and regulations  tend to prescribe the specific means by which environmental goals will be  reached, rather than establishing goals and allowing states and facilities the  flexibility to reach those goals.  GAO has also reported on these matters in  recent years, focusing in particular on EPA\u2019s efforts to \u201creinvent\u201d  environmental regulation. EPA has also recognized the need for new  approaches in numerous publications and in its interactions with state  governments and other parties.", "The Congress has recently considered giving EPA explicit authority to  allow more flexible approaches by states and others.  One such proposal,  the Second Generation of Environmental Improvement Act of 1999 (HR  3448), introduced in the 106th Congress, would have allowed EPA to enter  into innovative strategy agreements with states, companies, or other  interested parties in order to experiment with ways to achieve  environmental standards more efficiently and effectively.  Such agreements  could have involved the modification or waiver of existing agency  regulations.  The bill was not enacted and has thus far not been  reintroduced in the 107th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Have Used Several Key Avenues to Promote Innovative Environmental Approaches", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, states have worked with EPA through several key avenues  to pursue innovative environmental approaches.  Seven of the 15 states we  contacted have used EPA\u2019s Project XL as such a vehicle, even though the  projects in which they are involved were formally proposed to EPA by a  private company.  Partly as a result of states\u2019 dissatisfaction with Project  XL, however, EPA and the Environmental Council of the States (ECOS)  agreed in 1998 to a process in which, among other things, states submit  innovative projects through their respective EPA regional offices and EPA  is provided timelines within which it must respond.  In addition to these  two major avenues, states have also pursued alternative approaches to  environmental protection through the use of the National Environmental  Performance Partnership System (NEPPS), by participating in programs  developed through EPA\u2019s media offices and by negotiating relatively narrow  changes in their day-to-day working relationship with EPA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Project XL", "paragraphs": ["Project XL, which stands for \u201cexcellence\u201d and \u201cleadership,\u201d was launched  in 1995 as part of the previous administration\u2019s broad effort to reinvent  federal environmental protection policy.  Based on recognition of the need  for new approaches to environmental regulation, Project XL was designed  to allow private businesses, as well as states and local governments, to test  innovative ideas to enhance environmental protection. In exchange for  improved performance, participants would be given the flexibility to  explore new approaches to environmental protection.", "To participate in Project XL, businesses, states, and other government  agencies submit proposals to EPA, which then evaluates proposals  according to specific criteria and other considerations.  EPA requires that,  among other things, Project XL participants demonstrate that their  proposals will result in \u201csuperior environmental performance,\u201d and include  a system for monitoring and a process for stakeholder involvement.  XL  projects should also be designed to test innovative approaches that are  transferable to other facilities.", "Although most of the more than 50 XL projects approved to date were  submitted by private facilities, some federal and local government agencies  have submitted proposals as well.  In addition, four states have submitted  proposals designed to apply to multiple facilities within the states.  Massachusetts\u2019 Environmental Results Program, for example, covers the  dry cleaning, photo processing, and printing sectors.  Table 1 describes  each of the state-initiated projects that cover multiple facilities or entire  industry sectors.", "While not initiating specific Project XL proposals, 7 of the 15 states we  contacted have participated by working on initiatives that were formally  proposed to EPA under Project XL by private companies.  For example,  even before the establishment of Project XL, the Minnesota Pollution  Control Agency had been working with the 3M Company to develop  alternative compliance approaches, which it subsequently pursued under  the auspices of Project XL.  More recently, Minnesota has actively worked  with the Andersen Windows Corporation on a proposal to reduce air  emissions from a facility in Bayport, Minnesota, in exchange for regulatory  flexibility.  Similarly, Virginia played an active role in advocating an  innovative approach to controlling air emissions proposed by Merck  Pharmaceuticals for their facility in Stonewall, Virginia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint EPA/State Agreement to Pursue Regulatory Innovation", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, EPA and ECOS agreed to encourage experimentation by states  with new approaches to environmental protection through their Joint  EPA/State Agreement to Pursue Regulatory Innovation.  In part, this  agreement grew out of the states\u2019 frustration with other avenues for  pursuing innovation, such as Project XL.  Specifically, states were  frustrated with Project XL\u2019s requirement that sponsors document a  proposal\u2019s ability to achieve \u201csuperior environmental performance.\u201dMany  believed that such a requirement was too stringent and precluded  worthwhile projects that would deliver environmental results equivalent to  existing regulations but more efficiently.  States also believed that the  process of submitting a Project XL proposal and receiving EPA\u2019s approval  was too time-consuming.", "In response to these concerns, the ECOS/EPA agreement outlined a  process by which states could submit innovative projects through the EPA  regional offices and provided timelines during which EPA must provide a  response.  Specifically, once a state submits a proposal to EPA, the agency  has 4 weeks to reply to the state with a list of questions and concerns.  Within 90 days of receipt of the initial proposal, EPA must issue a final  response to the state.  According to the EPA regional officials we  interviewed, states do not often hold EPA strictly to these deadlines.  Nonetheless, state officials told us that the time limit is sometimes helpful  in obtaining a timely EPA response when necessary.  In addition, the  agreement omits Project XL\u2019s requirement for \u201csuperior environmental  performance.\u201d  Instead, it only requires that innovations seek more efficient  and/or effective ways of protecting the environment.", "The agreement also lays out a set of principles intended to guide the  development and implementation of innovations.  Specifically, it states that  (1) innovation often involves experimentation that should not harm human  health or the environment but may include some chance of failure;  (2) innovations must seek more efficient or effective ways of meeting  environmental performance goals; (3) innovations should seek creative  ways to tackle environmental problems; (4) stakeholders should be  involved in the development and evaluation of innovations; (5) results of  innovations must be measured and analyzed; (6) innovations must be  enforceable and accountable; and (7) states and EPA must work as  partners to promote innovation.", "State proposals submitted to EPA to date have covered a wide range of  innovations.  Some agreements have targeted one specific problem at an  individual facility, while others have been designed to affect a large number  of stakeholders or to develop a framework through which a state and EPA  agree to handle innovative proposals.  For example:", "The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services sought  flexibility under federal regulations for a single pulp and paper mill to  test an innovative regulatory approach to pollution control and  treatment.  Under new regulations, the mill would be required to install  expensive technology to control airborne methanol emissions.  Under  the proposal, however, the mill would use an alternative technology that  would result in a four-fold reduction in methanol emissions over the  current requirements while saving the company approximately  $825,000.", "In contrast, a proposal by Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental  Quality covered a much larger group of stakeholders.  The proposal  seeks approval for a new approach to meeting Total Maximum Daily  Load (TMDL) requirements under the Clean Water Act.  In particular, it  would facilitate ways that point sources of pollution (e.g., an industrial  facility discharging from one or more pipes) could collaborate with  diffuse, \u201cnonpoint\u201d sources in controlling phosphorus pollution.", "Wisconsin proposed a broad framework through which the Wisconsin  Department of Natural Resources and EPA would deal with multiple  innovations.  Under the agreement, Wisconsin may develop up to 10  pilot projects with facilities that would test a facility-wide, \u201cmulti-media\u201d  approach to regulation (i.e., an approach that comprehensively  integrates their air, water, and waste regulations) that is built around the  use of an environmental management system.  Facilities that commit to  achieving superior environmental performance would be granted some  degree of regulatory flexibility.", "The number of proposals under the ECOS/EPA agreement has been fairly  low to date, although participation has been growing recently.  As of  February 2001, 3 years after the agreement, 22 proposals had been  proposed from six states in three EPA regions.  As indicated in figure 1  below, by January 2002, participation had increased to 15 states, which  together had proposed 45 initiatives.  Of these proposals, EPA has accepted  20, another 22 are still under consideration, and 3 proposals have been  denied or withdrawn.  In our interviews with selected states, we discussed  specific state experiences under the agreement.  Of the 15 states, 10 had  proposed projects under the ECOS/EPA agreement, while other states  indicated that they are considering proposing projects in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Avenues", "paragraphs": ["In addition to Project XL and the ECOS/EPA agreement, state and EPA  officials identified several other avenues for negotiation that states have  used to obtain EPA\u2019s approval for innovative environmental strategies.  One  is the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS),  which was established in 1995 to give states greater flexibility in setting  their priorities and in the way they carry out their programs if they  demonstrate the capacity and willingness to achieve mutually agreed-upon  results.  NEPPS provides a framework for the state\u2019s relationship with EPA,  laying out the state\u2019s environmental goals and priorities, and the ways in  which they will measure progress in meeting these goals.  Under the  system, a state agency may enter into a Performance Partnership  Agreement with its EPA regional office that typically specifies the  signatories\u2019 respective roles and responsibilities in achieving specified  program objectives.", "While not intended to focus solely on innovation, some states have used  NEPPS for this purpose.  As our 1999 report on NEPPS noted, for example,  Minnesota\u2019s Pollution Control Agency reorganized its traditional medium- by-medium (i.e., air, water, and waste) structure into a structure the agency  believed would more effectively address problems that cross media lines.  The agency used its Performance Partnership Agreement to provide the  flexibility it needed to report environmental results to EPA in line with this  new structure.  Other states have also used their partnership agreements to  achieve and document agreements on specific initiatives.", "EPA has also sought to promote innovation through its program offices.  For example, the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response has  promoted cleanup and redevelopment of contaminated industrial sites by  encouraging state voluntary cleanup programs.  Unlike programs that rely  on enforcement alone to achieve cleanups by parties responsible for the  contamination, these voluntary \u201cBrownfields\u201d programs allow site owners  and developers to collaborate on bringing sites back to productive use.  EPA has encouraged the programs by providing funding to develop these  programs, reviewing program adequacy, and agreeing not to take further  enforcement action at these sites unless serious environmental  contamination was overlooked.", "Finally, EPA regional officials we interviewed mentioned that minor  changes are often adopted through informal discussions during the normal  course of work.  They noted that more significant changes, such as those  requiring a change in regulations, would have to go through one of the  avenues for innovation or through the rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 Innovative Proposals Face Obstacles at the State and Federal Level", "paragraphs": ["While states can face significant obstacles at the state level before  submitting an innovative proposal to EPA, officials in 12 of the 15 states we  contacted stated their most significant obstacles are at the federal level.  States cited prescriptive regulations as one of the most significant  obstacles, along with an EPA culture they viewed as being averse to risk  and resistant to change.  EPA officials acknowledged that its culture has a  tendency to resist innovative proposals, but some noted that such  resistance is rooted in the agency\u2019s primary mission to ensure strict  adherence to the letter of statutes and agency regulations.  They also noted  that some states have omitted key elements when they submit proposals,  such as provisions to measure whether the innovation to be tested will  have its intended effect."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resource Constraints Are Among the Key Obstacles at the State Level", "paragraphs": ["Officials in all of the states we contacted indicated that they faced  significant obstacles\u2014including lack of resources, cultural resistance in  the state agency, and opposition from environmental groups--even in  advance of proposing a project to EPA.  In some cases, state officials cited  these obstacles as reasons why the state had not yet actively pursued  innovations requiring federal approval.", "In discussing 20 separate initiatives, state officials cited a heavy ongoing  agency workload and concomitant limited resources as obstacles to  innovative approaches in 11 instances.  In several instances, the state was  nevertheless actively pursuing innovative approaches despite this  constraint.  For example, a Michigan official stated that finding sufficient  resources was one of the primary difficulties faced in pursuing initiatives  under the EPA/ECOS agreement.  Although a considerable number of  additional staff and resources were needed, the effort was given high- priority status; and therefore, agency resources were diverted to support it.  Similarly, noting that 80 percent of their resources are consumed in  meeting federally mandated requirements, officials from the Minnesota  Pollution Control Agency said the agency\u2019s management is reluctant to  divert scarce resources to innovative programs.  Nonetheless, they said the  agency has actively promoted Project XL initiatives and is likely to propose  future initiatives under the EPA/ECOS agreement.", "Officials from other states, however, said they were unable to pursue  innovative approaches because of the limited resources available to meet  an already-demanding workload.  For example, an official of the Nebraska  Department of Environmental Quality said that developing an innovative  proposal would take a considerable investment in up-front staff time and  resources, and the agency\u2019s federally mandated workload exhausts all  resources.  Largely for this reason, Nebraska has not yet pursued any major  innovative initiative requiring EPA approval.  Similarly, an official of the  Georgia Department of Natural Resources cited the agency\u2019s heavy  mandated workload and related budget constraints as one of the two most  significant obstacles to pursuing innovative approaches.", "The importance of limited state agency resources as an obstacle to  innovative approaches was also highlighted in an April 2000 ECOS survey.The survey asked state officials to indicate the degree to which each of 12  frequently cited impediments to innovative practices was an obstacle in  their case.  Six of the 29 responding states said that state agency resource  limitations were the single largest obstacle they faced, while officials of 7  states indicated that this was a persistent obstacle that was difficult to  address.  Among the factors not related to federal policy, this factor ranked  as the most significant obstacle in the survey.", "A state agency\u2019s culture and working environment can also discourage  innovative approaches.  For 5 of the 20 specific initiatives we discussed,  state officials said that an agency\u2019s culture and working environment to  some extent discouraged alternative approaches to environmental policy.  One state official said that obtaining EPA\u2019s permission to pursue an  innovation was an abstract problem because the state agency had not been  able to reach the point of submitting a proposal.  He explained that internal  staff resistance was the biggest problem, noting in particular that many  rank-and-file managers had been with the agency for 25 to 30 years and had  a professional ethic that emphasized following long-standing approaches to  environmental protection.  The official recalled that several years ago, the  agency had examined alternative approaches to permitting, including an  approach that would allow regulated facilities to certify their own  compliance, and thus allow the agency to shift resources from permitting  activities to enforcement activities.  The division managers in the agency  almost unanimously opposed this approach, fearing that it would lead to  loss of control over regulated entities, a loss of funding for their own  programs, and less effective environmental protection.  In part because of  such resistance, the agency had not recently tested EPA\u2019s receptiveness to  an innovative proposal.", "Opposition to innovative approaches from environmental groups and other  stakeholders has also impeded proposals.  Officials in several states noted  that environmental and community groups generally perceive innovative  proposals as opening the door to rollback of environmental standards.  A  Washington state official noted that the state has a very politically active  public, and some environmental and community groups perceive  innovative proposals as potentially compromising the goals of  environmental statutes.  For example, such groups vigorously opposed the  state\u2019s proposal to extend discharge permits under the Clean Water Act  from 5 to 10 years because they feared the state was backing away from  oversight of polluting facilities.  A representative of the Texas Natural  Resource Conservation Commission made similar comments, but noted  that early involvement of such groups can go a long way toward mitigating  their opposition.  He stated that if the concerns of such groups are taken  into account during the design of a proposal, their opposition later in the  process is far less likely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Federal Obstacles Include Prescriptive Regulations and Cultural Resistance", "paragraphs": ["State officials identified factors at the federal level, including statutes,  regulations, and an EPA culture not conducive to innovation, as more  significant obstacles than the factors they encountered at the state level.  Specifically, officials in 12 of the 15 states we contacted said that these  federal obstacles were more significant in impeding innovation than  obstacles faced at the state level (such as the state agency\u2019s culture and  workload, and opposition from environmental groups).  The three  remaining states said these two categories were about equal in their  significance.", "As summarized in table 2, of the federal obstacles we discussed with states,  federal regulations and an EPA culture viewed as resistant to innovative  approaches ranked as the two most significant obstacles affecting progress  among the 20 specific initiatives identified by state officials.  Our  interviews, however, revealed an important relationship between the two  factors.  Specifically, while EPA officials acknowledged the agency\u2019s  culture can be resistant to innovative proposals, some noted\u2014and some  state officials agreed\u2014that what is often construed as \u201ccultural resistance\u201d  is sometimes rooted in a sense of obligation among agency officials to  ensure that statutes and agency regulations are properly and fully  implemented.  EPA officials also pointed out that in some cases state  proposals lacked key elements when they were submitted, such as  provisions for public involvement or a systematic means of measuring  whether the innovation would have its intended effect.", "An extensive literature has documented that both existing environmental  statutes and environmental regulations can impede innovation.  However,  the manner in which the two may have this effect differs, with the more  detailed, individual regulations generally having a more direct impact on  proposals than the more general statutes that authorize the regulations.", "The major federal environmental statutes are generally less detailed and  specific, in terms of what they require or preclude, than the regulations  EPA develops to implement them.  There tends to be a hierarchical  relationship between statutes and regulations\u2014statutory requirements  establish the broad outlines of environmental policy while regulations  reflect EPA\u2019s effort to implement the statutes, and hence provide much  more specific requirements on how the regulated community is to control  pollution.  Perhaps for this reason, the state officials we interviewed cited  comparatively few instances in which an environmental statute precluded a  particular innovation they were pursuing. Overall, environmental statutes  were ranked either first or second 6 times among the 20 state innovations  we examined.", "However, environmental statutes have been linked with a broader, less  direct impact on state environmental innovations by directing regulators  and their resources toward specific, medium-by-medium activities\u2014  sometimes at the expense of alternative strategies that might more  effectively address the highest environmental risks.  For example, in our  July 1997 report on EPA\u2019s \u201creinvention\u201d activities, we cited the difficulties  in setting risk-based priorities across environmental media because each  statute prescribes certain activities to deal with its own medium-specific  problems. We also cited an observation from an earlier GAO report that  environmental statutes \u201cled to the creation of individual EPA program  offices that have tended to focus solely on reducing pollution within the  particular environmental medium for which they have responsibility, rather  than on reducing overall emissions.\u201d This \u201cstovepipe\u201d effect of the  environmental statutory framework was cited by an EPA headquarters air  official, who noted that the Clean Air Act would not recognize the value at a  specific industrial site of a large reduction in water emissions in exchange  for even a slight increase in air emissions--even though such a trade-off  might have significant net environmental benefits in certain situations.  As  others have noted, however, EPA generally does consider the potential  transfer of pollution from one medium to another when it develops new  regulations.", "Several state officials told us that federal environmental statutes can  indirectly hinder innovative state approaches not only by what they  include, but also by what they omit.  They noted that since environmental  statutes give EPA little or no explicit authority to grant regulatory flexibility  to the states, the agency is placed at a higher risk when it grants a state or  regulated entity permission to deviate from federal requirements.  One  state official cited the absence of such a \u201csafe legal harbor\u201d for EPA as a  key impediment to state innovation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulations", "paragraphs": ["State officials cited regulations as a significant factor more often than  statutes.  In discussing 20 specific innovative proposals, state officials  ranked regulations either first or second 12 times among the federal factors  listed in table 2.", "States cited a number of instances in which regulations prescribed an  approach for dealing with an environmental problem that a state believed it  could more effectively address in another way.  Oregon officials cited such  a proposal, pursued under the state\u2019s Green Permit Program, in which the  state sought to provide flexibility to a regulated facility as an incentive for  improved environmental performance.  The state\u2019s Department of  Environmental Quality proposed to grant a semiconductor manufacturing  firm expedited permit review and various other incentives in exchange for  the firm\u2019s commitment to future environmental improvements through its  environmental management system.  As part of the application, the facility  sought the approval of its system of correcting and detecting leaks in its  hazardous waste piping from processes to storage tanks.  According to a  state official, the system\u2019s overall performance matches or exceeds federal  regulatory requirements, though it does not meet certain technical  specifications of regulations under the Resource, Conservation, and  Recovery Act (RCRA).  As a result, EPA determined that it was unable to  approve that particular aspect of the facility\u2019s application.  EPA did not rule  out approval of this system, but stated that additional information would be  required to justify it.  An EPA official said that, after site visits and review of  additional information provided by the facility, EPA Region 10 has  concluded preliminarily that the required justification has been  established.  EPA and the state must now agree on a legally-enforceable  alternative to the relevant RCRA requirements.  EPA officials noted that the  most likely approach, a site-specific rule, is a time-consuming approach  that could take over 6 months.  An Oregon official added that EPA is  proceeding slowly on this issue both because it could set a precedent for  numerous similar facilities across the nation and because the process is  taxing limited regional staff resources.", "The Oregon experience is comparable to experiences cited by officials in  other states in which a regulation either discouraged an innovation or  imposed significant costs in pursuing the innovation.  It is also comparable  to the experiences documented in an extensive literature on the effect of  prescriptive regulations on efforts to innovate.  In summarizing part of this  literature, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) cited as a major problem  the design of most regulatory standards under the Clean Water Act and  Clean Air Act, which require EPA to establish technology-based discharge  rate limits based on \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cfeasible\u201d emission control  technologies. ELI noted that while alternative solutions are not  specifically prohibited, such regulatory standards may preclude innovation  in a number of ways, such as limiting permit writers to conservative  choices and eliminating incentives for progress beyond established  standards.  ELI summarized the effect of prescriptive regulatory standards  by noting that they \u201cmay severely limit innovation, creating higher costs  than necessary.\u201d", "Officials in EPA\u2019s regions and headquarters both cautioned that federal  regulations are critical in ensuring reasonable consistency in the level of  environmental protection afforded to individuals across the country.  Several officials also noted that there is a \u201cnatural tension\u201d between this  goal and the goal of allowing states greater flexibility to address  environmental problems in the way they believe best meets their needs.  Overall, however, they generally concurred with the comments voiced by  state officials concerning the effects of detailed, prescriptive regulations on  environmental regulatory innovation.  An official with EPA\u2019s Office of Air  and Radiation added that it is important to remember that the federal  environmental protection system is about 30 years old and that many  regulations in effect today were written before the relatively recent  emphasis on developing more flexible innovative approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Culture", "paragraphs": ["State officials indicated that a long-standing EPA culture that resists  alternative approaches to environmental protection is viewed as one of the  most significant obstacles to state environmental innovation.

Of the 20 individual  proposals that the states discussed, EPA culture was cited as either the first  or second most important factor in 14 cases.", "Some state officials noted that such cultural resistance often manifests  itself in a lengthy and time-consuming review and approval process.  One  EPA regional official referred to the numerous levels of review, the large  number of EPA stakeholders, and the degree to which every detail of a  proposal is examined as a \u201cdeath by 1,000 cuts,\u201d saying that after such a  review process, it is often hard to keep the original concept or retain what  is truly innovative.", "Along these lines, an official in Massachusetts\u2019 Department of  Environmental Protection cited as an example the experience of a  proposed addendum to its Project XL Agreement that established the  state\u2019s Environmental Results Program.  The official said that EPA\u2019s July  1999 response had included an extensive set of questions and comments  that went well beyond what the state DEP had proposed, and was viewed  by DEP staff as essentially asking the agency to justify the entire  Environmental Results Program all over again.  She added that DEP staff  were frustrated not only by the volume of the questions posed, but also by  the appearance that no one at EPA had been assigned to consolidate the  numerous comments from various EPA offices.  DEP\u2019s reaction was to  temporarily shelve the project, claiming that it did not have the resources  to enter into protracted negotiations to resolve EPA\u2019s concerns.  According  to the Commissioner, the subsequent intervention of the EPA Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance\u2019s Policy Director helped to revive  the proposal.  Currently, DEP is awaiting EPA approval of a draft state rule  containing the changes the state desires.", "New Jersey officials cited similar experiences during negotiations over the  state\u2019s Gold Track program, stating that some EPA program staff strongly  resisted requests for regulatory flexibility.  One official noted that EPA staff  had exhibited a \u201cwhat if\u201d mentality when reviewing proposals\u2014developing  a worst possible case scenario and holding that scenario up as a reason to  reject the proposal.  This official added that the EPA approach appeared to  focus more on a search for reasons not to pursue innovation, rather than on  an examination as to whether the proposal was fundamentally sound and  how it could best be implemented.", "EPA officials we interviewed also acknowledged the existence of an EPA  culture predisposed to view innovative proposals skeptically.  For example,  an official of EPA\u2019s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response noted  that this cultural tendency is partly rooted in the fact that many EPA staff  are used to addressing environmental problems in a \u201ctried and true\u201d way  and that EPA\u2019s reward system does not encourage staff to pursue  innovative approaches.  Similarly, an official of EPA\u2019s Office of Air and  Radiation noted that EPA has a culture somewhat resistant to new  approaches, in part, because of its reluctance to deviate from approaches  that it believes have proven effective over the last 30 years.", "The agency recognized the challenge of promoting acceptance of new  approaches on the part of its rank-and-file in our July 1997 report on its  reinvention efforts, which documented widespread agreement among EPA  officials, state officials, and others that the agency has a long way to go  before reinvention becomes an integral part of its staff\u2019s every day  activities. It cited the view of the then-head of EPA reinvention activities  as noting that many staff are comfortable with traditional ways of doing  business and consider their program-specific job responsibilities as their  first priority and reinvention projects as secondary.  Also commenting on  EPA staffs\u2019 comfort with traditional approaches, a senior ECOS official  noted that EPA was created in the early 1970s, and that many current  employees have spent their entire careers there.  He noted that for some of  them, a familiarity and comfort with earlier norms and practices may make  it hard to embrace some of the agency\u2019s recent experiments with  alternative compliance strategies.", "However, EPA officials indicated that what may be perceived as \u201ccultural  resistance\u201d among EPA staff may, in fact, reflect understandable concerns  that they properly implement the agency\u2019s core mission.  An official with  the agency\u2019s Office of Policy, Economics, and Innovation added that in  some cases, EPA staff may feel that specific regulations were the  culmination of a good faith commitment made to stakeholders and  members of the public who participated in the regulatory development  process.  An official of EPA\u2019s New York office noted that EPA is obligated to  ensure a certain level of environmental protection, and if proposed  innovations could potentially negatively affect the environment, the  benefits of moving forward must be carefully balanced against the risks.  Another EPA official noted that close scrutiny is warranted in situations  where an alternative approach may be viewed as setting a precedent for  similar requests in situations where it may not be appropriate.  An official  of EPA\u2019s Chicago office also noted that to allow deviation from regulatory  requirements, EPA must develop an  alternative legal mechanism to ensure  accountability.  Developing such legal mechanisms can be very time  consuming.  Perhaps most importantly, EPA staff are mindful of the  potential consequences when innovative proposals are at odds with laws or  regulations.  A state official said that EPA has to be cautious in permitting  innovative approaches because the agency is often sued by environmental  and community groups if it does not follow laws and regulations to the  letter.", "On the other hand, EPA and some state officials indicated that EPA\u2019s  disinclination to consider alternative approaches may be slowly changing.  Officials of the state environmental agencies in Massachusetts and New  Hampshire indicated that EPA\u2019s Boston office has become a stronger  advocate for flexibility and new approaches.  For example, a  Massachusetts official said the states in the region generally get a  sympathetic hearing when they make proposals.  The official also said that  EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance has also become  more willing to consider innovative approaches.  Similarly, the New  Hampshire official stated that EPA is gradually changing the mindset of its  staff to be more open to innovative proposals and that there is a healthy  and respectful working relationship between the state and the agency\u2019s  Boston Office on these matters.  Senior ECOS staff also told us that while  further progress is needed, the agency has also sought to include state  input earlier in its decision-making process to resolve long-standing data  reporting problems and other key issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA Sometimes Determines That Proposals Are Missing Key Elements", "paragraphs": ["While EPA officials acknowledged the key obstacles cited during our state  interviews, they also told us that state innovative proposals sometimes  encounter delays resulting from deficiencies in the form and content of the  proposals.  Project XL, the ECOS/EPA agreement, and other avenues for  innovation each have certain ground rules on which participating parties  agree.  The EPA officials noted, and some state officials agreed, that in  some cases a proposal\u2019s rejection or delay may have less to do with an  obstacle encountered at the federal level than with a problem in the  proposal\u2019s ability to meet these ground rules.", "As noted earlier, for example, Project XL requires that proposed innovative  approaches result in \u201csuperior environmental performance,\u201d in comparison  to traditional approaches.  According to EPA\u2019s Chicago office staff, the  difficulty in documenting compliance with this criterion was a primary  point of contention regarding the XL proposal made by the Andersen  Windows corporation with backing by the state of Minnesota.  Among other  things, Andersen Windows desired to obtain flexibility to change  production processes without costly permit reviews under the Clean Air  Act\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations.  In exchange, the  firm proposed to establish a per-unit volatile organic compounds emissions  rate of 0.763 pounds per unit of production (referred to as the performance  ratio).  The performance ratio ensures that future capacity increases would  use less polluting processes, such as the substitution of water-based wood  finishes for the solvent-based wood finishes the facility had traditionally  used.  Also, the project would adopt an overall emissions cap of 2,651 tons  of volatile organic compounds per year.", "Although the proposed emission cap was above current actual emission  levels, Andersen Windows contended that because it was below current  allowable emissions, EPA should take into account the firm\u2019s past efforts to  reduce VOC emissions.  EPA, on the other hand, wanted the project to  commit to a level of emissions no higher than current actual emissions.  EPA contended that there was no plausible scenario under which the  facility would have emitted at a level near the proposed cap, and thus the  proposal did not constitute a commitment to superior environmental  performance.  In response, the facility made a number of concessions,  including the performance ratio limit, a lower overall emissions cap, and an  explicit, enforceable commitment that any new paint processes would use  less polluting materials.  After extensive negotiations, EPA agreed to the  proposal.", "The ECOS/EPA agreement also includes a series of principles to which  signatories of proposals agree.  Among them, proposals should include  provisions for stakeholder involvement in a project, provisions for the  enforcement of alternative regulatory requirements to ensure that public  health and environmental protections are maintained, and a process for  assessing the results of the innovative approach to test whether the desired  results are actually achieved.  Representatives of the Office of Enforcement  and Compliance Assurance stated that state proposals do not always  include an evaluation component, while others have not identified how  stakeholder involvement would be assured.  An official in EPA\u2019s Chicago  office also noted that some ECOS proposals did not meet the requirement  that they be sufficiently limited in scope that they may be considered  \u201cexperimental,\u201d in order to minimize any risks if the initiative does not  work as anticipated.  For example, EPA initially resisted a Michigan  proposal to take an innovative approach to controlling phosphorous  discharges into state watersheds.  Because the state initially proposed that  this program be adopted in at least three watersheds and possibly  statewide, EPA felt that its scope was not sufficiently limited to be  considered an experiment.  The project was approved after Michigan  agreed to limit the proposal to a single watershed.", "Finally, project submittals may be subject to EPA\u2019s \u201ccompliance screening  guidance.\u201d  The guidance provides that participants in regulatory flexibility  programs, such as Project XL and the EPA/ECOS agreement, have good  overall compliance records.  In particular, participation is deemed  inappropriate if an applicant has been the subject of a recent criminal  conviction, an ongoing criminal investigation, or ongoing EPA-initiated  litigation.  Participation may also be deemed inappropriate if an applicant  has been involved in violations resulting in a serious threat to human health  or the environment, a pattern of significant noncompliance, or is the  subject of a citizen enforcement suit.", "Such screening guidance became a central issue in a Project XL proposal  submitted by the Hopewell Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility in  Virginia.  The facility receives industrial wastewater from a variety of  manufacturers, including makers of pulp and paper, organic chemicals, and  plastics.  As a result of federal pretreatment regulations under the Clean  Water Act, the contributing manufacturers were faced with the requirement  to add redundant pretreatment technology.  Adding the technology would  have adversely affected treatment performance at the Hopewell plant.  Consequently, the Hopewell Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility and  contributing sources proposed to move the application of pretreatment  standards from the industrial users to the Hopewell plant.  An EPA Deputy  Regional Administrator expressed EPA\u2019s support for the project and its  desire to continue technical review of the proposal.  However, the  participation of two of the contributing firms was temporarily deferred  pending the resolution of outstanding significant non-compliance at those  facilities.  The state subsequently resubmitted the proposal under the  ECOS/EPA agreement.  In July 2001, EPA indicated that the proposal could  move forward to fuller development, but that the two firms with  noncompliance issues could not participate until their enforcement cases  were resolved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent EPA Actions Are Intended to Facilitate State Innovative Approaches Regulations.

In June 2001,  EPA adopted the recommendations of its Task Force on Improving EPA  strategy on Innovating for Better Environmental Results.", "The EPA Task Force on Improving EPA regulations was created in April  2001 to reexamine EPA\u2019s regulatory development process and identify ways  to improve supporting scientific, economic, and policy analysis.  In  addition, the task force sought ways to enhance regulatory flexibility and to  create strong partnerships with states and businesses.  Among other key  findings, the task force determined that in the process of developing  regulations, EPA should develop and consider a broader array of policy  options, including innovative alternatives and market-based approaches.  Importantly, the task force report recommended that the regulations  development process consider the possibility of innovative alternatives and  that EPA strengthen the involvement of states and local governments  during the regulatory development process.  Should EPA follow through on  this recommendation, it would help the agency address one of the key  obstacles identified in this report\u2014the effect of prescriptive EPA  regulations in impeding innovative regulatory strategies.  By involving state  officials early in the regulations development process and identifying the  potential effects of regulatory proposals at this stage, there is a greater  chance that regulations will be developed in a manner that encourages,  rather than inhibits, innovation. The strategy, however, applies to the  development of new regulations rather than the obstacles posed by existing  regulations.", "EPA\u2019s Draft Strategy on Innovating for Environmental Results maintains  that EPA\u2019s efforts to promote innovation over the course of the last decade  have made significant advances, but they have resulted in a disparate array  of projects that were not designed to achieve system-wide improvement.

Following  up on EPA reinvention activities of the last 10 years, it states that EPA  should integrate support for innovation into its planning, budgeting, and  organizational systems.  It also notes that a more innovative culture will  require EPA staff to view their jobs more broadly; that is, not just as  overseers of ongoing operations, but as problem solvers, partners, and  facilitators.  It also proposes to hold senior managers accountable for  supporting innovative approaches and increasing their responsibilities for  scaling up successful innovations.  According to EPA officials, the process  of diffusion and broader application of successful innovations may lead to  gradual revision of existing regulations that may be inhibiting better ways  of achieving environmental goals.", "The details of both EPA initiatives still need to be fleshed out and a number  of issues resolved.  For example, some state officials have questioned the  focus of the Draft Strategy on Innovating for Environmental Results on four  priority issues (greenhouse gases, smog, water quality, and water  infrastructure), fearing that this focus downplays other issues of greater  importance to individual states or localities.  According to EPA, states will  play a role in refining the Draft Strategy as it undergoes further  development.

Of these federal obstacles, the detailed  requirements of prescriptive federal environmental regulations were cited  as among the most significant, along with a cultural resistance among many  EPA staff toward alternative approaches.  In some cases, however, the  underlying cause of this cultural resistance was traced back to the  regulations.  Specifically, many EPA staff believe that strict interpretations  must be applied to detailed regulations if they are to be legally defensible.", "The identification by state officials of prescriptive federal regulations as a  key obstacle to innovation is consistent with the findings of numerous  research organizations that have cited the need for environmental  regulations to focus more on the desired environmental results and, where  possible, to be less prescriptive concerning the specific means of achieving  these results.  It is also consistent with EPA\u2019s recent adoption of the  recommendations of its own Task Force on Improving EPA Regulations  which advocates, among other things, that innovative alternatives should  be considered as new regulations are developed.", "It remains to be seen if implementation of the EPA recommendations will  have the desired effect in reforming the regulations development process  to better accommodate innovative proposals.  Yet, however successful  these efforts are in accounting for the impact of new regulations, they still  do not focus on the key problem (documented by this report and by those  of other organizations) concerning the impact of many existing  prescriptive regulations on innovation, nor do other EPA initiatives resolve  the problem.  As noted in this report, current statutes are generally less  prescriptive than the more detailed regulations by which they are  implemented.  However, the statutes contain no explicit language  authorizing the use of innovative environmental approaches in lieu of  specific regulatory requirements and, as noted in this report, this absence  of a \u201csafe legal harbor\u201d for EPA has been a significant obstacle to states and  others in their efforts to test innovative proposals.  It has also tended to  reinforce the cultural resistance to innovation that EPA is seeking to  change.
