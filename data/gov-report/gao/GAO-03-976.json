Federal land managers recognize that cooperative management of endangered species has several benefits, such as sharing land-use restrictions and resources and providing better protection for species in some cases. The Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have issued policies, and DOD has issued directives to promote cooperative management of natural resources. They have also outlined specific actions to be taken--such as identifying geographic regions for species management and forming working groups. However, follow-through on these actions has been limited, without many of the prescribed actions being implemented. A few cooperative management efforts have been taken but were generally in response to a crisis--such as a species' population declining. The Departments of Defense, the Interior, and Agriculture have identified a number of factors that can limit cooperative management for endangered species on military training ranges. When a species is found on training ranges but is not found on other federal land or is not protected under the Endangered Species Act, neighboring land managers do not always consider management of the species a high priority. Limited interaction among agencies and limited resources to employ cooperative programs also inhibit cooperative management. Lack of training and expertise has limited federal land managers' ability to identify such opportunities. Moreover, federal agencies cannot easily share information--such as best practices and land management plans--because there is no centralized source of such information. Given that federal agencies have made little progress in implementing the various agreements for cooperative management, an interagency reporting requirement would provide a basis to hold agencies accountable for sharing endangered species management on training ranges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Military lands provide habitat for more than 300 federally listed species  that must be protected under the Endangered Species Act and many other  species that may become endangered.

The Department of Defense  (DOD) and other agency officials have testified that some of the finest  remaining examples of rare wildlife habitats for these species exist on  military installations. However, DOD officials have stated that protection  of endangered species may result in land-use restrictions that reduce the  military\u2019s flexibility to use designated lands for training, a restriction that  can put military missions in jeopardy. Likewise, senior DOD and military  service officials have testified before Congress that they face increasing  difficulty in carrying out realistic training at military installations and have  identified endangered species as one of eight \u201cencroachment\u201d issues that  affect or have the potential to affect military training and readiness. In an  effort to address these encroachment issues, DOD drafted a sustainable  range action plan for each of the encroachment issues in 2001. The draft  Endangered Species Act Sustainable Range Action Plansuggests that the  Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military services should build  new and expand upon existing partnerships with other federal land  managers in an effort to manage for endangered species on a regional  basis as a way to accommodate military training and operations as well as  meet the legal requirements for endangered species protection and  conservation.", "In 2002, we issued two reports on the effects of encroachment on military  training and readiness.

In June 2002, we reported on the impact of  encroachment on military training ranges inside the United States and  had similar findings to our earlier report. We reported that many  encroachment issues resulted from or were exacerbated by population  growth and urbanization. DOD was particularly affected because urban  growth near 80 percent of its installations exceeded the national average.

The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Land Management manages about 264 million acres of public land for a  variety of resources and uses including minerals, timber, forage, and  fish and wildlife habitat; Interior\u2019s National Park Service mission is the  conservation of the scenery and the natural and historic objects and  wildlife in the parks in order to leave them unimpaired for future  generations; Interior\u2019s National Wildlife Refuge System mission is to  administer lands and waters for the conservation, management, and  restoration of fish, wildlife, and their habitat; and the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service manages about 192 million acres of national  forest and grasslands for a variety of resources and uses including timber,  forage, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Endangered Species Act", "paragraphs": ["In 1973, Congress enacted the Endangered Species Act to protect plant  and animal species whose survival is in jeopardy. The act requires that  the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce publish lists  of all species determined to be endangered or threatened. A species is  defined as endangered when it is in danger of extinction throughout all or  a significant part of its range and as threatened when it is likely to become  endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the  foreseeable future.", "Concurrent with listing a species, the Secretary of the Interior or the  Secretary of Commerce must, to the maximum extent prudent and  determinable, designate \u201ccritical habitat\u201d for the species. Critical habitat  is defined as the specific areas that are essential for the conservation of  the species and, for areas occupied by the species, may require special  management considerations or protection. Species that are federally listed  are entitled to certain protections under the Endangered Species Act.  Specifically, the taking of a listed animal species without a permit from  the Secretary is prohibited. Further, under the act, each federal agency, in  consultation with the Secretary, is required to ensure that its actions are  not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of protected species or  adversely modify habitat critical to their survival.", "Defense and Interior officials have stated that in managing endangered  species affecting training ranges, DOD\u2019s past successful efforts have  resulted in the ranges becoming havens for at-risk species after rapid  urban growth destroyed habitat, leaving military lands as the last refuge  for many species. DOD officials believe that balancing endangered species  management with mission needs can sometimes be problematic. For  example, at the Barry M. Goldwater Training Range, Air Force officials  report that in 2001, 32 percent of their live-fire missions were either  cancelled or moved due to the presence of the endangered Sonoran  pronghorn. Also, a recent Marine Corps report stated that at Camp  Pendleton, California, compliance with the Endangered Species Act is the  leading encroachment factor impacting military training and operations.The report noted that the Marine Corps is only able to complete up to 68  percent of the service\u2019s readiness standard for an advanced tactical  training scenario and its participation in realistic training has been  significantly degraded due to endangered species and other forms of  encroachment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Sikes Act", "paragraphs": ["Since 1960, the Sikes Act has required military installations to provide for  the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources on their lands. In  1997, the Sikes Act was amended to require that the military services  prepare integrated natural resources management plans in cooperation  with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the appropriate state agencies  and established a timeframe for the completion of all plans. The plans are  expected to balance the management of natural resources with mission  requirements and other land-use activities affecting those resources and  should reflect the mutual agreement of the parties concerning  management of fish and wildlife resources.", "DOD and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials believe that DOD\u2019s  integrated natural resources management plans provide a holistic  approach for natural resources management and for installations where an  approved natural resources management plan is in place, the plan should  be used as a substitute for critical habitat designations. For several years,  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been using these management plans  in lieu of designating critical habitat on military lands. In testimonies in  March and April 2003, Interior Department officials said that a recent  lawsuit that successfully challenged U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s failure  to designate critical habitat casts doubt on the service\u2019s ability to  substitute critical habitat designations on military lands with approved  natural resources management plans. In that lawsuit, which involved a  Forest Service plan, the court ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  was incorrect in its interpretation that land may be excluded from critical  habitat designation under the Endangered Species Act when management  or protection of the area is already in place. In DOD\u2019s recent legislative  proposal\u2014Readiness and Range Preservation Initiative for Fiscal Year  2004\u2014it is requesting that Congress confirm an existing practice that,  according to DOD, may make the designation of critical habitat on military  lands unnecessary when an approved integrated natural resources  management plan is in place. DOD and other federal and state agencies  as well as some nongovernmental organizations view this initiative as  providing a crucial balance between the stewardship of its lands and the  ability for the military to train for combat missions.

In addition, a 1996 Keystone Centerreport stated that a regional approach increases opportunities for military  commanders to achieve compliance with the Endangered Species Act  and to share the burden for natural resource conservation with other  landowners, thereby potentially reducing the impact on military land.", "DOD and other federal land managers generally agree that interagency  cooperative management of endangered species has benefits, such as  sharing the costs of recovery efforts, the burden of land-use restrictions,  and expertise and resources, as shown in the following examples:", "At the Barry M. Goldwater Range, land managers are sharing the cost of  some recovery efforts to increase the endangered Sonoran pronghorn\u2019s  population, which the managers might not have been able to fund or  undertake, if not done cooperatively. For example, the Marine Corps, the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the  Arizona Game and Fish Department each contributed one-fourth of the  funding for a genetic study of the pronghorn, the results of which are  important for determining the types of recovery actions the land managers  can use to protect the species.", "Another effort at the Barry M. Goldwater Range benefits both the species  and the Air Force. According to range operating instructions, if pronghorn  are spotted on the range within a prescribed distance from the target,  training must be cancelled or moved. DOD and nearby federal land  managers in the region agreed to create forage enhancement plots on an  adjacent national wildlife refuge that entices the pronghorn to the plots  and away from the targets.", "Federal agencies can also benefit by sharing expertise and resources  through cooperative management efforts. For example, the Midwest  Natural Resources Group meets three times a year to discuss various land  management issues, crises that are affecting them, and ways they can help  each other. At one of these meetings, according to a U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service official, the Forest Service asked for help to develop a  land management plan for endangered species. As a result, the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service colocated one of its employees at a Forest Service  office to, among other things, assist with the plan. Another example of  sharing expertise and resources through cooperative management efforts  is the Southwest Strategy group, which was created by the Secretaries of  the Interior and Agriculture and the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  for Environmental Security in 1997 to develop and implement a strategy to  more effectively coordinate, among other things, natural resource issues in  Arizona and New Mexico.

The  training center manages the sage grouse, a candidate species, to prevent  restrictions on the training range that may occur should the species be  federally listed. One of the Army\u2019s goals for the working group was to  create a regional conservation plan for the sage grouse that would include  individual conservation management plans from each of the nearby land  managers. Although other land managers attend working group meetings,  they have not completed their plans because they do not place the same  priority on recovering the western sage grouse as the Army, as the species  is not listed and is not found on their lands. Consequently, the Army will  continue to bear the majority of the responsibility of managing for the  western sage grouse.", "At Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California, the Navy has held  numerous meetings with other land managers to encourage regional  management of the least tern and the snowy plover, which are federally  listed species. However, Navy officials told us that, to date, they have not  received commitment from local land managers to share the burden of  species management. The presence of these birds has resulted in the lost  use of the majority of the base\u2019s training beaches. For example, while  there are 14 beach lanes at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, 4 lanes  have been completely closed because the birds occupy the lanes, and  training on 5 additional lanes is restricted when the birds are present.  Consequently, Navy officials said they have to substantially alter training  activities or conduct them elsewhere, which disrupts training cycles,  increases costs, and adds to the time sailors spend away from their  families. To reduce the burden of training range restrictions caused by the  presence of the birds, the Navy has identified the opportunity to move  some birds to a nearby national wildlife refuge where there is an  established bird population. Navy officials added that the wildlife refuge  has not cooperated as much as the Navy would like.

Similarly, a Forest Service headquarters official said that  limited funding and staffing are barriers to cooperative management  efforts.", "A 2002 Army Environmental Policy Institute study concluded that  understaffing is a common problem for both installation environmental  and natural resources programs. At several installations included in  the study, a lack of staff was viewed as a critical issue and, in some  cases, cooperative management implementation was limited due to  understaffing. For example, at Fort Knox, Kentucky, the Army reported  there is a lack of staff to implement cooperative management efforts  and insufficient funding to support cooperative management projects.  Understaffed natural resources offices find they can respond to short-term  initiatives and immediate demands, but longer-term cooperative  management initiatives are conducted piecemeal and only as time permits.  In addition, the study states that partnerships to create a regional vision  require commitment, which in turn requires funding and staff. However,  developing this vision is often not a high priority for an installation, and  therefore there is usually little funding available to implement projects that  support cooperative management efforts. Without enough qualified  environmental professionals on staff, successful cooperative management  is greatly inhibited.", "Officials from the Departments of Defense, the Interior, Agriculture,  and other federal agencies stated that they lack incentives to manage  cooperatively. For example, Department of the Interior officials stated that  interagency cooperative management is not part of their performance  expectations and they are not rated on their ability to manage  cooperatively for endangered species with DOD and other federal land  managers. At Fort Knox, issues and activities facing command and staff  tend to be relatively near term and personnel are rewarded for their  abilities to address these issues quickly. Cooperative management, on the  other hand, is a fundamentally long-term endeavor. The divergence of  these time frames makes cooperative management efforts difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Training and Expertise Limits Cooperative Management", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials and other federal land managers said that a lack of training  and expertise has limited federal land managers\u2019 ability to identify  opportunities for cooperative management efforts as well as the  neighboring land managers needed to implement them.

However, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials stated that additional  training is needed to train land managers to identify opportunities for  interagency cooperation and to implement cooperative efforts. The Army  Environmental Policy Institute study concluded that there is a large  turnover in natural resources staff at military installations due to low pay  and limited advancement opportunities, and the newly hired staff requires  considerable training in natural resources issues. For example, according  to the study, field biologists at Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu,  California, are critical to managing the ecosystem. However, field  biologists\u2019 salaries are very low and they lack job security, so turnover is  high. As a result, the natural resources manager needs to frequently rehire  and train biologists.", "DOD officials noted that staff reductions and the reliance on contractors  to perform some functions have resulted in the loss of institutional  memory and expertise that has adversely affected long-term initiatives,  such as cooperative management for endangered species. This lack of  expertise in natural resources programs limits the abilities of managers to  implement cooperative management efforts. For example, at Robins Air  Force Base, Georgia, installation environmental staff suggested that  cooperative management requires existing staff to have a broader and  more diverse skill set than ever before, and more specialized training is  needed toward that end. In addition, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  officials said that high staff turnover at some national wildlife refuges  leads to a loss of expertise, which makes it difficult to establish and  maintain good working relationships with other agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Centralized or Otherwise Easily Accessible Source of Information Limits Cooperative Management", "paragraphs": ["The Departments of Defense, the Interior, and Agriculture and other  federal agencies lack a centralized or otherwise easily accessible source of  information, which could facilitate the exchange of reliable, current, and  consistent information among and between federal land managers.", "Officials with The Nature Conservancy, a nongovernmental organization  that works cooperatively with DOD and other federal land managers,  noted that the federal agencies lack a simple, comprehensive, and reliable  way to learn from each other\u2019s successes and failures in conservation  planning and action, and of ongoing conservation plans and actions being  conducted within the region. The officials added that information related  to cooperative management efforts is often incomplete, outdated, difficult  to access, and not widely available. For example, while DOD\u2019s Defense  Environmental Network and Information Exchange is centralized and  fairly good, the network is not widely available, does not contain  comprehensive data on lessons learned or best practices of interagency  cooperative management, and contains mostly information related to  policies or regulations. In addition, according to DOD officials, federal  agencies have no established method to share and integrate endangered  species research, development, monitoring actions, priorities, and results.

According to DOD officials, there  needs to be a more comprehensive strategic approach to cooperative  management for natural resources management. They added that  initiatives such as those at the Barry M. Goldwater Range for the Sonoran  pronghorn should not come about as a result of a crisis, but rather from a  systematic approach to identify cooperative management opportunities.  In addition, a former Deputy Under Secretary of Defense stated there  needs to be a systematic and structured process for natural resources  management. DOD and other agency and nongovernmental officials added  that the current administration supports cooperative management efforts  and that federal land managers need to reach agreement on how best to  approach cooperative management. Also, in commenting on a draft of this  report, the Department of the Interior stated that its mission is integrally  tied to cooperative natural resources conservation and management, while  U. S.

A strategy that includes a systematic  methodology to identify opportunities for cooperative management  efforts, funding sources, science and technology sources, and goals and  criteria to measure success would facilitate federal land managers sharing  the burden of land-use restrictions and limited resources, and potentially  help avoid exacerbating constraints on training at affected military  installations. Similarly, without training programs to train land managers  to identify opportunities for interagency cooperation as well as to train  neighboring land managers to implement cooperative efforts, DOD and  other federal land managers may miss opportunities to manage  endangered species more effectively while carrying out their land  management responsibilities. In addition, without a centralized or  otherwise easily accessible source of information that includes elements  such as lessons learned, best practices, and agency contacts, DOD and  other federal land managers cannot easily share information or learn  about cooperative management efforts within and across agencies.

Concerning our  recommendation to develop and implement an interagency strategy for  cooperative management efforts, DOD stated that the Interagency Military  Land Use Coordination Committee structure and process could be used to  develop a strategy. While we agree that the committee could be used to  develop the interagency strategy and methodology, the committee has  periods of inactivity and the memorandum of understanding that formed  this group is set to expire in October 2004. Therefore, we believe that a  more formalized effort needs to be undertaken with support from the  Secretary of each department. In commenting on our recommendation  that the departments with land management responsibilities jointly  develop an education program, DOD agreed but suggested a focus on  training rather than education might be more appropriate. We agreed and  have modified the recommendation accordingly.

The department also stated that it was  concerned the recommendations would likely create increased demands  on already strained resources. However, we believe that if cooperative  management were incorporated into the department\u2019s daily management  practices as stated in the department\u2019s policy of \u201cconserving through  cooperation\u201d and not viewed as a separate effort, the impact on resource  requirements could be limited. At the same time, based on the  department\u2019s concerns about resource requirements and recognizing the  prevalence of Web-based information systems, we modified our second  recommendation to suggest that a centralized or otherwise easily  accessible source of information be developed. In addition, the  department also expressed the view that the level of coordination and  cooperation between the department and DOD is more extensive than the  report\u2019s findings indicated. The department suggested that the report  should include a more comprehensive view of current interagency  cooperation for management of endangered species.
