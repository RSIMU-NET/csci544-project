Although BIS made some regulatory and operational changes to the dual-use export control system, it has not systematically evaluated the system to determine whether it is meeting its stated goal of protecting U.S. national security and economic interests. Specifically, BIS has not comprehensively analyzed available data to determine what dual-use items have actually been exported. Further, contrary to government management standards, BIS has not established performance measures that would provide an objective basis for assessing how well the system is protecting U.S. interests. Instead, BIS relies on limited measures of efficiency that focus only on narrow aspects of the license application review process to assess the system's performance. BIS officials use intelligence reports and meetings with industry to gauge how the system is operating. Absent systematic evaluations, BIS conducted an ad hoc review of the system to determine if changes were needed after the events of September 2001. BIS officials determined that no fundamental changes were needed but opted to make some adjustments primarily related to controls on chemical and biological agents. GAO was unable to assess the sufficiency of the review and resulting changes because BIS officials did not document their review. Omissions in BIS's watchlist. GAO found omissions in the watchlist BIS uses to screen export license applications. This screening, which is part of the license application review process, is intended to identify ineligible parties or parties warranting more scrutiny. The omissions undermine the list's utility, which increases the risk of dual-use exports falling into the wrong hands. GAO identified 147 parties that had violated U.S. export control requirements, had been determined by BIS to be suspicious end users, or had been reported by the State Department as committing acts of terror, but these parties were not on the watchlist of approximately 50,000 names. Reasons for the omissions include a lack of specific criteria as to who should be on the watchlist and BIS's failure to regularly review the list. In addition, a technical limitation in BIS's computerized screening system results in some parties on license applications not being automatically screened against the watchlist. Some prior GAO recommendations left unaddressed. BIS has implemented several but not all of GAO's recommendations for ensuring that export controls on sensitive items protect U.S. interests. Among weaknesses identified in prior GAO reports is the lack of clarity on whether certain items are under BIS's control, which increases the risk of defense-related items being improperly exported. BIS has yet to take corrective action on this matter."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year companies in the United States export billions of dollars worth  of dual-use items that have both commercial and military applications. For  example, dual-use materials can be incorporated into golf clubs but can  also help missiles evade radar detection. The Department of Commerce\u2019s  Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is responsible for regulating the  export of thousands of dual-use items. In so doing, BIS faces the challenge  of weighing U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests,  which at times are divergent or even competing, to achieve an appropriate  balance that allows U.S. companies to compete globally while minimizing  the risk that exported items could be used against U.S. interests. This  challenge has been heightened by shifts in the security and economic  environment since the late 1970s, when the current statutory framework  for dual-use export controls was put in place. Perhaps most notably, in the  aftermath of the September 2001 terror attacks, the threats facing the  United States have been redefined. Also, over the decades, trade in rapidly  advancing technologies has increased as the economy has become more  globalized.", "BIS administers the dual-use export control system through the  requirements contained in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).  Under these regulations, exporters are to either obtain prior government  authorization in the form of a license from BIS or determine that a license  is not needed before exporting dual-use items. Multiple factors govern  whether an exporter needs a license, including the item to be exported and  the country of ultimate destination. Within the dual-use export control  system, BIS heads an interagency process for reviewing export license  applications. The decision to approve an application is based, in part, on  how the exported item is to be used and who plans to use it. During the  license application review process, BIS screens applications against its  own watchlist of individuals and companies to identify applications  involving parties that are either ineligible or warrant additional scrutiny to  minimize the risk of dual-use items being used against U.S. interests.", "In light of the September 2001 terror attacks, you requested that we  examine BIS\u2019s dual-use export control system and whether BIS has made  changes to the system. In response, we (1) assessed whether BIS has  evaluated the dual-use export control system and made changes to the  system, (2) evaluated BIS\u2019s screening of export license applications  against its watchlist, and (3) determined the extent to which BIS has taken  corrective actions in response to weaknesses previously identified by  GAO.", "In assessing BIS\u2019s evaluations of the system\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency,  we compared BIS\u2019s annual reports, performance plans, and budget  submissions with performance management and internal control  standards. Through discussions with BIS officials and reviews of  regulatory notices, we identified evaluations conducted by BIS and  resulting changes to the system after the events of September 2001. We  also analyzed data on export license applications, which we determined to  be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To evaluate BIS\u2019s watchlist  screening process, we compared BIS\u2019s watchlist with government  documents to assess the list\u2019s completeness, reviewed BIS\u2019s internal  guidance for adding parties to the watchlist and screening applications,  and discussed with BIS officials reasons parties were not included on the  list and BIS\u2019s screening process. To determine what actions BIS has taken  during the last 5 years in response to previously identified weaknesses, we  reviewed regulatory changes and information provided by BIS and other  agency officials.

Under  the authority granted in the Export Administration Act (EAA), BIS  administers the EAR that require exporters to either obtain a license from  BIS or determine government authorization is not needed before exporting  controlled items. Even when a license is not required, exporters are  required to adhere to the provisions of the EAR when exporting controlled  dual-use items. Whether an export license is required depends on multiple  factors including the    country of ultimate destination,   individual parties involved in the export,    parties\u2019 involvement in proliferation activities, and    planned end use of the item.", "Dual-use items specified in the EAR\u2019s Commerce Control List are  controlled for a variety of reasons, including restricting exports that could  significantly enhance a country\u2019s military potential, preventing exports to  countries that sponsor terrorism, and limiting the proliferation of  chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. The  U.S. government controls many of these items under its commitments to  multilateral export control regimes, which are voluntary agreements  among supplier countries that seek to restrict trade in sensitive  technologies to peaceful purposes.", "For those exports requiring a license, Executive Order 12981 governs the  dual-use license application review process and establishes time frames  for each step in the review process (see fig. 1).", "One of the first steps in the license application review process is the  screening of parties on the application, such as the planned exporter or  end user, against BIS\u2019s internal watchlist to identify ineligible parties or  parties that warrant closer scrutiny. Neither the EAA nor the EAR provide  specific criteria as to which parties are to be included on the watchlist.  However, under the EAR, BIS may deny export privileges to persons  convicted of export violations, and the watchlist serves as a mechanism  for identifying parties that have been denied exporting privileges. This  screening process can also serve as a tool for identifying proposed end  users sanctioned for terrorist activities and, therefore, ineligible to receive  certain dual-use items. BIS has the discretion to add other parties to the  watchlist. A match between the watchlist and a party on an application  does not necessarily mean that the application will be denied, but it can  trigger additional scrutiny by BIS officials, including BIS enforcement  officials, during the license application review process.", "While BIS is responsible for administering the dual-use export control  system and licensing dual-use exports, other federal agencies play active  roles. As provided for under Executive Order 12981, the Departments of  Defense, Energy, and State have the authority to review any export license  applications submitted to BIS. These departments specify through  delegations of authority to BIS the categories of applications that they  want to review based, for example, on the item to be exported. License  applications can also be referred to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  for review. After reviewing an application, the agencies are to provide the  BIS licensing officer with a recommendation to approve or deny the  application. In addition to reviewing license applications, the Defense,  Energy, and State Departments are also involved in the regulatory process.

While BIS is cognizant of  dual-use exports authorized through the license application review  process, it has not analyzed export data to determine the extent to which  approved licenses resulted in actual exports.

Under the performance management framework established by the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, federal agencies are to  develop objective performance measures for assessing how well they are  achieving their goals over time. These measures should focus on an  agency\u2019s outcomes as opposed to its processes. BIS\u2019s lack of effectiveness  measures was noted in a 2005 review by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB). In response to OMB\u2019s review, BIS indicated plans for  developing measures to assess the system\u2019s effects on national security  and economic interests in consultation with the other agencies involved in  the export control system.

These efficiency-related measures generally focus on the first steps in the  license application review process\u2014how long it takes to review a license  application internally and refer an application to another agency. Over  the last 3 fiscal years, BIS has reported meeting its licensing-related time  frames. However, BIS does not have efficiency-related measures for other  steps in the license application review process, such as how quickly a  license should be issued or denied once other agencies provide their input,  or for the review process as a whole. BIS also does not evaluate the  efficiency of other aspects of the system. Most notably, it does not  measure whether it is meeting the regulatory time frame for the processing  of commodity classification requests, of which there were 5,370 in fiscal  year 2005 or about 24 percent of licensing officers\u2019 workload (see app. I  for additional information on BIS\u2019s processing times).", "BIS officials acknowledged that they have not systematically evaluated the  dual-use export control system. Instead, BIS officials informed us that they  regularly review intelligence reports and meet with industry officials to  gauge how well the system is working.

The official  added that \u201cit stands to reason\u201d that BIS\u2019s controls have limited various  parties\u2019 access to U.S. dual-use technologies but that it is difficult to  determine how controls are affecting U.S. industry. Also, as evidence of  how the system is operating, BIS officials referred us to BIS\u2019s annual  report on its foreign policy-based controls. This report summarizes  various regulatory changes from the previous year and what the newly  imposed controls were intended to achieve. However, this report does not  contain an assessment of the impact these controls have had on U.S.  interests. To address its lack of evaluations, BIS officials informed us that  they are in the process of establishing an Office of Technology Evaluation.  BIS is hiring analysts to evaluate topics including how dual-use items  should be controlled and how export controls have affected industry.", "Absent systematic evaluations, BIS conducted an ad hoc review after the  September 2001 attacks to determine what changes, if any, needed to be  made to the system in light of the new security environment. However,  according to BIS officials, they did not produce a report or other  documentation regarding their review. Therefore, we could not assess the  validity or sufficiency of BIS\u2019s review and the resulting changes. BIS  officials told us they determined that, other than some adjustments to its  controls, no fundamental changes to the system were needed because they  already had controls and procedures in place to deny terrorists access to  dual-use technologies. Of the hundreds of regulatory changes made since  September 2001, BIS officials identified the following specific changes as  stemming from their ad hoc review    establishing a worldwide licensing requirement for exports of    changing the licensing requirement for biological agent fermenters  from fermenters larger than 100 liters to those larger than 20 liters;    controlling components that can be used in the manufacture of  chemical agents;  including additional precursors for the development of chemical  agents on the Commerce Control List;  revising licensing requirements to further restrict U.S. persons from  designing, developing, producing, stockpiling, or using chemical or  biological weapons;  requiring licenses for exports of equipment related to the  production of chemical or biological agents to countries that are not  members of the Australia Group;  imposing controls on exports of unmanned aerial vehicles capable  of dispersing more than 20 liters of chemical or biological agents;  and    adding amorphous silicon plane arrays, which can be used in night  vision or thermal imaging equipment, to the Commerce Control List.", "According to BIS officials, their review did not result in changes to the  license application review process after the events of September 2001.

BIS does not have an official  definition or explanation as to what constitutes an export control concern.  As a result, the decision as to whether a party should be added to the  watchlist is left to the judgment of the BIS personnel responsible for  maintaining the watchlist. The only specific guidance BIS provides is that  parties under investigation by BIS enforcement officials must be added to  the watchlist. BIS officials told us that the reasons a company,  organization, or individual should be added to the watchlist include  previous violations of U.S. export control regulations, inability to  determine a party\u2019s legitimacy, possible support of international terrorism,  and possible involvement with missile programs of concern. The  147 parties we identified fall within these categories. In addition, BIS  officials do not regularly review the watchlist to ensure its completeness.  BIS officials said they do not conduct periodic checks as to whether  particular parties have been added to the list. They also do not compare  the BIS watchlist to other federal agencies\u2019 lists or databases used for  similar purposes to determine whether the BIS watchlist is missing  pertinent parties.", "BIS officials offered several explanations for why the 147 parties were not  on the watchlist. First, they acknowledged it was an oversight on their part  not to include several of the parties on the watchlist. For example, at least  two parties were not added to the watchlist because the BIS personnel  involved thought they had been added by someone else. Second, for some  of the parties, BIS did not receive information from another agency about  export control-related investigations. However, these parties could have  been identified through publicly available reports. Third, BIS relies on  limited sources to identify parties involved in terrorist activities. The  officials explained that their primary source for identifying terrorist  organizations is the Treasury Department\u2019s public listing of designated  terrorists. While Treasury maintains a list of terrorists, its list is not  exhaustive and therefore, does not include all known terrorist  organizations. Finally, BIS officials noted that many of the parties we  identified were individuals and that they do not typically add individuals to  the watchlist because applications generally contain names of companies.

If there are multiple parties, BIS\u2019s regulations direct the  applicant to list the additional parties in the \u201cAdditional Information\u201d field.  However, the computer system does not recognize the parties listed in that  field, which means the parties are not automatically screened against the  watchlist. While BIS officials told us that they may identify applications  involving multiple parties and manually screen them against the watchlist,  they do not have a systematic means of identifying applications involving  parties listed in the \u201cAdditional Information\u201d field.

A lack of clarity as to  whether an item is Commerce-controlled or State-controlled increases  the risk that defense-related items will be improperly exported and U.S.  interests will be harmed as a result. In most cases, State\u2019s controls over  arms exports are more restrictive than Commerce\u2019s controls over dual-use  items. For example, a State-issued license is generally required for arms  exports, whereas many dual-use items do not require licenses for export to  most destinations. Further, most arms exports to China are prohibited,  while dual-use items may be exported to China.", "In 2002, we reported that BIS had improperly informed exporters through  the commodity classification process that their items were subject to  Commerce\u2019s export control requirements, when in fact the items were  subject to State\u2019s requirements. BIS made improper determinations  because it rarely obtained input from the Departments of State or Defense  during the commodity classification process on which department had  jurisdiction over the items in question. We recommended that the  Commerce Department, together with the Departments of State and  Defense, develop agreed-upon criteria for determining which classification  requests should be referred to the other departments, which would  minimize the risk of improper determinations. However, BIS has not  implemented our recommendation and continues to refer only a few  commodity classifications to the Departments of State and Defense. In  fiscal year 2005, BIS processed 5,370 commodity classification requests  and referred only 10 to State and Defense. Additionally, in 2001, we  reported that export control jurisdiction between the Departments of State  and Commerce had not been clearly established for almost 25 percent of  the items the U.S. government has agreed to control as part of its  commitments to the multilateral Missile Technology Control Regime. The  two departments have yet to take action to clarify which department has  jurisdiction over these sensitive missile technology items. As a result, the  U.S. government has left the determination of jurisdiction to the exporter,  who by default can then determine which national policy interests are to  be considered and acted upon when defense-related items are exported.", "BIS has taken actions to address other weaknesses identified in GAO  reports. For example, in response to a 2004 GAO report, BIS expanded its  licensing requirements for the export of missile technology items to  address missile proliferation by nonstate actors.

The Commerce  Department further states that BIS represents the \u201cgold standard\u201d for its  rigorous process of defining priorities, implementing plans, and measuring  success. To support this statement, Commerce lists several actions that  BIS has taken since September 2001 and cites BIS\u2019s \u201cGame Plan\u201d as  identifying BIS\u2019s priorities and providing a basis for measuring BIS\u2019s  performance. However, BIS has not evaluated what effects these actions  have had on U.S. interests. Also, the \u201cGame Plan\u201d provided to us at the end  of our review did not contain performance measures for assessing how  dual-use export controls affect national security or economic interests.  Further, OMB determined in its 2005 Program Assessment Rating Tool that  BIS lacked measures related to its fundamental purpose. Absent  performance measures and systematic evaluations, it is unclear what the  basis was for the various actions taken by BIS, what the impact of these  actions has been on national security and economic interests, whether  these actions are sufficient to protect U.S. interests in the current  environment, or how BIS represents the gold standard.", "The Commerce Department also comments that our report is misleading  and does not provide sufficient context for our findings related to BIS\u2019s  watchlist. According to Commerce, the 147 parties we identified as not  being on the list should be placed in the context of the approximately  50,000 names that are on BIS\u2019s watchlist, and no licenses were issued to  the 147 parties. Commerce\u2019s comment does not address our basic point. It  was not our intent to identify every party that should be on BIS\u2019s watchlist.  Nor did we seek to determine whether licenses were issued to parties not  on the watchlist, in part, because BIS\u2019s regulations permit the approval of  license applications involving parties on the watchlist. Instead, the point of  our finding and our related recommendations is that BIS does not have  mechanisms for ensuring a robust watchlist and screening process. To  provide additional context, we adjusted the text to reflect the number of  names on the watchlist. The Commerce Department also notes that the  watchlist is only one check during the license application review process  and that there are multiple layers and agencies involved\u2014a fact we  address in our report. According to Commerce, the built-in redundancies  in the review process minimize the possibility of a party slipping through  the cracks. We agree that having multiple layers of review can create an  effective system of checks and balances, but only if each agency is  fulfilling its responsibilities at each stage in the review. The other agencies  involved in the process clearly expect BIS to have a robust watchlist  screening process. BIS\u2019s stated reliance on others to compensate for  weaknesses in its watchlist creates gaps in the review process and,  therefore, undermines the ability of the system to effectively protect U.S.  interests. While the Commerce Department cites some measures BIS has  taken recently to refine the watchlist, these measures do not address the  weaknesses created by the lack of criteria and reviews of who should be  on the watchlist or the technical limitations that result in some parties not  being screened against the watchlist.", "Regarding its implementation of GAO\u2019s prior recommendations, the  Commerce Department states that BIS has met most of the  recommendations and maintains that none of the outstanding  recommendations puts BIS\u2019s mission at risk. We disagree since BIS has not  implemented recommendations that address the most basic aspects of the  export control system. Specifically, BIS\u2019s failure to implement  recommendations that would provide for clear, transparent decisions  about export control jurisdiction increases the risk that sensitive defense- related items will be improperly exported and that some exporters will be  placed at a competitive disadvantage\u2014undermining BIS\u2019s goal of  protecting national security and economic interests.", "The Commerce Department also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated into our report as appropriate.

The report to Congress  justifying the changes in control thresholds for high  performance computers was issued in December 2001 and  focused on the availability of such computers. However, the  justification did not fully address the requirements of the  National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The December  2001 report did not address several key issues related to  the decision to raise the threshold: (1) the unrestricted  export of computers with performance capabilities between  the old and new thresholds will allow countries of concern  to obtain computers they have had difficulty constructing on  their own, (2) the U.S. government is unable to monitor the  end uses of many of the computers it exports, and (3) the  multilateral process used to make earlier changes in high  performance computer thresholds.", "Export Controls: Department of Commerce Controls over Transfers of Technology to Foreign Nationals Need Improvement  (Sept. 6, 2002, GAO-02-972)", "Background: To work with controlled dual-use technologies  in the United States, foreign nationals and the firms that  employ them must comply with U.S. export control and visa  regulations.

Most of the approved deemed export licenses allowed  foreign nationals from countries of concern to work with  advanced computer, electronic, or telecommunication and  information security technologies in the United States. To  better direct its efforts to detect possible unlicensed deemed  exports, in fiscal year 2001 Commerce screened thousands  of applications for H-1B and other types of visas submitted  by foreign nationals overseas. From these applications, it  developed 160 potential cases for follow-up by enforcement  staff in the field. However, Commerce did not screen  thousands of H-1B change-of-status applications submitted  domestically to the Immigration and Naturalization Service  for foreign nationals already in the United States. In addition,  Commerce could not readily track the disposition of the  160 cases referred to field offices for follow-up because it  lacks a system for doing so.", "Commerce attaches security conditions to almost all  licenses to mitigate the risk of providing foreign nationals  with controlled dual-use technologies.

They are  consensus-based, voluntary arrangements of supplier  countries that produce technologies useful in developing  weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons. The  regimes aim to restrict trade in these technologies to prevent  proliferation. The four principal regimes are the Australia  Group, which controls chemical and biological weapons  proliferation; the MTCR; the Nuclear Suppliers Group; and  the Wassenaar Arrangement, which controls conventional  weapons and dual-use items and technologies. All four  regimes expect members to report denials of export licenses  for controlled dual-use items, which provides members with  more complete information for reviewing questionable export  license applications. The United States is a member of all  four regimes.", "The State Department has not  implemented our  recommendations. representative to the multilateral  regimes, establish a strategy to  strengthen these regimes. This  strategy should include ways for  regime members to  implement regime changes to  their export controls more  consistently, and  identify organizational  changes that could help  reform regime activities.", "Main issues: Weaknesses impede the ability of the  multilateral export control regimes to achieve their  nonproliferation goals. Regimes often lack even basic  information that would allow them to assess whether their  actions are having their intended results. The regimes  cannot effectively limit or monitor efforts by countries of  concern to acquire sensitive technology without more  complete and timely reporting of licensing information and  without information on when and how members adopt and  implement agreed-upon export controls. For example, GAO  confirmed that the U.S. government had not reported its  denial of 27 export licenses between 1996 and 2002 for  items controlled by the Australia Group. Several obstacles  limit the options available to the U.S. government in  strengthening the effectiveness of multilateral export control  regimes. The requirement to achieve consensus in each  regime allows even one member to block action in adopting  needed reforms. Because the regimes are voluntary in  nature, they cannot enforce members\u2019 compliance with  regime commitments. For example, Russia exported nuclear  fuel to India in a clear violation of its commitments under the  Nuclear Suppliers Group, threatening the viability of this  regime. The regimes have adapted to changing threats in  the past. Their continued ability to do so will determine  whether they remain viable in curbing proliferation in the  future. ensure that the United States  reports all license application  denials to regimes.    establish criteria to assess the  effectiveness of the regimes.", "Nonproliferation: Improvements Needed to Better Control Technology Exports for Cruise Missiles and Unmanned Aerial  Vehicles   (Jan. 23, 2004, GAO-04-175)", "Background: Cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles  (UAV) pose a growing threat to U.S. national security  interests as accurate, inexpensive delivery systems for  conventional, chemical, and biological weapons.

A gap in dual-use export control authority enables  U.S. companies to export certain dual-use items to  recipients that are not associated with missile projects or  countries listed in the regulations, even if the exporter knows  the items might be used to develop cruise missiles or UAVs.  The gap results from current \u201ccatch-all\u201d regulations that  restrict the sale of unlisted dual-use items to certain national  missile proliferation projects or countries of concern, but not  to nonstate actors such as certain terrorist organizations or  individuals. Catch-all controls authorize the government to  require an export license for items that are not on control  lists but are known or suspected of being intended for use in  a missile or weapons of mass destruction program.", "Commerce, Defense and   State Departments    as a first step, each department  complete a comprehensive  assessment of cruise missile,  UAV, and related dual-use  technology transfers to  determine whether U.S.  exporters and foreign end users  are complying with the  conditions on the transfers.", "While the Commerce  Department has taken some  actions to address our  recommendations, the others  departments have not done so.", "The Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State have  seldom used their end use monitoring programs to verify  compliance with conditions placed on the use of cruise  missile, UAV, or related technology exports. For example,  Commerce conducted visits to assess the end use of items  for about 1 percent of the 2,490 missile-related licenses  issued between fiscal years 1998 and 2002.

PSVs serve as  one of the primary means of checking whether end users  are complying with conditions imposed by the license.  Commerce placed conditions on nearly all approved  licenses for exports to countries of concern for fiscal years  2000 to 2002.", "Our recommendations have  been implemented. improve technical training for  personnel conducting PSV  checks to ensure they are able  to verify compliance with license  conditions.  conducting PSV checks assess  compliance with license  conditions.", "Main issues: In fiscal years 2000 to 2002, the Commerce  Department approved 7,680 licenses for dual-use exports to  countries of concern, such as China, India, and Russia.  However, we found that during this time Commerce  completed PSV checks on only 428 of the dual-use licenses  it approved for countries of concern. require that the exporter inform  the end user in writing of the  license conditions.", "We identified three key weaknesses in the PSV process that  reduce its effectiveness. First, PSVs do not confirm  compliance with license conditions because U.S. officials  often lack the technical training needed to assess  compliance and end users may not be aware of the license  conditions by which they are to abide. Second, some  countries of concern, most notably China, limit the U.S.  government\u2019s access to facilities where dual-use items are  shipped, making it difficult to conduct a PSV. Third, PSV  results have only a limited impact on future licensing  decisions. Companies receiving an unfavorable PSV may  receive greater scrutiny in future license applications, but  licenses for dual-use exports to these companies can still be  approved. In addition, according to Commerce officials, past  PSV results play only a minor role in future enforcement  actions.", "5, \u00a71211, 111 Stat. 1932-34 (1997).  1 nor S. 149 was enacted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The scope of our review has remained unchanged. We examined BIS\u2019s  dual-use export control system and whether changes were made to the  system by focusing on three specific issues related to how well the  system is operating in the post-September 2001 environment.   2.  Our report is not premised on a need for BIS to develop a national  security strategy, which is outside of BIS\u2019s mission. BIS\u2019s stated goal is  the protection of national security and economic interests. In its  comments, BIS appears to define \u201cnational security interests\u201d in terms  of the administration\u2019s National Security Strategy, but BIS has not  developed performance measures to evaluate or determine whether the  dual-use export control system is supporting and furthering that  strategy. Commerce\u2019s comments also do not address what effects the  dual-use export control system has had on U.S. economic interests.   3.  The eight specific measures cited in our report are not \u201csamples\u201d of  steps taken by BIS. Rather, they represent all of the changes identified  by BIS officials as a result of their ad hoc review to determine what  changes, if any, should be made to the system after the September 2001  terror attacks.   4.  Our report accurately depicts what BIS officials told us regarding the ad  hoc review they conducted in the aftermath of the 2001 terror attacks.  Given that BIS officials did not document their review, we can neither  confirm what the review consisted of nor determine the sufficiency of  this review and the resulting changes.   5.  Our report acknowledges that BIS made adjustments to its enforcement  efforts in response to the changing security environment. Also, GAO is  currently conducting a separate review of export control enforcement  efforts.   6.  Our report identifies the specific changes BIS officials stated were the  result of their post-September 2001 ad hoc review and acknowledges  that BIS has reprioritized its enforcement efforts and taken other  actions as a result of various geopolitical changes. However, without  performance measures and systematic evaluations, BIS is not in a  position to readily identify weaknesses in the dual-use export control  system, implement corrective measures, and determine whether those  measures are having the intended effects of protecting U.S. national  security and economic interests.  7.  Commerce\u2019s characterization of BIS\u2019s annual foreign policy report is  misleading. BIS\u2019s annual report summarizes export control changes and  describes what those changes were intended to achieve. BIS\u2019s report  does not contain an assessment of the actual impact foreign policy- based controls have had on U.S. interests.   8.  Our report acknowledges that there have been over 100 amendments to  the EAR since September 2001. However, based on our review of those  amendments, the specific basis for many of these revisions is not clear  and given BIS\u2019s lack of evaluations, the impact of these revisions is  unknown. Also, it should be noted that many of the regulatory  amendments made since September 2001 consisted of administrative  changes and technical corrections as opposed to revisions of export  requirements for dual-use items.   9.  The quotes from senior BIS officials\u2019 speeches do not address whether  the dual-use export control system is protecting U.S. interests nor do  they provide other evidence that BIS has developed performance  measures or conducted systematic evaluations. While these speeches  outline BIS\u2019s mission and the role of export controls, the lack of  performance measures and systematic evaluations precludes a  determination as to whether that mission and role are being  successfully fulfilled. It is also unclear how changing the bureau\u2019s name  is an example of a successful adaptation to the current environment.  Further, the increased scrutiny of license applications was not the  result of BIS\u2019s actions as one of the quotes implies. As discussed in our  report, increases in the referral of license applications resulted from  decisions by other agencies involved in the application review process.   10. Absent any documentation to the contrary, particularly when BIS  officials repeatedly acknowledged that BIS had not undertaken  systematic evaluations, we stand by our finding that BIS has not  systematically evaluated the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the  dual-use export control system. Regarding BIS\u2019s ad hoc post-September  2001 review, we could not assess the validity and sufficiency of the  review and resulting changes due to the lack of documentation.   11. Commerce\u2019s description of BIS\u2019s Game Plan is misleading and  inaccurate. First, BIS\u2019s mission and priorities as summarized in the  Game Plan are not consistent with the mission and goals stated in  Commerce\u2019s official performance management documents, such as the  annual performance plan. The Game Plan may represent BIS\u2019s thoughts  for how to align activities and priorities in the future, but it does not  depict what has been in place since the September 2001 terror attacks.  Second, the Game Plan does not contain measures of effectiveness.  When we discussed the Game Plan with BIS officials, they  acknowledged that they had not developed measures for evaluating  how well the dual-use export control system is protecting national  security and economic interests.   12. We agree that the development of measures for determining the  effectiveness of the dual-use export system would be difficult.  However, BIS\u2019s existing performance measures, which focus on  processing times, fall far short of government management standards  since they do not provide a basis for determining whether the system is  protecting U.S. interests.   13. Our report presents BIS\u2019s position that it was unable to obtain  assistance from other agencies to develop performance measures for  assessing the dual-use export control system\u2019s effects on national  security and economic interests. The two examples of performance  measures provided in Commerce\u2019s comments do not relate to BIS\u2019s  administration of the export controls system, which was the focus of  our review, but rather to BIS\u2019s export enforcement efforts and  assistance to other countries. Also, it is not clear how these two  measures would provide BIS with a basis for determining the security  and economic impact of its controls on dual-use exports. Additionally,  Commerce\u2019s statement that BIS is assigning staff to develop a  methodology for evaluating the system\u2019s effectiveness indicates that  BIS does not yet have a systematic evaluation process in place.   14. Our report discusses that, in the absence of systematic evaluations, BIS  officials obtain information from industry to gauge how the dual-use  export control system is operating. However, the collection of data  from industry does not constitute a measure or evaluation of how the  dual-use export control system is affecting U.S. economic interests.  Also, BIS officials repeatedly informed us that they do not have  measures for determining the impact of dual-use export controls on  economic interests.   15. The Office of Management and Budget determined in its 2005 review  that BIS lacked measures related to the fundamental purpose of the  dual-use export controls system. Given this and our evaluation as well  as BIS\u2019s limited measures of efficiency and lack of comprehensive  analyses as to which items under its control have actually been  exported, BIS is not meeting government performance management  standards and, therefore, does not represent the gold standard.  16. We examined the completeness of the watchlist and the thoroughness  of BIS\u2019s watchlist screening process and found omissions in the list and  weaknesses in the process. Our intent was not to determine whether  licenses were approved for parties not on the watchlist. As our report  explains, a match between an application and the watchlist does not  necessarily mean that the application will be denied but that the  application will be more closely scrutinized during the license  application review process.   17. Our report places BIS\u2019s watchlist in the context of the larger license  application review process. A process built on multiple layers and  multiple agencies is only as strong as its weakest link. Other agencies  that participate in the license application review process expect BIS to  thoroughly screen all parties on all applications against the watchlist  before referring applications to them. Given the omissions we identified  in the watchlist and the weakness in the screening process, BIS\u2019s  watchlist is not serving its intended purpose of helping identify those  license applications that warrant additional scrutiny.", "We identified many of the 147 parties not on the watchlist by using the  lists cited in Commerce\u2019s comments. While BIS expects exporters to  check these publicly available lists, we found that BIS failed to include  all of the publicly-listed parties on its watchlist. It is reasonable that BIS  would focus its licensing and enforcement efforts on the \u201ctruly bad  actors.\u201d However, given that the watchlist is supposed to help BIS  identify parties of export control concern, BIS\u2019s ability to focus on \u201cbad  actors\u201d is undermined by the omissions we identified in the watchlist.   18. The 147 parties we identified should not be regarded as an exhaustive  list of every party of export control concern that should be on BIS\u2019s  watchlist. Our intent was not to identify all parties but rather to  evaluate the process that BIS uses to determine which parties should be  on the list. Therefore, the 147 parties represent examples that illustrate  weaknesses in BIS\u2019s management of the watchlist. However, to provide  additional context, we revised the text to include the number of names  on the BIS watchlist.  19. The measures listed in Commerce\u2019s comments do not address the  underlying weaknesses we identified or our corrective  recommendations.   20. Our report accurately reflects that several, but not all, of GAO\u2019s prior  recommendations regarding the dual-use export control system have  been implemented. BIS\u2019s disagreement with the conclusions of GAO\u2019s  report on China\u2019s semiconductor industry does not change the fact that  BIS continues to cite that report and its recommendations as  justification for requested increases in resources. However, BIS has not  implemented the report\u2019s recommendations.", "The continued failure to address GAO\u2019s recommendations regarding the  commodity classification process and export control jurisdiction places  BIS\u2019s mission of protecting national security and economic interests at  risk. Improper decisions regarding jurisdiction and the lack of clear  jurisdiction create the risk that defense-related items will be exported  without the proper level of government review and control to protect  national interests. These weaknesses can also result in companies  seeking to export similar items under the different controls of the  Departments of State and Commerce, which places some companies at  a competitive disadvantage.   21. As discussed in our report\u2019s scope and methodology, we reviewed BIS\u2019s  documents, such as its performance plans, that contain BIS\u2019s official  performance measures. None of these documents contains  performance measures related to the processing of commodity  classifications. During meetings with BIS officials, they did not identify  additional measures for evaluating the system\u2019s effectiveness. Also,  Commerce\u2019s comment is misleading, as our report does not cite BIS  statistics on commodity classifications. Our report contains GAO\u2019s  analyses of BIS\u2019s data on commodity classification processing times  and shows that BIS has exceeded regulatory processing time frames.   22. We are not revising the graphic because it depicts what can occur in the  license application review process under different circumstances.   23. Text revised to further clarify the CIA\u2019s role in the license application  review process.   24. The examples provided by Commerce are limited to BIS\u2019s analyses of  licensing data. However, BIS has not comprehensively analyzed data on  actual exports, particularly on unlicensed exports that represent the  majority of exports subject to BIS\u2019s control.   25. Our report states that Executive Order 12981 provides time frames for  the entire license application review process. However, none of BIS\u2019s  performance measures addresses the timeliness of the entire process.  Also, BIS has not reported overall timeframes consistently in its annual  reports.  26. Our draft report cited changes in BIS\u2019s licensing policy for dual-use  exports to Iraq as an illustrative example; however, we have revised our  report to include the other countries listed in Commerce\u2019s comments.   27. Despite Commerce\u2019s comment regarding its sources, some of the 147  parties we identified as not being on the watchlist appear on publicly  available documents from the State Department\u2019s Directorate of  Defense Trade Controls and the Homeland Security Department\u2019s  Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   28. We are not revising the text based on Commerce\u2019s comment because  our report accurately reflects how the Treasury Department  characterizes the list it maintains on individuals and companies.   29. Despite Commerce\u2019s comment that it adds individuals to its watchlist,  we identified many individuals who were not on the list but should have  been.   30. Our report explains that BIS has a regulatory change pending that once  implemented will address this recommendation from 2001.   31. Commerce\u2019s actions regarding production equipment for missile  technology items do not resolve the lack of clear jurisdiction between  State and Commerce as to which department controls the export of  almost 25 percent of the missile technology items the U.S. government  agreed to control as part of its commitments to the Missile Technology  Control Regime. As a result, GAO\u2019s recommendations regarding this  matter remain unimplemented.   32. See comment 20.   33. The memorandum contained in Commerce\u2019s comments does not  address GAO\u2019s recommendations that BIS develop criteria, with the  concurrence of the State and Defense Departments, for the referral of  commodity classification requests and develop procedures for referring  other commodity classification requests to the State Department. As a  result, GAO\u2019s recommendations regarding this matter remain  unimplemented.   34.
