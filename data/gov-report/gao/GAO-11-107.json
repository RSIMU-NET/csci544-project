Delta II, however, is no longer in production, and no other vehicle in the relative cost and performance range is currently certified for NASA use. Thus, NASA faces a potential gap in the availability of medium class launch vehicles that could cause design challenges, delays, or funding issues. GAO was asked to assess (1) NASA's and the Delta II contractor's, steps to ensure resources (budget, workforce, and facilities) are available to support safe Delta II operations through the last planned NASA flight in 2011; (2) NASA's plans and contingencies for ensuring a smooth transition from current small and medium class launch vehicles to other launch vehicles for future science missions; (3) the risks associated with NASA's planned approach to fill the medium launch capability gap; and (4) technical and programmatic implications to science missions if NASA commits to new launch vehicles before they are certified and proven.

For example, LSP uses government systems engineers with technical expertise to review or repeat the contractors' engineering analyses. This is a key factor in high launch success rates. From 1990 through 2009, LSP has achieved a 98 percent launch success rate. LSP is conducting additional reviews of launch vehicle processing to mitigate risk associated with the remaining Delta II flights. LSP has also identified several specific areas of concern with the remaining Delta II flights--including contractor workforce expertise, postproduction subcontractor support, spare parts, and launch pads--and is taking steps where possible to mitigate risks and ensure the success of the remaining missions. NASA plans to leverage ongoing investments to acquire a new medium launch capability for science missions in the relative cost and performance range of the Delta II. The agency expects to eventually certify the vehicles being developed for space station resupply for use by NASA science missions. NASA has been in coordination with agency and contractor officials responsible for these efforts. Further, the agency revised its policy to allow for faster certification of new providers. Due to an active small class launch vehicle market and NASA's relative low need for vehicles in this class, the agency has no plans to develop additional small class launch vehicles. Rather, the agency will acquire these services through the NASA Launch Services II Contract. NASA's plan has inherent risks that need to be mitigated. NASA has not developed detailed estimates of the time and money required to resolve technical issues likely to arise during the launch vehicle certification process. As these costs are currently unknown, according to Science Mission Directorate officials, NASA has not yet budgeted for them. Further, both space station resupply vehicles have experienced delays and more delays are likely as launch vehicle development is an inherently risky endeavor. Neither potential provider currently has the facilities needed to launch the majority of NASA earth science missions requiring a medium capability. NASA medium class science missions that are approaching their preliminary design review face uncertainties related to committing to as yet uncertified and unproven launch vehicles. Launch vehicle decisions for these missions will be made before new vehicles are certified. Because changing the launch vehicle of a science mission after its preliminary design review is likely to lead to significant cost growth and schedule delays, NASA's intention is to select a launch vehicle and accept the impacts that any delays in the certification process could have to the cost and schedule of the science mission. NASA officials also indicated that future science missions might be asked to accommodate multiple launch vehicle possibilities if the availability of future vehicles is delayed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NASA perform a detailed cost estimate based on knowledge gained during launch vehicle certification and adequately budget for potential additional costs.

NASA science spacecraft often carry  sensitive instruments that require unique interfaces and special processing  and handling. Although NASA has a continuing need for medium class  launch vehicles for science missions, the agency maintains that its need is  insufficient to sustain the Delta II program at prices traditionally paid.

Known as the workhorse of  the launch industry, the Delta II comprises a group of expendable rockets  that can be configured as two or three-stage vehicles and with three, four,  or nine strap-on solid rocket motors depending on mission needs. The  largest configuration is referred to as Delta II Heavy.", "The Commercial Space Act of 1998, U.S. Space Transportation Policy, and  National Space Policy of the U.S. require NASA, to the maximum practical  extent, to acquire launch vehicles from the U.S. commercial sector. NASA  uses the NASA launch services contract to acquire small, medium, and  intermediate launch vehicles for NASA\u2019s science, exploration, and  operational missions. The launch services contract is a multiple award  indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) task order contract. The  original launch services contract competition in 2000 resulted in the award  of firm-fixed price IDIQ launch services contracts with not-to-exceed  prices to Boeing Launch Services Incorporated (Boeing) and Lockheed  Martin Commercial Launch Services Incorporated (Lockheed), which later  merged to form United Launch Alliance, for the Delta and Atlas vehicles.  In 2005, NASA awarded Orbital an IDIQ launch services contract for the  small class launch vehicles Taurus, Taurus XL, and Pegasus XL, and in  2008 NASA awarded SpaceX an IDIQ launch services contract for the  small class Falcon 1 and medium class Falcon 9 vehicles. Pursuant to the  \u201con-ramp\u201d clause in the launch services contract, the original solicitation  remains open during the life of the contract to allow launch services  providers\u2014including contractors who have already been awarded an IDIQ  launch services contract as well as other contractors\u2014to introduce launch  vehicles or technologies that were not available at the time of the award of  the initial contract. See figure 2 for launch vehicles discussed in detail in  this report.", "When NASA needs to acquire launch services for science missions, NASA\u2019s  LSP, which is responsible for acquiring launch vehicles for NASA\u2019s Science  Mission Directorate, issues a request for launch service proposals. All  contractors who have been awarded a launch services contract at the time  NASA issues the request for launch service proposals are contractually  obligated to submit a proposal, unless the contracting officer waives the  requirement. NASA considers each proposal according to specified criteria  and awards the task order to the contractor who provides the best value in  launch services that meet NASA\u2019s requirements. The ordering period  under the NASA Launch Services I contract began in 2000 and expired in  summer 2010. On September 16, 2010, NASA announced the award of the  NASA Launch Services II contract which, like the NASA Launch Services I  contract, is a multiple award IDIQ contract. NASA selected four  companies for awards: Lockheed, Orbital, SpaceX, and United Launch  Alliance, and each contract has an ordering period through 2020. Orbital  did not respond to the contract solicitation for its Taurus II vehicle.  According to Orbital officials, it plans to take advantage of the on-ramp  clause of the NASA Launch Services contract in summer 2011. According  to LSP officials, competition between the launch service providers is  intended to lead the providers to sell NASA launch services at prices less  than the negotiated not-to-exceed prices. This competition is limited in the  medium and intermediate classes, however, because of the small number  of providers who have been awarded a contract. For example, United  Launch Alliance is currently the only provider of intermediate class launch  vehicles for Earth orbit escape missions and Space X is currently the only  provider of a medium class launch vehicle on the Launch Services II  contract.", "While NASA\u2019s LSP is responsible for acquiring launch services for science  missions, several NASA offices are involved in the development of the new  commercial launch vehicles that NASA plans to use to replace the Delta II.

For  example, it actively tracks the certifications necessary for  assembly, integration, ground operations, processing, and launch  of the Delta II. United Launch Alliance also tracks the current  certifications of the Delta II workforce and provides training  necessary to retain the required certifications. To retain critical  skills, United Launch Alliance uses essentially the same workforce  for the Delta II and Delta IV, a vehicle that shares significant  commonality. LSP officials indicated that the LSP workforce would  remain essentially unchanged through the last missions as LSP is  responsible not only for Delta II but for all NASA science mission  launches.", "Postproduction Subcontractor Support: LSP is funding an  approximately $8 million per year, postproduction support  relationship, managed by United Launch Alliance, with key Delta II  subcontractors. According to agency officials, this will ensure that  subcontractors with knowledge and expertise needed to  manufacture or repair subcomponents are available if needed.  United Launch Alliance has contracted with Alliant Techsystems,  Incorporated for solid rocket motors, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne  for the first stage engine, and Aerojet for the second stage engine  through fiscal year 2011.", "Spare Parts: United Launch Alliance has implemented a process,  which has previously been used on the last flights of other vehicles,  to ensure key spare parts are available to support the final Delta II  missions. This process identifies irreplaceable or critical hardware  the unavailability, loss, or damage of which cannot be remedied  without serious impact to program cost, schedule, or technical  performance. United Launch Alliance has identified 28 such items  for Delta II and will mitigate the risk of spare parts availability by  either purchasing additional spares beyond planned needs or  implementing quality assurance activities to minimize risk. In  addition, LSP personnel have been assigned to assess and monitor  Delta II launch vehicle spare parts during the retirement of the  Delta II.

This relationship has  already provided benefits. For example, through this relationship, LSP  persuaded Orbital to include additional engine testing into the Taurus II  test strategy that will ultimately contribute to the certification effort for  science missions. LSP does not have such an agreement in place with  SpaceX; however, LSP may gain insight into SpaceX\u2019s design for Falcon 9  that should provide similar benefits because SpaceX was awarded a NASA  Launch Services contract in 2008 and 2010.

GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating Guide, however, indicates that assumptions should be made  about the costs of unknowns and that contingency funding should be  reserved to cover potential costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule Delays with Taurus II and Falcon 9 Have Occurred and More Are Likely", "paragraphs": ["Both SpaceX and Orbital have experienced delays in the development and  testing of Falcon 9 and Taurus II, respectively. We reported in June 2009  that both companies were working under aggressive schedules and their  vehicles were experiencing schedule delays\u2014at the time, the first flight of  the Falcon 9 was scheduled for June 2009 but slipped to June 2010,  whereas the first flight of the Taurus II was scheduled for December 2010  and has now slipped to no earlier than September 2011. Further, our past  work and NASA\u2019s experience indicate that more delays are likely, given  that developing launch vehicles is an inherently complex and risky  endeavor. For example, we reported in 2005 that the Air Force\u2019s Delta IV  Heavy Lift Vehicle\u2019s first operational flight was delayed 6 months, due in  part to design problems discovered in testing. Likewise, according to  NASA, vehicle histories from SpaceX, Orbital, and United Launch Alliance  indicate that the average delay in the third successful launch of a new  vehicle is 31 months from the manifested date of launch. The contractors  for Falcon 9 and Taurus II are not currently awarded any task orders for  science missions; therefore the formal certification process for each has  not begun. Consequently, the schedule and budget of any science mission  that is assigned to one of these vehicles could be negatively impacted if  delays occur in the certification process. While NASA expects these  vehicles will eventually become a viable option for medium class science  missions, it is uncertain how long the process might take."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SpaceX and Orbital Lack Facilities Necessary to Meet Requirements for Some Science Missions", "paragraphs": ["Neither SpaceX nor Orbital currently has a high-inclination launch site  option for its medium class vehicle, yet the majority of NASA\u2019s Earth  science missions require such a site due to the high inclination required to  achieve a polar orbit. Launches from the East Coast of the United States  are suitable only for low-inclination orbits because major population  centers underlie the trajectory required for high-inclination launches.  High-inclination launches are accomplished from the West Coast because  the flight trajectory avoids populated areas. Orbital is conducting a site  selection survey and its West Coast options include Kodiak, Alaska; Space  Launch Complex 2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California; and Space  Launch Complex 8, also at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, which  Orbital currently uses to launch the Minotaur. According to Orbital  officials, the site selection decision is expected in 2011, with the site ready  for operations as early as 2014. According to SpaceX officials, SpaceX  plans are underway to secure a Falcon 9 launch site at Vandenberg Air  Force Base for high-inclination launches. This capability is planned to be  ready for operation by late 2012. However, if the launch sites are not  available when needed, NASA\u2019s planned science mission manifest could be  negatively impacted, as 12 of the 14 medium class science missions  planned through 2020 that do not yet have assigned launch vehicles  require a high-inclination launch."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Science Missions in Development Face Uncertainties Related to Committing to Launch Vehicles before They Are Certified and Proven", "paragraphs": ["NASA science missions requiring a medium class launch vehicle that are  approaching their preliminary design review face uncertainties related to  committing to as-yet uncertified and unproven launch vehicles. The  preliminary design review marks the point at which it is demonstrated that  the preliminary design meets system requirements with acceptable risk  and within cost and schedule constraints, and establishes the basis for  proceeding with detailed design. Shortly after the preliminary design  review, a project establishes its commitment baseline which documents  the project\u2019s estimated cost and schedule. From this point on, almost all  changes to baselines are expected to represent successive refinements,  not fundamental changes. NASA program managers indicated that the  launch vehicle of a science mission should be assigned by the preliminary  design review to allow the science mission design team to optimize their  spacecraft based on the operational characteristics of the launch vehicle.  A number of NASA science missions are approaching the preliminary  design review; therefore, decisions need to be made about the launch  vehicle for these missions. However, as indicated by figure 6, some  decisions will have to be made before either the Falcon 9 or Taurus II is  certified for science missions.", "The Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP), Joint Polar Satellite System  (JPSS-1), and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) missions  are approaching their preliminary design reviews and are the first three  missions requiring a medium capability for which a Falcon 9 could  potentially be selected for launch services. Falcon 9 had a successful first  flight in June 2010 and could potentially be certified as a category 3 vehicle  by late 2013 or early 2014. NASA is planning for the imminent release of a  request for launch service proposals for the SMAP mission and tentatively  plans to issue requests for proposals for the JPSS and ICESat-2 missions in  spring 2011. If Falcon 9, the only medium class launch vehicle currently  available under the Launch Services II contract, is selected for any of these  missions, the mission launch date will be tied to a successful certification  of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Because the preliminary design review  establishes the basis for proceeding with detailed design, according to  NASA officials, any changes to accommodate a new launch vehicle after  the preliminary design review are fundamental changes and rarely, if ever,  occur. Therefore, NASA\u2019s intention is to select a launch vehicle and  accept any delays and residual cost increases to the science mission  associated with delays in the certification process. According to NASA  officials, changing the planned launch vehicle of a science mission after its  preliminary design review is a fundamental change to the mission design  and would lead to significant cost growth and schedule delays. As figure  6 illustrates, several NASA missions require a launch vehicle decision prior  to the certification of Falcon 9. While NASA expects that Falcon 9 could  be certified to a category 3 prior to the planned launch dates of these  missions, given the relative immaturity of the launch vehicle and the  likelihood of further delays, the schedule for these missions could be at  risk if the Falcon 9, or any other unproven launch vehicle, is selected.", "NASA officials indicated that science missions within the next few years  might be asked to design to accommodate multiple launch vehicle  possibilities if the availability of future vehicles is delayed or until the task  order is issued for the particular mission. Science Mission Directorate  officials indicated that while designing to accommodate multiple launch  vehicles is possible, the practice is cumbersome, especially when  continued beyond the preliminary design review. Under this type of design  scenario, every decision is constrained to the worst case performance  characteristic of the competing vehicles. Consequently, overall mission  effectiveness is reduced, because benefits associated with a particular  vehicle are traded away to design to the lesser set of capabilities of  another vehicle. Thus, if the less constrained vehicle is chosen, that  capability is left unused. Ultimately, the scientific benefit of the planned  mission is reduced, because the science payload may have to be adjusted  to accommodate reduced launch capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NASA is taking an appropriate approach to help ensure the success of the  remaining Delta II missions by adequately addressing workforce, support,  and launch infrastructure risks. Nevertheless, an affordable and reliable  medium launch capability is critical to NASA meeting its scientific goals.  NASA has a plan in place for obtaining this capability through Orbital and  SpaceX\u2019s vehicles, but past experience with other development programs  and recent history with both vehicles indicate that maturing and certifying  these vehicles for use by science missions is likely to prove more difficult  and costly than currently anticipated. If the companies are not successful  in delivering, in a timely manner, reliable and cost-effective upgraded  launch vehicles that can be used for NASA science missions, NASA will  lack an affordable domestic launch capability in the medium performance  vehicle class and could be forced to use more costly or time-consuming  options.
