Although the administration gave agencies discretion to downsize in ways that best suited their needs, it appears that buyouts were used to meet the numerical goals of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act with minimal regard for NPR\u2019s objective to reduce management control positions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Except for Supervisors, Agencies Were Inconsistent in Using Buyouts to Help Meet NPR\u2019s Workforce Restructuring Goals", "paragraphs": ["One reason for the lack of progress made in meeting NPR\u2019s workforce restructuring goals lies in the fact that with the exception of supervisory positions, agencies were inconsistent in using the buyout authority as a tool to trim management control positions as recommended by NPR. Instead, agencies appeared to use buyouts mostly for achieving the numerical targets of the Workforce Restructuring Act.", "Had agencies more successfully directed their buyouts to NPR management control positions, the percentage of buyouts in these occupations would probably have been higher than their representation in the workforce. However, as shown in table 2.4, when both Defense and non-Defense agencies had buyout authority (fiscal year 1994 through the first half of fiscal year 1995), this was not the case for most positions. In fact, the percentage of buyouts taken in budget, accounting/auditing, and headquarters positions, was actually less than their representation in the workforce. For most other positions, the percentage of buyouts was roughly equal to their representation in the workforce. The one exception to this was supervisory positions, which represented 11.5 percent of the workforce during this period but received 20 percent of the buyouts.", "In some instances, agencies simply did not attempt to use buyouts to help meet NPR\u2019s workforce restructuring goals. Although the Workforce Restructuring Act authorized the use of buyouts to assist agencies in meeting numerical downsizing targets, it did not require that buyouts be used to reduce the ranks of management control positions as intended by NPR. Moreover, OMB\u2019s guidance on preparing streamlining plans did not specifically require agencies to show how they planned to use buyouts to meet NPR\u2019s workforce restructuring goals. Finally, some agencies may not have restricted buyout eligibility to employees in specific positions because they may have feared morale would be adversely affected if buyouts were offered to one set of employees but not to others.", "When agencies used buyouts to reduce the ranks of management control positions, they were often directed at one or two management control positions, typically supervisors and upper-level employees. For example, 7 of the 15 agency streamlining plans we examined tied their buyouts to reducing supervisors and managers as well as upper-level employees; however, none of the plans tied buyouts to personnel, budget, acquisition, or accountant/auditor positions. Similarly, other agency documents we reviewed only gave preference to some of the groups NPR recommended for reduction. In such instances, supervisors, managers, and upper-level employees were generally given priority for receiving buyouts. For example, in its first round of buyouts, BLM gave priority to Senior Executive Service employees, followed by employees in grades 15 and 14, and personnel occupations. Similarly, in its voluntary separation incentive plan, the Department of Energy gave priority to supervisory and managerial positions and upper-level employees in both fiscal years 1994 and 1995.", "Finally, even those agencies that directed buyouts at specific positions did not always get the results they wanted. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, planned to use up to 80 percent of its total buyouts for managers and supervisors. In actuality, about 20 percent of the buyouts went to such individuals, and EPA had to flatten the agency through other means, including converting supervisors to nonsupervisors and team leaders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Often Set Restructuring Goals That Were Less Ambitious Than Those Recommended by the Administration", "paragraphs": ["Another likely reason for the minimal change in levels of management control positions is that agencies said they could not meet NPR\u2019s workforce restructuring goals without adversely affecting their ability to carry out their missions. Like the government as a whole, the 24 agencies we surveyed made substantial personnel reductions, many of which were achieved through buyouts. However, our analysis of agency streamlining plans shows that agencies claimed they could not reduce management control positions to the levels recommended by NPR without adversely affecting their operations. As a result, these agencies often set their own restructuring goals at a less ambitious level than those called for by the administration. Although OMB allowed this, agencies were asked to specify what alternative steps they were taking to restructure their workforces.", "Table 2.5 shows the variance between NPR\u2019s goals for reducing management control positions and the average of agencies\u2019 reduction goals as reported in their survey responses. While agencies made considerable progress in meeting their own workforce restructuring goals, those goals were generally far lower than those recommended by NPR. DOD agencies may have had somewhat lower reduction goals for management control positions because when closing a military base, all positions are eliminated, regardless of whether they are management control positions.", "With regard to meeting their own goals, however, table 2.5 shows that, on average, agencies are well on their way. Indeed, several individual agencies have already met or exceeded their reduction goals. For example, the Geological Survey\u2019s goal for reducing accountants and auditors was 47 percent, but the Survey expected a 58 percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 1995. The Forest Service\u2019s goal for reducing acquisition specialists was 15 percent, but the Service expected a 22 percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 1995. Similarly, three agencies responding to our survey stated that buyouts helped them meet their reduction goals for supervisors and managers. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said that buyouts helped its Agency for Health Care Policy and Research reduce senior staff by six people, supervisory staff by five people, and control staff by one person.", "The agency streamlining plans we examined cited various reasons for not meeting NPR\u2019s goals. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said it will increase acquisition specialists by 23 percent because it needs them to address long-standing weaknesses cited in reports on compliance with the Financial Integrity Act. The Department of Education said it will reduce budget analysts by 25 percent, but that a deeper cut is infeasible given, for example, the continuing growth in the number of department programs as well as the complexity of its legislation, budgets, policies, and programs.", "Only one of the 15 agencies whose plans we reviewed had complied with the NPR recommendation to establish a goal that would increase the supervisor to subordinate ratio from 1:7 to 1:15 by fiscal year 1999. The others set goals ranging from 1:9 to 1:14. The Department of Justice, for example, said the U.S. Marshals Service will not make significant progress at improving its supervisory ratio. Because the Marshals Service must maintain offices with 10 or fewer employees in order to staff all federal court facilities, it is difficult to eliminate supervisors in district offices. The Department of Agriculture claimed that doubling the current span of control for supervisors to 1:15 would not allow it to carry out its mission. It said most of its work is at field project locations, where a supervisor monitors two to six people. Moreover, the optimum size of fire fighting crews for safety and coordination purposes is less than the 1:15 ratio.", "Although OMB gave agencies discretion to downsize according to their needs, if agencies could not meet NPR\u2019s workforce restructuring goals, they were to provide information on what they were doing instead to streamline and improve program performance.
