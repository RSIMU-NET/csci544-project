Congress increased NFIP's borrowing authority with the U.S. Treasury from a pre-Katrina level of $1.5 billion to about $20.8 billion in March 2006, but FEMA will probably not be able to repay this debt on annual premium revenues of about $2 billion. As of May 2006, NFIP had paid approximately 162,000 flood damage claims from Hurricane Katrina and another 9,000 claims from Hurricane Rita. Most paid claims were for primary residences where flood insurance was generally required. FEMA and its private sector partners faced several challenges in processing a record number of flood claims from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, among them were (1) reaching insured properties in a timely way because of blocked roadways and flood water contamination and (2) identifying badly damaged homes to be inspected in locations where street signs had washed away. Despite these and other obstacles, FEMA reported that over 95 percent of Gulf Coast claims had been closed by May 2006, a time frame comparable to those for closing claims in other, smaller recent floods. To help keep pace with the volume of claims filed, FEMA approved expedited methods for claims processing that were unique to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. To provide oversight of the claims adjustment process, FEMA's program contractor did quality assurance reinspections of Hurricane Katrina and Rita claims adjustments. FEMA did not adopt our October 2005 recommendation that it select the claims to be reinspected from a random sample of the universe of all closed claims; thus, the results of the reinspections cannot be projected to a universe larger than the 4,316 claims adjustments that were reinspected. FEMA agrees with our prior recommendation and plans to do quality reinspections in future flood events based on a random sample of all claims. FEMA did not analyze the overall results of the quality reinspections for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. FEMA has made progress but has not fully implemented the NFIP program changes mandated by the Flood Insurance Reform Act.

However, the magnitude and severity of losses from Hurricane Katrina and  other 2005 hurricanes required the NFIP to obtain borrowing authority of  $20.8 billion from the Treasury, an amount the program is unlikely to be  able to repay while paying future claims with its current premium income  of about $2 billion annually.

Although homeowner insurance policies typically cover damage  and losses from fire or theft and often from wind-driven rain, they do not  cover flood damage because private insurance companies are largely  unwilling to bear the economic risks associated with the potentially  catastrophic impact of flooding. To provide some insurance protection for  flood victims, as well as incentives for communities to adopt and enforce  floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood damage, and to  reduce the amount of federal disaster assistance payments, federal law  established the NFIP in 1968. The legislative history of the National Flood  Insurance Act recognized that insurance for existing buildings constructed  before the NFIP was established would be extremely expensive because  most of them were flood prone and did not comply with NFIP floodplain  management standards that went into effect after they were built. The  authorizing legislation included provisions for subsidized insurance rates  to be made available for policies covering certain structures to encourage  communities to join the program.

Optional lower-cost coverage is  also available under the NFIP to protect homes in areas of low to  moderate risk. To insure furniture and other personal property items  against flood damage, homeowners may purchase separate NFIP personal  property coverage. Maximum coverage amounts under the NFIP are  $250,000 for dwellings and $100,000 for personal property.", "Accurate flood maps that identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding are  the foundation of the NFIP. Flood maps must be periodically updated to  assess and map changes in the boundaries of floodplains that result from  community growth, development, erosion, and other factors that affect the  boundaries of areas at risk of flooding. FEMA is in the midst of a multi- year effort to update the nation\u2019s flood maps at a cost in excess of   $1 billion.

However, by design, the program is not  actuarially sound because federal law authorized subsidized insurance  rates to be made available for policies covering some properties to  encourage communities to join the program.

A Senate provision would forgive the NFIP debt and bills  in both houses had provisions to improve the financial solvency of the  program and reduce the extent of the federal government\u2019s exposure for  losses in catastrophic loss years. For example, proposed legislation in  both the Senate and the House of Representatives contain provisions that  would allow premium increases of up to 15 percent annually on NFIP  policies, up from the current cap of 10 percent on premium increases.  Additionally, legislation in both houses of Congress would phase out  subsidized rates for some properties built before flood insurance rate  maps were put into effect in their communities, including nonresidential  properties and those that are not primary residences.

In each instance, FEMA repaid the funds with interest.  According to FEMA officials, as of August 31, 2005, FEMA had outstanding  borrowing of $225 million with cash on hand totaling $289 million. FEMA  had substantially repaid the borrowing it had undertaken to pay losses  incurred for the 2004 hurricane season, which, until Hurricane Katrina  struck, had been the worst hurricane season on record for the NFIP.

In some circumstances, claims could be  adjusted without site visits by certified flood claims adjusters. For flooding  from Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans caused by the failure of the  levees, FEMA allowed the use of aerial and satellite photography and flood  depth data to identify structures that had been severely affected. If data on  the depth and duration of the water in the building showed that it was  likely that covered damage exceeded policy limits, the claim could be  settled without a site visit by a claims adjuster. Similarly, for some other  losses in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, FEMA authorized claims  adjustments without site visits where structures were washed off of their  foundations by flood waters and square foot measurements of the  dwellings were known. While FEMA authorized the use of these  approaches, the write-your-own companies made the decision on whether  they wished to use expedited processes to adjust claims. In addition,  FEMA authorized the use of a square foot measurement methodology for  homes that had been flooded off of their slabs, pilings, or posts. In those  instances, damages could be calculated by a certified flood adjuster based  on measurements of room dimensions and classification of building  materials as high, medium, or low level, rather than a room-by-room, item- by-item calculation of loss amounts.  FEMA authorized payments to its  private insurance company partners of $750 per expedited claim  adjustment\u2014a lower fee than would have been paid for a more time- consuming room-by-room, line-item-by-line-item visual assessment of  flood damage.", "According to the FEMA director of NFIP claims, about 17,200 claims for  damage, mostly from Hurricane Katrina (about 11 percent of all Hurricane  Katrina claims), were adjusted using expedited procedures. Although a  relatively small number of claims were adjusted using expedited  processes, officials of FEMA, its program contractor, representatives of  two of the five private insurance companies we interviewed, and a flood  claims adjusting service official said that having the option to do some  expedited adjustments enabled the NFIP to keep up with demands for  adjuster services and close the claims as quickly as it did.", "Representatives of the three insurance companies we visited that did not  use expedited processes to a significant extent said they did not do so for  reasons including concerns over the accuracy of flood depth data, delays  in the availability of flood depth data, and because their companies did not  write homeowners\u2019 policies on the dwellings in question, they lacked  necessary information (i.e., square foot measurements of the home) that  were needed to process claims without site inspections.", "According to the FEMA director of NFIP claims, two large write-your-own  insurance companies developed models that were approved by FEMA for  use in making square foot estimates of damage for some claims from  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita instead of sending certified flood adjusters to  the sites to assess and document damage room by room and item by item.  According to the FEMA official, the square foot models paid claims based  on the square footage of the property and a classification of the building  materials as low, middle, or high level. For example, claims paid on a  flooded high-level kitchen would be more than payments for a middle-level  kitchen of the same square footage. If one or two high-end items were in a  middle-level home (i.e., a custom front door or exotic hardwood floors),  an adjustment to the middle-end rate would be made for those specific  items. According to the official, the NFIP had experimented briefly with a  much less sophisticated approach to square foot estimating about 10 years  ago but had not used any form of claims adjusting since that time other  than the traditional approach of sending a certified flood adjuster to the  site to assess damage and estimate losses with required reports, work  sheets, and photographs to document damage room by room and line item  by line item.", "The director of NFIP claims said that FEMA did not track the number of  estimates done using the square foot method. He said that FEMA plans to  examine the accuracy of the models carefully and consider using them for  other catastrophic flooding events in the future. Because usage of the  square foot method by the two companies with approved models was not  carefully tracked during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA paid the same  fee for square foot adjustments as it did for regular line-item-by-line-item  adjustments that took longer to perform and required more extensive  documentation. However, the director of NFIP claims said that if the  square foot methodology is approved for future use, the fee schedule paid  for these adjustments would probably be lower than the current schedule  for regular claims adjustments, with a resulting savings for the NFIP.", "In addition to approving expedited and square foot claims adjusting  methods, FEMA took several other actions to expedite claims adjustments  and meet the needs of claimants in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita. These were actions that, according to officials, FEMA had also  used to a more limited extent in prior large flood events. Specifically,  FEMA    waived the requirement that property owners furnish proof of loss  statements that list their losses for all Hurricane Katrina and Rita  claims,    allowed telephone adjustments for some claims below $25,000,    established special toll-free telephone lines to assist policyholders  who had questions about filing claims,  liberalized adjuster training requirements to deploy more adjusters  to flood-damaged areas, and    authorized insurance companies and independent flood adjusting  firms to use adjusters who did not meet FEMA\u2019s minimum flood  certification requirements provided that they worked under the  direction of seasoned adjusters until the company certified that they  were trained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NFIP Adjustment Process Will Continue with Claims for Help to Elevate or Remove Substantially Damaged Properties", "paragraphs": ["As part of its floodplain management strategy, FEMA policies encourage  the elevation or removal of damaged properties from the floodplain.

The payments are made under the  increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage of the standard flood  insurance policy. As a first step to making claims for this coverage,  adjusters are required to file preliminary damage assessment forms with  FEMA for properties that may be substantially damaged.

Through May 2006, FEMA had made ICC payments of  about $7 million on Hurricane Katrina and Rita claims.

For the first time, FEMA issued advisory  guidance on coastal flood elevations that communities can use in the  reconstruction process until more detailed data become available.   According to FEMA officials, this guidance\u2014called advisory base flood  elevations\u2014was necessary because a risk assessment showed that base  flood elevations in effect for coastal Louisiana and Mississippi did not  reflect the true risk to the areas from flooding. According to a FEMA  official, FEMA expects to have updated rate maps for coastal areas by  early 2007 so that communities can begin the process of considering to  adopt them.", "Accurate flood maps that identify the areas at high risk of flooding are the  foundation of the NFIP, and the flood maps for some areas of the Gulf  Coast affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were out of date. The maps  identify base flood elevation levels\u2014the height at which there is a   1 percent chance of a flood occurring in a given year, also known as the  100-year flood. FEMA uses the 100-year flood as the standard for setting  premium rates and requirements for NFIP.", "Prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA was conducting a coastal  study of hurricane storm flooding as a part of its map modernization  program. According to a FEMA official, the agency was about to issue  several new preliminary flood insurance rate maps in the Gulf Coast  region when the storms hit. However, the storm surges from Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita far exceeded the base flood elevations in many areas of  the Gulf Coast, raising questions about the validity of the base flood  elevations and current flood insurance rate maps. In response, FEMA  conducted risk assessments using the most current and accurate flood risk  data available. The analyses incorporated storm data from the past   35 years, including data from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, tide (water  level) gauge data, and other engineering studies. The analyses showed that  base flood elevations on the flood insurance rate maps in effect for coastal  Louisiana and Mississippi did not reflect the true risk from flooding  because the elevations were between 1 and 9 feet too low. Also, the  analyses showed that higher storm surges and larger waves can be  expected to spread farther inland than previously estimated because of  land subsidence and the loss of the protective coastal barrier over the past  10 to 20 years. On completion of the risk analyses, FEMA issued advisory  base flood elevation maps for 15 parishes in Louisiana and 3 counties in  Mississippi that took into account the more accurate and up-to-date flood  hazard data. (See app. III for a list of the communities for which the  advisories were issued and the status of the communities\u2019 consideration of  their adoption.)", "FEMA cannot require communities participating in the NFIP to use the  advisory base flood elevations. According to FEMA, it issued the  advisories to parishes and counties, and individual communities within  those jurisdictions can decide whether or not or to what extent they will  adopt the guidance. For example, the City of Gulfport, Mississippi,  adopted the advisories in September 2006 to protect citizens from future  floods but extended the official adoption of the new elevations to  November 1, 2006, to allow residents wishing to rebuild to less stringent  elevation requirements in effect prior to the adoption of the advisories  adequate time to secure building permits. The New Orleans city council  approved FEMA\u2019s new advisories but made exceptions for properties in  the French Quarter and other national historic structures in the city and  those listed with the Historic Districts Landmarks Commission.  Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, rejected the advisory because the parish  council considered some advisory map data to be wrong, determined that  adopting the advisory would have a high negative economic impact on  homeowners, and noted that the advisory information was intended to be  only advisory and preliminary.", "However, FEMA has provided incentives for individual homeowners and  communities to rebuild using the advisory standards. For example, FEMA  requires that rebuilding projects it funds, through public assistance or  mitigation grants, be built to advisory standards. Similarly, FEMA grants  for repairing and rebuilding public infrastructure such as schools,  libraries, and police stations will not be available to communities unless  they rebuild to advisory base flood elevations. NFIP policyholders who  live in communities that have flood plain management standards that  exceed the minimum standard are eligible for discounts on their  premiums. ICC payments to NFIP claimants that take steps to reduce their  risk from future flood damage will help cover the elevation of homes to  the advisory base flood elevation if that standard is adopted by the  community. FEMA has also warned communities that continued use of  flood data on current flood insurance rate maps could result in residential  and commercial buildings that will be vulnerable to flood damage because  they will not be built high enough or have the structural integrity to resist  flood forces that may be encountered in future large events.", "According to a FEMA official, the agency expects to have updated,  preliminary flood insurance rate maps for the coastal parishes and  counties in Louisiana and Mississippi by early 2007. However, the maps  will become effective only after a formal appeals process and community  adoption; a process that normally takes a minimum of 2 years to complete.

In addition, FEMA formed a  special task force to reinspect an additional 1,696 claims that were  adjusted using expedited processes.

Funds may also be used by  states and communities to purchase severe repetitive loss properties.  FEMA officials noted that they had made progress in developing the  program guidance and implementing regulations for the pilot program and  plan to combine the fiscal years 2006 and 2007 appropriations and begin  funding projects under the pilot program in fiscal year 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By the measures of number of claims filed, amount of claims paid, losses  per claim, and debt incurred, Hurricane Katrina was an unprecedented  event for the NFIP that created challenges to process a record number of  claims and address needs of claimants and communities that experienced  grave losses. FEMA approved new methods of adjusting some Hurricane  Katrina and Rita claims, issued advisory opinions to aid in rebuilding after  these flood events, and took other actions to address the needs of NFIP  claimants and communities.", "However, the importance of FEMA taking additional actions to enhance  the value of its monitoring and oversight processes is also illustrated in the  aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Not only did these flood events  involve billions more dollars and hundreds of thousands more claims for  the NFIP than any previous flood event since the program\u2019s inception, but  they also involved new claims-processing methods that, if proven to result  in accurate claims adjustments, could lower NFIP payments for claims  adjustments as compared to fees paid for the more time-consuming room- by-room, line-item-by-line-item visual assessments of flood damage that  the NFIP had exclusively relied upon for all prior flood events. FEMA\u2019s  current use of quality assurance reinspections to discuss individual results  and specific adjustment errors with insurance company officials and seek  reimbursements for overpayments is too limited to meet our internal  control standard that it have reasonable assurance that program objectives  are being achieved and its operations are effective and efficient. For future  flood events, when FEMA conducts its quality assurance reinspection  program for claims adjustments using the statistically valid sampling  methodology we previously recommended, the agency will be well  positioned to broaden the scope of its analyses to determine the overall  results of claims adjustments done for each future flood event, including  the number and type of claims adjustment errors that occurred.", "FEMA made progress in implementing provisions of the Flood Insurance  Reform Act of 2004. However, our recommendation that FEMA establish  milestones for meeting provisions of the act remains open. In October  2005, we recommended that FEMA develop a documented plan with  milestones for ensuring that agents that sell NFIP policies meet minimum  training and education requirements. FEMA has taken a number of  actions, including outreach to the states, to encourage the implementation  of minimum training standards. However, given the somewhat slow  progress among states to adopt mandatory training requirements, we  continue to think that FEMA should elaborate on the state implementation  performance measure by developing a documented plan with milestones  for state adoption of minimum training and education requirements and  our recommendation related to the minimum training and education  requirements remains open."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen and improve FEMA\u2019s monitoring and oversight of the NFIP,  including ensuring that claims payments are accurately determined, we are  recommending that for future flood events when FEMA implements our  prior recommendation to do quality assurance reinspections of a  statistically valid sample of claims adjustments, the Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security also direct the Under Secretary of  Homeland Security, FEMA, to take the following action:    Analyze the overall results of claims adjustments done for each  future flood events to determine the number and type of claims  adjustment errors made and to help determine whether new,  cost-efficient methods for adjusting claims that were  introduced after Hurricane Katrina are feasible to use after  other flood events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On December 8, 2006, DHS provided written comments on a draft of this  report.

Most of the additional  oversight and management processes and controls that FEMA has in place  are for financial management\u2014an area not included in the scope of our  work.  Our work focused on program implementation and oversight in the  aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  During our review, FEMA  managers described the quality assurance claims reinspection program as  the primary method for overseeing the accuracy of claims adjustments for  these flood events.

We compared claims payments for losses from Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita to payments for losses from past flood events. We also analyzed  statistical data from the NFIP data system on claims payments for  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We analyzed the data on losses paid by state,  for principal and nonprincipal residential properties, within and outside of  special flood hazard areas, and by type of coverage (i.e., building,  contents, or both building and contents). We updated our reliability  assessment of the statistical data base reported in October 2005 by  interviewing database managers to discuss any system changes that would  have an impact on data reliability and by replicating statistical analyses by  the NFIP to determine their accuracy. We determined that the database  was sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes. We did our analyses  and reliability testing of FEMA statistical data that were current through  May 31, 2006, when FEMA reported that over 95 percent of Hurricane  Katrina and Rita claims were closed.", "To describe the challenges FEMA and its private sector partners faced and  the results of their efforts to process flood claims resulting from  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and address the needs of NFIP claimants and  communities, we interviewed headquarters and field officials of FEMA and  its program contractor. We also conducted semistructured interviews  based on our judgment with insurance industry officials involved in the  recovery effort and visited areas impacted by Hurricane Katrina in New  Orleans, Louisiana, and Bayou La Batre, Alabama. Interviewees included  the owner of a firm that specializes in insurance claims adjustments for  catastrophes, representatives of the three insurance companies that closed  the largest number of Hurricane Katrina and Rita NFIP claims, and a  representative of an insurance company that was not a major NFIP insurer  for the Gulf Coast claimants but did process some claims. Their views are  not representative of the universe of all insurance industry officials  involved in the flood recovery effort. We also analyzed statistical data on  the number of appeals filed by claimants and requests made for  reinspections by FEMA\u2019s program contractor to assist claimants and  insurance companies in reaching resolutions on disputes. We reviewed  documentation and talked with officials about new, expedited methods of  claims processing FEMA approved. We examined preliminary data on  claims that may be filed for coverage under the standard flood insurance  policy for up to $30,000 for some property owners to take actions to  reduce their risk of future flood damage. Finally, we examined  documentation and interviewed FEMA officials on the status of efforts to  provide guidance to communities and property owners to assist in  recovery and rebuilding efforts and reviewed documentation on the status  of communities\u2019 actions to adopt FEMA\u2019s advisory base flood elevation  standards.", "To assess FEMA\u2019s role in monitoring and overseeing the NFIP and the  results of that oversight, we interviewed officials of FEMA and its program  contractor who were involved in the quality assurance reinspections of  claim adjustments done for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and documented  the number of reinspections performed and the methodology used to  select claims for reinspection. We reviewed documentation of FEMA\u2019s  procedures for monitoring and overseeing claims adjustments. We  observed a disaster analyst for FEMA\u2019s program contractor performing  several quality assurance reinspections in Bayou La Batre. We followed up  on the status of our prior recommendation for improvements in the quality  assurance reinspection program and discussed actions taken or planned to  implement it. We selected a statistically valid sample of 740 reinspection  reports done for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to review to determine,  among other things, errors that were identified in the claims adjustments.  Using a data collection instrument, we reviewed the results of these  randomly selected reinspection reports of Hurricane Katrina and Rita  claims to determine whether reinspectors identified errors, including  overpayment, underpayments, or adjustments that did not meet NFIP  standards (i.e. did not contain appropriate documentation).", "Table 3 shows the number of quality assurance reinspection reports of  claims adjustments done using regular processes we examined, including  site visits by flood adjusters and expedited methods FEMA approved for  some Hurricane and Rita claims.", "To assess the status of FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement provisions of the  Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we  interviewed officials and examined documentation of the actions FEMA  took.
