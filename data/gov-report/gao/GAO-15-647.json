If goals are at risk of not being met, officials may take action to select additional priority cases. In recent fiscal years, the collection program has exceeded nearly all case closure goals for priority cases.

This  report (1) describes IRS\u2019s processes for categorizing and routing  collection cases, trends in priority areas, and key process changes for  fiscal years 2012 through 2014; and (2) assesses how well the processes  for case selection support the collection program\u2019s mission, including  applying tax laws with integrity and fairness to all.", "For the first objective, to describe IRS\u2019s processes for categorizing and  routing collection cases, we reviewed IRS documents describing the  processes and systems at the enterprise level, including program  management reports and presentations prepared by IRS staff. We also  analyzed system rules to determine how they affect case categorization  and routing. We analyzed information about the collection program\u2019s  statistical methods and procedures used in the modeling process, a  statistical method that predicts likely case outcomes. We also visited the  IRS office in St. Paul, Minnesota, that is responsible for building and  maintaining the models. We analyzed documents to learn how the models  were used and how they affect case categorization and routing for case  selection. To describe trends in priority areas, we analyzed IRS case  priorities and closure data in management reports for fiscal years 2013  through 2014. To describe key process changes, we interviewed IRS  officials, reviewed a study that resulted in process changes, and analyzed  data on the application of various IDS business rules for calendar years  2011 through 2014.", "For the second objective, we compared the processes identified above to  the relevant federal standards for internal control.

As shown in figure 2, the source  of assessments in the potentially collectible tax debt inventory has been  roughly even among the three categories over the last 6 fiscal years.

We previously reported that the notice phase provides IRS with  an opportunity to maximize collections while minimizing costs in pursuing  tax debts. Notices are computer generated and mailed to taxpayers with  little direct involvement by IRS employees. If taxpayers then take action to  pay or otherwise resolve their debts, collections can occur with relatively  little additional IRS investment. When individuals with tax debts do not  respond to notices, IRS may route the case to either ACS or the Field for  collections. While both of these processes are more labor intensive and  expensive than the notice process, costs for routing a case to ACS or the  Field differ significantly. Based on data from fiscal years 2010 through  2014, IRS\u2019s Office of Cost Accounting determined that it cost roughly  $200 to close a case in ACS and about $2,500 to close a case in the  Field.

For example in  2009, IRS created a GHW industry group within LB&I to centralize and  focus IRS compliance expertise involving high-wealth individuals and their  related entities (we previously reported on GHW cases). LB&I requested  that collections prioritize GHW cases because, if the unpaid tax debts  identified in such programs are not effectively collected, the deterrence  effect of the audits themselves could be greatly diminished. To track the  number of GHW taxpayer cases that are closed as compared to goals,  collection staff use a list of Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) of  GHW taxpayers developed by LB&I.

At the time of the study, most payroll cases  were assigned to the Field queue based on routing rules that tested the  total dollar amount owed. Generally, only cases where the business owed  less than a few thousand dollars were routed to ACS, and all other payroll  tax cases were sent to the Field queue.

Further, the  annual program letter does not identify program objectives, but instead  identifies distinct projects or activities (including the seven priority areas)  grouped underneath IRS\u2019s broad strategic goals. Performance measures  do not serve as objectives, but rather should be derived from objectives.  Having clear objectives, especially as they relate to the seven priority  areas, is important to support management decisions about high priority  areas. For example, collection executives cited GHW and return preparer  penalty cases as high priority areas to enhance the deterrent effect of the  respective completed audits and other IRS compliance initiatives.

Although fairness is in the collection mission statement and IDS  processes may affect how collection cases are selected, collection  officials had not defined fairness or established it as a program or case  selection objective. A clear definition of fairness is needed because  program managers provided us with differing explanations of how to  achieve fairness in case selection. An IRS official responsible for case  selection functions defined fairness as when taxpayers with similar case  characteristics\u2014such as the amount or type of tax owed\u2014have an equal  chance of being selected for collection action. However, it is not clear  from this definition which case characteristics should be taken into  consideration and which should not when selecting cases for collection.  Others have suggested that fairness means ensuring that all taxpayers  are pursued to the same degree.", "Another collection official discussing fairness said that if the public had  information on IRS\u2019s methods for prioritizing and routing cases for  selection, they would agree that the process was fair. This suggests that,  in addition to comparing chances of selection, the public\u2019s perception of  fairness is an important consideration. Collection program managers  stated that their processes were inherently fair and that they did not see  the need to define fairness. These varying views illustrate that without  fairness being clearly defined and established as a program or case  selection objective, however, IRS management cannot adequately  determine if the collection process is being implemented fairly or in an  unbiased manner. Moreover, officials cannot systematically identify and  address risks to help ensure that fairness is continually achieved, leaving  the agency vulnerable to selecting taxpayer\u2019s collection cases in an  inconsistent manner.", "Another important and widely used term\u2014risk\u2014is also missing a clear  definition and officials we spoke with had a variety of ideas as to its  meaning.

However, program managers have not clearly defined risk. As we  attempted to clarify this, we asked if risk pertained to the amount of debt  due.

Another IRS official  said \u201crisking\u201d included the concept of tradeoffs. A collection program  manager explained that the term risking was established during the term  of a previous IRS commissioner who had promoted the concept as used  in the private sector, where it generally refers to decision making based  on data analytics or modeling. However, the manager said IRS\u2019s use of  the term is not similar to the private sectors, but rather refers to using  case variables and thresholds for prioritizing and routing cases. In  reviewing the types of cases IRS gives high priority\u2014including payroll tax  cases\u2014we found that the concept of compliance risk may also include  the potential future revenue loss, the number of taxpayers affected,  and/or the likelihood that tax debts, if allowed to accumulate, might not be  collectible in the future. Further, risking at the enterprise level seems to  be different than risking in ACS and the Field; IDS risking refers to  processes that identify only high priority cases, whereas in ACS and Field  risking refers to processes that rank order cases in high-, medium-, and  low-priority categories.

Risk analysis  generally includes estimating the risk\u2019s significance, assessing the  likelihood of its occurrence, and deciding how to manage the risk by  determining what actions should be taken, if any.", "The first and most critical step is risk identification. Management should  have well-documented procedures for regularly identifying internal and  external risks to program objectives and procedures, such as in short-  and long-term forecasting and strategic planning. Procedures should  include how internal risks are to be identified, such as risks resulting from  downsizing of agency operations and personnel or redesigning business  processes. Similarly, procedures should include how external risks\u2014such  as economic changes or changing needs or expectations of the  Congress, agency officials, and the public\u2014are to be identified.", "Risk identification and assessments are not new to IRS. IRS has relied  upon many long-standing processes and procedures, and conducted a  variety of program reviews to identify and address risks. However, the  agency\u2019s overall approach to risk management became more focused in  2013, when it established the Enterprise Risk Management Office (ERM)  process. IRS implemented ERM, among other reasons, to serve as an  early warning system to allow the agency to identify emerging challenges  and address them before they affect operations. According to IRS\u2019s Chief  Risk Officer, the goal is to embed risk management principles and  practices into the daily operations of the business units and integrate  long-standing processes into the new, more holistic ERM approach.", "Officials said the first year of ERM focused on enterprise-level risks that  include potential major reputational risks to IRS. The second year of ERM  has focused on risk at the operating division level. For example, in April  2015, Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) (the operation division that  includes the collection program) completed its first division-level risk  register. A risk register is a list of risks and related information, including  strategies for mitigating them. To provide input into the SB/SE risk  register, collection officials told us that they decided to use a \u201cbottom up\u201d  approach whereby potential risks would be identified and elevated by  frontline staff and other lower-level staff who may be aware of risks at an  operational level. Future years of ERM will focus more on risks at the  program level. Collection officials said they have started trying to integrate  risk management into their program\u2019s daily operations. They also noted  that in recent months they have been developing processes and  documentation for the program\u2019s risk management strategy and  establishing the infrastructure for its risk management process.", "The risk management guidance collection used to provide input to the  SB/SE risk register focused on how to assess risks identified at the  employee and mid-management levels. Such methods of identifying risks  would be useful for the bottom-up approach collection officials described  to us. Although the guide encouraged managers and executives to self- identify risks\u2014ostensibly to their program objectives for which they are  responsible\u2014the guide did not have information on how managers are to  identify such risks. Collection management would need such information  when determining the priority areas for a given year. For example, if  fairness was defined as a key program objective, then management  would want to define the risk associated with ensuring the priority cases  were selected in a fair way. This underscores that risk assessments  should be based on program objectives. Without clear objectives, as  discussed earlier, comprehensive assessments of risks are difficult to  conduct.", "Collection program officials said that they had identified risks using  processes and guidance established by ERM. Although officials said that  managers were involved in identifying risks, they did not have  documentation or guidance on how management identified risks. In May  2015, after the completion of the SB/SE risk register, ERM put forth  guidance to help managers identify risks. While the guidance provides  helpful information for management, further information would be useful  so that managers better understand how to integrate IRS\u2019s long-standing  risk management processes with the new ERM approach. Officials said  SB/SE is in the early stages of developing its own training for collection  executives and managers, which may also provide useful information for  management.", "IRS\u2019s ERM efforts are at initial stages and it is too early to determine their  effectiveness. Management\u2019s identification of risks is important because  internal and external risks could affect the collection program and  collection case selection in particular. For example, economic changes  could affect the mix of complex cases that come into IDS and require IRS  to consider making changes to case prioritization and routing. Similarly,  downsizing of IRS operations\u2014as discussed previously\u2014has the  potential for creating risks of greater imbalances between workload and  resources, either overall or between ACS and the Field. Such risks could  be better managed by IRS with guidance that helps to identify and  manage them, particularly when changes occur to collection-wide case  categorization and routing processes.

Documentation is a  necessary part of an effective internal control system and should clearly  identify related objectives and control activities or procedures. Such  documentation should allow agency officials and staff to understand the  purpose of internal control procedures and be readily available for  examination. Documentation provides a means to retain organizational  knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few  personnel. Documenting procedures is evidence that the right controls  are identified and that those procedures are capable of being  communicated to those responsible for their performance, and capable of  being monitored and evaluated.", "Comprehensive documentation to describe IDS and the collection case  selection processes was not available, and hinders managers\u2019s ability to  assure these processes are effective in addressing risks. Most of the  documents we were provided to describe IDS and the case selection  process were developed for purposes of our review or for training staff,  rather than for management and control purposes. Further, the  documentation provided contained some errors. For example, one  document showed that IDS uses statistical model results along with  business rules to make decisions on whether to route cases to either ACS  or the Field. IRS officials later told us, and our analysis of routing rules  confirmed, that IDS only uses model results in deciding whether to shelve  cases and not for deciding to which function to route them. As another  example, a different document showed that IDS routes and prioritizes  cases by using a series of business rules and predictive model scores,  which again misstated how IDS uses model scores. Also, IRS officials  later clarified that IDS actually does not prioritize cases. ACS and Field  inventory management systems accomplish this function. Other  documentation, including one 154-page document describing detailed  \u201crisking\u201d and routing rules, was very complex, using multiple acronyms  and code references. IRS officials agreed this documentation could  generally only be interpreted by employees with experience in collection  case routing and selection. We were only able to summarize the key  functions of IDS categorizing and routing (as described earlier) after  conducting a detailed review of these documents and having multiple  discussions with several IRS officials familiar with various parts of the  process. According to IRS collection officials, documents identifying and  describing IDS procedures and the case selection process are not  available because they are the result of incremental decisions and system  changes implemented over several years.", "Similarly, we did not identify any guidance on how managers are to select  high priority cases and little documentation exists as to how and why the  priority areas were established, such as analyses of data to determine or  demonstrate the relative benefits and costs of working priority areas as  compared to others. Collection officials told us that management meets  annually to determine what the priority areas should be. As described  earlier, according to collection officials, some areas like delinquent payroll  tax cases historically have been priority cases, in part, due to the  pyramiding effect of the cases and therefore the need to address them  quickly. When we asked officials how they identified GHW taxpayers as  a priority area, they said the collections program had committed to work  all such cases but could not provide additional information on why, such  as analyses for working these cases as compared to others. IRS\u2019s LB&I  division develops the list of GHW taxpayers for collection. When we  asked LB&I and collection program staff about procedures used to  develop the data and list of GHW taxpayers, the officials were not sure of  the answers and said the procedures had been in place for a few years.  They stated that they thought they could get more information by reaching  out to a recently retired person who had developed them. Program  documents show that because the retired staff person did not leave  instructions on how to develop the list, new staff had to recreate the  process.", "Without adequate documentation, it is difficult to determine whether the  collection\u2019s case selection procedures are effective in supporting program  objectives. For example, IDS decisions on shelving or routing a case to  either ACS or the Field could have important implications for whether and  when a debt will be collected (timeliness of collection or compliance) and  IRS\u2019s costs (efficiency). According to IRS data, noted earlier, the costs for  sending cases to ACS versus the Field are significant. Similarly, routing to  either ACS or the Field could affect how long it takes IRS to resolve a  case, which could affect the collection result. A lack of documented  procedures also increases the risk that they will be consistently applied.  This is important, for example, when considering the seven priority areas.  Without documented procedures for how to select cases manually when  goals are not being met, IRS risks ensuring fair selection to all taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Does Not Regularly Monitor the Effectiveness of Collection Routing Rules and Has Not Reevaluated Dollar Thresholds Used to Identify High Priority Cases", "paragraphs": ["According to internal control standards, program managers should have a  strategy and establish procedures to continually monitor and assure the  effectiveness of its control activities. This strategy should trigger separate  evaluations whenever monitoring identifies problems or improvement  opportunities.", "Although evaluations have been conducted from time to time, IRS does  not have procedures to periodically monitor IDS categorization and  routing rules, such as reevaluating dollar thresholds used for categorizing  some cases as high priority and routing cases to one collections function  instead of another (e.g., ACS versus the Field). IRS does not have any  documentation showing when many rules were established, the rationales  for them, or data supporting them because, according to IRS officials,  most of the rules were established years before IRS starting keeping such  records in 2009. Knowing the rules\u2019s rationales would help managers  evaluate the rules\u2019s effectiveness. Most rules used to route or designate  cases as high priority rely primarily upon tests of the dollar amount owed.  But, IRS documentation does not show the rationale for using a specific  dollar amount or any data to support the selection of the dollar amount.  IRS has about 60 rules to categorize cases as high risk and more than  half of these rules use the same dollar threshold. This same dollar  amount is used to determine whether the case is high risk regardless of  the type of tax owed; the amount owed is an actual current amount due or  a previous amount from a prior return; or IRS has estimated an amount a  taxpayer earned using third-party data.", "Our prior reports indicate that the dollar thresholds IRS uses to classify  some individual nonfilers as \u201chigh income\u201d are the same as they were 20  years ago. Our analysis of IRS Statistics of Income information  concluded only 5 percent of individual taxpayers had adjusted gross  incomes that exceeded this threshold about 20 years ago. By contrast, in  2012 (the most recent data available), 14 percent of taxpayers had  adjusted gross incomes exceeding the threshold. Assuming that  nonfiling rates for \u201chigh income\u201d taxpayers have remained constant, more  nonfilers\u2019s incomes would be exceeding this dollar threshold as overall  taxpayer incomes increased over time.", "IRS officials were unable to provide analyses or justification on why the  threshold was chosen, as opposed to a higher or lower amount. IRS  officials told us they did not have documented rationales for thresholds in  most cases because many routing rules were established long ago.  Officials said that, rather than focusing on evaluating the rules, IRS had  decided to dedicate its limited resources to improving other aspects of its  case selection processes, such as modeling.", "IRS has evaluated business rules on an ad-hoc basis. For example, as  previously noted, a 2010 study of IRS collections evaluated the routing  rules being used to split the assignment of delinquent payroll tax cases  between ACS and the Field. The study estimated that about 1 million  delinquent payroll tax modules (with a total amount owed of $8 billion)  were sitting in the Field queue and not being worked. The study  recommended that the dollar threshold used to assign payroll tax cases to  collections functions be adjusted so that more cases would be sent to  ACS instead of the Field.", "If the rules are not periodically evaluated, over time they could lose their  value and usefulness. Moreover, without adjusting the thresholds, more  and more cases are selected, increasing collection\u2019s already very large  workload. We previously recommended that Congress require IRS to  regularly adjust the dollar amounts of penalties for taxpayer  noncompliance. We found that because IRS penalty amounts had not  been adjusted for decades in some cases, the real value of the fixed  dollar amounts of penalties has decreased. We also reported that not  adjusting these penalties for inflation could lead to inconsistent treatment  of otherwise equal taxpayers over time because taxpayers penalized  when the amounts were set could effectively pay a higher penalty than  those with the same noncompliance pay years later. Since we made our  recommendation, IRS has indexed almost all of the penalties to inflation.", "Another risk is that without systematic monitoring, collection procedures  could result in unnecessary costs or missed collections. Given increases  in taxpayer incomes and taxpayer debts over time, it is likely that more  delinquent taxpayer accounts are exceeding the unchanged dollar  amount limits and, as a result, being prioritized within IRS collections  processes regardless of whether their cases are truly high risk.

We interviewed IRS headquarters managers  in the offices of Enterprise Collection Strategy, Campus Compliance  Services, and Field Collection. To better understand background and  context for these processes, we reviewed information on the processes  ACS and the Field use to prioritize cases for selection. To better  understand processes results, we reviewed general program  management documents, including regular management reports on IRS\u2019s  collections operations for fiscal years 2009 through 2014. We also  reviewed Collections Pipeline Reports (CPR) and Monthly Monitoring  Report (MMR) data on the inflows and outflows of collections inventory,  as well as data on collections workforce levels (full-time equivalents).  Most of the CPR and MMR data that we used in this report were originally  from IRS Collection Activity Reports (CAR). We previously used CAR  data to report on the IRS notice phase process in 2009. At that time, we  interviewed IRS officials with knowledge about CAR data about the steps  taken to ensure data accuracy. We determined that the CAR data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. The CPR also contained data  prepared by the IRS Chief Financial Officer on the sources of assessment  in potentially collectible inventory (PCI). We compared the PCI data to  data from other collection reports and interviewed IRS officials  knowledgeable about the PCI source of assessment data. We reviewed  information on the Inventory Delivery System (IDS) and its various  functions that prioritize and route cases to include functions that either  exclude or include cases from potential selection by ACS or the Field,  affect potential IRS costs (as in the costs to route a case to use ACS  versus Field resources), or reflect how ACS and the Field rank order  cases for selection. Our review of available documents on IDS and  discussions with program officials focused on the various factors IDS  takes into account in deciding how to prioritize and route cases. We  reviewed IRS documents describing the factors considered in routing and  flowcharts illustrating how cases can flow from IDS to ACS and the Field,  or be shelved and not actively pursued further.
