DOD's information security program is decentralized to the DOD component level, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)), the DOD office responsible for DOD's information security program, has limited involvement with, or oversight of, components' information security programs. While some DOD components and their subordinate commands appear to manage effective programs, GAO identified weaknesses in others in the areas of classification management training, self-inspections, and classification guides. For example, training at 9 of the 19 components and subordinate commands reviewed did not cover fundamental classification management principles, such as how to properly mark classified information or the process for determining the duration of classification. Also, OUSD(I) does not have a process to confirm whether self-inspections have been performed or to evaluate their quality. Only 8 of the 19 components performed self-inspections. GAO also found that some of the DOD components and subordinate commands that were examined routinely do not submit copies of their security classification guides, documentation that identifies which information needs protection and the reason for classification, to a central library as required. Some did not track their classification guides to ensure they were reviewed at least every 5 years for currency as required. Because of the lack of oversight and weaknesses in training, self-inspection, and security classification guide management, the Secretary of Defense cannot be assured that the information security program is effectively limiting the risk of misclassification across the department. GAO's review of a nonprobability sample of 111 classified documents from five offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense shows that, within these offices, DOD personnel are not uniformly following established procedures for classifying information, to include mismarking. In a document review, GAO questioned DOD officials' classification decisions for 29--that is, 26 percent of the sample. GAO also found that 92 of the 111 documents examined (83 percent) had at least one marking error, and more than half had multiple marking errors. While the results from this review cannot be generalized across DOD, they are consistent with the weaknesses GAO found in the way DOD implements its information security program. The accuracy of DOD's classification decision estimates is questionable because of the considerable variance in how these estimates are derived across the department, and from year to year. However, beginning with the fiscal year 2005 estimates, OUSD(I) will review estimates of DOD components. This additional review could improve the accuracy of DOD's classification decision estimates if methodological inconsistencies also are reduced."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.

The  former DOD Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence  and Security testified in 2004 in a congressional hearing that she believed  the department overclassified information, and she estimated that 50  percent of information may be overclassified, to include overclassification  between the classification levels. An example would be the classifying of  information as Top Secret instead of Secret. The Director of ISOO in the  same hearing testified that information that should not be classified is  increasing, in violation of the Executive Order.

Original  classification is the initial determination that information requires  protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national  security. An original classification decision typically results in the creation  of a security classification guide, which is used by derivative classifiers  and identifies what information should be protected, at what level, and for  how long. Derivative classification is the incorporation, paraphrasing, or  generation of information in new form that is already classified, and  marking it accordingly. In 2004, 1,059 senior-level officials in DOD were  designated original classification authorities, and as such, they were the  only individuals permitted to classify information in the first instance.  But any of the more than 1.8 million DOD personnel who possess security  clearances potentially have the authority to classify derivatively.  According to DOD, less than 1 percent of the estimated 63.8 million  classification decisions the department made during fiscal years 2000  through 2004 were original; however, ultimately, original classification  decisions are the basis for 100 percent of derivative classification  decisions.", "Executive Order 12958, as amended, assigns ISOO the responsibility for  overseeing agencies\u2019 compliance with the provisions of the Executive  Order. In this capacity, ISOO (1) performs on-site inspections of agency  information security operations, (2) conducts document reviews, (3)  monitors security education and training programs, and (4) reports at least  annually to the President on the degree to which federal agencies are  complying with the Executive Order. ISOO also issued Classified National  Security Information Directive No. 1 to implement the Executive Order.  The Executive Order and the ISOO directive stipulate a number of specific  responsibilities expected of federal agencies, including DOD. Examples of  responsibilities are promulgating internal regulations; establishing and  maintaining security education and self-inspection programs; conducting  periodic declassification reviews; and committing sufficient resources to  facilitate effective information security operations. The Executive Order  and the ISOO directive also require classifiers to apply standard markings  to classified information. For example, originally classified records must  include the overall classification as well as portion or paragraph marking,  a \u201cClassified by\u201d line to identify the original classifier, a reason for  classification, and a \u201cDeclassify on\u201d date line.", "Executive Order 12958, as amended, states that information shall be  declassified when it no longer meets the standards for classification. The  point at which information generally becomes declassified is set when the  decision is made to classify, and it is either linked to the occurrence of an  event, such as the completion of a mission, or to the passage of time.  Classified records that are more than 25 years old and have permanent  historical value are automatically declassified unless an exemption is  granted because their contents could cause adverse national security  repercussions.", "The Defense Security Service Academy is responsible for providing  security training, education, and awareness to DOD components, DOD  contractors, and employees of other federal agencies and selected foreign  governments.

Agency officials attributed this dramatic drop to e-mails being  included in the totals for fiscal year 2002 and not for fiscal year 2003.", "Some DOD components and subordinate commands do not query their  entire organization, to encompass all personnel who may be classifying  information. For example, the Defense Intelligence Agency randomly  selects four of its eight directorates to participate, and the National  Security Agency and the Naval Air Systems Command selects only lower  echelon organizations that have an original classification authority. As a  result, these locations omit an unknown number of derivative  classification decisions. The Navy bases its annual estimate on data  covering a 2-week period from each of its major commands once per year  rather than from all of its commands, four times per year as suggested in  ISOO guidance. For example, during the first quarter, the Marine Corps is  queried, and during the second quarter, the fleet commands are queried.  Also, some of the combatant commands\u2019 service components are not  queried at all, such as the Army\u2019s component to the European Command,  the Navy\u2019s component to the Transportation Command, the Air Force\u2019s  component to the Southern Command, and the Marine Corps\u2019 component  to the Central Command. In commenting on a draft of this report, the  department correctly points out that guidance issued by ISOO allows each  component to decide who to include in its classification decisions  estimate.", "The Special Operations Command and the Central Command both  schedule their counts at the end of the fiscal year; 4 consecutive weeks at  the former, and 8 consecutive weeks at the latter. Special Operations  Command officials told us that the end of the fiscal year tends to be a  slower operational period, thereby allowing more time to conduct the data  collection.", "DOD components and subordinate commands convert their estimates in  different ways to project an entire year. Those that conform to the  suggested ISOO format of four 2-week counting periods a year (that is, 8  weeks) multiply their counts by 6.5 (that is, 8 weeks x 6.5 = 52 weeks). The  Navy, however, multiplies each of its four separate counts by 429 to  account for all of the lower echelon units not represented in the estimate.", "Our review of DOD\u2019s submissions to ISOO of its estimated number of  classification decisions for fiscal years 2000 through 2004, revealed several  anomalies. For example, the National Reconnaissance Office reported  making more than 6 million derivative and zero original classification  decisions during this 5-year period, and the Marine Forces, Atlantic,  reported zero derivative and zero original classification decisions during  fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Subsequent conversations with Marine Forces,  Atlantic, officials indicated that a misunderstanding as to what constitutes  a derivative classification decision resulted in an underreporting for those  2 years.", "Other examples of DOD component data submissions during this 5-year  time period that had either a disproportionate reporting of original versus  derivative classification decisions or a significant change in counts from 1  year to the next include:    DOD reported in fiscal year 2004 that, departmentwide, about 4 percent  of its classification decisions were original, yet the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency and the Joint Forces Command both  reported that more than 70 percent of their classification decisions  were original.", "DOD reported in fiscal year 2003, that departmentwide, less than 2  percent of its classification decisions were original, yet the Joint Staff  and the European Command both reported more than 50 percent of  their classification decisions were original.", "DOD reported in fiscal year 2002 that, departmentwide, less than 1  percent of its classification decisions were original, yet the Office of  the Secretary of Defense and the Southern Command both reported  more than 20 percent of their classification decisions were original.", "DOD reported an increase in the number of original classification  decisions during the fiscal year 2002 through 2004 period, from 37,320  to 47,238 (about a 27 percent increase), to 198,354 (about a 300 percent  increase). However, during this same 3-year period, the Navy\u2019s trend  for original classification decisions was from 1,628 to 16,938 (about a  900 percent increase) to 1,898 (about a 90 percent decrease); and the  Army\u2019s trend was from 10,417 to 2,056 (about an 80 percent decrease)  to 133,791 (about a 6,400 percent increase).", "DOD reported a 75 percent decrease in the total number of classification  decisions (that is, original and derivative) from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal  year 2004, yet several DOD components reported a significant increase in  overall classification decisions during this same time period, including the  Defense Threat Reduction Agency (a 20,107 percent increase), the  Southern Command (1,998 percent increase), Defense Intelligence Agency  (a 1,202 percent increase), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency (a 354 percent increase).", "OUSD(I) has decided to discontinue the practice of DOD components  submitting their classification decisions estimates directly to ISOO.  Beginning with the fiscal year 2005 estimates, OUSD(I) will scrutinize the  classification decision estimates of its components before consolidating  and submitting them to ISOO.

However, these officials told us that they are less  likely to meet the target date of 2009 for reviewing records referred to  them, and of 2011 for reviewing special media (such as audio and video  recordings). DOD\u2019s ability to satisfy the 2009 and 2011 target dates  depends, to a great extent, on the actions of other federal agencies.", "We limited our review of DOD\u2019s automatic declassification program to the  four military services because, as figure 3 shows, they performed 85  percent of all the declassification within DOD in fiscal year 2004.", "Executive Order 12958, as amended, stipulates that on December 31, 2006,  and on December 31 of every year thereafter, classified records that are  (1) at least 25 years old and (2) of permanent historical value shall in  general be automatically declassified, whether or not they have been  reviewed. The Executive Order sets a record\u2019s date of origination as the  time of original classification, and it also exempts certain types of  information from automatic declassification, such as information related  to the application of intelligence sources and methods. The automatic  declassification deadline for records containing information classified by  more than one agency, such as the Army and the Air Force or the Army  and the Central Intelligence Agency, is December 31, 2009, and for special  media it is December 31, 2011. For the most part, only the originating  agency can declassify its own information. Consequently, if the Army  discovers classified information that was originated by the U.S. State  Department, the Army must alert the State Department and refer the  information to the State Department for resolution. The Executive Order  describes special media as microforms, motion pictures, audiotapes,  videotapes, or comparable media that make its review for possible  declassification exemptions \u201cmore difficult or costly.\u201d The ISOO directive  mirrors these requirements and directs ISOO, in conjunction with its  parent organization, the National Archives and Records Administration,  and other concerned agencies to develop a standardized process for  referring records containing information classified by more than one  agency across the federal government.", "Army, Navy/Marine Corps, and Air Force classification officials told us  that they face a variety of challenges impacting their ability to meet the  target dates of 2009 for reviewing records referred to them, and of 2011 for  reviewing special media. Based on information provided by officials from  the military services and the National Archives and Records  Administration who are responsible for the automatic declassification  effort, it appears that three obstacles hinder their progress toward meeting  these deadlines. DOD\u2019s ability to remove these obstacles without the  involvement of other federal agencies is limited. First, there is no federal  government standard for annotating classified records that contain  information classified by more than one agency. For example, two non- DOD agencies both annotate their records with a \u201cD\u201d and an \u201cR,\u201d but for  opposite purposes. That is, one of the agencies uses a \u201cD\u201d to denote \u201cdeny  automatic declassification\u201d and an \u201cR\u201d to denote \u201crelease,\u201d while the other  agency uses a \u201cD\u201d to denote \u201cdeclassify\u201d and an \u201cR\u201d to denote \u201cretain.\u201d The  National Archives and Records Administration and various interagency  working groups and task forces have sought a federal government  standard, but National Archives officials told us that they were not  optimistic that agencies would reach agreement soon. According to these  officials, the lack of a federal government standard has contributed to the  inadvertent release of classified information.", "Second, there is no central location within DOD or the federal government  for storing records eligible for automatic declassification that contain  information classified by multiple DOD components or non-DOD agencies.  To review records originated by the four military services, agencies must  send personnel trained to evaluate information for declassification  suitability to as many as 14 different sites where the records are stored.  For example, the Air Force has records eligible for automatic  declassification at storage sites located in Ohio, Alabama, and Texas (see  figure 4). National Archives officials pointed out that consolidating the  records at fewer sites may be more efficient, and likely more cost- effective.", "A third factor that may cause DOD to miss meeting the Executive Order  deadlines is the lack of a common database that federal government  agencies can use to track the status of records containing information  classified by more than one agency. The ISOO directive allows federal  government agencies to utilize electronic databases to notify other  agencies of their referrals; however, agencies have created their own  databases that operate independently of one another. In commenting on a  draft of this report, DOD officials stated that, despite the lack of federal  government standards, the department has been a leading proponent of  working collaboratively with other federal agencies to meet automatic  declassification deadlines. We cannot confirm the accuracy of DOD\u2019s  characterization because DOD\u2019s relationship with other agencies involved  in automatic declassification was not part of our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence has delegated the  execution and oversight of information security to the DOD component  level. This decentralized approach, coupled with inconsistency in the  implementation of components\u2019 information security programs, has  resulted in wide variance in the quality of these programs. For example,  the OUSD(I) does not directly monitor components\u2019 compliance with  federal and DOD training, self-inspection, and documentation  requirements stipulated in Executive Order 12958, as amended; the ISOO  directive; and the DOD regulation. Inadequate classification management  training, self-inspections, and security classification guide documentation  among the various DOD components increase the risk of (1) poor  classification decisions and marking errors, similar to what we observed in  our OSD document review; (2) restricting access to information that does  not pose a threat to national security; and (3) releasing information to the  general public that should still be safeguarded.", "OUSD(I) oversight could reduce the likelihood of classification errors. For  example, if OUSD(I) ensured that components evaluated the quality and  effectiveness of training and periodically included document reviews in  their self-inspections, prevalent classification errors could be addressed  through annual refresher training that derivative classifiers complete.  Evaluating the quality of training can assist components in targeting scarce  resources on coursework that promotes learning and reduces  misclassification. Although the results of our review of a sample of OSD  documents cannot be generalized departmentwide, we believe these  results coupled with the weaknesses in training, self-inspections, and  documentation that we found at numerous components and subordinate  commands increases the likelihood that documents are not being  classified in accordance with established procedures.", "DOD\u2019s estimate of how many original and derivative classification  decisions it makes annually is unreliable because it is based on data from  the DOD components that were derived using different assumptions about  what should be included and about data collection and estimating  techniques. Still, this estimate is reported to the President and to the  public, and it is routinely cited in congressional testimony by DOD  officials and freedom of information advocates as authoritative. During  our review, OUSD(I) decided to resume its practice of reviewing  components\u2019 classification estimates before they are submitted to ISOO. If  properly implemented, this review could improve data reliability to some  extent, but only if it addresses the underlying lack of uniformity in how the  individual DOD components are collecting and manipulating their data to  arrive at their estimates.", "The automatic declassification provision in Executive Order 12958, as  amended, requires agencies generally to declassify records that are 25  years old or more and that no longer require protection. The Army,  Navy/Marine Corps, and Air Force reported they are on track to review all  of the documents they classified before the deadline; however, they are  less likely to complete their review of the untold number of records  containing information classified by other DOD components and non-DOD  agencies by the deadlines set in the Executive Order. As the deadlines pass  and these records are automatically declassified, information that could  still contain national security information becomes more vulnerable to  disclosure. DOD\u2019s ability to meet these deadlines is jeopardized both by  conditions beyond and conditions within its direct control. For example,  DOD cannot require non-DOD agencies to adopt a national standard for  annotating classified records, but it can take action to streamline the  process of reviewing records containing information classified by more  than one DOD component."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the risk of misclassification and create greater accountability  across the department, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence to    establish a centralized oversight process for monitoring components\u2019  information security programs to ensure that they satisfy federal and  DOD requirements. This oversight could include requiring components  to report on the results of self-inspections or other actions, targeted  document reviews, and/or reviews by the DOD Inspector General and  component audit agencies.  to issue a revised Information Security Program regulation to ensure  that  those personnel who are authorized to and who actually perform  classification actions, receive training that covers the fundamental  classification principles as defined in the Under Secretary\u2019s  memorandum of November 30, 2004 and that completion of such  training is a prerequisite for these personnel to exercise this  authority; the frequency, applicability, and coverage of self-inspections, and  the reporting of inspection results are based on explicit criteria; and   authorized individuals can access up-to-date security classification  guides necessary to derivatively classify information accurately.", "To support informed decision making with regard to information security,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence to institute quality assurance measures to ensure  that components implement consistently the DOD guidance on estimating  the number of classification decisions, thereby increasing the accuracy  and reliability of these estimates.", "To assist DOD in its efforts to meet automatic declassification deadlines,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence to evaluate the merits of consolidating records  eligible for automatic declassification that contain information classified  by multiple DOD components at fewer than the current 14 geographically  dispersed sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with all six  recommendations; however, the department expressed concern that we  did not accurately portray the Navy\u2019s program for managing its security  classification guides.

We  disagree with the department\u2019s assertion that the Navy is tracking its  classification guides to ensure that they are reviewed at least once every 5  years for currency and are updated accordingly. Based on our discussions  with Navy information security officials, including the Retrieval and  Analysis of Navy (K)lassified Information (RANKIN) Program Manager,  and observing a demonstration of the spreadsheet used to catalog security  classification guide holdings, we saw no evidence to suggest that currency  of guides is being systematically tracked. With respect to our fifth  recommendation that focuses on how DOD estimates the number of  classification decisions it makes each year, we endorsed the department\u2019s  decision to continue scrutinizing its components\u2019 estimates before  consolidating and submitting them to ISOO. However, we continue to  believe that OUSD(I) should augment its after-the-fact review with  measures to ensure that components follow a similar process to derive  their classification decisions estimates, such as standardizing the types of  records to be included.
