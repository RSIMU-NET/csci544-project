For projects selected in the first round of competition, repayment was to come from (1) any net revenues generated from continued project operations and (2) revenues accruing from the commercial sale, lease, manufacture, licensing, or use of the technology. During rounds two and three, DOE changed the repayment provisions to respond to the industry\u2019s concerns and lessen the likelihood that the repayment requirements could hamper the project participants\u2019 competitiveness. Among other things, DOE (1) excluded net operating revenues as a required source of repayment, (2) reduced the percentage of revenues from technology sales that are subject to repayment, (3) excluded foreign sales from repayment, (4) eliminated an inflation adjustment requirement, (5) allowed a grace period before repayment begins to facilitate the technology\u2019s initial market penetration, and (6) provided for a waiver from repayment altogether if repayment would place the participants at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.", "According to DOE officials, three clean coal projects with a federal investment of about $36.2 million have progressed to the repayment phase.

DOE provides up to 50 percent of the funding for projects carried out with industry, and industry provides the balance. According to DOE, in 1986 when this program was begun, repayment was not considered because the main objective was to reduce the licensing and regulatory impediments that were contributing to extensive delays in the construction and permitting of nuclear power generating facilities. The objective evolved into a certification of advanced light water reactor designs to help restore the industry\u2019s confidence and reduce the financial risks in acquiring new nuclear plants at the appropriate time in the future. The repayment provisions covering domestic or foreign sales have been incorporated into two programs that are part of the Advanced Light Water Reactor Program.", "In one of these programs\u2014the advanced reactor design certification program\u2014the Congress provided $14 million in additional funding for a specific contract, and an appropriations report recommended that this additional federal cost should be repaid from royalties on the first commercial sale of the reactor design. DOE will require repayment of this amount. DOE subsequently agreed to provide another $11 million in additional funding and may require that this amount be repaid, as well as any additional future funding provided under this contract. DOE\u2019s original contractual commitment of about $50 million is not subject to repayment. According to DOE officials, the Department also may provide for the recovery of any federal contributions in excess of the original $50 million commitment under another contract in the advanced reactor design certification program.", "The other program\u2014the \u201cfirst-of-a-kind\u201d engineering program\u2014involves a cooperative agreement between DOE and the Advanced Reactor Corporation. According to DOE, in the development of this program, the participating electric generating utilities made a major commitment to provide cost-share funding and overall direction and technical advice to achieve a plant design that they would be willing to acquire at some future time. Because of their direct, substantial contributions to the plant designs, the utilities require reactor vendors to pay them royalties from the sale of the plant designs or technology to other customers. Since the utilities were going to require royalty payments, DOE decided to also require royalties proportionate to its share of the project\u2019s total costs. The cooperative agreement requires that DOE be repaid up to its total investment from the revenues received by the Advanced Reactor Corporation from the sale or use of the plant designs or technology developed under this program.

The main advantage is the recovery of the federal investment. We believe that many of the disadvantages and arguments against repayment can be mitigated by structuring a flexible policy that provides criteria and factors to consider in determining the application of repayment to individual programs or projects.", "In 1991, DOE considered having a Department-wide policy to recover its investment in technology development projects and even developed a draft order with criteria and guidelines for determining when repayment is appropriate. But due to substantial opposition within the Department and the departure of the Deputy Secretary who was the primary supporter of this concept, the order was never implemented."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Advantages", "paragraphs": ["The primary advantage of a repayment policy is that the government could recover some of its investment in the development of technologies. According to several DOE officials, a repayment requirement could also provide more assurance that the project proposals are sound and economically viable by discouraging proposals that are too marginal financially for their sponsors to commit to repayment.", "As previously mentioned, the DOE offices in our review are funding projects with industry that are expected to cost more than $15 billion by the time they are completed. DOE\u2019s share of the planned funding is expected to total about $8 billion, and the nonfederal share about $7 billion, as shown in table 1. About $2.5 billion of the $8 billion is subject to repayment.", "Except for the projects within the four programs that already require repayment, it is important to note that, for a variety of reasons discussed later, not all of the projects contained in the table would lend themselves to repayment. In addition, unless follow-on projects are undertaken, requiring new or amended contracts or cooperative agreements, only new projects not yet negotiated with industry would be appropriate for repayment.", "While the potential repayment is difficult to quantify, DOE documents developed when the 1991 draft repayment policy statement was under consideration indicated that the potential is substantial. To illustrate the potential for repayment, we subtracted the approximately $2.5 billion in federal funding included in table 1 for projects already covered by repayment provisions from the approximately $8 billion total planned federal funding. The remaining cooperative agreements and contracts amount to about $5.5 billion. If one assumes that only 50 percent of this amount is dedicated to projects that would lend themselves to repayment, and that about 15 percent of research and development funds result in commercialized technologies (which DOE officials say is about average), then about $400 million could come back to the federal government in the form of repayment.", "In discussing technology development programs and projects with DOE\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretaries and other DOE officials, many of them agreed that certain types of projects might be appropriate candidates for repayment of the federal investment if the concept was employed at the beginning of the projects or new projects are undertaken in the future. The officials generally indicated that repayment should be more applicable to projects with a large federal investment where the federal contribution is easily identified, projects involving technologies that are close to commercialization, and projects in which the federal investment serves to reduce the costs and risks of providing the technology to potential users. The officials also said that technologies that have a large potential market and technologies that are likely to be commercialized in foreign countries are good candidates for requiring repayment of the federal investment. Some officials said that repayment should be directed at projects that have large, well-financed industry teams.", "DOE officials indicated, for example, that the Reservoir Class Field Demonstration Program might be appropriate for repayment if future projects are undertaken. This program shares costs for demonstrations of existing and new technologies for increasing production from U.S. oil fields that might otherwise be prematurely abandoned. The program operates on the premise that the characteristics of some oil formations are similar, and when small and major oil producers demonstrate technologies and processes that are successful in increasing production, other oil field operators may want to try them in their fields. Three rounds of demonstration projects have been undertaken, and more may be undertaken if funding becomes available. DOE has committed about $100 million to the 29 projects that are currently in the program. According to DOE, the projects may take from 3 to 7 years to complete.", "The Advanced Turbine Systems Program is another program that DOE officials said might be appropriate for repayment if new projects are begun or current projects are amended. This program is intended to develop more efficient, advanced turbine systems for both utility and industrial electric power generation. According to DOE, the program is expected to cost about $700 million by the time it is completed in the year 2000. Depending on appropriations, DOE is planning to fund about $450 million of the total estimated cost, and industry participants are expected to fund the balance.", "New cost-shared technology demonstration and commercial application programs authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 would also be appropriate candidates for repayment if they are funded. In fact, the act requires DOE to establish procedures and criteria for the repayment of the federal investment in several authorized coal projects, but they have not been funded.", "Many of the DOE officials we spoke with generally indicated a willingness to consider repayment, but they said that flexibility should exist to be able to structure or waive repayment to meet programmatic needs. Some officials believed that repayment may not be suitable for grants, universities, and small businesses or for projects that are directed at basic research. Others indicated that repayment should be waived if the federal investment is considered disproportionately small in comparison with the potential costs of administering the repayment process. Some DOE officials said that a stronger argument can be made for repayment if the technology developed is likely to be commercialized outside of the United States.", "Appendix I provides a more detailed discussion of the types of projects that DOE officials believe would be the most appropriate or suitable for repaying the federal investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disadvantages", "paragraphs": ["DOE officials we spoke with and DOE\u2019s 1991 draft document on repayment policy also pointed out several disadvantages to the government or industry participants that would need to be addressed. These disadvantages, along with potential ways to structure repayment so as to mitigate the disadvantages, are discussed below.", "According to DOE, most technologies funded by the Department require further development and/or funding to bring them to the marketplace after DOE\u2019s participation is complete. Some DOE officials believe that repayment could lower industry\u2019s rate of return on investment and discourage industry, especially small businesses, from commercializing such technologies. The officials also believe that repayment might discourage industry from participating in cost-shared technology development projects in technological areas that DOE wants to promote. In our October 1991 report, we recommended that DOE study the effect that repayment provisions have had on the industry\u2019s participation in the Clean Coal Technology Program. DOE agreed to do this but has not completed its study. Although a repayment requirement might have some influence on the timing of commercialization or participation in technology development projects, industry participants would not have to repay the federal investment unless the technology is commercialized. Therefore, repayment should be more favorable to industry than other sources of funding, such as a bank loan, which would have to be repaid with interest regardless of whether the technology is commercialized. According to a former DOE Deputy Secretary who supported the expansion of repayment programs, businesses expect some form of repayment as a normal cost of doing business.", "DOE officials generally believe that repayment would create an administrative burden in negotiating, administering, auditing, and enforcing cost-sharing and repayment agreements. Both DOE and industry participants would need to establish a recordkeeping system for tracking the sales and use of technologies long after a project ends (up to 20 years in three of the programs that require repayment). According to DOE, the administrative and auditing costs may not make it worthwhile to pursue repayment. We believe one way of making the administrative burden less onerous and minimizing auditing requirements might be to require sample audits of industry participants\u2019 records. Another approach might be to require repayment only in those instances in which the amount of the return justifies the cost of necessary audits and other internal control measures. DOE officials indicated that they are studying the issue of ensuring proper repayment in the Clean Coal Technology Program.", "Many DOE officials believe that obtaining increased cost-sharing by industry is preferable to requiring repayment of the federal investment. Some indicated that a repayment requirement could be used as a negotiating tool to obtain higher cost-sharing in lieu of repayment. The officials also argue that it may be better in terms of conserving federal resources to obtain an increased cost-share from all participants than to obtain repayment only from those successfully commercializing their technologies.", "According to DOE, any repayment provisions must consider the effect of repayment on the ability of the entity carrying out the project to compete in the marketplace (proceed with commercialization of the technology and achieve a rate of return commensurate with the industry and the risk). DOE believes that if repayment obligations are too demanding, especially in the early years of technology sales, cash flows and profitability may not be sufficient for the organization responsible for repayment to remain in business, or licensing fees and costs may be too high for the technology to remain competitive with alternative technologies. We believe one way of mitigating this concern could be to allow a grace period after a project ends before requiring repayment to begin, as was done in two of the programs discussed above that require repayment. A grace period could be based on a specified period of elapsed time or a specified number of technology units sold before repayment begins."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Related Issue", "paragraphs": ["Another issue is the disposition or use of the proceeds resulting from repayment. Many DOE officials indicated that any proceeds from repayment programs should flow back into the applicable program to leverage the federal funding that would be available for ongoing and future projects, rather than be deposited in the Treasury, which is the current practice. Under current policy, proceeds are available to either reduce the budget deficit or to be reallocated on the basis of national priorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While we do not believe that cost recovery should be a major objective, opportunities may exist for substantial recovery of taxpayers\u2019 dollars if DOE would adopt a policy to require repayment of its investment in successfully commercialized technologies. However, a repayment policy would need to be structured with enough flexibility so as not to interfere with program objectives or adversely affect industry\u2019s participation in projects and technology commercialization. Such a policy should provide criteria and factors to consider in determining whether it should be applied to individual programs or projects. A properly structured policy could provide the flexibility needed to mitigate many of the arguments against having a policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Energy develop and implement a Department-wide policy for requiring repayment of the federal investment in successfully commercialized cost-shared technologies.

DOE said that it concurred with our conclusion that cost recovery should not be a major objective of a federal technology development program but pointed out that in its experience, there are individual projects and programs for which repayment provisions can work. DOE said that demonstration programs that are well advanced in the research and development pipeline are the most likely candidates for repayment. According to DOE, however, the real payback to the nation is in the societal benefits that flow out of federally funded research and development, including jobs, competitiveness in world markets for U.S. companies, and the resulting contributions to the U.S. economy of both domestic and export technology sales. We agree that these potential benefits are very important, but they are independent of the argument for recovering the taxpayers\u2019 share of investment in successfully commercialized technologies. If repayment under appropriate circumstances was an ancillary requirement for successfully commercialized technologies, it would allow the government to potentially recover some of its investment in technologies as well as enjoy the other positive benefits that might accrue.", "In the case of environmental cleanup technologies, DOE said that the payback is in the form of cost avoidance to the government through the use of innovative technologies that reduce the cost of cleaning up the contaminated weapons complex. We recognized this major benefit in our draft report. However, we continue to believe that if such technologies have potential commercial application, new projects demonstrating the technologies should be considered for repayment of the federal investment.", "DOE said that it agreed with our recommendation that a repayment policy should provide the flexibility for determining which programs and projects are appropriate for repayment.

The planned funding for light water reactors is shown in table I.4 The overall program involves three major components: a design certification program for advanced reactors, a first-of-a-kind engineering program for advanced reactors, and a program to extend the life of aging commercial nuclear powerplants. Four cost-shared projects are being funded under separate contracts to design, test, and obtain Nuclear Regulatory Commission certification of advanced reactor designs. Two other projects are being funded under a cooperative agreement to develop the detailed engineering design of two advanced reactors in order to promote commercial standardization, produce reliable construction schedules and cost estimates, and facilitate construction preparations. Additional projects are developing technologies for assessing material degradation of systems and components at operating nuclear powerplants.", "As previously discussed, DOE may require repayment of any additional federal funds provided in excess of $50 million under two of the contracts in the design certification program. According to DOE, the contractors have agreed to this arrangement. DOE requires repayment of its total investment under the cooperative agreement in the first-of-a-kind engineering program. DOE officials said that they were also looking for opportunities for DOE to share in any patents that may be developed based on technologies developed under the commercial operating reactors program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Energy\u2019s letter dated May 24, 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The issues raised in DOE\u2019s letter are addressed in the agency comments section of our report. The issues in the enclosure to DOE\u2019s letter are addressed below. 2. Our report points out that the costs of administering, auditing, and enforcing repayment agreements should be considered in determining whether to pursue repayment on specific projects. In fact, we suggested that DOE should only require repayment in those instances where the amount of the potential return justifies the cost of necessary audits and other internal control measures. We also pointed out that there may be ways to reduce the cost of such control measures, but it was beyond the scope of this review to design such measures. Once cost-effective control measures are developed, DOE could then address the related costs on a case-by-case basis in determining whether to apply repayment to specific projects. 3. Our hypothetical example of potential repayment if future projects are funded at the level planned for active projects is for illustrative purposes only. We included an assumption that half of the projects may not lend themselves to repayment. Projects in which the potential costs of obtaining repayment would exceed the potential benefits would fall in this category, along with projects that are too early in the technology development process to lend themselves to repayment.", "We disagree with DOE\u2019s comment that our report does not sufficiently elaborate on the tradeoffs between up-front cost-sharing and downstream repayments if the technologies are commercialized. We pointed out that DOE generally prefers to have increased industry cost-sharing, and that some DOE officials believe that it may be better to obtain increased cost-sharing from all participants than to obtain repayment only from those that successfully commercialize their technologies. We believe that even with increased industry cost-sharing, however, an argument can be made that taxpayers have an interest in the repayment of taxpayers\u2019 dollars when technologies developed with federal funds are successfully commercialized.

We also talked with several DOE attorneys, an official of DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General, and a former congressional subcommittee staff member who had been responsible for appropriations for many DOE technology development programs.", "To identify advantages and disadvantages of having or not having a repayment policy, we interviewed many DOE officials involved in administering cost-shared technology development and demonstration programs, including several Deputy Assistant Secretaries; DOE policy officials and attorneys; and a former Deputy Secretary of DOE and his former Executive Assistant. We also reviewed DOE reports and other documents that discussed the advantages and disadvantages of a repayment policy, including DOE files relating to a 1991 draft repayment policy that was never implemented.", "To obtain a perspective on DOE\u2019s investment in technology development projects, we asked DOE to provide us with information on the estimated total federal and nonfederal funding planned for active cost-shared technology development projects funded under contracts and cooperative agreements. We focused on the major organizational areas of DOE that fund most of the Department\u2019s cost-shared technology development projects involving contracts and cooperative agreements\u2014Fossil Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Environmental Management, and Nuclear Energy\u2014and we asked DOE to exclude any projects involving grants and basic research.
