The  1998 terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,  which killed more than 220 people and injured 4,000, highlighted the  compelling need for safe and secure overseas facilities.  Following the  bombings, three high-level independent groups cited physical security  problems at numerous overseas facilities.  In November 1999, one of these  groups, the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel, said that thousands of  Americans representing our nation abroad faced an unacceptable level of  risk from terrorist attacks and other threats.

Our observations are based  on an analysis of data from the State Department\u2019s Bureaus of Diplomatic  Security, Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), and Information  Resources Management, and our visits last month to four posts where we  examined how facility conditions affect security risks and mission  effectiveness.  For security reasons, I will not be identifying these posts.   Finally, I will discuss some preliminary observations regarding State\u2019s  efforts to improve facility conditions by replacing existing buildings with  new, secure embassy compounds.

About 50 government agencies and subagencies  operate overseas, including the Departments of State, Defense, and  Justice; and the U.S. Agency for International Development.", "Since the 1970s, U.S. diplomatic personnel overseas have been  increasingly at risk from terrorist attacks and other acts of violence.  In  response, the State Department in 1986 began a substantial embassy  construction program, known as the Inman program, to protect U.S.  personnel and facilities.  In 1991, we reported that State was unable to  complete as many projects as originally planned due to systemic  weaknesses in program management, as well as subsequent funding  limitations.  This construction program suffered from delays and cost  increases due to, among other things, poor program planning, difficulties  in acquiring sites, changes in security requirements, and inadequate  contractor performance.  Following the demise of the Inman program in  the early 1990s, the State Department initiated very few new construction  projects until the Africa embassy bombings in August 1998 prompted  additional funding.", "In the 1998 bombings, terrorists attacked the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,  Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  These large-scale truck bombings  killed more than 220 people, including 12 American U.S. government  employees and family members, 32 Kenyan national U.S. government  employees, and 8 Tanzanian national U.S. government employees.

Figures 1 and 2 show pictures of the embassy in Tanzania  before and after the bombings.", "Since these embassy bombings, U.S. facilities and personnel have faced  continued threats from terrorist and other attacks.  Embassy and  consulate employees are on the front lines, often serving in dangerous  locations, and must rely heavily on the protection provided by the law  enforcement and security measures of the foreign country in which they  are located.  From 1998 through 2002, there were 30 terrorist attacks  against overseas posts, personnel, and diplomatic residences.  During that  same period, overseas posts were forced to evacuate personnel or suspend  operations 83 times in response to direct threats or unstable security  situations in the host country.  (See table 1.)  During the first 2 months of  2003, overseas posts authorized the departures of personnel and/or their  families a total of 11 times due to security concerns."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Security Standards", "paragraphs": ["Before I discuss the results of our work, I want to explain some of State\u2019s  security standards and why they are important.  State identified five key  security standards for overseas diplomatic office facilities to protect them  against terrorism and other dangers.  First, State believes that office  facilities should be at least 100 feet from uncontrolled areas, such as a  street where vehicles can pass without first being checked by security  officials.  Therefore, this distance helps to protect the buildings and  occupants against bomb blasts, mob attacks, and other threats.  In  establishing the setback standard, the State Department determined that at  100 feet, the effects of a bomb blast have diminished to the point where  the cost of site acquisition and construction to protect against the  remaining blast effects are relatively affordable.  State notes that  additional setback may not be practical at many locations.  Exhibit 1 is a  video clip from the State Department showing a test blast from 100 feet  away.", "The second and third standards are strong perimeter walls and anti-ram  barriers to ensure that vehicles cannot breach the facility perimeter to get  close to the building prior to detonating a bomb.  Exhibits 2 and 3 are  video clips from the State Department showing the effectiveness of these  walls and barriers.", "The fourth standard requires blast-resistant construction techniques and  materials.  Among other things, these materials include reinforced  concrete and steel construction and blast-resistant windows.  Diplomatic  Security officials state that flying glass is a primary cause of injuries and  deaths in a blast.  Coupled with a 100-foot setback, blast-resistant  construction provides the best possible protection against a vehicle bomb  attack, according to Diplomatic Security officials.  Combined, these four  standards mitigate the effect of a vehicle bomb attack and prevent the  building from suffering catastrophic collapse and complete destruction.", "State\u2019s fifth security standard is controlled access at the perimeter to the  compound.  At this control access point, guards can screen personnel and  visitors before they enter the embassy compound to verify that they have  no weapons and that they should be allowed to enter, and can fully search  vehicles before they are permitted to enter the compound."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Has Done Much to Improve Facility Security but Most Facilities Still Do Not Meet Security Standards", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 4 years, State has accomplished much in improving posts\u2019  security through various security upgrades.  These upgrades include the  installation of Mylar shatter-resistant window film and forced  entry/ballistic-resistant doors; the construction of perimeter security walls  and fences, jersey barriers, and compound access controls; and the  stationing of additional police and security guards.  In June 2002, a bomb  attack against the U.S. consulate in Karachi demonstrated the  effectiveness of recent security upgrades to the compound.  As shown in  figure 3, physical damage to the building was minimized by these  upgrades.  As of September 30, 2002, State had completed security  upgrades at 113 posts and had installed Mylar window film barriers and  forced entry/ballistic-resistant doors at 242 posts.", "Further, to address security concerns at some of the buildings without a  100-foot setback, State has secured host government cooperation in either  closing adjacent streets and/or posting local police officers as guards to  monitor and control surrounding streets.  State has also acquired adjacent  land at 34 posts to increase setback since the 1998 embassy bombings.   For example, State purchased a gas station next to an office annex  building in Athens, Greece, and closed the gas station, thus increasing  setback and improving security.", "At all four posts we visited, we observed that recent security upgrades  have enhanced security.  At three of these posts, local authorities have  permitted closing off streets to public traffic in order to protect U.S.  facilities.  However, Diplomatic Security officials acknowledged that it is  not feasible to increase setback by acquiring land and closing off nearby  streets at many locations.  Furthermore, these officials also told us that  security upgrades were partial fixes that did not bring the buildings up to  physical security standards.  As a result, many buildings and their  occupants remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks.  Exhibit 4 is a video clip  from the State Department that illustrates this vulnerability.  It shows the  effect of a blast 100 feet away on an office that does not meet the standard  for blast-resistant construction.  The windows have been treated with  Mylar sheeting, a standard upgrade that mitigates the effects of glass  shattering in a blast.  Although Mylar provides some protection, the non- blast-resistant window construction may allow glass to be forced into the  building at a high rate of speed.", "To assess the security of embassy and consulate facilities, we analyzed  State Department data to determine if the primary facilities meet State\u2019s  five key standards that I discussed earlier.  Figure 4 shows the portion of  posts where the primary office building meets or does not meet four of the  five security standards:  setback, perimeter wall or fence, anti-ram barrier,  and compound access control.  At the request of Diplomatic Security  officials, we will not discuss details on the remaining standard, blast- resistant construction, due to its sensitivity.  We can say, however, that  facilities completed since the late 1980s are considered to be blast  resistant.  Figure 5 shows the number of primary facilities that meet one,  two, three, four, or five of the physical security standards.  For example, it  shows that the primary office facility at 81 posts met none of the five  standards.

As  shown in figure 7, one of these buildings is adjacent to a public gas station,  which could exacerbate the effects of a bomb attack.", "Another building, with little setback, is located next to a main  thoroughfare.  Consequently, public traffic, including trucks and buses,  routinely travels within feet of U.S. government office space.  At three of  the four posts we visited, the embassy had secured host government  cooperation in closing at least one street surrounding the primary office  building; however, embassy officials at one location noted that these  agreements were temporary and could be revoked at any time.  Moreover,  the embassies had not been able to close streets running next to all of their  facilities, such as office annexes.

Figure 9 depicts an  inadequate compound access control booth, which is located within the  embassy compound.  The Security Officer acknowledged that this was a  serious weakness and that visitors were not screened adequately before  entering the embassy building.  Construction of a new compound access  control system is scheduled to begin in May 2003.  Figure 10 depicts a  newly upgraded compound access control system that facilitates full  screening of all vehicles and persons prior to their gaining access to the  compound.", "Ambassadors and security officers at three of the four posts we visited  emphasized that in addition to facilities not meeting standards, there were  security difficulties associated with the number of office facilities at their  post that were spread out around the city.  Three of the four posts we  visited had more than five locations, and post managers were concerned  that this made it extraordinarily difficult and expensive to implement  security measures.  Officials also stated that dispersion of facilities  complicates emergency action planning.  We note that frequent travel  between dispersed facilities may also pose security risks to personnel  because terrorists and criminals can target them while they are in transit.   In the construction of new embassy compounds, all U.S. government  offices are required to be located on the compound."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Buildings Are in Poor Condition", "paragraphs": ["State Department data show that many buildings are in poor condition.

OBO fire officials explained that a number of posts were unable to meet  fire standards, such as sprinkler systems and proper number of exits, due  to the structural limitations of the building.  This underscores the  Department\u2019s position that many buildings are in a condition that will not  allow a security and safety upgrade.", "Another safety problem is the seismic condition of buildings.  Although the  State Department does not have data on seismic conditions at all facilities,  it acknowledges that embassy and consular employees at some locations  may be working in buildings that do not protect against earthquakes.  At  one of the posts we visited, located in an earthquake region, the consular  building has a very poor seismic rating.  The State Department has been  unable to locate a suitable temporary facility that can house the consular  services while the landlord makes seismic improvements to the current  building.

For the primary office buildings alone, maintenance  needs exceed $316 million, with the primary building at more than one- third of all posts having more than $1 million in maintenance  requirements.  OBO projects that maintenance costs will increase over  time because many of the facilities are so old and antiquated, some dating  back to the late 19th and early 20th century.

We counted 96 posts mentioned in the plan where  OBO described the office space as being crowded or poorly configured.   During our post visits, we verified that crowded and poorly configured  office space is a problem.  This was particularly true in the controlled  access areas of the embassies where classified information is stored and  processed.  Because of the special requirements of these areas, it is  generally not feasible to lease additional space as the embassies have done  to expand office space for unclassified work.  One post had severe  overcrowding in its chancery.  To cope, the post resorted to creating  workspaces under a stairway and in storage areas.  One office stacked a  printer on top of shelving that can only be accessed with a stepladder in  order to make room for another small workstation.  This post used trailers  located behind the chancery to augment office space.  In addition, all of  the posts expressed concern that the crowded conditions would get worse  because they anticipate staff increases to handle additional  responsibilities, such as performing more rigorous screening of visa  applicants.

In 2001, we reported that State was not following proven system  acquisition and investment practices in attempting to deploy a common  overseas knowledge management system.  State canceled this initiative  because it could not get buy-in from other foreign affairs agencies.  In  2001, we reported on State\u2019s information security problems, including  weaknesses in access control that place information resources at risk of  unauthorized access.  As State continues to modernize information  technology at overseas posts, it is important that it employs rigorous and  disciplined management processes on each of its projects and that it  addresses its information security weaknesses.

As mentioned earlier, OBO developed the Long-range Overseas  Buildings Plan in July 2001, an action we had previously recommended.   This plan represents a major improvement in the management of embassy  construction because it provides decision makers with an overall sense of  proposed project scope and funding needs, and sets performance targets  that can be compared with actual performance.  Further, in February 2002,  OBO leadership convened the Industry Advisory Panel.  The panel consists  of volunteer industry representatives who meet quarterly to discuss issues  related to OBO\u2019s construction program and advise OBO management on  industry\u2019s best practices.

For example, OBO has developed a standard  embassy design for use in most projects and has moved away from a  \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d method of contracting toward a \u201cdesign-build\u201d method.   Use of a standard design and design-build contracting has the potential to  reduce project costs and the time taken to implement projects.  Table 2  provides details of the three standard designs that OBO has developed for  small, medium, and large posts.  OBO has set a goal of a 2-year design and  construction period for its standard embassy design buildings, which, if  met, would reduce the amount of time spent in design and construction by  almost a year.", "In addition, OBO and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security are actively  seeking to incorporate advanced technologies into the construction  program.  Exhibit 5, a video clip from the State Department showing the  performance of new windows and building materials, indicates that these  technologies show promise of providing an even greater level of physical  security for personnel operating in new buildings.", "While OBO has taken positive steps, we do have concerns regarding  requirements for staffing levels at locations where OBO is planning to  build a new embassy compound.  We believe that improvements are  needed in how the State Department and other agencies project staffing  requirements for new embassies.  In April 2003, we will report to the  Chairman of the House Government Reform Committee\u2019s Subcommittee  on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations that  staffing projections for new embassy compounds are developed without a  systematic approach or comprehensive assessments of the number and  types of staff who would be needed in the future.  Without adhering to a  systematic process for developing future staffing needs at U.S. embassies  and consulates, the U.S. government risks building the wrong-sized  facilities, which could lead to security concerns, additional costs, and  other work inefficiencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding and Timelines for Completing the Construction Program", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s timeline for completing the replacement of all 160 remaining posts  will depend on the amount of funding it receives for the construction  program.  For fiscal year 2004, State\u2019s Long-range Overseas Buildings Plan  called for almost $2 billion to fund the design and/or construction of 19  capital projects; in contrast, the President\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2004  budget requested $890 million for 8 new diplomatic posts.  As shown in  figure 15, at the proposed fiscal year 2004 rate of replacement, it would  take about 20 years to fund and 22 years to complete construction of the  estimated 160 remaining posts (assuming a 2-year design and construction  period).  Figure 15 also shows that this timeline would be shortened if  State receives more funds annually.  According to an OBO projection, the  program to replace the remaining 160 posts could be completed in 12  years if OBO receives $1.4 billion annually for new capital projects."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
