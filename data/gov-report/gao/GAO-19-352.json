Concerns remain that positive economic results of recent years could mask underlying risk-management deficiencies.", "This report examined (1) how consistent regulators' revised policies and procedures are with leading risk-management practices, (2) how they applied examination policies and procedures, and (3) trends in supervisory concern data since 2012 and how regulators tracked such data. GAO compared regulators' policies and procedures for oversight against leading practices; compared documents from selected bank examinations for 2014\u20132016 against regulator's risk-management examination procedures; reviewed aggregate supervisory concern data for 2012\u20132016; and interviewed regulators and industry representatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2009, federal banking regulators have revised policies and procedures for use by examiners in supervising depository institutions' management activities (such as those related to corporate governance and internal controls) and for identifying and communicating supervisory concerns. For example, regulators differentiated levels of severity for supervisory concerns and specified when to communicate them to boards of directors at the depository institutions. GAO found that the updated policies and procedures generally were consistent with leading risk-management practices, including federal internal control standards.", "Examination documents that GAO reviewed showed that examiners generally applied the regulators' updated policies and procedures to assess management oversight at large depository institutions. In particular, for the institutions GAO reviewed, the regulators communicated deficiencies before an institution's financial condition was affected, and followed up on supervisory concerns to determine progress in correcting weaknesses. However, practices for communicating supervisory concerns to institutions varied among regulators and some communications do not provide complete information that could help boards of directors monitor whether deficiencies are fully addressed by management. Written communications of supervisory concerns from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) that GAO reviewed often lacked complete information about the cause of the concern and, for the Federal Reserve, also lacked information on the potential consequences of the concern, which in one instance led to an incomplete response by an institution. Communicating more complete information to boards of directors of institutions, such as the reason for a deficient activity or practice and its potential effect on the safety and soundness of operations, could help ensure more timely corrective actions.", "While supervisory concern data indicated continuing management weaknesses, regulators vary in how they track and use the data. Data on supervisory concerns, and regulators' internal reports based on the data, indicated that regulators frequently cited concerns about the ability of depository institution management to control and mitigate risk. However, FDIC examiners only record summary information about certain supervisory concerns and not detailed characteristics of concerns that would allow for more complete information. With more detailed information, FDIC management could better monitor whether emerging risks are resolved in a timely manner. In addition, the regulators vary in the nature and extent of data they collect on the escalation of supervisory concerns to enforcement actions. FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have relatively detailed policies and procedures for escalation of supervisory concerns to enforcement actions, but the Federal Reserve does not. According to Federal Reserve staff, in practice they consider factors such as the institution's response to prior safety and soundness actions. But the Federal Reserve lacks specific and measurable guidelines for escalation of supervisory concerns, relying solely on the judgment or experience of examiners, their management, and Federal Reserve staff, which can result in inconsistent escalation practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDIC and the Federal Reserve improve information in written communication of supervisory concerns; FDIC improve recording of supervisory concern data; and the Federal Reserve update guidelines for escalating supervisory concerns.

We and the inspectors general for the federal banking  regulators have previously reported that management weaknesses at  large financial institutions contributed to the financial crisis and that bank  supervision needed to be strengthened. Management weaknesses at the  institutions included ineffective leadership by boards of directors and  management; compensation arrangements tied to quantity rather than  quality of loans; and poor underwriting and credit administration practices.  In addition, our prior work identified a need for federal banking regulators  to take timely action to address identified supervisory concerns and adopt  a forward-looking approach to identify emerging risks.", "Since 2009, the regulators have issued updated examiner guidance for  examining management practices at institutions they oversee and  implemented risk-management requirements in the Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Although the economy and  banking industry largely have recovered from the financial crisis,  concerns remain that complacency might set in and that positive  economic results could mask underlying issues. For example, OCC has  reported that credit quality remains strong but credit risk is increasing  because of accumulated risk in loan portfolios from successive years of  incremental easing in underwriting, risk layering, concentrations, and  rising potential impact from external factors.", "We conducted our work, under the authority of the Comptroller General,  to assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities. This report examines  (1) the extent to which revised policies and procedures for regulators\u2019  supervision of management at large depository institutions were  consistent with leading risk-management practices; (2) how examiners  applied policies and procedures for supervision of management at large  depository institutions they oversee; and (3) trends in regulators\u2019  supervisory concern data for all depository institutions since 2012 and  how regulators tracked and used such data.", "To address all our objectives, we focused on risk-management activities  related to corporate governance, internal controls, and internal audit  because management weaknesses in these areas could threaten the safe  and sound operation of a depository institution. We reviewed relevant  federal laws and regulations. We reviewed prior reports from GAO and  from the banking regulators\u2019 Offices of Inspector General. We also  reviewed a 2013 assessment of OCC supervision of large and mid-size  institutions. We interviewed Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC staff  about examination policies and procedures for large depository  institutions, processes related to supervision of management at large  institutions, and use of supervisory concerns to address weaknesses the  examiners identified.

(See table 1 for the federal banking regulators\u2019 definitions of  \u201clarge depository institutions\u201d which we adopted for reviewing regulators\u2019  policies and procedures and examination documents). We reviewed  documents from several standard-setting organizations and other  information to identify criteria for assessing risks and risk management.  We made connections between the principles listed in each of the criteria  documents to highlight the key elements of risk assessment, risk  measurement, corporate governance, internal controls, and internal audit  requirements. Additionally, we factored in regulators\u2019 consideration of  compliance with laws and regulations. We then reviewed relevant  documents from the regulators\u2014policy and procedural manuals,  supervisory statements, and other supervisory guidance\u2014issued since  2009. We compared the information in the agency documentation against  our criteria to determine if updated policies and procedures included  elements of the criteria we selected.", "To review how examiners applied agency policies and procedures for  supervision of management during examinations of large depository  institutions, we selected a non-generalizable sample of nine institutions  (three supervised by each regulator). We sought to achieve geographic  dispersion and diversity in asset size among the nine institutions and to  identify institutions with a focus on traditional banking activities. We then  requested examination documents (such as supervision plans, conclusion  memorandums, reports of examination, and supervisory letters) from  each regulator that related to review of management functions in 2014\u2013 2016 (2016 was the most recent complete calendar year when we began  our review). We assessed the documents against the regulators\u2019 policies  and procedures. We used a data collection instrument to determine if the  regulators\u2019 actions and reporting were consistent with policies and  procedures we reviewed. The results of our review are not generalizable  to all of the regulators\u2019 examinations, but provide illustrative examples of  how examiners applied agency policies and procedures for supervision of  management during examinations of large depository institutions.", "To examine how regulators track and use data on supervisory concerns,  we analyzed the regulators\u2019 policies and procedures for escalating  supervisory concerns to enforcement actions, interviewed staff at each  regulator about the data and their processes for collecting the data, and  reviewed internal reports and other supporting documentation. To  determine trends, we analyzed aggregate data on supervisory concerns  (2012\u20132016) for all institutions supervised by FDIC, OCC, and the  Federal Reserve. We determined the regulators\u2019 data were reliable for  showing general trends in numbers of supervisory concerns, time frames  for closing supervisory concerns, and additionally for OCC, numbers of  supervisory concerns elevated to enforcement actions.

Generally,  federal banking regulators use off-site systems to monitor the financial  condition of an individual bank; groups of banks with common product,  portfolio, or risk characteristics; and the banking system as a whole  between on-site examinations. Federal banking regulators generally  conduct on-site supervision by stationing examiners at specific  institutions. This practice allows examiners to continuously analyze  information provided by the financial institution, such as board meeting  minutes, institution risk reports or management information system  reports. This type of supervision is intended to allow for timely  adjustments to the supervisory strategy of the examiners as conditions  change within the institutions.", "FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC are required to conduct a full- scope, on-site examination of each insured depository institution they  supervise at least once during each 12-month period. The regulators may  extend the examination interval to 18 months, generally for institutions  that have less than $3 billion in total assets and that meet certain  conditions, based on ratings, capitalization, and status of formal  enforcement actions, among others.", "For large institutions, federal banking regulators do not conduct an annual  point-in-time examination of the institution. Rather, they conduct ongoing  examination activities that are generally intended to evaluate an  institution\u2019s operating condition, management practices and policies, and  compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In particular, examiners  review an institution\u2019s condition using the Uniform Financial Institutions  Rating System, also known as CAMELS (capital adequacy, asset quality,  management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk).  Evaluations of CAMELS components consider an institution\u2019s size and  sophistication, the nature and complexity of its activities, and its risk  profile. Throughout the examination cycle, each target examination will  result in a letter that is transmitted to the institution (where applicable). At  the end of the supervisory cycle, a report of examination is issued to the  institution. The target examination letter and report of examination may  include supervisory concerns that examiners found and that an institution  is expected to address within specific time frames.", "The regulators also issue supervisory guidance, which they describe as  including interagency statements, advisories, bulletins, policy statements,  questions and answers, and frequently asked questions issued to their  respective supervised institutions. Supervisory guidance outlines the  regulators\u2019 supervisory expectations or priorities and articulates general  views regarding appropriate practices for a given subject area. The  guidance often provides examples of practices that the regulators  generally consider consistent with safety and soundness standards or  other applicable laws and regulations. According to the regulators,  supervisory guidance is not legally binding.", "For instance, FDIC financial institution letters generally announce matters  of interest to those responsible for operating an institution. Federal  Reserve supervision and regulation letters address significant policy and  procedural matters. OCC bulletins generally accomplish the same goals  as FDIC and Federal Reserve letters. The letters and bulletins are  published on each regulator\u2019s website. Often, the contents of these  documents are incorporated into broader examination manuals.", "Moreover, the federal banking regulators have developed internal control  functions within the supervision programs for large depository institutions,  which consist of several layers of review following examinations. Each  regulator has a review process at the conclusion of examinations, and  examiners prepare written products documenting their findings and meet  with regional and headquarters officials to finalize decisions.

For example,  according to FDIC, the quality of management, including the board of  directors and executives, is probably the single most important element in  the successful operation of an institution. The Federal Reserve noted that  the culture, expectations, and incentives established by the highest levels  of corporate leadership set the tone for the entire organization and are  essential determinants of whether an organization is capable of  maintaining fully effective risk-management and internal control  processes. Also, according to OCC, an effective corporate and risk  governance framework is essential to ensuring the safe and sound  operation of the institution and helping to promote public confidence in the  financial system.", "In our past work, regulators told us they recognized bank supervision  needed to be more forward-looking and had incorporated more forward- looking elements into examinations. Forward-looking supervision seeks  to mitigate emerging risks before they affect the financial condition of an  institution. Regulators can respond to emerging risks in the banking  sector with a variety of supervisory tools. These include micro-prudential  tools, which traditionally have focused on the safety and soundness of  individual financial institutions, and macro-prudential tools, which can be  used to address vulnerabilities across the banking system and broader  financial system. Supervisory concerns are an important micro-prudential  tool to support forward-looking supervision by ensuring that a depository  institution takes early action to correct deficiencies.

The post-crisis updates were intended to provide better definitions  of certain risk categories and enable examiners to consider individual  risks within the context of all risks facing the institution.", "For instance, in June 2009, FDIC re-emphasized the forward-looking  approach, which FDIC states encourages examiners to consider the  likelihood that identified weaknesses will cause material problems in the  future, and consider the severity of damage to an institution if conditions  deteriorate. FDIC further noted that this assessment reflects both the  board of directors\u2019 and management\u2019s ability to identify, measure,  monitor, and control the risks of the institution\u2019s activities, ensure its safe  and sound operations, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and  regulations. FDIC policy provides that an assessment of management is  not solely dependent on the current financial condition of the institution.  Also, in 2015 FDIC updated policies and procedures for identifying and  assessing the influence of dominant bank officials or policymakers on an  institution, and stated the policy was intended to limit the influence of  dominant officials when internal controls are inadequate and ensure  independence of the risk-management function.", "In 2012, the Federal Reserve updated procedures for supervision of large  financial institutions, which were intended to strengthen traditional firm- level supervision while also incorporating systemic considerations to  reduce potential threats to the stability of the financial system and provide  insights into financial market trends.

Also, in 2016, OCC published the Corporate and Risk  Governance booklet of the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook to incorporate  heightened standards requirements for depository institutions with  average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The booklet  provides guidance to examiners on board and management  responsibilities, risk management assessment factors, and measurement  and assessment of risk consistent with the heightened standards.", "Regulators also took steps to enhance their ability to resolve supervisory  concerns in a timely manner through improvements to policies and  procedures on identifying and communicating concerns. The regulators  employ progressive enforcement regimes to address supervisory  concerns that arise during the examination cycle (see table 2). If the  institution does not respond to the concern in a timely manner, the  regulators may take informal or formal enforcement action, depending on  the severity of the circumstances. Informal enforcement actions include  obtaining an institution\u2019s commitment to implement corrective measures  under a memorandum of understanding. Formal enforcement actions  include issuance of a cease-and-desist order or assessment of a  monetary penalty, among others.", "The regulators have continued to update these regimes to clarify the  distinction between each level of concern and to improve communication  of concerns to the boards of directors of depository institutions. For  instance, in 2016, the board of directors of FDIC issued a statement  setting forth basic principles to guide the identification and communication  of supervisory recommendations. The board stated that a supervisory  recommendation refers to FDIC communications with a depository  institution that are intended to inform it of FDIC\u2019s views about changes  needed to its practices, operations, or financial condition. FDIC\u2019s updated  policies and procedures state that supervisory recommendations must be  presented in writing and most are generally correctable in the normal  course of business. When developing and communicating these  recommendations, FDIC examiners are required to (1) address  meaningful concerns, (2) communicate concerns clearly and in writing,  and (3) discuss corrective action. Supervisory recommendations involving  an issue or risk of significant importance and that typically would require  more effort to address than those correctable in the normal course, would  need to be brought to the attention of the board and senior management  through matters requiring board attention (MRBA) comments.", "The Federal Reserve updated its policies and procedures on identification  and communication of supervisory concerns in 2013. The supervision and  regulation letter defined matters requiring immediate attention (MRIA) to  include (1) matters that have the potential to pose significant risk to the  safety and soundness of the banking organization; (2) matters that  represent significant noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;  (3) repeat criticisms that have escalated in importance due to insufficient  attention or inaction by the banking organization; and (4) in the case of consumer compliance examinations, matters that have the potential to  cause significant consumer harm. The letter defines matters requiring  attention (MRA) as deficiencies that are important and should be  addressed over a reasonable period of time, but where the institution\u2019s  response need not be immediate. Therefore, the distinction between  MRIAs and MRAs is the nature of and severity of the matter and the  timing by which the institution must respond. No matter how serious the  concern, it is addressed to the institution\u2019s board of directors.", "According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies and procedures, the  communication of supervisory findings must be (1) written in clear and  concise language, (2) prioritized based upon degree of importance, and  (3) focused on any significant matters that require attention. The Federal  Reserve proposed new supervisory concern policies and procedures in  2017, which provided that examiners and supervisory staff should direct  most MRIAs and MRAs to senior management of institutions for  corrective action. MRIAs or MRAs only would be directed to the board for  corrective action when the board needed to address its corporate  governance responsibilities or when senior management failed to take  appropriate remedial action. The proposed policies would not change the  definitions of MRAs and MRIAs or the content of communications to  institutions. As of April 2019, the proposed policies and procedures had  not been finalized.", "OCC updated its policies and procedures for examiners to identify and  communicate MRAs in 2014 and further enhanced them in 2017. OCC\u2019s  policy states that MRAs describe practices that an institution must  implement or correct, ideally before those deficient practices affect the  bank\u2019s condition. Specifically, MRAs describe practices that (1) deviate  from sound governance, internal control, or risk-management principles,  and have the potential to adversely affect the bank\u2019s condition, including  its financial performance or risk profile, if not addressed; or (2) result in  substantive noncompliance with laws or regulations, enforcement actions,  or conditions imposed in writing in connection with the approval of any  application or other request by the bank. OCC refers to such practices as  deficient practices. Such practices also may be unsafe or unsound\u2014 generally, any action, or lack of action that is contrary to generally  accepted standards of prudent operation and the possible consequences  of which, if continued, would be abnormal risk or loss or damage to an  institution, its shareholders, or the Deposit Insurance Fund.", "OCC supervisory concerns are to be communicated in writing to the  institution\u2019s management and board of directors to ensure timely and  effective correction.

Criteria we used included  that guidance be clear and actionable and that examiners review risk- management and control functions, identify existing and emerging risks,  and review compliance with laws and regulations. (See table 3 for the  specific criteria we applied, appendix I for more information on our  methodology, and appendix II for the list of policy and procedure  documents we reviewed).", "While individual policies or procedures may not have satisfied all of our  criteria, when viewed collectively the policies and procedures generally  addressed leading risk-management practices. For example, the policies  and procedures almost always provided examiners with clear and  actionable objectives for risk-management governance; enabled  examiners to identify whether an institution had established a clear  governance framework; assisted examiners in identifying, reporting, and  recommending changes to address existing and emerging risks; and  required review of institutions\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and  regulations.", "More specifically, we found FDIC risk-management policies and  procedures for examining large insured depository institutions generally  provide clear, actionable risk-management objectives with a few  exceptions that did not materially affect our overall assessment. For  instance, we identified that a policy document contains clear parameters  for examiners to assess identified risks, which is consistent with our  criteria, but the parameters did not include instructions for when  examiners should consider changing a bank\u2019s rating based on identified  risk levels. However, related guidance for examiners in considering the  impact of risk on the institution can be found in the definitions and  descriptions of CAMELS ratings. We also found that FDIC developed  adequate policies and procedures to evaluate corporate governance. In  particular, consistent with leading practices, the guidance requires  separation of board and management; identification and response to  dominant officials; and encourages detailed review of the control  environment. FDIC also has processes on risk assessment, and tracking  and monitoring risk to address existing and emerging risks. For example,  examiners are required to review updates to the institution\u2019s risk- management processes for new lines of business.", "Similarly, we found that Federal Reserve policies and procedures for  large depository institutions generally identify clear, actionable risk- management objectives and explain activities that might be riskier at  some institutions compared to others, but a few policies and procedures  were not fully consistent with our criteria. For instance, while corporate  governance policies and procedures provide detailed materials for  examiners to use during examination, and there is extensive guidance on  risk identification, assessment, and communication, we noted relatively  limited written procedures regarding escalation of concerns to  enforcement actions. We discuss this issue in more detail later in this  report. We also found that the Federal Reserve included forward-looking  risk assessment procedures within risk-identification processes, including  preliminary risk assessment to address existing and emerging risks.", "Finally, we found that OCC policies and procedures for large depository  institutions generally provide clear requirements for examiner evaluation  of the supervised institution\u2019s quantity of risk, quality of risk management,  and direction of risk. But the methods of measurement and specific  tolerances for risk in these policies and procedures are not as clear as  suggested by the leading practices. However, guidance to evaluate the  potential impact of risk is separately available to examiners in OCC\u2019s  MRA and enforcement action policies and procedures. We found that  consistent with our criteria, policies and procedures are detailed to  provide examiners a clear framework to review banks\u2019 corporate  governance and risk-management systems. In particular, appropriate  attention is paid to board oversight and effective management practice,  including clear outlines for board and management responsibilities and  independence. To address existing and emerging risks, OCC requires  examiners to assess a specific set of risks within its risk-based  supervision approach using the Risk Assessment System.

One industry representative told us  that supervisory concerns were not always clearly communicated, noting  that communications of supervisory concerns sometimes can be difficult  to interpret and correct. An official from one of the regulators stated that  former examiners working as industry consultants sometimes may be  hired to help interpret supervisory letters and assist depository institutions  in responding to supervisory concerns.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should  communicate quality information externally to help the entity achieve its  objectives and address related risks. Quality information is defined as  appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a  timely basis. Other authoritative internal control sources, including  Circular A-123 and the framework of the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) require cause  analysis\u2014that is, an identification of the cause of the deficiencies that  have been found. Generally accepted government auditing standards  require that auditors plan and perform procedures to develop all four  elements of a finding (criteria, condition, cause, and effect) necessary to  address audit objectives. Although these authoritative sources do not  apply to federal banking regulators, the standards identify principles  consistent with the goal of FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC guidance in  ensuring clear and complete communication of supervisory  recommendations.", "OCC. For two of the three OCC-supervised institutions whose  examination documents we reviewed, OCC examiners generally  communicated to boards of directors the information they would need to  monitor to determine whether deficiencies were fully addressed by  management. OCC\u2019s policies and procedures on MRAs require  examiners to identify and communicate in writing to depository institutions  the concern, cause, consequences of inaction, required corrective action,  and management\u2019s commitment for corrective action. If the cause of the  deficient condition is not apparent, examiners must direct the institution\u2019s  management to perform a root-cause analysis as part of the corrective  action. According to OCC staff, they implemented the MRA requirements  agency-wide in 2014 after having a positive experience applying them at  the community bank level. OCC staff told us that it is necessary for  examiners and institutions to understand the cause of a deficiency for  examiners to make appropriate recommendations and institutions to  address the concern and help ensure the deficiency does not reoccur.", "Failure of examiners to identify and communicate the root causes of  inappropriate practices was among the key findings of an internal OCC  review of supervision of sales practices at Wells Fargo. In September  2016, OCC took enforcement action against Wells Fargo for improper  sales practices. In April 2017, OCC\u2019s Office of Enterprise Governance  and the Ombudsman published an independent review of OCC\u2019s  supervisory record for Wells Fargo, which identified gaps in OCC\u2019s  supervision and lessons learned. Review findings included that the OCC  team responsible for supervising Wells Fargo did not ensure that  examiners evaluated root causes of the improper sales practices. In  addition, they found that the first MRA that identified the sales practices  issue in 2010 did not list the issue as an unsafe or unsound practice and  did not identify a root cause or responsible parties. Among the lessons  learned was ensuring analysis of root causes and compliance with OCC  MRA guidance.", "In our review, we also observed how OCC\u2019s written communications of  concerns changed as its requirements were implemented. For example,  in documents from 2014 for two institutions, OCC examiners generally  only communicated the concern or the required corrective action and  management\u2019s commitment to corrective actions. By 2016, examiners  documented each of the required elements for MRAs in their written  communication (for two institutions).", "FDIC. For the three FDIC-supervised institutions whose examination  documents we reviewed, FDIC examiners did not communicate to boards  of directors the information they would need to monitor whether  deficiencies were fully addressed by management. For these three  institutions, FDIC examiners stated the concern (deficiency) and required  corrective action in their internal communications of supervisory  recommendations and also externally with depository institutions. They  sometimes stated the potential effect of the deficient condition on the  safety and soundness of the institution. These practices were consistent  with FDIC policies and procedures in place at the time. For example, in  the written communication to one FDIC institution selected for our review,  examiners conveyed specific information about the supervisory concerns,  the effect of the deficiencies on the institution, and the required corrective  action for the MRBAs related to an examination. In another instance, the  communication of the supervisory concerns appeared less specific. In  that case, examiners reported that the institution management\u2019s actions  did not fully address a deficient condition identified in the prior  examination. We found that the prior written communication of concerns  to the institution did not identify the cause of the deficient condition or  propose specific action to be taken.", "FDIC staff told us they believed that updates to their policies and  procedures in 2016 already require examiners to identify the cause for the  deficient condition and communicate it to the depository institutions.  Specifically, FDIC requires examiners to \u201cdescribe the deficient practices,  operations, or financial condition and how it deviates from sound  governance, internal controls, or risk management or consumer  protection principles, or legal requirements.\u201d This requirement is similar  to OCC\u2019s requirement to \u201cdescribe the concern.\u201d Specifically, OCC  examiners are required to \u201cdescribe the deficient practice and how it  deviates from sound governance, internal control or risk management  principles.\u201d FDIC\u2019s policies and procedures do not require examiners to  identify the factor(s) responsible for the deficient condition (the \u201cwhy\u201d) or  communicate it to the institutions. Based on the examination documents  we reviewed, we did not observe that FDIC examiners communicated the  cause of the deficiency. Including the cause facilitates a better  understanding of why an institution\u2019s condition is not consistent with law  or regulations and, ultimately, can help an institution determine how it  could remedy the condition.", "Federal Reserve. In our review of examination documents for three  institutions, Federal Reserve examiners did not include information that  boards of directors would need to monitor whether deficiencies were fully  addressed by management. Reserve Bank examiners stated the  condition and required corrective action in their internal and external  communications of supervisory recommendations to depository  institutions, consistent with Federal Reserve policies and procedures.  Furthermore, the condition and required corrective action were generally  closely linked to the criteria examiners applied during the examination,  which often consisted of Federal Reserve supervisory guidance.", "We found that the written communications to depository institutions did  not always provide information that would convey the reason the deficient  condition occurred (cause) or the potential consequences of the deficient  condition (effect). As a result, the information conveyed in the written  communications of supervisory concerns was limited.", "The Federal Reserve Board has broad criteria for Federal Reserve Bank  examiners requiring them to communicate only the condition and required  corrective action. Federal Reserve Board staff told us that they do not  require examiners to identify the cause of a deficient practice or condition.  Instead, they leave that responsibility to institutions. Staff stated that they  believe the institution is in the best position to identify the cause. They  noted that this also could reduce the amount of time examiners otherwise  would spend searching for the cause. However, we noted that at least  one Reserve Bank builds on the Board\u2019s criteria for communicating  supervisory concerns and developed policies and procedures that require  examiners to identify condition, criteria, cause, and effect to support  supervisory findings in review sessions with Reserve Bank management.  As discussed previously, authoritative internal control sources require  cause analysis. As an example applicable to banking regulators, OCC  requires its staff to identify and communicate the cause of the deficiency  that led to the supervisory concern, or, if the root cause is not apparent, to  instruct institution management to identify root cause as part of its  corrective action. OCC staff noted that identifying root cause in  examinations does not require additional resources. Also, if the root  cause is not apparent, examiners instruct the institution to identify root  cause as part of the corrective action, per OCC\u2019s MRA policy.", "Furthermore, a September 2018 interagency statement clarifying the role  of supervisory guidance instructed examiners to not criticize institutions  for a \u201cviolation\u201d of supervisory guidance. Identification and  communication of the potential effect of a deficiency could enable the  Federal Reserve to move away from its practice of closely linking  supervisory concerns to failure to comply with guidance and better  explain why an institution\u2019s condition is not consistent with law or  regulations.", "FDIC and the Federal Reserve are missing an opportunity to  communicate complete information, in writing, to the boards of institutions  regarding the cause of the identified deficiency that led to the supervisory  concern, which would facilitate a better understanding of why the  institution\u2019s condition deviates from safety and soundness standards.

Examiners used various methods to follow up on  supervisory concerns, such as by conducting limited-scope targeted  reviews of one or more issues or incorporating follow-up as part of their  regularly scheduled examination of a functional area. In addition, we  observed that at four institutions examiners performed follow-up as part of  their ongoing supervisory activities.", "While there are time frame targets for completion of corrective action,  concerns can remain open until examiners are satisfied with the  effectiveness of the remedial actions taken to address the supervisory  concern. For instance, at three institutions we found that examiners  closed concerns in targeted follow-up examinations once they validated  the completion of remedial action by reviewing documents and activities  that verified the implemented action was effective. We also observed  instances for at least three institutions in which examiners refrained from  closing supervisory concerns because they determined that the  institutions\u2019 management had not yet adequately addressed the concerns  and further attention was warranted to ensure the corrective action was  sustainable.", "In performing regularly scheduled target examinations of specific  functions or risk areas examined during a previous examination cycle,  examiners assessed management\u2019s progress in addressing prior  supervisory concerns at eight of the nine institutions we selected for  examination documentation review.

Due to the limitations  with the data and the inability to combine the data sets, some analyses  were completed with the raw data set and others with the data set divided  by topics. As a result, the analysis provides a general understanding of  trends in FDIC supervisory concerns, rather than a rigorous trend  analysis.", "Federal Reserve. We obtained data on MRAs issued to all Federal  Reserve-supervised institutions from 2012 through 2016. The Federal  Reserve has two systems for recording and tracking supervised institution  data: the \u201cC-SCAPE\u201d platform for institutions with assets greater than $50  billion and all foreign banks, and the \u201cINSite\u201d platform for smaller  community banks. Some of the MRA data were not categorized by  supervisory concern and were assigned a \u201cnull\u201d value.

For ease of explanation and analysis, the data under the  sub-categories were consolidated under their larger categories. The  number of MRAs uncategorized by supervisory concern did not present a  significant obstacle to our analysis. The data on escalation of MRAs to  MRIAs and enforcement actions were collected in a manner that made it  difficult for us to determine the extent of escalation.

For our purposes, OCC staff stated  that we could use the data to count the number of concerns; however,  analyzing the concerns by categories could have been problematic  because of changes to the classification method that occurred in October  2014 and March 2017. As a result of the 2017 changes, OCC supervisory  concern data are recorded in a four-level framework (examination area,  category of concern, type, and topic) that allows for tracking of  supervisory concerns at the MRA level and at the \u201cconcern\u201d level.
