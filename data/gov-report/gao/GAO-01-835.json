Little, however, is known about the comparability and reasonableness of individual agencies\u2019 estimates for infrastructure needs. In fact, even the concept of infrastructure \u201cneed\u201d is difficult to define and to distinguish from \u201cwish lists\u201d of capital projects.

As you requested, we focused on the following infrastructure areas\u2014water resources (inland and deep draft navigation, flood control, and shore protection), hydropower, water supply, wastewater treatment, airports, highways, mass transit, and public buildings. For these seven agencies and specified types of public infrastructure, we agreed to address the following: (1) What are the agencies\u2019 estimates for infrastructure investment and how do the estimates compare in terms of how they are developed and used? (2) To what extent do the agencies\u2019 procedures for developing the estimates embody practices of leading government and private-sector organizations?", "We did not independently verify the agencies\u2019 investment estimates, but we did rely on past reviews of these data by us and others that examined the soundness and completeness of the methodology and/or data used to develop the estimates.  We incorporated findings from these reviews as appropriate. The amount of information we present concerning an estimate reflects the extensiveness of past reviews and does not imply that an estimate is better or worse than other estimates. For some agencies\u2014 ARC, the Army Corps, EPA, and FTA\u2014we did not have past reviews related to the estimates to draw upon. We reviewed agencies\u2019 documentation of their procedures to develop the estimates, but we did not verify whether these procedures were followed. We compared agencies\u2019 procedures with some of the capital decisionmaking practices used by leading government and private sector organizations that we identified and reported on in 1998. This report focuses on those leading practices that relate to developing and using investment estimates.  We included practices such as establishing a baseline inventory of assets, using cost-benefit analysis to identify economically justified investments, and ranking and selecting projects for funding based on established criteria.

The investment requirements depend on (1) the supply of service\u2014what facilities exist, their condition and maintenance, how efficiently they are operated, and how services might be provided other than through capital spending\u2014and (2) the demand for such services by the public, which can be influenced, in part by the price charged for infrastructure services and the state of the economy.  Infrastructure investment estimates can vary greatly depending on the extent to which such factors are considered in investment calculations.  For example, the investment required to maintain or rehabilitate existing facilities could differ significantly from the investment required to meet a specified level of service.  Moreover, focusing on the provision of service, rather than the condition of a structure or facility, can lead to the consideration of less costly, noncapital alternatives to meeting the demand for infrastructure. For example, to meet a specified level of service on roads, such as keeping traffic flowing at the speed limit, decisionmakers might consider changing the timing of traffic lights rather than building new lanes.  Furthermore, future investment needs are not a predetermined reality and can be affected by more efficient use of existing infrastructure.  For example, technological improvements can increase the efficiency of infrastructure. In addition, pricing strategies can affect the use of infrastructure\u2014 relatively higher fees can encourage users to economize on their consumption."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Federal Agencies\u2019 Roles in Developing Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["The seven agencies we reviewed develop information on infrastructure investment requirements because of their roles in financing and developing infrastructure.

In 1998, we identified the practices of leading government and private-sector organizations in capital decisionmaking.During that review, we found that conducting a comprehensive needs assessment is an important first step in an organization\u2019s decisionmaking process for infrastructure because it allows an organization to (1) consider its overall mission, (2) identify the resources needed to fulfill both immediate requirements and anticipated future needs on the basis of results-oriented goals and objectives that flow from the organization\u2019s mission, and (3) consider both capital and noncapital approaches to addressing these goals.  The following leading practices relate to developing and using investment estimates:   conduct a comprehensive assessment of the resources needed to meet an agency\u2019s mission and results-oriented goals and objectives;   establish a baseline inventory of existing assets, evaluate their condition, determine if they are performing as planned, and identify excess capacity;   consider alternative ways to address needs, including noncapital   use cost-benefit analysis as a primary method to compare alternatives and select economically justified investments; rank and select infrastructure projects for funding based on established criteria;   budget infrastructure projects in useful segments;   develop a long-term capital plan that defines capital asset decisions;   establish procedures to review data developed by others and using independent reviews of data and methods to further enhance the quality of estimates.", "The leading practices we identified reflect requirements that the Congress and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have placed on federal agencies that are aimed at improving federal agencies\u2019 capital decisionmaking practices.  These requirements relate to aspects of investment estimates, such as developing cost information, measuring the benefits of proposed investments, and using investment estimates as a first step toward acquiring infrastructure.  These requirements include, for example, the Chief Financial Officers\u2019 Act of 1990, which required the development of accounting and financial systems to report cost information and that the principles used in accounting for program costs be consistent with those used in developing program budgets. In addition, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Results Act) required agencies to develop mission statements, long-range strategic goals and objectives, and annual performance plans. The Results Act emphasized identifying and measuring outcomes, including benefits. In addition, the Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 to improve the federal acquisition process. Title V of the act was designed to foster the development of (1) measurable cost, schedule, and performance goals and (2) incentives for acquisition personnel to reach these goals.  To help agencies integrate and implement these and other requirements, OMB added a section to its annual budget preparation guidance (Circular A-11) requiring agencies to provide OMB with information on major capital acquisitions and to submit a capital asset plan and justification. This guidance is supplemented by OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide, which provides detailed steps on planning, budgeting, acquiring, and managing infrastructure and other capital assets.

According to an Army Corps official, regional Army Corps personnel evaluate the requests and determine both the seriousness of the problems and the need for immediate solutions. Project costs are estimated by engineers and other professionals using existing industry data. The agency also uses cost-benefit analysis to determine which projects are economically justified and would assist the agency in reaching its goals, such as environmental protection and flood mitigation.

Data for the investment estimate come primarily from airport plans\u2014such as airport master plans and layouts--which include proposals and cost estimates for specific infrastructure projects at individual airports. FAA officials in field offices review each project, and approved projects are entered into a FAA database. FAA officials in headquarters review the database for anomalies in the data, then add up the estimated cost of each project to produce an overall investment estimate. Because this estimate is not a spending plan, FAA has reported that it makes no attempt to prioritize the projects or determine if the benefits of specific projects would exceed their cost. This estimate is prepared and submitted to the Congress biennially, as required by statute.", "FTA also used local sources of data to estimate an investment of $10.8 billion to $16.0 billion per year for mass transit systems (such as buses and railcars) from 1998 to 2017, depending on whether the condition and performance of mass transit systems would be maintained or improved. The estimates cover both federal and nonfederal shares of costs. FTA used data from local urban transit agencies to determine the age and condition of mass transit infrastructure and then estimated the cost of either maintaining or improving that infrastructure. FTA used an estimate developed by its Transit Economic Requirements Model. The model performed a benefit-cost analysis to determine if replacing an asset was economically justified. The model then aggregated the cost of all the infrastructure projects that were justified by benefit-cost analysis to determine the total investment estimate for the nation\u2019s mass transit systems. FTA uses this estimate to provide general support for its budget and information on changes in mass transit systems.", "ARC estimated that it would cost $8.5 billion from state and federal sources to complete the Appalachian Development Highway System. To do this, it relied on state highway officials within Appalachia, who determined the estimated cost to complete individual highway corridors within their particular state that are part of the highway system. These estimates used engineering structural criteria to estimate the cost of constructing highway corridors. The estimate included costs for project design, environmental mitigation, rights of way access, and construction.", "ARC officials provided instructions to the states for computing this estimate and reviewed the estimates by comparing the costs to the costs of similar highway projects within that state and to FHWA\u2019s data on construction costs. The costs were not adjusted for inflation. ARC then aggregated the data from each state to produce an overall estimate of the cost to complete the entire highway system.

Only costs eligible for funding under the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund were included. These costs were not adjusted for inflation. To develop the estimate, EPA surveyed all of the large water systems in the United States as well as a sample of the medium water systems. In addition, EPA conducted site visits to 599 small systems and extrapolated data from these surveys and site visits to compute the total investment estimate. The surveys and supporting cost documentation for medium and large systems were submitted to states for review and were subsequently reviewed by EPA. The agency uses the results of this estimate to allocate monies to the states for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund based on each state\u2019s share of the total investment amount.", "In 1996, EPA estimated that $139.5 billion in federal and state funds was needed between 1996 and 2016 for water pollution control, primarily for capital investment in already-existing wastewater treatment facilities. Only costs eligible for funding under Title VI of the Clean Water Act were included in the estimate. These costs were not adjusted for inflation. EPA developed the estimate from a nationwide database of wastewater treatment facilities that is periodically updated by surveying the states. The states provided revised estimates of capital investment needs from their documented plans, which were supplemented by costs modeled by EPA when the state lacked this information. In addition, EPA modeled the costs for each state for combined sewer overflows and activities to control stormwater runoff and nonpoint sources of pollution. The Congress has used this information as one consideration in appropriating funds for capitalization grants to the states, through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund loan program.

Furthermore, placing the focus on results drives an organization to consider alternative, noncapital ways to fulfill program requirements. Until recently, agencies have not been required to relate their planned infrastructure spending to their missions and goals, so evaluating these plans has presented a challenge to agencies and the Congress. This situation changed with the enactment of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and corresponding revisions to OMB Circular A-11.

OMB has defined a useful segment as a component that either (1) provides information that allows the agency to plan the capital project, develop the design, and assess the benefits, costs, and risks before proceeding to full acquisition (or canceling the acquisition) or (2) results in a useful asset for which the benefits exceed the costs even if no further funding is appropriated.", "For the agencies we reviewed, investment estimates, particularly those that involve the construction or rehabilitation of an asset, are often based on the full cost of projects.

The estimate did not include over $600,000 appropriated to the Army Corps between fiscal years 1986 and 1989 to study the proposed project. The agency requested and received funds each fiscal year for various phases of the work until fiscal year 1997, by which time the total federal share of the work had increased to $20.4 million, due to inflation and cost overruns. As another example, ARC officials told us that prior to fiscal year 1999, it had been difficult for the agency to develop realistic estimates for the cost of completing the highways under its jurisdiction because funding was limited and was only sufficient to construct a few sections each year.

Developing a long-term capital plan enables an organization to review and refine a proposed project\u2019s scope and cost estimates over several years, which helps to reduce cost overruns.

For example, officials may consider altering operational procedures or practices to allow more airplanes to use one runway instead of requesting funds for an additional runway. If noncapital alternatives do not exist, airport officials request funding for a capital project within their plans, which contain specific proposals and cost estimates for each project. FAA officials in field offices review each project within each airport plan to determine if the project is eligible and justified. A project is eligible if it qualifies for federal funds under the Airport Improvement Program. A project is justified based on a judgmental decision by FAA district officials. For example, one airport in central Texas proposed adding four new runways to the airport, which FAA officials considered unjustified because the amount of air traffic served by the airport was insufficient to merit the additional runways. Projects and plans that are approved by FAA at the district level are then entered into the NPIAS database, along with the estimated costs.

The states also provided FHWA with forecasts on such matters as travel growth. FHWA staff reviewed the data submitted by the states and looked for anomalies or unusual patterns. FHWA asked the states to correct serious flaws and improve data submission for minor flaws. Finally, FHWA division offices periodically reviewed state data collection procedures to ensure consistency among states. The corrected information was inputted into FHWA\u2019s Highway Performance Monitoring System.", "FHWA primarily used the Highway Economic Requirements System (HERS) model to determine future investment requirements. It assessed the current condition of the sample highway segments and then projected future condition and performance of the segments based on expected changes in factors such as traffic volume. Based on this information, the model simulated the effects of infrastructure improvements for the highway segments and compared the relative benefits and costs associated with alternative improvement options. While FHWA\u2019s model analyzes these sample sections individually, the model is designed to provide estimates of investment requirements valid at the national level and does not provide improvement recommendations for individual highway segments. FHWA acknowledges that some HERS data, particularly emissions data, varies in quality.", "To reach a total estimate for highway investment requirements, FHWA supplements results of this model with external adjustments to account for (1) classes of highways not included in either the statistical sample or the model and (2) certain types of capital investment. FHWA acknowledges that the estimates are not based on benefit-cost analysis and are less rigorous than the HERS results. The model currently does not directly consider new roads or system enhancements\u2014improvements primarily related only to safety, traffic operations, or environmental enhancements\u2014as part of its analysis.

In June 1999, the experts found that FHWA has strengthened the model over time and that recent refinements have increased its applicability and credibility. Also, FHWA staff and consultants continually look for ways to improve the model. For example, FHWA officials told us they plan to eliminate a computational shortcut for their next estimates, which they plan to issue in 2002. FHWA used this shortcut to approximate the lifetime benefits associated with an improvement.  In addition, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program is reviewing FHWA\u2019s methodology for determining its investment estimate.", "We found the model was reasonable despite some limitations. First, the model cannot completely reflect changes occurring among all highways in the transportation network at the same time, since the model analyzes each highway segment independently. Second, the model cannot estimate the full range of uncertainties within which its estimates vary because it is not designed to completely quantify the uncertainties associated with its methods, assumptions, and data. In making estimates, the model relies on a variety of estimating techniques and hundreds of variables, all of which are subject to some uncertainties. For example, we have reported that pavement roughness data reported by the states to FHWA are not completely comparable, partly because the states use different devices to measure roughness. Third, FHWA uses two different approaches in compiling the estimate.
