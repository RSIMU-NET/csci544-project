Questions have been raised about whether similar activity exists in Medicare Part D. GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries obtained frequently abused drugs from multiple prescribers, (2) identify examples of doctor shopping activity, and (3) determine the actions taken by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to limit access to drugs for known abusers. To meet the objectives, GAO analyzed Medicare Part D claims for calendar year 2008 to identify potential doctor shoppers. To identify examples, GAO chose a nonrepresentative selection of 10 beneficiaries based on a number of factors, including the number of prescribers. GAO also interviewed policy officials from CMS and from prescription drug plans that administer the drug benefit program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found indications of doctor shopping in the Medicare Part D program for 14 categories of frequently abused prescription drugs. About 170,000 beneficiaries (about 1.8 percent of beneficiaries receiving these 14 categories of drugs) acquired the same class of frequently abused drugs, primarily hydrocodone and oxycodone, from five or more medical practitioners during calendar year 2008 at a cost of about $148 million (about 5 percent of the total cost for these drugs). About 120,000 of these beneficiaries were eligible for Medicare Part D because of a disability. There may be justifiable reasons for receiving prescriptions from multiple medical practitioners, such as visiting specialists or several prescribers in the same medical group. However, one individual received prescriptions from 87 different medical practitioners in 2008. In such situations, there is heightened concern that Medicare beneficiaries are seeing several medical practitioners to support and disguise an addiction. GAO judgmentally selected 10 beneficiaries and found that they were doctor shopping for prescription drugs. These cases are among the more egregious and cannot be generalized beyond the examples presented. CMS has systems in place to identify individuals with doctor shopping behavior; however, according to CMS policy officials, federal law may not authorize them to restrict these individuals' access to drugs, including highly abused drugs, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. One option to control doctor shopping used by Medicaid and some private sector plans is the restricted recipient program. It limits individuals identified as doctor shoppers to one prescriber, one pharmacy, or both for receiving prescriptions. There are issues to consider with a restricted recipient program, such as potentially denying legitimate drug needs and unknown administrative costs. These issues should be balanced against the potential protections such a program can provide. Doctor shopping for frequently abused drugs can increase the cost of the Part D program and jeopardize patient care. Controls proven to reduce doctor shopping could be considered by CMS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS review its findings and consider steps such as a restricted recipient program for identified doctor shoppers and seek congressional authority, as appropriate.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug  overdoses, including those from prescription drugs, are the second  leading cause of deaths from unintentional injuries in the United States,  exceeded only by motor vehicle fatalities. Unlike addiction to heroin and  other drugs that have no accepted medical use, addiction to some  controlled substances can be unknowingly financed by insurance  companies and public programs, such as Medicare. There are reports  and allegations that criminals and drug abusers are able to illegitimately  acquire controlled substances by filing fraudulent claims, seeking  treatment from medical practitioners for feigned injuries and illnesses, and  perpetrating other fraudulent activities. The financial cost associated with  controlled substance fraud and abuse is more than the cost of drug  purchases since there are related medical services, such as doctor and  emergency room visits, that precede the dispensing of these medications.", "GAO reported, in September 2009, on an investigation of Medicaid fraud  and abuse related to controlled substances in selected states. The  investigation found about 65,000 Medicaid beneficiaries and providers  involved in potential fraudulent or abusive purchases of controlled  substances in five selected states. These Medicaid beneficiaries in the  five selected states acquired the same class of controlled substance from  six or more different medical practitioners during fiscal years 2006 and  2007. Such activities, known as doctor shopping, resulted in about   $63 million in Medicaid payments. According to the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA), doctor shopping generally refers to visits by an  individual to several doctors, each of whom writes a prescription for a  controlled substance. The individual will visit several pharmacies,  receiving more of the drug than intended by any single physician, typically  for the purpose of abuse. Based on the findings from the Medicaid  investigation, you expressed concern about whether similar doctor  shopping was taking place in the Medicare Part D program.", "Medicare Part D provides voluntary, outpatient prescription drug coverage  for eligible individuals 65 years and older and eligible individuals with  disabilities. The Medicare Part D program, which began in January 2006,  is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS contracts with  private companies\u2014such as health insurance companies and pharmacy  benefit managers\u2014to serve as Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.  Over 27 million individuals were enrolled in Medicare Part D in 2010 and  benefit expenditures were about $53 billion. Because of Medicare\u2019s  vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse, GAO has designated Medicare  as a high-risk program. We and HHS\u2019s Inspector General have  previously reported that the size, nature, and complexity of the Medicare  Part D program make it particularly at risk for fraud, waste, and abuse.  You asked us to (1) determine the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries  obtained frequently abused drugs from multiple medical prescribers,   (2) identify examples of doctor shopping activity, and (3) determine the  actions taken by CMS to limit access to prescription drugs for known  abusers.", "To determine the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries obtained  frequently abused drugs through the prescriptions of multiple medical  prescribers, we extracted the claims for the 14 selected classes of drugs  from the approximately 1 billion Medicare Part D paid claims for calendar  year 2008. From this subset of claims we determined the number of  beneficiaries who saw at least five different medical practitioners for the  same class of drugs. We selected the 14 classes of drugs, 12 of which  are controlled substances, and the five or more prescribers threshold  based on our review of drug diversion literature and prior GAO work and  discussions with a criminal investigator whose recognized expertise is in  drug diversion and with an official representing state prescription drug  monitoring programs. To determine the total number of different  prescribers from which a beneficiary received a prescription, we identified  and totaled the number of different prescribers shown in each  beneficiary\u2019s claims data by each class of drug. Some duplication may  have occurred in our estimate of doctor shoppers because the Medicare  Part D prescription claims identify prescribers using either their own  identifier or a group practice identifier. However, our analysis showed that  the extent of claims with group level identifiers was insignificant.", "To identify examples of doctor shopping activity, we selected  beneficiaries from those identified as seeing at least five different medical  practitioners for the same class of drugs from a nonrepresentative  selection of five states: California, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts,  and Texas. These states were selected based on geographical location  and to provide a mixture of states that did and did not have programs for  monitoring prescriptions for controlled substances. We further narrowed  the number of individuals for our investigation primarily based on data  showing a high number of prescriptions filled within the 14 classes of  drugs, a high number of different prescribers involved, and the overlap of  prescriptions. To further develop these examples, we identified  overlapping prescriptions for the same class of drug from different  prescribers, and interviewed selected employees from pharmacies and  medical practitioners to confirm that these individuals were doctor  shopping. Although our 10 case studies allowed us to identify issues  related to the doctor shopping of Medicare Part D drugs, circumstances of  each case are unique and cannot be generalized.", "To determine the actions taken by CMS to limit access to prescription  drugs for known abusers, we obtained and reviewed agency documents,  including CMS regulations and program integrity requirements related to  Medicare Part D. We also interviewed policy officials from CMS, CMS\u2019s  fraud contractor, and three Medicare Part D contractors. We selected the  Medicare Part D contractors based primarily on the number of  beneficiaries enrolled in their plans whom we identified as potential doctor  shoppers for these 14 classes of highly abusive drugs.

Further, DEA has also stated that diverted controlled  prescription drugs have been added to the supplies of some illicit drug  distributors.

An  intervention might consist of an informational letter to the medical  practitioner; a response form for the medical practitioner to complete,  along with a preaddressed return envelope; and a patient drug profile.  However, the effectiveness of such a notification may be limited because  the physicians can overlook the intervention letters, or if a request for a  prescription is denied by one physician, the beneficiary can go to another  physician for the desired prescription.", "Although not currently used in the Medicare Part D program, officials from  the Part D plan sponsors we interviewed stated that additional controls  already in place in the Medicaid program and in some private sector plans  could be used to better restrict the dispensing of abused drugs, such as  hydrocodone and oxycodone, to individuals identified as doctor shoppers  through detecting a pattern of abuse during retrospective analysis. Such  programs employ a restricted recipient program, where prescription drug  plans restrict beneficiaries who have been identified as drug abusers to  one prescriber, one pharmacy, or both for receiving prescriptions.  However, according to CMS policy officials, the restricted recipient  program cannot be utilized in the Medicare Part D program because MMA  did not authorize CMS to establish such restrictions on beneficiaries. As  such, Part D plan sponsors are prevented from implementing these  controls on specific individuals to prevent doctor shopping. There are  issues to consider with a restricted recipient program, such as potentially  denying legitimate drug needs and unknown costs for administration.", "These costs include developing and implementing criteria and procedures  for placing individuals in the program, allowing them to change providers  as appropriate, and ultimately releasing them from the program.", "Effective retrospective DURs require prescription drug plans to be able to  share information about individuals identified as doctor shoppers with  other Part D plans, as appropriate.

As a result, a Medicare Part D plan sponsor cannot forewarn  another Medicare Part D plan sponsor when an identified doctor shopper  has left its plan and enrolled in another. Because Medicare Part D  beneficiaries can change prescription drug plans on at least a yearly  basis, beneficiaries may be able to switch plans and continue their  doctor shopping activity. Thus, to prevent known doctor shoppers from  circumventing a restricted recipient program, a mechanism would also  need to be established that allows CMS or its fraud contractor to inform  the new plan of the doctor shopping activities of the beneficiary.
