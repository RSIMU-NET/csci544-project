For example, in its 2012 report, USCIRF recommended that the Secretary of State designate Turkey as a CPC. Because the Ambassador-at-Large was not regularly attending USCIRF meetings at the time, State officials learned of the commissioners' intent shortly before USCIRF published its report. State officials explained that Turkey did not warrant CPC designation, as it had taken steps to improve religious freedom, but USCIRF proceeded with its recommendation.

To date, Iraq, Vietnam, the  Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime, and the Taliban regime are the only entities that State  has removed from the CPC list.CPC in 2004, the Ambassador negotiated an action plan with the  Vietnamese government whereby the government, among other things,  would pass a law to reduce religious persecution. On the basis of  subsequent actions by the Vietnamese government, State removed  Vietnam from the list in 2006.

The report contains three sections that, respectively, highlight the countries that USCIRF recommends that the Secretary of  State designate as CPCs for particularly severe violations of religious  freedom;  focus on the countries USCIRF has placed on a watch list for serious  violations of religious freedom that do not meet the CPC threshold but  require very close attention; and discuss other countries and issues of concern.", "The CPC and watch list sections of the report are divided by country and  includes a summary of religious freedom conditions in that country, U.S.  government policies and actions taken in the country, and policy  recommendations for the U.S. government.", "USCIRF officials stated that the policy directors, the executive director,  and commissioners review the report for accuracy and tone. USCIRF staff  said that they verify information in the report with State officials, NGOs,  and religious communities. Commissioners deliberate and vote on which  countries they want to categorize as CPCs, place on the watch list, or  identify as additional countries of concern. After commissioners make a  determination for each country, staff members prepare the country  chapters and circulate them to the commissioners for review.  Commissioners\u2019 dissenting opinions are included in the report when  voting is not unanimous. For example, in USCIRF\u2019s 2012 annual report, a  commissioner dissented from the CPC recommendation for Iraq, stating  that USCIRF\u2019s report, among other things, did \u201cnot establish either that  the government  engaged itself in severe violations or that it  tolerated them.\u201d Further, the commissioner stated that USCIRF\u2019s report  \u201conly establishes the existence of such violations and the inability of the  government to prevent them always (or prevent them often).\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIRF Has Provided Technical Assistance and Recommendations to Foreign Officials", "paragraphs": ["In addition to carrying out the primary responsibilities laid out in the Act,  USCIRF at times has provided technical assistance and  recommendations to foreign officials through meetings, letters, press  releases, and editorials. Examples of these activities include the  following.", "Meetings with foreign officials. During meetings abroad, USCIRF has  provided assistance to foreign governments and at times has called  directly for policy changes. For instance, according to USCIRF\u2019s 2011  annual report, USCIRF worked with members of the Indonesian  House of Representatives and civil society groups to introduce  measures to strengthen criminal code provisions regarding attacks on  religious gatherings and to amend laws governing the building of  religious venues. Further, during its 2011 visit to Saudi Arabia,  USCIRF said that it called on high-level Saudi officials to release long- term religious prisoner Hadi Al-Mutif from prison and raised concerns  about six young Shi\u2019a Muslim prisoners.", "Writing letters to foreign officials. USCIRF provided policy  recommendations to foreign officials through letters. In June 2010,  USCIRF wrote a letter to the Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey  about reports of Turkish government interference in the election of the  Armenian Orthodox Patriarch, requesting additional information and  urging the removal of governmental constraints on such internal  church matters. In June 2011, USCIRF wrote to the Head of Mission  of the Government of South Sudan, providing a review of the draft of  the Government of South Sudan\u2019s interim constitution and offering  suggestions to strengthen the freedom of religion or belief provisions.", "Writing press releases. According to USCIRF officials, it issues press  releases in response to current events and at times has used press  releases to urge foreign officials to take actions. For example, in a  May 2011 press release, USCIRF provided recommendations to the  government of Egypt. USCIRF recommended, among other things,  that the government establish a special unit in the Office of the Public  Prosecutor that would be dedicated to investigating acts of violence  against Egyptian citizens on the basis of religion or belief, particularly  Coptic Orthodox Christians; vigorously prosecuting, and bringing to  justice, perpetrators of these acts; and ensuring compensation for  victims. In addition, in a July 2012 press release, USCIRF urged  China\u2019s government to lift its restrictions on all peaceful religious  activities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, especially during  the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.", "Writing editorials. USCIRF commissioners have written editorials that  also urge foreign officials to take actions related to religious freedom.  For example in a November 2011 editorial, USCIRF commissioners  stated that Pakistan\u2019s government should replace current public  school textbooks with ones that exclude messages of intolerance,  hatred, or violence based on religious or other differences. Also, in a  January 2012 editorial, USCIRF commissioners wrote that \u201cNigeria\u2019s  political establishment, including President Goodluck Jonathan and  other leaders, should muster the will and courage not only to curb the  strife but to bring all perpetrators to justice.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and USCIRF Have Not Defined How They Should Interact, Which Has at Times Created Foreign Policy Tensions", "paragraphs": ["Although the Act, as amended, directs State and USCIRF to cooperate,  they have not defined how they should interact.

Some former commissioners said that without the Ambassador\u2019s regular  participation, USCIRF had difficulty getting access to State policymakers  to discuss religious freedom. One former commissioner said that such  access would have enriched USCIRF\u2019s recommendations. At the same  time, two of the current commissioners said that USCIRF could improve  its efforts to understand State\u2019s diplomatic efforts with regard to religious  freedom.", "The Ambassadors also provided varying interpretations of the ex-officio  role. They said, for example, that the Ambassador should be an active  participant at USCIRF meetings during every discussion, short of voting;  that the Ambassador\u2019s role was to explain State activities and actions to  USCIRF and that USCIRF, conversely, should include the Ambassador  on e-mails and other forms of internal communication; and that the  Ambassador has no clear role on USCIRF but should try to attend as  many USCIRF commissioner meetings as possible. One of the  Ambassadors said that commissioners did not always include him in e- mail conversations and exchanges, resulting in a loss of communication.  For example, he said that at times commissioners withheld documents  and e-mail communications from the Ambassador\u2019s office or only shared  drafts of press releases at the last minute, thereby inhibiting the  Ambassador\u2019s ability to convey State\u2019s perspective or correct factual  errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and USCIRF\u2019s Interaction Has Fluctuated", "paragraphs": ["The level of interaction between the Ambassador and USCIRF has varied  greatly over the years.

However, that Ambassador said he  had discussed his ex-officio role with USCIRF only once, during a debate,  when a commissioner told him he should not be participating. State and  USCIRF officials told us that the second Ambassador began his tenure by  regularly attending the monthly USCIRF meetings, but he attended less  frequently over time. Former State officials and USCIRF officials said that  both entities considerably decreased their official communication, in part  because of disagreement over how they should work together.", "As the level of interaction between the Ambassador and commissioners  has varied over the years, so has the level of interaction between their  staffs. According to State and USCIRF officials, when the Ambassador  and commissioners had little official interaction, their staffs had little  interaction as well, although they did try to maintain some informal  collaboration. For example, according to one former Office staff member,  during a period of little official interaction and even discouragement of  staff interaction, he and the USCIRF executive director began meeting for  lunch to maintain a line of communication. In addition, a former  commissioner noted that when the Ambassador\u2019s position was vacant for  2 \u00bd years, USCIRF\u2019s contact with State was primarily at the staff level.", "More recently, according to the current Ambassador and USCIRF  officials, they have increased their interaction from its previously low level,  with both a new Ambassador and a largely new commission in place. For  example, from 2009 to 2011, USCIRF and State officials, including  officials from the Office of International Religious Freedom, collaborated  on efforts that led to the passage of UN Resolution 16/18 to combat  religious intolerance. The Ambassador now participates in the lunchtime  portions of discussions during some of the monthly meetings, although  she generally does not participate in USCIRF\u2019s monthly teleconferences.  The Ambassador and the current USCIRF chair also have been joint  presenters at various forums, both in the United States and abroad. In  October 2012, for example, they gave a joint speech on religious freedom  at Europe\u2019s largest annual human rights and democracy conference,  sponsored by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  In addition, staff from the Office and USCIRF staff stated that they share  information with each other more now than in the past.

For example, USCIRF recommended in its 2012  annual report that the Secretary of State designate Turkey as a CPC. The  Ambassador was not regularly attending USCIRF meetings at the time,  and State officials learned of USCIRF\u2019s intent to recommend Turkey only  shortly before USCIRF published its report in March 2012. State officials  tried to engage the commissioners and explain State\u2019s position against  such a recommendation, but USCIRF proceeded to recommend Turkey  for CPC designation. Turkish officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  said in a press release that USCIRF\u2019s report directly contradicted State\u2019s  annual report on religious freedom, and called the USCIRF report \u201cnull  and void.\u201d State officials told us that they had to resolve the resulting  tensions with the Turkish government. In June 2012, a senior State  official briefed USCIRF regarding State\u2019s position on Turkey, namely, that  because the Turkish government had taken actions to improve religious  freedom in the country, Turkey did not deserve CPC designation.", "In addition, according to State officials, because the Ambassador and  commissioners have not defined how they should interact, they have at  times communicated conflicting information to foreign governments on  behalf of the United States. For example, 5 days after USCIRF  recommended Turkey for CPC designation in March 2012, the President  publicly congratulated the Turkish prime minister on efforts he had made  to protect religious minorities in Turkey. In addition, one Ambassador said  that in meetings with foreign-government officials, he sometimes not only  had to explain the function of USCIRF, but\u2014because some statements  by commissioners were not in line with U.S. foreign policy\u2014he also had  to clarify that USCIRF did not speak for him, even as an ex-officio  member of the commission, or for the U.S. government.", "All three Ambassadors cited instances when USCIRF\u2019s approach with  foreign-government officials created bilateral tensions. For example, the  first Ambassador recounted helping to bring a delegation of high-level  Laotian officials to the United States to tour, meet with government  officials and religious communities, and view examples of religious  freedom.they freed 34 of 37 people imprisoned for their religious beliefs. The  Ambassador told us that as a result, he had judged that Laos was making  progress in instituting some real changes in the area of religious freedom;  however, USCIRF recommended Laos for CPC designation shortly  thereafter. The Ambassador said that USCIRF\u2019s recommendation almost  ruined State\u2019s diplomatic efforts to address religious freedom in Laos. In  another example, in 2005, the second Ambassador negotiated an action  plan with the Vietnamese government including actions that, if taken by  the government, could support its case for removal from the CPC list.  According to State officials, Vietnam took the necessary steps and the  Secretary of State removed the country\u2019s CPC designation in 2006.  However, when USCIRF commissioners visited Vietnam later that year,  according to State and Vietnamese officials, they offended the  Vietnamese officials by their conduct in high-level meetings. State officials  told us that this was damaging to some of the progress made with  Vietnamese officials and necessitated efforts to repair the U.S.  relationship with Vietnam.", "According to the Ambassador, when the delegation returned,  Some State, USCIRF, and NGO officials we spoke with raised other  concerns about the role USCIRF has played with respect to U.S. foreign  policy. According to a former commissioner, during her tenure on  USCIRF, commissioners became bolder in speaking out in letters or  during meetings with foreign officials, and it was unclear to her whether  these activities were within the bounds of the Act. Also, USCIRF officials  told us that the commission has at times applied an expansive  interpretation of the Act, questioning whether the responsibilities in the  Act were a \u201cfloor or a ceiling.\u201d They also said that, under USCIRF\u2019s  mandate to provide recommendations to the U.S. government on  religious freedom, USCIRF has the obligation to help foreign  governments take actions to address U.S. critiques. Some former  commissioners said that foreign governments have at times requested  advice or assistance from USCIRF and that, in general, USCIRF urged or  made recommendations to foreign officials when it thought the  recommendations were consistent with U.S. foreign policy.

In addition, the mandate included a  specific requirement that we consult with nongovernmental organizations  (NGO) in preparing the report. In response to the mandate, this report  assesses (1) the Department of State\u2019s (State) implementation of its  primary responsibilities established in the International Religious Freedom  Act of 1998 (the Act); (2) the U.S. Commission on International Religious  Freedom\u2019s (USCIRF) implementation of its primary responsibilities  established in the Act; (3) State\u2019s and USCIRF\u2019s interaction in their efforts  to promote religious freedom; and (4) NGOs\u2019 views on U.S. efforts to  promote international religious freedom. The mandate also directed us to  compare USCIRF with other advisory commissions; for this analysis, we  summarized a previous Congressional Research Service report (see app.  II).", "To address our four objectives, we conducted fieldwork in five countries\u2014 Afghanistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. We selected  these countries on the basis of their meeting at least two of the following  criteria: (1) State had funded international religious freedom programs in  the country; (2) the country was on USCIRF\u2019s watch list; (3) USCIRF had  recommended the country for designation as a Country of Particular  Concern (CPC) or State had designated it as a CPC; and (4) the  Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom (the  Ambassador) or USCIRF had visited the country in the previous 3 years.  Specifically:", "Afghanistan. State had funded international religious freedom  programs in the country. In addition, USCIRF had included  Afghanistan on its watch list for several years and visited the country  in 2010.", "Indonesia. State had funded international religious freedom programs  in the country, and USCIRF had included Indonesia on its watch list  for several years.", "Turkey. USCIRF recommended Turkey for CPC designation for the  first time in 2012, but according to State officials, State did not agree  with the recommendation. The Ambassador and USCIRF had both  traveled to Turkey in the previous 3 years.", "Uzbekistan. State had designated Uzbekistan as a CPC for several  years and had waived sanctions against it. The Ambassador had  traveled to Uzbekistan in the last year.", "Vietnam. State had funded an international religious freedom program  in the country. State removed Vietnam from the CPC list in 2006,  making it one of only two countries that State had ever removed from  the CPC list. The Ambassador had traveled there in the last year.", "While in each country, we interviewed State embassy officials, including  the U.S. Ambassador to the country and the International Religious  Freedom officer. We also interviewed representatives from host  governments, NGOs, and religious communities. In two countries we  visited, we also met with officials from third-country embassies.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed the provisions of the Act and  identified the primary responsibilities that the Act established for State.  We also analyzed State documents, including cables, grant materials,  State\u2019s annual International Religious Freedom Report, the 2003 State  Inspector General\u2019s Report of Inspection: Bureau for Democracy, Human  Rights and Labor, and the Inspector General\u2019s 2005 Compliance Follow- up Review on the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. We  also met with State officials, including staff from the Office of International  Religious Freedom, all three Ambassadors-at-Large for International  Religious Freedom\u2014two former and one present\u2014and senior level  officials such as an Assistant Secretary and two Under Secretaries in  Washington, D.C. We requested that State provide us with cables to  demonstrate the type of activities it undertook from January 2009 through  October 2012 to (1) promote or improve international religious freedom  and (2) document international religious freedom issues. State provided  us with 183 unclassified cables, five of which were duplicates. State also  identified more than 100 additional classified cables that pertained to  CPCs, but State did not provide those cables to us in time for us to  analyze them for this report. This analysis does not provide a full list of all  religious freedom\u2013related activities that State conducted worldwide during  this time period, because (1) not all activities are reported in cables; (2)  State may not have located all the relevant cables sent during this time  period; and (3) we did not receive the classified cables in time for us to  analyze them for this report. See appendix III for a summary of our  analysis of the cables.", "In response to our request that State identify all of its grants related to  international religious freedom, State provided us with a list of 27 grants  that it had grouped either globally or by region of the world. For our  analysis, we selected seven grants that generally represented the largest  award amount in each region of the world and that included both ongoing  and completed grants as well as a grant in one of our fieldwork countries.  We also selected a seventh grant that was not country specific from the  global programs category. For each of these seven grants, we reviewed  the grant\u2019s goals and objectives, how the grant implementer measured  progress toward those goals, and whether the implementer reported  meeting the goals.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed the provisions of the Act,  identified the primary responsibilities that the Act established for USCIRF,  and analyzed USCIRF documents such as its annual report on  international religious freedom, letters to U.S. government officials,  editorials, and press releases. To determine how USCIRF implemented  its primary responsibilities, we also interviewed USCIRF staff and 20 of  the 33 commissioners appointed to USCIRF, including all of the current  commissioners. In addition, we also interviewed all three Ambassadors- at-Large\u2014two former and one present\u2014who serve as ex-officio members  of USCIRF. We conducted these interviews in or near Washington, D.C.", "To address our third objective, we met with officials from State and  USCIRF, including all three Ambassadors-at-Large\u2014two former and one  present\u2014and all of the current and approximately half of the former  USCIRF commissioners. We also interviewed State and foreign- government officials in our fieldwork countries, as well as NGO officials  both in the United States and abroad who have worked closely with both  entities. In addition, we analyzed State cables as well as documents from  USCIRF, including press releases, editorials, and their annual reports.", "To address our fourth objective, we conducted a survey of NGOs that we  identified from five sources: (1) State\u2019s Office of International Religious  Freedom\u2019s list of 30 most-consulted NGOs; (2) USCIRF\u2019s list of NGOs  that the commission has worked, or been in contact, with; (3) members of  the Secretary of State\u2019s Religion and Foreign Policy Working Group; (4) a  list of NGOs participating in the International Religious Freedom  Roundtable in Washington, D.C.; and (5) the Pew Online Directory of  Religious Advocacy Groups, which the Pew Research Center\u2019s Pew  Forum on Religion and Public Life developed. These sources produced a  list of 317 unique NGOs. To determine the universe of NGOs from our  five sources, we contacted each NGO and identified 137 that had  conducted work related to international religious freedom. We developed  a web-based survey instrument in August 2012 and pretested it with 6  NGOs. The survey contained closed- and open-ended questions in four  general areas: (1) demographics, (2) State\u2019s international religious  freedom activities, (3) USCIRF\u2019s international religious freedom activities,  and (4) general U.S. policy on international religious freedom. We sent  the web-based survey to all 137 NGOs via e-mail in September 2012.  However, we removed six NGOs from our universe of 137, resulting in a  universe of 131 NGOs, after 5 NGOs responded that they did not conduct  work related to religious freedom and we determined that one NGO was a  duplicate. We received 84 responses to our survey, or a 64 percent  response rate. The results of the survey reflect the views of only the  respondents to our survey and cannot be generalized either to the  universe of 131 organizations or to any other organizations that are  involved in these types of issues. See appendix IV for selected survey  results.", "We administered the web-based survey from September 5 to October 18,  2012. We sent each NGO an e-mail invitation to complete the survey on a  GAO web server using a unique username and password. During the  data collection period, we sent reminder e-mails and made phone calls to  nonresponding NGOs. Because this was not a sample survey, it had no  sampling errors; however, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce nonsampling errors, such as difficulties in  interpreting a particular question, which can introduce unwanted  variability in the survey results. We took steps to minimize nonsampling  errors by pretesting the questionnaire with six NGOs representing  different religious traditions or no religious affiliation. We conducted  pretests to ensure that the questions were clear and unbiased, that the  data and information were readily obtainable, and that the questionnaire  did not place an undue burden on respondents. Additionally, a senior  GAO methodologist independently reviewed a draft of the questionnaire  prior to its administration. We made appropriate revisions to the content  and format of the questionnaire after the pretests. All data analysis of  survey results were independently verified for accuracy.", "In addition, we conducted a limited content analysis of open-ended  responses to five survey questions. We developed initial categories for  selected questions with open-ended responses, to characterize the  general theme of the response. For responses to questions asking about  the credibility of each report, we developed the following categories:  Timeliness (described as the frequency and/or timing of the reports);  Effectiveness; Specific; CPC; Lack of Objectivity (initially coded as  \u201cBias\u201d); Lack of Input; Composition/Format; Contrast; and Lack of  Resources. For questions elaborating on the perception of the usefulness  of each report, we developed the following categories: Specific; Policy  (regarding the formulation/motivation of U.S. international religious  freedom policy); CPC; Contrast; Limited (meaning the State or USCIRF  report has a circumscribed impact); and Not Applicable. For the question  asking NGOs to provide their suggestions on ways to improve U.S.  promotion of international religious freedom, we developed the following  categories: Inclusion; Measurement; Enforcement; Empowerment;  Awareness; Prioritize; Specific; and Not Applicable. One analyst coded  the responses with at least one category, with an optional second  category. After the initial coding, a second analyst independently  assigned categories to the same responses. The analysts then reconciled  the two sets of coding, assigning a final determination to each response.  A methodologist then reviewed the categories, making language changes  as needed. These results were then tabulated.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2012 to March 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

CRS grouped the  current 85 congressional commissions in four categories: (1) policy  advisory bodies, (2) commemorative advisory bodies, (3) operational  advisory bodies, and (4) diplomatic advisory bodies.
