All agency officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed said the likelihood of illegal timber export and substitution is low, citing several reasons, including economic factors associated with log markets, which have changed over the years. For example, many officials and stakeholders said the timber harvested from federal lands is smaller and of lower quality compared to what was harvested in the 1990s, making it less likely to be exported.", "The Forest Service and BLM did not issue new regulations related to illegal federal timber export and substitution, and some agency policies related to export and substitution are outdated or unclear. The agencies did not issue regulations to implement the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997, as required by the act. Without issuing new regulations or obtaining legislative relief from this requirement, the agencies will continue to be out of compliance with the act. The agencies have policies to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution, such as policies that require the marking of logs to identify them as coming from federal lands. However, the agencies have not reviewed their policies for continued relevance and effectiveness as called for by federal standards for internal control, and some policies are outdated or unclear. For example, Forest Service policy calls for the collection of a certification form to help determine whether timber purchasers are engaged in export or substitution, but the form expired in 1999. Also, it is unclear what BLM considers a violation of the export ban because agency policy does not define what constitutes a violation. Forest Service officials said the agency has not reviewed its policies since 1997, largely due to competing priorities, but agreed it would be beneficial to do so. BLM officials said they reviewed the agency's export regulations in 2010, but this effort did not include a review of timber export policies.

The law also prohibits  purchasers from using timber harvested from federal lands in their  processing facilities while exporting nonfederal unprocessed timber that  could have been used in those facilities\u2014known as substitution.", "Restrictions on federal timber export and substitution were put in place  decades ago to help sustain the domestic timber-processing industry at a  time when large volumes of timber were being exported from the United  States. For example, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1968 restricted the  volume of timber that could be harvested and exported in unprocessed  form from federal lands. The Forest Resources Conservation and  Shortage Relief Act of 1997 updated the export restrictions and currently  governs federal log exports. The Forest Service, within the Department  of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), within the  Department of the Interior, implement and enforce the restrictions.

The agencies reported that they had no  documentation of violations. The Forest Service provided documentation  about potential violations it had investigated but not substantiated, which  we reviewed. To obtain background information and corroborate agency  information, we searched various databases, such as ProQuest, to  identify articles on illegal timber export and substitution. Based on our  review of these articles, we did not identify violations of the ban that had  occurred during this time period. We performed these searches from June  2017 to August 2017.", "In addition, we interviewed Forest Service and BLM officials about the  number of timber export and substitution violations or potential violations  during calendar years 2007 through 2017, agency actions taken in  response, and officials\u2019 views about the likelihood of illegal timber export  and substitution. Specifically, we interviewed Forest Service and BLM  headquarters officials, regional officials in the six Forest Service regions  with forests subject to the 1997 act, and officials at one national forest in  each region. We selected these forests after discussions with regional  officials about the forests they viewed as having the greatest potential risk  of export or substitution because of proximity to export facilities, the  amount of timber sold, or other factors. We also interviewed officials from  the BLM Oregon/Washington State Office and the five western Oregon  BLM districts where most of BLM\u2019s timber program is concentrated.  Table 1 provides a list of Forest Service and BLM offices included in our  review.", "To gain a broader perspective about the likelihood of illegal timber export  and substitution, we also interviewed nonfederal stakeholders, including  state forestry officials, academic researchers, and representatives of  trade associations representing federal timber purchasers, loggers, and  mill owners. We selected these stakeholders to provide a range of  perspectives on the issue of timber export and substitution. Table 2 lists  the stakeholder organizations we interviewed.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed federal laws to identify  relevant legal provisions regarding the prohibition on the export and  substitution of unprocessed federal timber. We also reviewed agency  regulations and policies related to illegal federal timber export and  substitution. We interviewed agency officials described above to identify  key policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal  timber export and substitution.", "In addition, we reviewed each agency\u2019s implementation of those policies  that require the agency to collect forms or conduct inspections. To  determine the extent to which BLM collected required contract forms  certifying that purchasers had not illegally exported or substituted federal  timber, we requested contract forms for a random sample of timber sale  contracts that closed in fiscal year 2017 from each of the five western  Oregon BLM districts included in our review, for a total of 22 contracts.  We reviewed contract forms included in each timber sale contract to  determine whether each district collected and maintained the required  forms. Because the Forest Service does not collect certification forms, we  did not perform a similar review of Forest Service contracts.", "To determine the extent to which the agencies conducted surveillance at  log export facilities, we requested agency inspection reports for  surveillance conducted in 2017 for the 14 log export facilities in California,  Oregon, and Washington that were identified as operational at the time of  our review. Forest Service regional officials identified and provided  reports for 6 facilities in California. For Oregon and Washington  combined, Forest Service regional officials identified 6 log export facilities  and provided reports for 1 facility. BLM officials identified and provided  reports for 2 facilities in Oregon. We reviewed the inspection reports for  each facility to determine the number of inspections that were conducted,  and, where applicable, to determine whether the number of inspections  conformed with agency policy.", "To gain a broader perspective about agency implementation of timber  sale program activities, we reviewed Forest Service \u201cTimber and Log  Accountability Audits\u201d\u2014internal evaluations of regional and forest-level  timber sale activities. We reviewed the most recent evaluation of each  of the six regions with forests subject to the federal timber export and  substitution ban and the most recent evaluation of at least one national  forest in five of these regions, selected as described above. We also  reviewed the agencies\u2019 general timber sale administration policies to gain  a better understanding of the extent to which these policies address the  issue of export and substitution. We compared agency policies and  practices with relevant portions of the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government to assess the extent to which agency policies and  practices aligned with the standards.", "In addition, to address both objectives, we conducted a site visit to Coos  Bay, Oregon in September 2017. We selected this location due to its  proximity to a BLM field office, active logging sites on federal lands, and  log export facilities. During this site visit, we met with agency officials at  BLM\u2019s Coos Bay district; traveled to an active logging site where we  observed a timber harvesting operation and met with logging operators;  and visited a log export facility, where we observed logs being prepared  for export and met with the export facility manager and a timber company  official.", "We also reviewed reports and studies related to timber export and  substitution, including reports from the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest  Research Station, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Foreign Agricultural  Service, and Oregon State University.

This legislation was enacted after the Secretaries of  Agriculture and the Interior issued joint orders calling for this restriction,  deeming it necessary to maintain a viable domestic wood-processing  industry. As we previously found, in the early 1960s, export of federal  timber was generally not viewed as a concern, but as exports of federal,  private, and other timber increased, public and private concerns grew  about the effect of unrestricted log exports on the domestic wood- processing industry. For example, the percentage of timber harvested in  Oregon and Washington that was exported grew from approximately 6  percent in 1965 to about 18 percent in 1972.", "In 1973, a provision was included in the Interior and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act of 1974 that, in effect, prohibited the export of  unprocessed timber harvested from federal lands west of the 100th  meridian in the contiguous 48 states. (Figure 1 shows the location of the  100th meridian and Forest Service- and BLM-managed lands.) The 1973  provision also prohibited purchasers from using timber harvested from  federal lands in their processing facilities while exporting nonfederal  unprocessed timber that could have been used in those facilities, an  activity referred to as substitution. The provision also stated that the  limitation on export and substitution did not apply to species of timber the  agencies have determined to be surplus to domestic lumber and plywood  manufacturing needs.", "In 1990, the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of  1990 made permanent the ban on exporting unprocessed logs from  western federal lands and provided for greater restrictions on  substitution. Under the 1990 act, however, it is not considered  substitution if a company purchases federal timber from within a particular  \u201csourcing area\u201d and exports nonfederal timber harvested from areas  outside the sourcing area. For example, firms with timber operations in  both Oregon and Washington could purchase federal timber from a  sourcing area in eastern Oregon for manufacture while also purchasing  private timber in Washington for export. The 1990 act required the Forest  Service and Interior to issue, in consultation with each other, coordinated  and consistent regulations implementing the act on the lands under their  respective jurisdictions.", "The Forest Service issued a series of regulations to implement the 1990  act, the most comprehensive of which was issued September 8, 1995.  In a provision contained in the act providing appropriations to the Forest  Service for fiscal year 1996, Congress effectively suspended  implementation of the 1995 regulation to allow the administration,  Congress, and affected parties more time to address policy issues with  respect to the 1990 act. The Forest Service\u2019s fiscal year 1997  appropriation act contained a similar provision. BLM did not issue  regulations implementing the 1990 act.", "In 1997, Congress amended the 1990 act. Among other things, the  Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997 relaxed  substitution restrictions in Washington State and allowed the Forest  Service and BLM to reduce the penalties imposed for violating the act by  taking into account \u201call relevant mitigating factors, including mistake,  inadvertence, and error.\u201d The 1997 act also suspended the Forest  Service\u2019s 1995 regulations implementing the 1990 act and directed the  agencies to issue new coordinated and consistent regulations  implementing the act by June 1998.

Domestically, the volume of timber harvested from Forest  Service lands each year has declined from about 12.4 billion board feet in  1973 to 2.6 billion board feet in 2017. The number of domestic mills  along the Pacific Coast has also decreased, mostly through mill closures.  For example, from 1996 to 2016, the number of mills in Washington State  declined from 186 to 88. In addition, since the 1990s, the structure of  the corporate timber industry has changed. For example, many of the  corporate timber companies that once owned both mills and the private  lands to supply those mills have divested some or all of their private  timberlands. Additionally, the value of U.S. softwood log exports has  grown since 2007, with China, Japan, and Canada the three largest  importers of these logs. According to information from the Foreign  Agricultural Service, the value of U.S. softwood log exports grew from  approximately $949 million in 2007 to approximately $1.4 billion in 2017  (in constant 2017 dollars)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Forest Service and BLM Found No Violations of the Export and Substitution Ban from 2007 through 2017, and Officials and Stakeholders Said the Likelihood of Violations is Low", "paragraphs": ["According to Forest Service and BLM officials, the agencies found no  violations of the ban on federal timber export and substitution from 2007  through 2017. Forest Service officials described instances in which the  agency responded to reports of potential violations, but the reports were  not substantiated. All agency officials and stakeholders we interviewed  said that the likelihood of illegal timber export and substitution is low.  However, several officials acknowledged that some risk of violations  exists under certain circumstances.", "From 2007 through 2017, the Forest Service and BLM found no violations  of the federal timber export and substitution ban. Forest Service officials  identified four instances in which the agency investigated potential  violations. For example, in one instance, the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific  Southwest region investigated an incident in 2017 at the Port of  Richmond near Oakland, California. According to the associated  investigation report, an employee at the port\u2019s export facility noticed four  logs were marked as coming from a federal timber sale and reported it to  the Forest Service. Forest Service law enforcement officials conducted an  investigation and determined that the logs came from the Sierra National  Forest and were placed at the facility in error. The purchaser  subsequently delivered the logs to the intended recipient and the agency  took no further action. Forest Service officials said that because the logs  had not been exported, but had been placed at the facility in error with no  intent to export them, the agency determined that there was no violation  of the export ban. In another instance, officials from the agency\u2019s  Southwestern Region said that, in 2010, they identified a case in which a  purchaser cut federal logs, removed the bark, and then exported the logs  to Mexico for use as telephone poles. The officials investigated to  determine whether that type of exporting was legal. The Forest Service  concluded that the purchaser\u2019s activities constituted processing the logs  into end products and therefore the logs were being legally exported.  BLM officials we interviewed did not describe any instances in which they  identified, or were made aware of, potential violations.", "All Forest Service and BLM officials and stakeholders we interviewed said  the likelihood of timber export and substitution violations is low due to a  combination of several factors, including economic factors associated  with log markets and changes in the organizational structure of timber  companies. However, several officials acknowledged that some risk of  violations exists under certain circumstances.", "Economic factors within log markets. Several agency officials and  stakeholders said smaller trees of a lower quality are being harvested  from federal lands compared to the trees harvested in the 1990s.  Several of these officials and stakeholders said there is less demand  and lower value in overseas markets for logs with such  characteristics. A senior official from the Klamath National Forest in  California, for example, said that trees harvested from the forest in the  1980s had log diameters of 35 to 42 inches, but by 2017 the diameter  had decreased to 14 to 18 inches. Additionally, according to statistics  from the State of California, old-growth trees\u2014generally, trees more  than 150 years old\u2014represented nearly 70 percent of timber  harvested in California in 1979, but by 1999 the proportion had fallen  to less than 10 percent. As we have found, old-growth trees can  have more attractive grain characteristics and can be used for higher- value products compared to young-growth trees, which may make the  former more attractive for export. Several officials and stakeholders  also said that the decrease over time in the amount of federal timber  available for sale has made violations less likely. For example,  Oregon Department of Forestry information shows that the volume of  timber harvested on BLM-managed lands in Oregon declined from  about 1.5 billion board feet in 1973 to 182 million board feet in 2016.  Some of these officials and stakeholders said that federal timber is an  important part of domestic sawmill operators\u2019 timber supply, and,  given the reduced amount of federal timber available, sawmill  operators would have little incentive to export logs because doing so  would further reduce their own timber supply.", "Changes in timber company organizational structure. Several  officials and stakeholders said that changes in timber company  organizational structure have also made substitution less likely.  Several officials and stakeholders noted that many Pacific Northwest  timber companies once owned both sawmills and timberland from  which they harvested timber to supply their mills. According to some  officials, under those conditions, the likelihood of substitution was  greater because these companies could have benefitted by exporting  logs from their own lands for a high price while supplying their sawmill  operation with federal timber purchased at a lower price. However,  many timber companies have sold or reorganized over the past 2  decades, resulting in few companies now owning both sawmills and  timberlands, according to some agency officials. In 2009, Oregon  State University reported on this change, noting that \u201calmost all large,  publicly traded forest product companies have shed their timber lands  in the past 20 years, a reflection of global economic pressures, new  tax laws, and other forces.\u201d A 2014 report from the Department of  Agriculture likewise noted this change. Some agency officials said  that, as a result, sawmills generally must buy all of their timber\u2014 whether privately sourced or federal\u2014on the open market, which  provides less incentive for substitution than if these sawmills were  using timber they already owned.", "Several officials also said, however, that some risk of violations remains,  particularly under certain circumstances. For example, some Forest  Service regional officials said that some national forests could be  vulnerable to illegal timber export if log prices or demand for certain tree  species increase in the future. Additionally, several Forest Service  officials expressed concern about having sufficient staff to monitor timber  sales for compliance with relevant requirements, including the ban on  export and substitution, especially in light of potential increases in timber  sales. In particular, officials from four of the six national forests included in  our review said the Forest Service increased the volume of timber their  national forest is expected to offer for sale beginning in fiscal year 2018.  For example, a Boise National Forest official said the forest\u2019s timber sale  target increased from 50 million board feet per year, which has been  consistent over the last decade, to 74 million board feet in fiscal year  2018, with a goal of 96 million board feet per year by fiscal year 2021.  According to some Forest Service officials, higher timber sale targets could reduce the ability of agency staff to carry out timber sale  responsibilities, including monitoring, that help guard against illegal timber  export and substitution. Several Forest Service \u201cTimber and Log  Accountability Audits\u201d\u2014internal evaluations of regional and forest-level  timber sale activities\u2014also noted that reduced staffing levels and  experience were areas of concern in carrying out forests\u2019 timber sale  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Forest Service and BLM Did Not Issue New Regulations Required by Law and Some Policies are Outdated or Unclear", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service and BLM neither issued new regulations as required  by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997  nor obtained legislative relief from the requirement.

Likewise, when a  log truck carries 10 or fewer logs (regardless of the logs\u2019 diameter), all  logs on the truck are to be painted and branded. For truckloads of 11  logs or more, a minimum of 10 logs must be painted and branded on  one end, regardless of the logs\u2019 diameter. BLM policy allows  contracting officers to implement more stringent requirements, such  as requiring purchasers to paint and brand all logs harvested on an  individual timber sale regardless of size or number, but it does not  allow contracting officers to waive the marking requirement.", "Penalizing violators.

Both agencies\u2019 policies for  timber sale administration include mechanisms for monitoring various  activities associated with federal timber sales, including periodically  inspecting timber harvest operations at active logging sites and observing  log trucks carrying cut timber from logging sites to ensure they follow  designated haul routes.

However,  three of the six regions subject to the ban have not established  surveillance procedures because, according to regional officials, they  have no access to ports and therefore the policy is not relevant to  them. However, Forest Service headquarters officials said the  requirement is relevant to all regions having forests subject to the ban,  because federal logs originating from regions without ports could be  transported across regions and exported from another region. These  headquarters officials said that more clarity in the agency\u2019s policy  about establishing regional surveillance procedures may be helpful to  the regions.", "The remaining Forest Service regions subject to the ban\u2014the Pacific  Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern regions, each of which  contains log export facilities\u2014established procedures as called for by  national policy but do not conduct surveillance on a monthly basis.

However, the Pacific Northwest Region\u2019s procedures call for quarterly  surveillance rather than monthly surveillance. The Northern Region  delegates responsibility for surveillance to a national forest in the  Pacific Northwest Region. We reviewed surveillance inspection  reports from calendar year 2017 and found that, during that year, the  Pacific Southwest Region conducted from one to nine inspections of  each of the six facilities regional officials identified as exporting logs\u2014 less than the monthly surveillance called for by regional and national  policy. Officials from the Pacific Northwest Region provided us  calendar year 2017 surveillance information for one of the region\u2019s six  facilities that exported logs that year. For that facility, Forest Service  officials conducted surveillance seven times in 2017, including at least  one inspection per quarter, which is in accordance with regional policy  but not national policy. Officials from both regions said they view the  frequency with which they conduct surveillance to be appropriate. For  example, officials from the Pacific Southwest Region said that when a  port is actively exporting timber, they conduct surveillance at least  once per month, as required by policy. Officials from the Pacific  Northwest Region said they view their frequency of surveillance to be  appropriate, since they view the likelihood of export violations to be  low and they have competing agency priorities.", "BLM policy does not call for surveillance of log export facilities.  However, officials from BLM\u2019s Coos Bay District, which has two log  export facilities, have conducted surveillance since the 1970s as a  way to help detect illegal timber export, according to BLM documents  and officials. Based on our review of 2017 surveillance inspection  reports, BLM officials inspected one export facility twice and the other  facility seven times during that year. Figure 3 shows an example of  unprocessed logs at one of the export facilities in Coos Bay, Oregon.", "Some officials from both agencies said they may in some cases be  unable to conduct surveillance within export facilities because they do  not have clear authority to enter these facilities. BLM headquarters  officials said BLM did not develop a policy calling for surveillance  because the agency did not know whether it had the authority to enter  log export facilities and therefore was not confident that such a policy  could be carried out. Some officials from both agencies said they  generally have been granted access but noted that this is subject to  the willingness of the facility owners. Forest Service and BLM  headquarters officials similarly said the agencies generally do not  have legal authority to board ships or to inspect closed shipping  containers to look for federal logs.", "Certification Requirements. Both agencies\u2019 policies direct the  agencies to collect certification forms to help them determine whether  timber purchasers are engaged in export or substitution. However, the  agencies\u2019 forms are outdated\u2014the Forest Service\u2019s certification form  expired, and some BLM forms reflect legal requirements that are no  longer in effect. Nevertheless, the agencies have not updated their  forms or changed their policies requiring collection of these forms.", "Forest Service policy states that \u201cPrior to award, during the life of the  contract, and for a period of 3 years from the termination date, the  purchaser must furnish, upon request, the volume and geographic  origin of unprocessed timber from private lands that was exported or  sold for export.\u201d The purchaser may submit the information on a  specified Forest Service certification form or \u201cother appropriate  forms.\u201d Forest Service regional officials from three of the six regions  subject to the ban said they do not collect this information because  the certification form, approved by the Office of Management and  Budget, expired in 1999. Some Forest Service officials said updating  and collecting the form could help prevent and detect illegal timber  export and substitution by providing agency officials with information  about purchasers\u2019 activities. One senior headquarters official,  however, noted that the information provided on the form relies on the  purchaser\u2019s self-certification, making it difficult for agency officials to  verify.", "BLM policy requires agency staff to collect a minimum of two  certification forms for each timber sale. One is to be collected before  the sale is approved, to determine whether the timber sale purchaser  has substituted federal timber for exported unprocessed private timber  within a specified time frame. The other is to be collected after the  harvest is completed and before the contract is terminated, to  determine whether purchasers are exporting BLM timber. Two  additional certification forms may be collected when applicable\u2014one  prior to the sale and the other after the harvest is completed\u2014but are  not required for all sales. We reviewed documentation from a sample  of 22 BLM timber sale contracts that closed in 2017 in the five western  Oregon BLM districts and found that BLM collected the required  certification forms for 21 of the 22 contracts. The remaining contract  file was missing a required form. BLM officials said the missing form  could not be located.", "However, the two certification forms BLM can collect before approving  a timber sale reflect legal requirements that are no longer in effect.  According to the 1997 act, a purchaser may not purchase  unprocessed federal timber if \u201csuch person has, during the preceding  24-month period, exported unprocessed timber originating from  private lands.\u201d However, the two BLM certification forms instruct the  purchaser to provide this information for the preceding 12-month  period. Senior BLM officials acknowledged the inconsistency between  these forms and the current legal requirement. They said that the 12- month time frame specified in the certification forms reflects the BLM  regulations issued to implement the appropriations act export  restrictions in the 1970s.", "Investigating Potential Violations. Both agencies have policies for  investigating potential export violations. The Forest Service\u2019s policy  for investigating export violations states that, upon finding a violation,  the contracting officer should contact law enforcement and prepare a  report about the violation, including any planned follow-up actions.  Forest Service headquarters officials said that it is unclear whether  this policy applies only in cases where export violations have been  substantiated or is to be used in instances where violations are  suspected but not confirmed. BLM headquarters officials said that  their personnel are to use policies detailed in the agency\u2019s standard  contract administration procedures, which cover all timber sale  administration violations, to investigate potential and substantiated  export violations. These procedures provide officials discretion in the  actions they take. For example, the procedures state that \u201cmany such  violations may simply be corrected with good verbal communications  between the BLM and purchaser representatives. Other violations  require more forceful action and complete documentation of such  actions.\u201d", "The agencies differ in the extent to which they define what conduct  constitutes an export violation. Forest Service policies do not define  export; however, its regulations do, stating that export can occur at  any of several points\u2014when a person enters into an agreement to  convey logs to another country, when logs are placed in an export  facility in preparation for shipment outside the United States, or when  logs are placed on a ship, train, or other transport destined for a  foreign country. BLM policies and regulations do not define the term  export or state what constitutes an export violation. Officials from both  agencies said that determining whether a violation has occurred  requires judgment on the part of agency staff. For example, according  to these officials, finding logs in an export facility may constitute a  violation, but would require the agency to determine whether the logs  were being prepared for shipment outside the United States. Officials  from both agencies said they would benefit from a clear definition of  export violation.", "In addition, the agencies do not have up-to-date information about  sourcing areas, which is used to determine substitution violations.  Under the 1997 act, manufacturers may not engage in substitution\u2014 that is, exporting timber from private lands while purchasing federal  timber to supply their mills. However, it is not considered substitution if  a company purchases federal timber from within a particular \u201csourcing  area\u201d and exports nonfederal timber harvested from areas outside the  sourcing area. Sourcing areas outside Washington State are subject  to Forest Service or BLM approval, and the agencies are required by  law to review them at least every 5 years. Forest Service  headquarters officials said they had not reviewed sourcing areas for at  least 20 years, and said that over this time, many timber companies  with approved sourcing areas have gone out of business or no longer  purchase national forest timber. Forest Service headquarters officials  said that they did not maintain lists of sourcing areas, and none of the  six Forest Service regions subject to the ban had information about  sourcing areas. BLM provided us a list of sourcing areas identified by  the Forest Service, but the list dates to 1992. Moreover, many Forest  Service and BLM officials we interviewed said they were unfamiliar  with the concept of substitution and sourcing areas. A few officials  said identifying sourcing areas may no longer be relevant given the  changes in the organizational structure of timber companies and the  resulting lower likelihood of substitution.", "According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management should implement control activities through  policies, including by periodically reviewing policies, procedures, and  related control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in  achieving an entity\u2019s objectives or addressing related risks. Forest  Service officials said the agency has not reviewed its policies specific to  export and substitution since the enactment of the 1997 act, largely  because of competing priorities and the officials\u2019 view that the likelihood  of illegal export or substitution is low. Nevertheless, these officials agreed  that it would be beneficial for the Forest Service to review and update its  policies, especially in light of the significant changes to the timber  economy in the past 2 decades. BLM officials said they reviewed the  agency\u2019s export regulations in 2010, but this effort did not include a  review of log export policies. They said they did not believe such a review  would be useful until new regulations are issued, since it is important that  policies conform with regulations. These officials noted that BLM\u2019s  Oregon/Washington State Office updated some of its policies in 2016, but  the officials did not indicate the extent to which the policies were reviewed  for relevance and effectiveness\u2014and, as noted, some BLM policies  appear unclear or are inconsistent with the 1997 act. By reviewing agency  policies and making changes to them as necessary, in accordance with  applicable regulations, the Forest Service and BLM will have better  assurance that their policies are relevant and effective for addressing the  risk of illegal timber export and substitution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["For 50 years, Congress has restricted the export and substitution of  federal timber from the western United States. Since the restrictions were  put in place, substantial changes to the timber economy have occurred,  and agency officials and stakeholders view the likelihood of illegal timber  export and substitution as low. The Forest Service and BLM have various  regulations, policies, and procedures to carry out the ban. However, the  agencies did not issue new regulations as required by the Forest  Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997 and have not  obtained legislative relief from this requirement. As a result, the agencies  are relying on regulations issued before 1995. Without issuing new  coordinated and consistent regulations or obtaining legislative relief, the  Forest Service and BLM will continue to be out of compliance with the  regulation provisions of the 1997 act.", "Further, some agency policies are outdated or unclear. For example,  Forest Service policy calls for collecting a certification form that expired in  1999, and BLM policy does not clearly define what constitutes a violation  of the export ban.
