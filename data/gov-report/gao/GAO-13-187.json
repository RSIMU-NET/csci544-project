Increasingly sophisticated cyber threats have underscored the need to manage and bolster the cybersecurity of key government systems as well as the nation's critical infrastructure. GAO has designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997, and in 2003 expanded it to include cyber critical infrastructure. GAO has issued numerous reports since that time making recommendations to address weaknesses in federal information security programs as well as efforts to improve critical infrastructure protection. Over that same period, the executive branch has issued strategy documents that have outlined a variety of approaches for dealing with persistent cybersecurity issues.", "GAO's objectives were to (1) identify challenges faced by the federal government in addressing a strategic approach to cybersecurity, and (2) determine the extent to which the national cybersecurity strategy adheres to desirable characteristics for such a strategy. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed previous reports and updated information obtained from officials at federal agencies with key cybersecurity responsibilities. GAO also obtained the views of experts in information technology management and cybersecurity and conducted a survey of chief information officers at major federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Threats to systems supporting critical infrastructure and federal operations are evolving and growing. Federal agencies have reported increasing numbers of cybersecurity incidents that have placed sensitive information at risk, with potentially serious impacts on federal and military operations; critical infrastructure; and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive government, private sector, and personal information. The increasing risks are demonstrated by the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents, the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools, and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology. The number of incidents reported by federal agencies to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team has increased 782 percent from 2006 to 2012.", "GAO and inspector general reports have identified a number of key challenge areas in the federal government\u0092s approach to cybersecurity, including those related to protecting the nation\u0092s critical infrastructure. While actions have been taken to address aspects of these, issues remain in each of these challenge areas, including:", "Designing and implementing risk-based federal and critical infrastructure programs . Shortcomings persist in assessing risks, developing and implementing controls, and monitoring results in both the federal government and critical infrastructure. For example, in the federal arena, 8 of 22 major agencies reported compliance with risk management requirements under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), down from 13 out of 24 the year before. In the critical infrastructure arena, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the other sectorspecific agencies have not yet identified cybersecurity guidance applicable to or widely used in each of the critical sectors. GAO has continued to make numerous recommendations to address weaknesses in risk management processes at individual federal agencies and to further efforts by sector-specific agencies to enhance critical infrastructure protection.", "Detecting, responding to, and mitigating cyber incidents . DHS has made incremental progress in coordinating the federal response to cyber incidents, but challenges remain in sharing information among federal agencies and key private sector entities, including critical infrastructure owners, as well as in developing a timely analysis and warning capability. Difficulties in sharing and accessing classified information and the lack of a centralized information-sharing system continue to hinder progress. According to DHS, a secure environment for sharing cybersecurity information, at all classification levels, is not expected to be fully operational until fiscal year 2018. Further, although DHS has taken steps to establish timely analysis and warning, GAO previously reported that the department had yet to establish a predictive analysis capability and recommended that DHS expand capabilities to investigate incidents. According to the department, tools for predictive analysis are to be tested in fiscal year 2013.", "Promoting education, awareness, and workforce planning . In November 2011, GAO reported that agencies leading strategic planning efforts for education and awareness, including Commerce, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management, and DHS, had not developed details on how they were going to achieve planned outcomes and that the specific tasks and responsibilities were unclear. GAO recommended, among other things, that the key federal agencies involved in the initiative collaborate to clarify responsibilities and processes for planning and monitoring their activities. GAO also reported that only 2 of 8 agencies it reviewed developed cyber workforce plans and only 3 of the 8 agencies had a department-wide training program for their cybersecurity workforce. GAO recommended that these agencies take a number of steps to improve agency and government-wide cybersecurity workforce efforts. The agencies generally agreed with the recommendations.", "Promoting research and development (R&D) . The goal of supporting targeted cyber R&D has been impeded by implementation challenges among federal agencies. In June 2010, GAO reported that R&D initiatives were hindered by limited sharing of detailed information about ongoing research, including the lack of a repository to track R&D projects and funding, as required by law. GAO recommended that a mechanism be established for tracking ongoing and completed federal cybersecurity R&D projects and associated funding, and that this mechanism be utilized to develop an ongoing process to make federal R&D information available to federal agencies and the private sector. However, as of September 2012, this mechanism had not yet been fully developed.", "Addressing international cybersecurity challenges . While progress has been made in identifying the importance of international cooperation and assigning roles and responsibilities related to it, the government\u0092s approach to addressing international aspects of cybersecurity has not yet been completely defined and implemented. GAO recommended in July 2010 that the government develop an international strategy that specified outcome-oriented performance metrics and timeframes for completing activities. While an international strategy for cyberspace has been developed, it does not fully specify outcome-oriented performance metrics or timeframes for completing activities.", "The government has issued a variety of strategy-related documents over the last decade, many of which address aspects of the above challenge areas. The documents address priorities for enhancing cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the private sector. However, no overarching cybersecurity strategy has been developed that articulates priority actions, assigns responsibilities for performing them, and sets timeframes for their completion. In 2004, GAO developed a set of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of national strategies in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. Existing cybersecurity strategy documents have included selected elements of these desirable characteristics, such as setting goals and subordinate objectives, but have generally lacked other key elements. The missing elements include:", "Milestones and performance measures . The government\u0092s strategy documents include few milestones or performance measures, making it difficult to track progress in accomplishing stated goals and objectives. The lack of milestones and performance measures at the strategic level is mirrored in similar shortcomings within key government programs that are part of the government-wide strategy. The DHS inspector general, for example, recommended in 2011 that DHS develop and implement performance measures to be used to track and evaluate the effectiveness of actions defined in its strategic implementation plan. As of January 2012, DHS had not yet developed the performance measures but planned to do so.", "Cost and resources . While past strategy documents linked certain activities to budget submissions, none have fully addressed cost and resources, including justifying the required investment, which is critical to gaining support for implementation. In addition, none provided full assessments of anticipated costs and how resources might be allocated to address them.", "Roles and responsibilities . Cybersecurity strategy documents have assigned high-level roles and responsibilities but have left important details unclear. Several GAO reports have likewise demonstrated that the roles and responsibilities of key agencies charged with protecting the nation\u0092s cyber assets are inadequately defined. For example, the chartering directives for several offices within the Department of Defense assign overlapping roles and responsibilities for preparing for and responding to domestic cyber incidents. In an October 2012 report, GAO recommended that the department update its guidance on preparing for and responding to domestic cyber incidents to include a description of its roles and responsibilities. In addition, it is unclear how OMB and DHS are to share oversight of individual departments and agencies. While the law gives OMB responsibility for oversight of federal government information security, OMB transferred several of its oversight responsibilities to DHS. Both DHS and OMB have issued annual FISMA reporting instructions to agencies, which could create confusion among agency officials because the instructions vary in content. Clarifying oversight responsibilities is a topic that could be effectively addressed through legislation.", "Linkage with other key strategy documents . Existing cybersecurity strategy documents vary in terms of priorities and structure, and do not specify how they link to or supersede other documents, nor do they describe how they fit into an overarching national cybersecurity strategy. For example, in 2012, the administration determined that trusted Internet connections, continuous monitoring, and strong authentication should be cross-agency priorities, but no explanation was given as to how these three relate to priorities previously established in other strategy documents.", "The many continuing cybersecurity challenges faced by the government highlight the need for a clearly defined oversight process to ensure agencies are held accountable for implementing effective information security programs. Further, until an overarching national cybersecurity strategy is developed that addresses all key elements of desirable characteristics, overall progress in achieving the government's objectives is likely to remain limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To address missing elements in the national cybersecurity strategy, such as milestones and performance measures, cost and resources, roles and responsibilities, and linkage with other key strategy documents, GAO recommends that the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that includes all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy. Such a strategy would provide a more effective framework for implementing cybersecurity activities and better ensure that such activities will lead to progress in cybersecurity.", "This strategy should also better ensure that federal departments and agencies are held accountable for making significant improvements in cybersecurity challenge areas, including designing and implementing risk-based programs; detecting, responding to, and mitigating cyber incidents; promoting education, awareness, and workforce planning; promoting R&D; and addressing international cybersecurity challenges. To address these issues, the strategy should (1) clarify how OMB will oversee agency implementation of requirements for effective risk management processes and (2) establish a roadmap for making significant improvements in cybersecurity challenge areas where previous recommendations have not been fully addressed.", "Further, to address ambiguities in roles and responsibilities that have resulted from recent executive branch actions, GAO believes Congress should consider legislation to better define roles and responsibilities for implementing and overseeing federal information security programs and for protecting the nation\u0092s critical cyber assets.", "In its comments, the Executive Office of the President agreed that more needs to be done to develop a coherent and comprehensive strategy on cybersecurity but did not believe producing another strategy document would be beneficial. However, GAO believes an overarching strategy document that includes milestones and performance measures, cost and resources, roles and responsibilities, and linkage with other key strategy documents would provide a more effective framework for implementing cybersecurity activities. The Executive Office of the President also agreed that Congress should consider enhanced cybersecurity legislation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The pervasive use of the Internet has revolutionized the way that our  government, our nation, and the rest of the world communicates and  conducts business.

Security of Classified Networks: Increase the security of classified  networks to reduce the risk of information they contain being  disclosed. 8.  Expand Education: Expand education efforts by constructing a  comprehensive federal cyber education and training program, with  attention to offensive and defensive skills and capabilities. 9.  Leap-Ahead Technology: Define and develop enduring leap-ahead  technology, strategies, and programs by investing in high-risk, high- reward research and development and by working with both private  sector and international partners. 10. Deterrence Strategies and Programs: Define and develop enduring  deterrence strategies and programs that focus on reducing  vulnerabilities and deter interference and attacks in cyberspace. 11.

Additionally, the inspector general reported that CS&C was not able to  track its progress efficiently and effectively in addressing the actions  outlined in the 2003 National Cybersecurity Strategy or achieving the  goals outlined in the NIPP. Accordingly, the inspector general  recommended that CS&C develop and implement performance measures  to be used to track and evaluate the effectiveness of actions defined in its  strategic implementation plan. The inspector general also recommended  that management use these measures to assess CS&C\u2019s overall  progress in attaining its strategic goals and milestones.

Without establishing milestones or  performance measures in its national strategy, the government lacks a  means to ensure priority goals and objectives are accomplished and  responsible parties are held accountable.", "Though the 2000 plan and the 2003 strategy linked some investments to  the annual budget, the strategy documents generally did not include an  analysis of the cost of planned activities or the source and type of  resources needed to carry out the strategy\u2019s goals and objectives. The  2000 National Plan for Information Systems Protection identified  resources for certain cybersecurity activities, and the 2003 National  Strategy to Secure Cyberspace linked some of its investment requests\u2014 such as completing a cyber incident warning system\u2014to the fiscal 2003  budget. However, none of the strategies included an analysis of the cost  and resources needed to implement the entire strategy. For example,  while the cybersecurity R&D strategic plan mentioned specific initiatives,  such as a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program to fund  biologically inspired cyber-attack resilience, it did not describe how  decisions were made regarding the amount of resources to be invested in  this or any other R&D initiative. The plan also did not outline how the  chosen cybersecurity R&D efforts would be funded and sustained in the  future.", "In addition, the strategies did not include a business case for investing in  activities to support their goals and objectives based on assessments of  the risks and relative costs of mitigating them. Many of the private sector  experts we consulted stated that not establishing such a value proposition  makes it difficult to mobilize the resources needed to significantly improve  security within the government as well as to build support in the private  sector for a national commitment to cybersecurity.

For example, as already  discussed, while the law gives OMB responsibility for oversight of federal  government information security, OMB transferred several of its oversight  responsibilities to DHS. According to OMB representatives, the oversight  responsibilities transferred to DHS represent the operational aspects of its  role, in contrast to the general oversight responsibilities stipulated by  FISMA, which OMB retained. The representatives further stated that the  enlistment of DHS to assist OMB in performing these responsibilities has  allowed OMB to have more visibility into the cybersecurity activities of  federal agencies because of the additional resources and expertise  provided by DHS and that OMB and DHS continue to work closely  together. While OMB\u2019s decision to transfer several of its responsibilities to  DHS may have had beneficial practical results, such as leveraging the  resources of DHS, it is not consistent with FISMA, which assigns all of  these responsibilities to OMB.", "With these responsibilities now divided between the two organizations, it  is also unclear how OMB and DHS are to share oversight of individual  departments and agencies, which are responsible under FISMA for  ensuring the security of their information systems and networks. For  example, both DHS and OMB have issued annual FISMA reporting  instructions to agencies, which could create confusion among agency  officials. Further, the instructions vary in content. In its 2012 instructions,  DHS included, among other things, specific actions agencies were  required to complete, time frames for completing the actions, and  reporting metrics. However, the OMB instructions, although identically  titled, included different directions. Specifically, the OMB instructions  required agencies to submit metrics data for the first quarter of the fiscal  year, while the DHS reporting instructions stated that agencies were not  required to submit such data. Further, the OMB instructions stated that  agency chief information officers would submit monthly data feeds  through the FISMA reporting system, while the DHS instructions indicated  that inspectors general and senior agency officials for privacy would also  submit monthly data feeds. Issuing identically titled reporting instructions  with varying content could result in inconsistent reporting.", "Further, it is unclear which agency currently has the role of ensuring that  agencies are held accountable for implementing the provisions of FISMA.  Although FISMA requires OMB to approve or disapprove agencies\u2019  information security programs, OMB has not made explicit statements  that would indicate whether an agency\u2019s information security program has  been approved or disapproved. As a result, a mechanism for establishing  accountability and holding agencies accountable for implementing  effective programs is not being used.", "Mirroring these shortcomings, several GAO reports have likewise  demonstrated that the roles and responsibilities of key agencies charged  with protecting the nation\u2019s cyber assets are inadequately defined. For  example, as described in our recent report on gaps in homeland defense  and civil support guidance, although DOD has prepared guidance  regarding support for civilian agencies in a domestic cyber incident and  has an agreement with DHS for preparing for and responding to such  incidents, these documents do not clarify all key aspects of how DOD will  support a response to a domestic cyber incident. For example, the  chartering directives for the Offices of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Global Strategic Affairs and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs assign overlapping  roles and responsibilities for preparing for and responding to domestic  cyber incidents. In an October 2012 report, we recommended that DOD  update guidance on preparing for and responding to domestic cyber  incidents to align with national-level guidance and that such guidance  should include a description of DOD\u2019s roles and responsibilities. Further,   we stated that federal agencies  in a March 2010 report on the CNCI,had overlapping and uncoordinated responsibilities and it was unclear  where overall responsibility for coordination lay. We recommended that  the Director of OMB better define roles and responsibilities for all key  CNCI participants to ensure that essential government-wide cybersecurity  activities are fully coordinated.", "Many of the experts we consulted agreed that the roles and  responsibilities of key agencies are not well defined. Clearly defining roles  and responsibilities for agencies charged with implementing key aspects  of the national cybersecurity strategies would aid in fostering  coordination, particularly where there is overlap, and thus enhance both  implementation and accountability.", "The cybersecurity strategy documents we reviewed did not include any  discussion of how they linked to or superseded other documents, nor did  they describe how they fit into the overall national cybersecurity strategy.  For example, the 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace does not  refer to the 2000 plan nor describe progress made since the previous  strategy was issued or if it was meant to replace or enhance the previous  strategy. Each of the subsequent documents that have addressed  aspects of the federal government\u2019s approach to cybersecurity\u2014such as  the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, and the International  Strategy to Secure Cyberspace\u2014has established its own set of goals and  priority actions, but none of these cybersecurity agendas are linked to  each other to explain why planned activities differ or are prioritized  differently. For example, in 2012, the administration determined that  trusted Internet connections, continuous monitoring, and strong  authentication should be cross-agency priorities, but no explanation was  given as to how these three relate to priorities established in other  strategy documents. Specifying how new documents are linked with the  overall national cybersecurity strategy would clarify priorities and better  establish roles and responsibilities, thereby fostering effective  implementation and accountability.", "The importance of developing an overarching strategy that links  component documents and addresses all key elements was confirmed by  our discussions with experts. For example, experts agreed that a strategy  should define milestones for achieving specific outcomes and that it  should be linked to accountability and execution with performance  measures to help in determining whether progress is being made.

These assessments  increase an organization\u2019s awareness of risk and can generate support  for policies and controls that are adopted in response.

For  example, according to a November 2011 inspector general report, one  agency did not have a risk management framework in place and had not  fully developed risk management procedures, due to budget cuts. Around  the same time, another agency\u2019s inspector general reported that while  risk management procedures at a system-specific level had been  implemented, an agency-wide risk management methodology had not  been developed. In an October 2011 report on agencies\u2019 efforts to  implement information security requirements, we reported that of the 24  major agencies, none had fully or effectively implemented an agency- wide information security program. Of those, 18 had shortcomings in the  documentation of their security management programs, which establish  the framework and activities for assessing risk, developing and  implementing effective security procedures, and monitoring the  effectiveness of these procedures.", "Risk management was also a topic that our experts felt was very  important to a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. One expert  stated that cybersecurity is not a technical problem, but an enterprise- wide risk management challenge that must be tackled in a far more  comprehensive manner than is generally understood both at the  enterprise and government level. One expert cited defining the cost of  insecurity as one of the most significant challenges in improving the  nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture. Another expert suggested that the risk  guidance be reviewed and updated due to changes in technology.", "NIST has developed guidance to assist agencies, once risks have been  assessed, in determining which controls are appropriate for their  information and systems. In August 2009, NIST released the third revision  of special publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for  Federal Information Systems and Organizations, which provides a catalog  of controls and technical guidelines that federal agencies must use to  protect federal information and information systems.NIST guidance for nonfederal information systems, such as those in the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, is encouraged but not required.", "Agencies have flexibility in applying NIST guidance, and according to  NIST, agencies should apply the security concepts and principles  articulated in special publication 800-53 in the context of the agency\u2019s  missions, business functions, and environment of operation.", "In addition, in order to ensure a consistent government-wide baseline,  specific guidance has been developed for implementing and configuring  controls in certain widely used computing platforms. In fiscal year 2010,  DOD, DHS, NIST, and the federal CIO Council worked closely together to  develop the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)  for Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8. As a baseline, USGCB is the core  set of default security configurations for all agencies; however, agencies  may customize the USGCB baseline to fit their operational needs. In  fiscal year 2011, the USGCB was expanded to include RedHat Enterprise  Linux 5 Desktop, and multiple updates for Windows 7 and Internet  Explorer 8 were released.", "Although guidance for implementing appropriate cybersecurity controls  has been available for many years, we have consistently identified  weaknesses in agencies\u2019 implementation of the guidance in control areas  such as configuration management. Configuration management is an  important process for establishing and maintaining secure information  system configurations, and provides important support for managing  security risks in information systems. However, inspectors general have  consistently reported weaknesses in agencies\u2019 implementation of such  controls. For example, the fiscal year 2011 report to Congress on the  implementation of FISMA listed configuration management as one of the  11 cybersecurity program areasAccording to that report, 18 of 24 agencies\u2019 configuration management   that needed the most improvement.  programs needed significant improvement. The following deficiencies  were found to be the most common:  configuration management policy was not fully developed (13 of 23  agencies), configuration management procedures were not fully developed (9 of  23 agencies), standard baseline configurations were not identified for all hardware  components (9 of 23 agencies), and", "USGCB was not fully implemented (8 of 23 agencies).", "Our own analysis of weaknesses reported by agency inspectors general  also shows that the number of weaknesses related to configuration  management has increased over the last 4 years. In fiscal year 2008,  inspectors general from 15 agencies reported weaknesses related to  configuration management, whereas 23 reported weaknesses in 2011.", "The experts we consulted focused on the need for security controls to be  included in systems development, instead of being applied as an  afterthought. One expert stated that commercial companies often forgo  the extra cost associated with meeting defined cybersecurity  specifications, and security is weakened as a result of the lack of built-in  controls. Another expert made a similar comment by saying that one of  the most significant changes that would improve cybersecurity is building  in security instead of \u201cbolting it on\u201d after the fact. He added that this would  involve changing the mindset of various stakeholders.", "According to NIST, security control effectiveness is measured by  correctness of implementation and by how adequately the implemented  controls meet organizational needs in accordance with current risk  tolerance (i.e., whether the control is implemented in accordance with the  security plan to address threats and whether the security plan is  adequate). Further, according to NIST, a key element in implementing an  effective risk management approach is to establish a continuous  monitoring program. Continuous monitoring is the process of maintaining  an ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats  to support organizational risk management decisions. The objectives are  to (1) conduct ongoing monitoring of the security of an organization\u2019s  networks, information, and systems; and (2) respond by accepting,  transferring, or mitigating risk as situations change. Continuous  monitoring is one of the six steps in NIST\u2019s risk management framework  and is an important way to assess the security impacts on an information  system due to changes in hardware, software, firmware, or environmental  operations. As part of its reporting instructions since fiscal year 2010,  OMB requested inspectors general to report whether agencies had  established continuous monitoring programs. For fiscal year 2011, the  administration identified continuous monitoring as one of three FISMA  priorities, and therefore the fiscal year 2011 FISMA reporting instructions  included expanded metrics related to continuous monitoring.", "OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2011 report on the implementation of FISMA shows  that, according to agency reporting, implementation of automated  continuous monitoring capabilities rose from 56 percent of total assets in  fiscal year 2010 to 78 percent of total assets in fiscal year 2011. Agencies  reported that they had implemented automated capabilities for activities  such as inventorying assets, configuration management, and vulnerability  management, which contributed to improvements in continuous  monitoring capabilities (see fig. 5).", "However, the report also states that inspectors general cited 4 out of 11  cybersecurity program areas, including continuous monitoring, as needing  the most improvement. The weaknesses in continuous monitoring  management most reported by agency inspectors general were  continuous monitoring policy was not fully developed (9 of 23  agencies), key security documentation was not provided to the system  authorizing official or other key system officials (8 of 23 agencies),  and continuous monitoring procedures were not consistently implemented  (7 of 23 agencies).", "Similarly, in October 2011, we reported that most of the 24 major federal  agencies had not fully implemented their programs for continuous  monitoring of security controls in fiscal year 2010. We and inspectors  general identified weaknesses in 17 of 24 agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2010  efforts for continuous monitoring. In addition, in a July 2011 report we  stated that while the Department of State is recognized as a leader in  federal efforts to develop and implement a continuous risk monitoring  capability, this capability\u2019s scope did not include non-Windows operating  systems, firewalls, routers, switches, mainframes, databases, and  intrusion detection devices. We recommended that State take several  steps to improve the implementation of its continuous monitoring  capability. Further, 2 inspectors general also reported that their respective  agencies had not established a continuous monitoring program. While 15  inspectors general reported that their agencies had programs in place, all  cited weaknesses in their agencies\u2019 programs. These weaknesses  included, for example, that continuous monitoring procedures were not  fully developed or consistently implemented at 11 agencies. In another  example, 10 inspectors general cited weaknesses in ongoing  assessments of selected security controls.", "Experts had mixed views about the importance of continuous monitoring  as a tool to improve cybersecurity in the federal government. While one of  the experts we consulted stated that moving from a paperwork-intensive  process to a continuous monitoring process was the single most  important action that could be taken to improve federal information  security, another expert cited penetration testing as the single most  important action. Two of the CIOs we surveyed also stated that the move  to relying on automated tools to continuously monitor government  systems is a practical way to contribute to meaningful security.", "Although federal agencies are making progress in implementing  continuous monitoring programs that include automated capabilities for  managing agency assets, configuration management, and vulnerability  management, much more progress is needed to meet the administration\u2019s  goal for continuous monitoring. Until agencies can fully implement their  continuous monitoring programs, they may have little assurance that they  are aware of the true security impacts on their information and information  systems due to changes in hardware, software, firmware, or  environmental operations.", "Given the persistent shortcomings in all three key elements of agency risk  management processes\u2014assessment, implementation of controls, and  monitoring results\u2014it is important that a clearly defined OMB oversight  process be in place to ensure that agencies are held accountable for  implementing required risk management processes. Without a means to  hold agencies accountable, the pattern of persistent risk management  shortcomings is unlikely to improve.", "DHS and sector-specific agencies have responsibilities for facilitating the  adoption of cybersecurity protective measures within critical infrastructure  sectors. The NIPP states that, in accordance with HSPD-7, DHS is a  principal focal point for the security of cyberspace and is responsible for  coordinating efforts to protect the cyber infrastructure owned and  operated by the private sector and is responsible for providing guidance  on effective cyber-protective measures, assisting sector-specific agencies  in understanding and mitigating cyber risk, and assisting in developing  effective and appropriate protective measures. To accomplish these  responsibilities, according to the NIPP, sector-specific agencies are to  work with their private sector counterparts to understand and mitigate  cyber risk by, among other things, determining whether approaches for  critical infrastructure inventory, risk assessment, and protective measures  address assets, systems, and networks; require enhancement; or require  the use of alternative approaches.", "Security controls for critical infrastructure are likely to be determined  largely by industry benchmarks and standards. In some instances, federal  agencies have regulatory authority to require private sector  implementation of controls. Some controls have also been recommended  by federal agencies. In other areas there is little or no federal regulation of  private sector cybersecurity practices. For example, as we reported in  December 2011, the information technology, communications, and water  critical infrastructure sectors and the oil and natural gas subsector of the  energy sector are not subject to direct federal cybersecurity-related  regulation.", "Our December 2011 report stated that although the use of cybersecurity  guidance is not mandatory for all sectors, entities may voluntarily  implement such guidance in response to business incentives, including  the need to mitigate a variety of risks. Officials familiar with cybersecurity  issues from both the communications and information technology sectors  stated that the competitive market place, desire to maintain profits, and  customer expectation of information security\u2014rather than federal  regulation\u2014drive the adoption of best practices. Officials responsible for  coordinating the oil and gas sector said that their member companies are  not required to follow industry guidelines, but legal repercussions  regarding standards of care may motivate the incorporation of such  cybersecurity guidance into their operations.", "Other critical infrastructure entities, such as depository institutions in the  banking and finance sector; the bulk power system in the electricity  subsector of the energy sector; the health care and public health sector;  and the nuclear reactors, materials, and waste sector, are required to  meet mandatory cybersecurity standards established by federal  regulation. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  approved eight mandatory cybersecurity standards that address the  following topics: critical cyber asset identification, security management  controls, personnel and training, electronic security perimeter(s),physical security of critical cyber assets, systems security management,  incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans for critical  cyber assets. However, applicability of these standards is limited to the  bulk power system\u2014a term that refers to facilities and control systems  necessary for operating the electric transmission network and certain  generation facilities needed for reliability. Further, regulatory oversight of  the electric industry is fragmented among federal, state, and local  authorities, thus posing challenges in gaining a system-wide view of the  cyber risk to the electric grid in an environment where cyber threats and  vulnerabilities of one segment of the grid could affect the entire grid.", "DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications\u2019 Control Systems  Security Program has also issued recommended practices to reduce risks  to industrial control systems within and across all critical infrastructure  sectors.

For example, it stated  that while federal cybersecurity centers often shared their information, no  single entity combined all information available from these centers and  other sources to provide a continuously updated and comprehensive  picture of cyber threats and network activity. Such a comprehensive  picture could provide indications and warning of incoming incidents and  support a coordinated incident response. The policy review observed that  the government needed a reliable and consistent mechanism for bringing  all appropriate incident and vulnerability information together and  recommended the development of an information-sharing and incident  response framework. The review recommended that the federal  government leverage existing resources such as the Multi-State  Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the 58 state and local fusion  centersresponding to cyber incidents. Implementation of the recommended  framework would require developing reporting thresholds, adaptable  response and recovery plans, information sharing, and incident reporting  mechanisms.   to develop processes to assist in preventing, detecting, and  The review also identified and recommended near and midterm actions,  which included preparing a cybersecurity incident response plan, initiating  a dialogue to enhance public-private partnerships, and developing a  process between the government and the private sector to assist in  preventing, detecting, and responding to incidents. In response to the  policy review recommendations, DHS drafted the Interim National Cyber  Incident Response Plan in 2010, which establishes an incident response  framework and designates the National Cybersecurity Communications  and Integration Center (NCCIC) as the national point of execution for  response activities within the scope of DHS authorities. The NCCIC is the  point of integration for sharing information from federal agencies, state,  local, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector, including  international stakeholders.

For example, in  2010, the DHS inspector general reported that US-CERT had established  the Joint Agency Cyber Knowledge Exchange (JACKE) and  Government Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams to  facilitate collaboration on detecting and mitigating threats to the .gov  domain and to encourage proactive and preventative security practices.  Additionally, in 2010, the DHS inspector general reported that DHS  shared cyber incident information through its Government Forum of  Incident Response and Security Teams and US-CERT portals.", "In 2008 and 2010, we reported that one of the barriers to information  sharing was the lack of individuals with appropriate security clearances to  receive classified information related to potential or actual cyber-related  incidents, which prevented federal agencies and private sector  companies from acting on these incidents in a timely manner. In 2010,  we also reported that private sector companies were often unwilling to  share incident data because they were concerned about their proprietary  data being seen by competitors. We recommended that the Cybersecurity  Coordinator and the Secretary of Homeland Security focus their  information-sharing efforts on the most desired services, including  providing security clearances. Since these reports, DHS stated that it has  taken steps to increase the number of individuals in the public and private  sector who are granted security clearances and are able to receive  classified information related to cyber incidents. According to the DHS  inspector general, the department has also coordinated the installation of  classified and unclassified information technology systems at fusion  centers to support information sharing.has established information-sharing agreements between the federal  government and the private sector or ISAC, and a program to address  private sector partners\u2019 concerns related to protecting their proprietary  data. Further, DHS reported that, as of May 2012, there were 16  organizations, including federal agencies and private sector companies,  operating and participating within the NCCIC to share information.

The program\u2019s goal is to improve sharing among  ISACs, information and communications technology service providers,  and their respective critical infrastructure owners, operators, and  customers. According to DHS, this program facilitated the sharing and  distribution of 11,000 indicators of cyber threat activity and over 400  products, including indicator and analysis bulletins. In addition, according  to DHS, US-CERT has incorporated a Traffic Light Protocol into its  information-sharing products. The Traffic Light Protocol provides a  methodology to specify a color on a product to reflect when information  should be used and how it may be shared. In addition, according to a  DHS official, in October 2012, DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications was realigned to include all entities reporting to the  NCCIC division. This new structure brought all of the department\u2019s  operational communications and cybersecurity programs together under a  single point of coordination.", "DHS has not always been able to take action to improve information  sharing, however. For example, the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence issued a directive on sharing \u201ctear-line\u201d information among  intelligence community members, and state, local, tribal, and private  sector partners. This policy directs the intelligence community to  improve tear-line utility for the needs of recipients prior to publication and  specifies that tear lines should be extended to the broadest possible  readership. However, DHS does not have the authority to declassify  information it receives from other entities.

For  example, in December 2011, the DHS inspector general reported that  classification of information impedes effective information sharing  between officials within fusion centers and emergency operations  centers. The inspector general recommended that DHS effectively disseminate and implement a directive to improve policies for  safeguarding and governing access to classified information shared by  the federal government with state, local, tribal, and private sector entities.  DHS concurred with the recommendation. In addition, in July 2012, the  DHS former inspector general reported that state and local fusion center  personnel had expressed concern with federal information-sharing  systems due to the fact that the systems were not integrated and  information could not easily be shared across the systems, resulting in  continued communication and information-sharing challenges. The DHS  inspector general also reported that US-CERT collected and posted  information from several systems and sources to different portals, all of  which had different classification levels resulting in communication and   The inspector general recommended that  information-sharing issues.the department establish a consolidated, multiple-classification-level  portal that can be accessed by the federal partners and includes real-time  incident response related information and reports. According to DHS  officials, a secure environment for sharing cybersecurity information, at all  classification levels, intended to address these issues is scheduled to be  fully operational in fiscal year 2018.", "Information sharing presents a challenge not only within the nation, but  also with the international community. In August 2012, the DHS inspector  general reported that information sharing with foreign partners has been  hindered due, in part, to varying classification policies. Foreign governments have developed their own policies for classifying sensitive  information, which has resulted in inconsistencies in classifying  information among different countries. According to the inspector general,  an international team surveyed indicated that inconsistent classification  requirements hinder foreign countries\u2019 abilities to share cyber threat data  in a timely manner, as information shared must be approved by different  authorities in various countries before it can be disseminated to  international partners and private organizations. The inspector general  recommended that DHS conduct information-sharing assessments to  identify internal gaps and impediments in order to increase situational  awareness and enhance collaboration with foreign nations. DHS  concurred with the recommendation.", "Agency officials, CIOs, and experts we consulted agreed that information  sharing remains a significant challenge. According to a DHS official,  despite the NCCIC being in operation, there are still challenges with  coordinating and sharing information. The official explained that these  challenges are due in part to DHS\u2019s lack of authority over agencies\u2019  information-sharing practices and the private sector\u2019s cybersecurity  efforts, and that agencies and private sector companies are not always  able to identify the benefit of reporting information to DHS. Seven out of  the 11 CIOs that responded to our survey stated that the most effective  way to enhance information sharing would be to develop a streamlined  process for declassifying key information and making it available to  stakeholders. One CIO also explained that the current process for  notifying agencies about incidents lacks specificity, making it unclear what  the threat is and how to mitigate it. The CIO added that a declassification  process would be helpful. Several CIOs stated the most effective way to  enhance information sharing would be to improve the timeliness of  incident information reports. Further, 6 of the 11 CIOs indicated that  focused information-sharing efforts, including working toward increased  private sector engagement and a robust information-sharing framework,  are the most important actions that the federal government can take now  to improve protection of cyber critical infrastructure. Six CIOs also stated  that improving information sharing and coordination is the most important  action that the federal government could take to improve the national  response to large-scale cyber events.", "Several experts surveyed agreed that information sharing is a challenge.  For example, one expert stated that the most important action that can be  taken now to improve federal information security is improving information  sharing.

In addition, experts stated  that information sharing is one of the most significant challenges in  improving the nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture.", "Establishing analytical and warning capabilities is essential to thwarting  cyber threats and attacks. Cyber analysis and warning capabilities include  (1) monitoring network activity to detect anomalies, (2) analyzing  information and investigating anomalies to determine whether they are  threats, (3) warning appropriate officials with timely and actionable threat  and mitigation information, and (4) responding to threats. The 2009  Cyberspace Policy Review identified a need for the federal government to  improve its ability to provide strategic warning of cyber intrusions. In  2008, we identified 15 key attributes associated with these capabilities,  including integrating the results of the analysis of the information into  predictive analysis of broader implications or potential future attacks.  This type of effort\u2014predictive analysis\u2014should look beyond one specific  incident to consider a broader set of incidents or implications that may  indicate a potential threat of importance.", "US-CERT has established a cyber analysis and warning capability that  includes many elements of the key attributes we identified in our 2008  report. For example, it obtains internal network operation information via  technical tools and EINSTEIN; obtains external information on threats,  vulnerabilities, and incidents; and detects anomalous activities based on  the information it receives. To help improve the federal government\u2019s  analysis and warning capability, DHS has completed several actions. For  example, according to DHS, the department has (1) increased its  cybersecurity workforce, (2) improved the training available to federal  staff, such as periodic training on EINSTEIN capabilities; and (3)  launched a loaned executive program to obtain ad hoc, unpaid, short- term expertise through appointment of private sector individuals.", "According to DHS, to strengthen its analytical capabilities, it is using an  analysis tool to enhance its ability to track malicious activity. DHS also  reported utilizing a cyber indicators analysis platform that acts as a  centralized repository for cyber threat network data and facilitates  information exchange among US-CERT and its partners to conduct  analysis. Also, DHS has established the NCCIC as its 24-hour cyber and  communications watch and warning center with representation from law  enforcement and intelligence organizations, computer emergency  response teams, and private sector information-sharing and analysis  centers.have been expanded, and 53 federal agencies are now using EINSTEIN  2 intrusion detection sensors. DHS staff have also stated that the  department is incorporating an EINSTEIN 3 accelerated (EA) strategy  allowing for accelerated deployment of intrusion prevention services  through an Internet Service Provider-based managed security service.

For example,  one CIO stated that there has been a significant amount of turnover of  cyber leadership at DHS and that this is one of the most significant  challenges to improving the nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture. Another CIO  indicated that increased funding, hiring of more qualified personnel, and  more timely notifications would also significantly assist in developing  timely warning capabilities. Likewise, a cybersecurity expert we  interviewed agreed that DHS may be losing skilled personnel to the  private sector because of incentives such as higher salaries. A federal  CIO further stated that additional funding was needed for monitoring and  intrusion prevention tools.", "DHS has taken a number of steps to improve information sharing and  timely analysis and warning capabilities, including addressing many of our  prior recommendations. However, it has not yet fully addressed all of the  recommendations made by us and the inspector general.

In April 2010, the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) was begun as an  interagency effort coordinated by NIST to improve cybersecurity  education, including efforts directed at training, public awareness, and the  federal cybersecurity workforce. To meet NICE objectives, efforts were  structured into the following four components:  1.  National Cybersecurity Awareness: This component included public  service campaigns to promote cybersecurity and responsible use of  the Internet as well as making cybersecurity popular for children. It  was also aimed at making cybersecurity a popular educational and  career pursuit for older students. 2.  Formal Cybersecurity Education: Education programs  encompassing K-12, higher education, and vocational programs  related to cybersecurity were included in this component, which  focused on the science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines  to provide a pipeline of skilled workers for private sector and  government. 3.  Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Structure: This component  addressed personnel management functions, including the definition  of cybersecurity jobs in the federal government and the skills and  competencies they required. Also included were new strategies to  ensure federal agencies attract, recruit, and retain skilled employees  to accomplish cybersecurity missions. 4.  Cybersecurity Workforce Training and Professional  Development: Cybersecurity training and professional development  for federal government civilian, military, and contractor personnel  were included in this component.", "In March 2010, we reported that CNCI faced a number of key challenges  in achieving its objectives, including reaching agreement among  stakeholders on the scope of cybersecurity education efforts.  Stakeholders could not reach agreement on whether to address  cybersecurity education from a much broader perspective as part of the  initiative, or remain focused on the federal cyber workforce. A panel of  experts stated at the time that the federal government needed to publicize  and raise awareness of the seriousness of the cybersecurity problem and  to increase the number of professionals with adequate cybersecurity  skills. They went on to say that the cybersecurity discipline should be  organized into concrete professional tracks through testing and licensing.  Such tracks would increase the federal cybersecurity workforce by  strengthening the hiring and retention of cybersecurity professionals. We  recommended that the Director of National Intelligence and the OMB  Director reach agreement on the scope of CNCI\u2019s education projects to  ensure that an adequate cadre of skilled personnel was developed to  protect federal information systems.

We further reported that specific tasks under and  responsibilities for NICE activities were unclear and a formal governance  structure was missing. We recommended that Commerce, OMB, OPM,  and DHS collaborate through the NICE initiative to clarify the governance  structure for NICE to specify responsibilities and processes for planning  and monitoring of initiative activities; and develop and finalize detailed  plans allowing agency accountability, measurement of progress, and  determination of resources to accomplish agreed-upon activities. Since  then, DHS has developed a plan for its role in implementing NICE.  Although the plan does not contain detailed steps on how the department  will achieve the stated goals, it does include a timeline for completion and  immediate and long-term recommended calls to action. In addition, in  support of the NICE initiative, the National Security Agency established a  program in April 2012 for the Academic Centers of Excellence in Cyber  Operations to further the goal of broadening the pool of skilled  cybersecurity workers.

The  remaining three agencies\u2014the Department of Commerce, the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of  the Treasury\u2014had neither departmental workforce plans nor workforce  plans that specifically addressed cybersecurity workforce needs.  Additionally, data provided from various sources on these agencies\u2019  cybersecurity workforce numbers were inconsistent due, in part, to the  challenge of defining cybersecurity positions. These agencies had  generally taken steps to define cybersecurity roles and responsibilities  and related skills and competencies; however, the approaches taken by  each agency varied considerably. All eight agencies reported challenges  with filling cybersecurity positions. Further, only three of the eight  agencies had a department-wide training program for their cybersecurity  workforce. Two of the three had established certification requirements for  cybersecurity positions.", "We recommended that Commerce, HHS, and Treasury develop and  implement a department-wide cybersecurity workforce plan or ensure that  departmental components are conducting appropriate workforce planning  activities; that DOD and DOT update their department-wide cybersecurity  workforce plan or ensure that departmental components have plans that  appropriately address human capital approaches, critical skills,  competencies, and supporting requirements for their cybersecurity  workforce strategies; and that VA update its department-wide  cybersecurity competency model or establish a cybersecurity workforce  plan that fully addresses gaps in human capital approaches and critical  skills and competencies, supporting requirements for its cybersecurity  workforce strategies, and monitoring and evaluating agency progress. In  addition, to help federal agencies better identify their cybersecurity  workforce and to improve cybersecurity workforce efforts, we  recommended that OPM identify and develop government-wide strategies  to address challenges federal agencies face in tracking their  cybersecurity workforce; finalize and issue guidance to agencies on how  to track the use and effectiveness of incentives for hard-to-fill positions,  including cybersecurity positions; and maximize the value of the  cybersecurity competency model by (1) developing and implementing a  method for ensuring that the competency model accurately reflects the  skill set unique to the cybersecurity workforce, (2) developing a method  for collecting and tracking data on the use of the competency model, and  (3) creating a schedule for revising or updating the model as needed.

According to these CIOs  and experts, executives in both federal and private sector organizations  often lack a clear understanding of the cybersecurity threat they face and  thus often do not make the necessary commitment to developing and  maintaining adequate cybersecurity defenses. Specifically, three CIOs  stated that the root cause hindering progress in improving the nation\u2019s  cybersecurity posture is the lack of understanding of the threats and risks  to cyber assets. One CIO responded that there does not seem to be  sufficient understanding or appreciation of the seriousness of the threats.  He went on to state that we must find ways to convince the public that  immediate, priority actions are necessary. Two of the cybersecurity  experts we surveyed agreed that a poor understanding of the threats and  risks was a root cause hindering progress in cybersecurity. For example,  one expert stated that it was commonplace for corporate executives to  underestimate cybersecurity threats, believing that Internet-based attacks  are \u201cnot going to happen to me.\u201d", "In addition, several CIOs and experts were concerned that the  cybersecurity workforce was inadequate, both in numbers and training.  One CIO stated that role-based qualification standards are needed for the  cybersecurity and general workforce with specific actions and activities  that are common across the government. He added that the quality of the  workforce is one of the largest contributors to the success or failure of a  cybersecurity program. During our panel discussion, one expert cited the  difficulties in retaining cyber professionals as a challenge. Another panel  participant agreed, adding that the lack of cyber professionals at the local  government level was also a problem. He added that another challenge  was that not enough effort had been spent on implementing planned  education and awareness initiatives. For example, he stated that the  NICE initiative had stalled in part because funding was devoted to an  additional study of the issues involved in education and workforce  development.", "While DHS and other agencies have taken steps to address our  recommendations to clarify the scope of CNCI education initiatives and  the governance structure of the NICE initiative, other recommendations  have not yet been fully addressed.

For example, the plan stated that coordinating federal R&D with  ongoing private sector programs would be complicated by industry\u2019s  desire to guard proprietary programs and trade secrets. Specifically, the  plan noted that it was difficult to identify all relevant ongoing R&D  programs and that some of them overlapped. In a June 2010 report on  research and development, we concluded that despite the continued  focus on coordination between federal agencies and the public sector,  R&D initiatives were hindered by limited sharing of detailed information  about ongoing research. According to federal and private experts we  consulted for the 2010 report, key factors existed that reduced the private  sector\u2019s and government\u2019s willingness to share information and trust each  other with regard to researching and developing new cybersecurity  technologies. Specifically, private sector officials stated that they were  often unwilling to share details of their R&D with the government because  they wanted to protect their intellectual property. On the government side,  officials were concerned that the private sector was too focused on  making a profit and may not necessarily conduct R&D in areas that  require the most attention.", "Additionally, at the time of our report, government and private sector  officials indicated that the government did not have a process in place to  communicate the results of completed federal R&D projects. The private  and public sectors had shared some cybersecurity R&D information, but  such information sharing generally occurred only on a project-by-project  basis. For example, we reported that the National Science Foundation\u2019s  Industry University Cooperative Research Center initiative established  centers to conduct research that is of interest to both industry and  academia, and DOD\u2019s Small Business Innovation Research program  funded R&D at small technology companies. However, according to  federal and private sector experts we consulted at that time, widespread  and ongoing information sharing generally had not occurred.", "Further, the 2010 report also stated that no complete and up-to-date  repository existed to track all cybersecurity R&D information and  associated funding as required by law. At that time, an OSTP official  indicated that it was difficult to develop and enforce policies for identifying  specific funding as R&D, and that the level of detail to be disclosed was  also a factor because national security must be protected. To help  facilitate information sharing about ongoing and planned R&D projects,  we recommended that OSTP, in conjunction with the Cybersecurity  Coordinator, direct NITRD to (1) establish a mechanism, consistent with  existing law, to keep track of all ongoing and completed federal  cybersecurity R&D projects and associated funding; and (2) utilize the  newly established tracking mechanism to develop an ongoing process to  make federal R&D information available to federal agencies and the  private sector. OSTP concurred with our recommendations.", "Subsequently, in September 2012, we reported that OMB had not fully  established the repository for providing information on R&D funded by the  federal government. We found that only 11 of the 24 major agencies in  our study reported providing research information to  http://www.Science.gov. Moreover, 2 agencies in our study reported not  being aware of any R&D repository. OMB officials pointed to an R&D  dashboard website being developed by OSTP that was intended to meet  the requirement for an R&D repository. However, this website provided  information on federal investments in research and development for only  2 agencies.

DHS also identified multiple  capabilities related to information dissemination to international partners  in areas such as adverse incidents and proven practices to decrease the  spread and impact of hazards.", "While progress has been made in identifying the importance of  international cooperation and assigning roles and responsibilities related  to it, the government\u2019s approach for addressing international aspects of  cybersecurity has not yet been completely defined and implemented. We  have identified significant challenges within the federal government\u2019s  international cybersecurity efforts. In our March 2010 report focused on  the CNCI, we observed that the federal government was facing strategic  challenges in areas that are not the subject of existing projects within  CNCI but that remained key to achieving the initiative\u2019s overall goal of   One of the strategic challenges  securing federal information systems.we identified was coordinating with international entities. We found that  there was no formal strategy for coordinating outreach to international  partners for the purposes of standards setting, law enforcement, and  information sharing. Accordingly we recommended that the Director of  OMB establish a coordinated approach for the federal government in  conducting international outreach to address cybersecurity issues  strategically.", "GAO, Cyberspace: United States Faces Challenges in Addressing Global Cybersecurity  and Governance, GAO-10-606 (Washington, D.C.: July 2, 2010). the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator\u2019s authority and capacity  to effectively coordinate and forge a coherent national approach to  cybersecurity, which were needed to lead near-term international  goals and objectives from the President\u2019s Cyberspace Policy Review,  were still under development; the U.S. government had not documented a clear vision of how the  international efforts of federal entities, taken together, supported  overarching national goals;  federal agencies had not demonstrated an ability to coordinate their  international activities and project clear policies on a consistent basis; some countries had attempted to mandate compliance with their own  cybersecurity standards in a manner that risked discriminating against  U.S. companies or posed trade barriers to foreign companies that  sought to market and sell their products to other countries; the federal government lacked a coherent approach toward  participating in a broader international framework for responding to  cyber incidents with global impact; the differences among laws of nations could impede U.S. and foreign  efforts to enforce domestic criminal and civil laws related to  cyberspace; and some federal agencies reported that they participated in efforts that  may contribute to developing international norms, but agencies  reported challenges such as, that this was a complicated and long- term process and that the absence of agreed-upon definitions for  cyberspace-related terminology could impede efforts to develop  international norms.", "We concluded that until these challenges were addressed, the United  States would be at a disadvantage in promoting its national interests in  the realm of cyberspace.", "Accordingly, we recommended that the Cybersecurity Coordinator, in  collaboration with others, take five actions to address these challenges,  which included the following:", "Develop with the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland  Security, Justice, and State and other relevant federal and nonfederal  entities, a comprehensive U.S. global cyberspace strategy that articulates overarching goals, subordinate objectives, specific  activities, performance metrics, and reasonable time frames to  achieve results; addresses technical standards and policies while taking into  consideration U.S. trade; and identifies methods for addressing the enforcement of U.S. civil and  criminal law.", "Enhance the interagency coordination mechanisms by ensuring  relevant federal entities are engaged and that their efforts, taken  together, support U.S. interests in a coherent and consistent fashion.", "Determine, in conjunction with the Departments of Defense and State  and other relevant federal entities, which, if any, cyberspace norms  should be defined to support U.S. interests in cyberspace and  methods for fostering such norms internationally.", "Although the White House developed and released the International  Strategy for Cyberspace in May 2011 that addresses several of our  recommendations, it does not include all the elements we recommended.  To its credit, the strategy included goals for establishing cyberspace  norms that should be accepted internationally and methods for fostering  such norms internationally, such as developing cybercrime norms in  appropriate forums and incorporating existing efforts. However, the  strategy does not fully specify outcome-oriented performance metrics, or  time frames for completing activities. For example, the strategy discusses  multiple goals and objectives, but does not provide performance metrics  to help ensure accountability and gauge results.", "We continue to believe that the international strategy should specify  outcome-oriented performance metrics, and time frames for completing  activities. Including outcome-oriented performance metrics and time  frames for completion would help to ensure that agencies with  international responsibilities are taking appropriate actions to implement  the strategy and are making progress in improving international  cooperation.

Such an approach would not only define priority problem areas  but also set a roadmap for allocating and managing appropriate  resources, making a convincing business case to justify expenses,  identifying organizations\u2019 roles and responsibilities, linking goals and  priorities, and holding participants accountable for achieving results.  However, the federal government\u2019s efforts at defining a strategy for  cybersecurity have often not fully addressed these key elements, lacking,  for example, milestones and performance measures, identified costs and  sources of funding, and specific roles and responsibilities. As a result, the  government\u2019s cybersecurity strategy remains poorly articulated and  incomplete. In fact, no integrated, overarching strategy exists that  articulates priority actions, assigns responsibilities for performing them,  and sets time frames for their completion. In the absence of an integrated  strategy, the documents that comprise the government\u2019s current strategic  approach are of limited value as a tool for mobilizing actions to mitigate  the most serious threats facing the nation.", "Previous GAO and inspector general reviews as well as federal CIOs and  experts have made recommendations to address challenges faced by  federal agencies and the private sector in effectively implementing a  comprehensive approach to cybersecurity and reducing the risk of  successful cybersecurity attacks. Many of these recommendations have  not yet been fully addressed, leaving much room for more progress in  addressing cybersecurity challenges. In many cases, the causes of these  challenges are closely related to the key elements that are missing from  the government\u2019s cybersecurity strategy. For example, the persistence of  shortcomings in agency cybersecurity risk management processes  indicates that agencies have not been held accountable for effectively  implementing such processes and that oversight mechanisms have not  been clear. It is just such oversight and accountability that is poorly  defined in cybersecurity strategy documents. Clarifying oversight  responsibilities is a topic that could be effectively addressed through  legislation.", "An overarching strategy that better addresses key desirable  characteristics could establish an improved framework to implement  national cybersecurity policy and ensure that stated goals and priorities  are actively pursued by government agencies and better supported by  key private sector entities. To be successful such a strategy would  include a clearer process for OMB oversight of agency risk management  processes and a roadmap for improving the cybersecurity challenge  areas where previous concerns have not been fully addressed.

The Executive  Office of the President and OMB both commented on our draft  recommendations, and the Executive Office of the President concurred  with our matter for congressional consideration. The audit liaison officer in  the Director\u2019s Office of the National Institute of Standards and Technology  within the Department of Commerce responded that the department did  not have any comments. A summary of comments we received follows.", "The General Counsel of OSTP in the Executive Office of the  President provided comments via e-mail in which the National  Security Staff stated that the administration agrees that more needs to  be done to develop a coherent and comprehensive strategy on  cybersecurity and noted that a number of strategies and policies had  been issued to address specific cybersecurity topics. According to the  National Security Staff, remaining flexible and focusing on achieving  measurable improvements in cybersecurity would be more beneficial  than developing \u201cyet another strategy on top of existing strategies.\u201d  We agree that flexibility and a focus on achieving measurable  improvements in cybersecurity is critically important and that simply  preparing another document, if not integrated with previous  documents, would not be helpful. The focus of our recommendation is  to develop an overarching strategy that integrates the numerous  strategy documents, establish milestones and performance measures,  and better ensure that federal departments and agencies are held  accountable for making significant improvements in cybersecurity  challenge areas. We do not believe the current approach  accomplishes this. The National Security Staff also agreed with our  matter for congressional consideration and that comprehensive  cybersecurity legislation that addresses information sharing and  baseline standards for critical infrastructure, among other things, is  necessary to mitigate the threats posed in cyberspace. The General  Counsel also provided technical comments from OSTP, which we  have incorporated into the final report as appropriate.", "In comments provided via e-mail, the Deputy General Counsel at  OMB responded to our draft recommendation, stating that OMB\u2019s  responsibility under FISMA is to \u201coversee\u201d agency implementation of  requirements for effective risk management processes. We agree that  FISMA gives OMB the responsibility of overseeing agency  implementation of cybersecurity risk management requirements and  have changed the wording of our recommendation to reflect OMB\u2019s  role as specified by the act. The Deputy General Counsel also  expressed concern about our description of actions OMB took in 2010  with regard to roles and responsibilities under FISMA. According to  the Deputy General Counsel, OMB did not delegate or transfer any  statutory authorities to DHS. Instead, DHS exercised its own  authorities in taking on additional responsibilities. We disagree.  FISMA specifies in detail a number of oversight responsibilities that it  assigns to OMB. It was several of these specific responsibilities that in  2010 OMB announced DHS would be assuming. Therefore we  conclude that OMB transferred these responsibilities to DHS. More  importantly, with these responsibilities now divided between the two  organizations, it remains unclear how OMB and DHS are to share  oversight of individual departments and agencies.", "The Director of the Departmental GAO-OIG Liaison Office at DHS  provided written comments that discussed specific actions the  department has taken or plans to take to address challenges we  identified, such as information sharing, analysis and warning, and  expanding the cybersecurity workforce. He added that the  department\u2019s Blueprint for a Secure Cyber Future aligns with the  various national strategies we discuss in this report and addresses the  challenge areas we identified.

DHS\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix III.", "The Special Assistant for Cybersecurity in the Office of the Secretary  of Defense provided general observations about the draft report as  well as technical comments via e-mail. For example, the comments  indicated that any update to the national cybersecurity strategy should  address ways to make cyberspace more defensible. The Special  Assistant for Cybersecurity also acknowledged inconsistencies in  departmental guidance but said that DOD officials were not confused  about their responsibilities and that future updates to the departmental  guidance would clarify cyber policy responsibilities. We agree that  clarification of DOD organizations\u2019 roles and responsibilities would  enhance the department\u2019s ability to support DHS during significant  domestic cyber incidents. In addition, the comments indicated that  cybersecurity strategies should be evaluated in terms of to whom the  strategy is addressed (i.e., the federal government or the private  sector), the rapidity of change in cybersecurity issues, and the  environment for which the strategy is written (i.e., federal civilian  government, the military, or the private sector). We agree that these  are important factors to consider in developing comprehensive  cybersecurity strategies and believe our report reflects these factors.

Our  assessment determined the extent to which all of the elements of each  desirable characteristic were addressed by the strategies. These  desirable characteristics were developed by GAO in 2004. At that time,  we identified these characteristics by consulting statutory requirements  pertaining to certain strategies we reviewed, as well as legislative and  executive branch guidance for other national strategies. In addition, we  studied the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA),  general literature on strategic planning and performance, and guidance  from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the President\u2019s  Management Agenda.

We further surveyed chief information officers  from the 24 agencies identified in the Chief Financial Officers Act to  determine their key issues and challenges. Eleven of the 24 chief  information officers responded to our survey (see app. II). Our second  panel and survey involved a selection of private sector cybersecurity  experts. To identify private sector cybersecurity experts, we first obtained  a universe of experts by reviewing membership and advisor roles for  pertinent cybersecurity boards and commissions (e.g., the Information  Security and Privacy Advisory Board and the National Academies\u2019  Computer Science and Telecommunications Board), key associations  that are leading thinkers on cybersecurity (e.g., the Internet Security  Alliance), and witnesses from cybersecurity-related congressional  hearings.
