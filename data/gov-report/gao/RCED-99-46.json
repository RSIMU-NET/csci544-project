The Board, established pursuant to the ICC Termination Act of 1995, is a bipartisan, independent, adjudicatory body that is organizationally housed within the Department of Transportation (DOT).

These acts provided the railroads with greater flexibility to negotiate freight rates and respond to market conditions. The Staggers Act in particular made it federal policy that freight railroads would rely, where possible, on competition and the demand for services rather than on regulation to establish reasonable rates. As a result of mergers and acquisitions fostered by these statutes, as well as changes in bankruptcies and changes in the definition of a class I railroad, the number of large railroads in the United States has declined substantially from the 63 class I railroads operating in 1976 to nine by 1997.", "In spite of the reduction in the number of class I freight railroads, these railroads accounted for 91 percent of the industry\u2019s freight revenue and 71 percent of the industry\u2019s mileage operated. In 1997, class I freight railroads originated almost 1.6 billion tons of freight, of which coal, farm products, and chemicals accounted for about 61 percent. The nine class I freight railroads in 1997 were the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co.; CSX Transportation; Consolidated Rail Corporation; Grand Trunk Western Railroad, Inc.; Illinois Central Railroad Co.; Kansas City Southern Railway Co.; Norfolk Southern Corp.; Soo Line Railroad Co.; and Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "Since 1997, additional railroad consolidations have occurred. In July 1998, the Board approved the division of the Consolidated Rail Corporation\u2019s (Conrail) assets between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. This will reduce the number of class I freight railroads to eight in 1999. Also, in July 1998, Canadian National Railway, the Canadian parent of Grand Trunk Western Railroad, Inc., requested the Board\u2019s authorization to acquire Illinois Central Railroad Company. The Board\u2019s proposed schedule provides for a final decision on the proposed acquisition no later than May 25, 1999.

Under the statute, the Board is responsible for balancing shipper and railroad interests by assisting railroads in their efforts to earn adequate revenue to cover their costs and provide a reasonable return on capital while ensuring that shippers that depend on one railroad are protected from unreasonably high rates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Board\u2019s Oversight of Railroad Rates", "paragraphs": ["The 1976 and 1980 acts provided railroads with significant flexibility to negotiate freight rates and respond to market conditions. The 1976 act retained federal rate regulation only for traffic where the railroad dominates the market, that is, it provides service for which there is no effective competition to otherwise control rates. In such cases, the ICC had jurisdiction to determine whether a challenged rate was reasonable and, if unreasonable, to award reparations and prescribe a maximum rate. The Staggers Rail Act built on the reforms of the 1976 act by establishing a threshold under which railroads would not be considered market dominant. The ICC Termination Act transferred this regulatory function to the Board.", "The Staggers Rail Act permitted railroads to negotiate transportation contracts containing confidential terms and conditions that are beyond the Board\u2019s authority while in effect. As figure 1.1 shows, most rail tonnage in 1997\u201470 percent\u2014moved under contracts between the railroads and shippers involved and therefore was not subject to the Board\u2019s rate regulation.", "Shipments exempted from rate regulation accounted for an additional 12 percent of all rail tonnage moved in 1997. The Board is required to exempt any person or class of persons, or a transaction or service, from regulation, where regulation is not needed to carry out congressionally set rail transportation policy and either the transaction or service is of limited scope or regulation is not needed to protect shippers from an abuse of market power. For example, in April 1998, the Board exempted 29 nonferrous recyclable commodity groups from the Board\u2019s regulation. The Board found that trucks play a significant role in the transportation of these commodity groups. Therefore, the Board found that railroads do not possess sufficient market power to abuse shippers. Other exemptions issued for the same reason include those for boxcar traffic, certain agricultural products, and intermodal transportation.", "The remaining traffic, potentially subject to rate regulation, accounted for 18 percent of rail tonnage in 1997.

By contrast, manufacturing companies and utilities earned rates of return in 1975 of about 15 and 12 percent, respectively. The financial community was concerned about the railroads\u2019 long-term viability, since the industry faced cash flow difficulties and marginal credit ratings. The 1976 act required the ICC to develop standards for determining whether railroads\u2019 were earning adequate revenues to cover their operating costs and provide a reasonable return on capital. The act provided that railroads\u2019 revenue should (1) provide a flow of net income plus depreciation adequate to support prudent capital outlays, ensure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, and cover the effects of inflation and (2) attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system. Despite the reforms of the 1976 act, in 1980, the Congress found that railroads\u2019 earnings were still insufficient to generate the funds they needed to make improvements to their rail facilities. While the 1976 act required the ICC to develop standards for the adequacy of railroad revenue, the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 required the ICC to determine annually which railroads were earning adequate revenues and to consider revenue adequacy goals when it reviewed the reasonableness of rates.

We met with Board officials, shippers\u2019 organizations, and the AAR to gain a thorough understanding of the process. We then summarized the rate relief process and obtained comments on our summary from the Board. Board officials provided clarification where necessary, and their comments are included in our report. Our description of the rate relief process is contained in chapter 2.", "To determine the number and outcome of rate relief cases filed and/or pending since 1990, we obtained the rate complaints either filed with or pending before the Board or its predecessor, the ICC, from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1998. We compared the number of complaints filed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1998, with the number of complaints that shippers filed from 1980 through 1990. We reviewed the complaints to determine, among other things, their nature, the complaint process used in filing them and their outcome. We also examined the complaints to determine the types of commodities involved, whether the railroad was found to be market dominant, how much time the agency required to make a rate-reasonableness determination, and the rationale for the determination. The Board\u2019s requirement that railroads demonstrate product and geographic competition for traffic subject to a challenged rate was in effect during the course of our review. We did not independently verify the information provided by the Board regarding the number of complaints filed or pending since January 1, 1990.

To identify the individual shippers of each commodity, we obtained the membership lists from each association we contacted. To identify these shippers, we selected three commodity classifications representing four commodities that constitute the largest volume of rail shipments\u2014bulk grain, coal, chemicals, and plastics. In order to identify a sufficient cross-section of wheat shippers, we selected wheat associations in states with the largest wheat production (by volume) for 1997, using data on wheat production from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service. We selected the top three wheat-producing states\u2014Kansas, North Dakota, and Montana\u2014and contacted the grain shipper associations in these states.

In analyzing the questionnaires that were returned, we discovered that a very small percentage of National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) members were rail shippers. Of the questionnaires returned by NCGA members, only six indicated they were rail shippers. This does not yield a statistically valid result, and therefore we dropped the NCGA membership from our statistical analysis. As a result, we reduced our sample of 2,057 by the 400 NCGA members we sampled. This results in an adjusted sample size of 1,657. Of the 1,657 grain, coal, chemicals and plastics shippers we surveyed, 996 (or 60.1 percent) returned our survey. The response rates for grain, coal, chemicals and plastics shippers were 61 percent, 62 percent, and 55 percent, respectively.", "Because the National Grain and Feed Association\u2019s (NGFA) membership was large, we sent our survey to a randomly selected sample of NGFA members. Our sample was statistically drawn and weighted so that we could generalize the responses of the NGFA members we surveyed to the entire membership for each question in the survey. The weights apply only to NGFA member responses and not the responses of the other shippers because we surveyed the entire membership of the other associations. We statistically combined the sample with the responses from the other 10 groups and reported weighted estimates for each question in the survey. As a result, the views and opinions of the shippers we surveyed are generalizable to the views and opinions of the 11 groups we surveyed.", "Not all shippers who responded to our survey were rail shippers, however. Therefore, our analysis only considers the responses of shippers that indicated that they were rail shippers, and have used rail in at least one year since 1990.

The questionnaires asked the railroads to indicate the significance of barriers caused by the standard rate complaint process and their opinions regarding shippers\u2019 suggestions to improve the process and increase competition in the railroad industry. In addition, we asked them for information regarding any rate complaint cases in which they were involved, including the number of complaints and the outcome of each complaint. AAR officials answered questions pertaining to the rate relief process and competition issues on behalf of the railroads. Each individual railroad was asked to answer questions regarding rate complaints pertaining to its company. We did not receive a sufficient number of responses from the railroads regarding the rate complaints to provide any additional data on the cases filed and or pending since 1990.

A complaint must indicate whether the Board should examine the challenged rate under the Board\u2019s more complex standard or its simplified guidelines and provide information to enable the Board to decide which guidelines to apply. The Board charges a fee to process the complaint. In February 1999, the Board raised the filing fee for a case brought under the standard guidelines to $54,500\u201420 percent of the 1999 cost to the agency of adjudicating a rate complaint. The Board also raised the fee for cases brought under the simplified guidelines issued after the ICC Termination Act to $5,400. After the case is initiated, the parties use a variety of tools to obtain information from each other and present evidence supporting their positions under a schedule established by regulation or by the Board. The Board must decide cases under the standard guidelines within 9 months after the close of the administrative record and cases under the simplified guidelines within 6 months. For cases under the standard guidelines, the Board\u2019s goal is to complete the entire process in 16 months.

However, either side may be reluctant to share information, particularly information that may damage its case. Disputes have also arisen when a shipper contended that a railroad\u2019s discovery requests were unfairly burdensome. For example, in a 1998 case, FMC Wyoming Corporation and FMC Corporation v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, the Board limited the railroad\u2019s broad requests for information on possible product- and geographic-based competition.", "The Board found that through its broad discovery requests, the railroad had improperly attempted to shift the burdens of identifying product and geographic competition to the complaining shipper. As a result, the Board imposed restrictions limiting discovery requests. The Board later removed product and geographic competition from consideration in all cases.", "Shipping groups told us that obtaining information during the discovery process can be difficult and that railroads make it burdensome and time-consuming for them. Furthermore, shippers are reluctant to challenge railroads during discovery, fearing that an extended schedule will lead to added costs and the continued disruption of daily operations. On the basis of survey responses, we estimate that about 67 percent of the rail shippers indicated that difficulty in getting necessary data from the railroads would preclude them from filing a rate complaint.

The requirement to determine market dominance originated with the 1976 act, which broadly defined market dominance as the absence of effective competition from other railroads or other modes of transportation. Underlying this statutory directive was the theory that if the railroad did not dominate the market, competitive pressures would keep rail rates at a reasonable level. The Staggers Rail Act retained this requirement and tied the definition of market dominance to rail rates exceeding a certain revenue-to-variable cost percentage.", "An analysis of market dominance contains both quantitative and qualitative components. Quantitatively, the Board first determines if the revenue produced by the traffic transported is less than 180 percent of the railroad\u2019s variable cost of providing the service. By statute, a railroad is not considered to dominate the market for traffic that is priced below the 180-percent revenue-to-variable cost level. If the revenue produced by the traffic exceeds the statutory threshold, the Board conducts a qualitative analysis using data the shipper and railroad provide on competition. The shipper must prove that it does not have (1) access to more than one competing railroad or combination of railroads that can transport the same commodity between the same origin and destination points (intramodal competition) or (2) access to other competing modes of transportation, such as trucks or barges, that could transport the same commodity between the same origin and destination points (intermodal competition).

In February 1983, the ICC proposed new Constrained Market Pricing (CMP) guidelines for coal shipped in markets where there was only one railroad. After more than 2-1/2 years of comment, the ICC adopted these final standard guidelines. Since the standard guidelines\u2019 adoption, the ICC and the Board have used the guidelines to evaluate the reasonableness of rates for noncoal shipments.

If the hypothetical railroad\u2019s rate, including revenues sufficient to cover all costs and a reasonable profit, would be less than the rate the railroad charged the shipper, the Board will conclude that the challenged rate is unreasonable and may order the railroad to pay reparations on past shipments and prescribe rates for future shipments. Conversely, if the hypothetical railroad\u2019s rate would be greater than the challenged rate, the Board will conclude that the rate is reasonable and dismiss the complaint.", "To reach its final decision, the Board typically employs a multidisciplinary team that includes a civil engineer to review the shipper\u2019s assumptions in building the hypothetical railroad, a transportation analyst to review the shipper\u2019s operational assumptions for the hypothetical railroad, and a financial analyst to prepare discounted cash flows. According to Board officials, the complexity of current rate cases and resource constraints on the Board allow the agency to work on two standard procedures cases concurrently at an average cost to the agency of $270,000 per case for staff directly assigned to a given case.

After the Board adopted the simplified guidelines in 1996, AAR challenged the simplified guidelines in federal court, contending that the guidelines did not fulfill the Congress\u2019s directive to establish a simple and expedited method to determine whether rates in small cases were reasonable. AAR asserted that the guidelines were \u201cvague and could undermine the revenue adequacy of railroads.\u201d On June 30, 1998, the court found that the challenge to the simplified guidelines was premature because the Board had not yet applied them to invalidate a specific rate. The shippers\u2019 representatives that we contacted expect that AAR will challenge the results of the first case in which the Board decides that a challenged rate is not reasonable under the simplified guidelines. These representatives contend that shippers may be reluctant to file a case under the simplified guidelines because they expect the results to be appealed and they would incur additional legal costs in subsequent litigation. In addition, they contend that if the court ruling invalidates the simplified guidelines, shippers would then have to decide whether to pursue complaints under the more complex standard guidelines.

In January 1998, the Board issued expedited procedures for complaints brought under the simplified guidelines. These procedures established a 50-day schedule for the Board\u2019s determination as to whether simplified guidelines should be used in the complaint. Despite these efforts, the Board has either suspended or extended the proceedings for most of the shippers\u2019 complaints as a result of shippers\u2019 and railroads\u2019 requests. Furthermore, in an effort to speed up the process and develop realistic time frames, the parties confer with each other at the outset of a rate case to set the ground rules for the proceedings. During the conference, the parties identify and resolve disputes relating to discovery or the evidentiary schedule. Finally, the Board eliminated product- and geographic-based competition from its market-dominance analysis.

The ICC Termination Act established the Railroad-Shipper Transportation Advisory Council to advise the Board, the Secretary of Transportation, and congressional oversight committees on rail transportation policy issues of particular interest to small shippers and small railroads. As a result of a proposal by the Council, the Board established a voluntary arbitration process as an alternative to traditional proceedings. The regulations establish a 120-day time frame for arbitration proceedings. Arbitrators\u2019 decisions are binding and judicially enforceable, subject to a limited right of appeal to the Board. Arbitration has not been used as a substitute for a rate complaint. According to officials of the National Grain and Feed Association, arbitration is suitable for service problems, such as the misrouting of cars, but mediation is preferred to resolve rate complaints.", "As a result of April 1998 hearings, the Board has encouraged further private-sector discussions to address access and competition issues. At the hearings, shippers called for a greater role for smaller railroads, particularly in rural areas. In September 1998, the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) and AAR announced an agreement to improve service. The agreement provides for the arbitration of certain issues contested by class I and smaller railroads. However, the Board also mandated that the railroads and shippers establish a formal dialogue to address concerns raised during the April hearings. In response to the Board\u2019s directive, the National Grain and Feed Association and AAR entered into an agreement to address rate and service issues in the grain industry. The agreement provides for confidential, nonbinding mediation of certain rate disputes and mandatory binding arbitration of service disputes.", "Other mechanisms to encourage discussions between the railroad and shipper communities include the National Grain Car Council and the Joint Grain Logistics Task Force. The ICC Termination Act directed the Board to consult as necessary with the National Grain Car Council, previously established by the ICC as a means for assisting the Board in addressing problems arising in transporting grain by rail. According to a Board official, the National Grain Car Council generally focuses on addressing issues for the grain industry as a whole, and not necessarily for individual shippers.

Officials stated that the standard complaint procedures that the Board currently uses for large cases resulted from many years of debate and judicial interpretations. These standard procedures address the concerns that the Board must consider under the statute as it seeks to balance two competing goals: considering the needs of the railroad industry for adequate revenues while simultaneously ensuring that the industry does not exert an unfair advantage over captive shippers. Board officials noted that the agency has streamlined the standard process for handling large cases (such as modifying the market-dominance rule). However, they stated that the complexity of the standard procedures for larger rate cases is largely unavoidable, given the complexity of the underlying issues to be resolved and the need to balance competing policy objectives laid out by the Congress. Thus, officials contend that to further substantially reduce the complexity, time, and expense involved in handling these rate complaints would require legislative action.", "Officials noted that the Congress could choose to adopt even simpler maximum rate formulas for certain traffic. However, officials continued, a substantial retreat from differential pricing principles could have a noticeable effect on the railroad industry\u2019s financial health and the type and scope of services provided and thus could affect the shippers that rely upon that industry to meet their transportation needs. Similarly, officials noted that the suggestions for increasing rail competition, such as through open access, would require substantial changes to the statute, could alter the shape and condition of the rail system, and limit the ability of the nation\u2019s rail system to meet the needs of some of the shippers that use the current system.", "In response, we recognize that the Board faces competing policy objectives as a result of existing laws. These competing policies come to the forefront not just with rail rate complaints but with many other Board proceedings, such as actions to approve railroad mergers and consolidations. Throughout this report, we repeatedly cite the competing policies, embodied in statute, that the Board must employ in making its rail-related decisions. However, we have modified the report to reflect the Board\u2019s views that important aspects of the rate-relief process or the competitive structure of the railroad industry can only be changed with the support and approval of the Congress.", "Board officials also stated that the report does not adequately address the simplified procedures. Officials stated that the new procedures were designed to provide a shorter, simpler, and less expensive means to address cases in which the more complex standard procedures are not cost effective. Board officials stated that the report, as well as our survey, generally focused on the standard rate complaint process\u2014a process that is inherently more complex and time-consuming. Board officials stated that the report does not adequately reflect the value that the new, simplified procedures could have for the shippers that will use them. Although shippers have complained that the simplified procedures are also complex, Board officials stated that the procedures are user-friendly and based on readily available and inexpensive data. Because the Board would defend the simplified procedures against railroad challenges in court, Board officials stated that eligible shippers should not be deterred from using them simply because the procedures have not yet been judicially affirmed. Officials expressed confidence that the courts would affirm the Board\u2019s simplified procedures, when they are applied.", "In response, we note that since the Board issued its simplified procedures in December 1996, no shipper has asked the Board to review a rate complaint under them. As this chapter notes, shippers and their associations are reluctant to use the simplified procedures because they believe that AAR will challenge the first rate complaint filed under the new procedures. Shipper associations have noted that Board statements declaring the Board\u2019s intended defense of the simplified guidelines offer little encouragement for any shipper to be the first to file a complaint under these new procedures. While the new procedures offer shippers the prospect of resolving their complaints faster, the prospect of future litigation provides little incentive for shippers to initiate such a complaint.

However, some of the rail shippers that responded to our survey indicated that the complexity of the rate complaint process also had influenced their decisions not to file rate complaints. As a result of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, railroads could establish rates through contracts with individual shippers rather than only through tariffs\u2014predetermined rate schedules for particular routes\u2014filed with the ICC. Contracts reflect negotiated agreements for rates and service levels tailored to the shippers\u2019 needs. A 1988 AAR survey found that 60 percent of all rail traffic was subject to private transportation contracts between the shippers and the railroads. By 1997, AAR found that the amount of rail traffic subject to a contract had increased to 70 percent. In addition, according to the Board, the average inflation-adjusted class I railroad rate steadily declined 46 percent from 1982 through 1996, perhaps also leading to a decline in the number of rate complaints. Of the 709 shippers that responded to our survey, 25 percent indicated that they found their freight rates reasonable and therefore found no reason to file a complaint.

Shippers of bulk commodities like coal, grain and chemicals are highly dependent on rail for their transportation needs and filed the most rate complaints. Coal, grain, and chemical shipments constituted about 60 percent of total traffic on class I railroads in 1997, and accounted for 76 percent (31) of the complaints either pending or filed since January 1, 1990. Coal shippers alone filed 21 of the 41 complaints, as shown in figure 3.2.", "The six chemical and four grain complaints represented 24 percent of the complaints either pending or filed since 1990. Commodities other than coal, grain, and chemicals identified in these complaints include corn syrup, sugar, pulpwood and woodchips, electric transformers, spent nuclear fuel, railroad cars, and perlite rock. Appendix II contains a list of the commodities associated with each complaint. Board officials believe that the number of rate complaints from coal shippers will increase partly because many long-term private transportation contracts between railroads and utility companies are expiring and there may be disputes regarding rates in the absence of contracts. According to the Board, coal shippers have the most incentive for bringing a rate complaint because of the large amount of dollars potentially in dispute. For example, in 1998, the Board awarded the Arizona Public Service Company and PacifiCorp over $23 million plus interest in their joint complaint against the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company. In addition, the stand-alone cost model is relatively less complicated to apply to coal shipments than it is to other commodities, such as chemicals. Railroads usually transport coal shipments between few origins and destinations\u2014mainly between the coal mine and the utility company\u2019s generating plant\u2014over a limited segment of a railroad\u2019s system. Chemical shippers, on the other hand, typically send smaller shipments to many destinations.

According to the Board, some cases were lengthy because the standards were not in place when the cases were filed and/or because of extensive litigation.", "The time required for resolving a complaint varied by commodity. Three complaints filed by grain shippers, which were combined into a single proceeding, McCarty Farms, Inc. et al. v. Burlington Northern, Inc., took about 16 years to resolve. According to Board officials, this is principally because the complaints were filed before the ICC had developed rate standards and because the parties challenged various ICC and Board decisions in court. In 1980, about 10,000 Montana farmers and owners of grain elevators (the McCarty Farms Group) filed a class action lawsuit against the railroad in federal district court, challenging Burlington Northern\u2019s rates on wheat shipped from Montana to Oregon and Washington State. After numerous reviews by the agency and the courts, the Board found the rates not to be unreasonable in August 1997 and discontinued the proceedings. In October, 1997, the McCarty Farms Group appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Shippers of specific commodities (grain, coal, chemicals, and plastics) have unique characteristics that may have affected their responses. For example, coal shippers make very large, routine shipments throughout the course of the year and often have few alternatives to using rail; thus, rail shipping costs are a significant portion of their total shipping costs. Coal shippers believed that the most significant barrier is the time involved in filing a complaint. This is because coal shippers would have to continue to pay the disputed rate over the length of the rate complaint process. However, they can obtain reparations plus interest if the rate is found to be unreasonable. Grain shippers cited legal costs as the most significant barrier. Grain shippers make the highest volume of their shipments during the harvest season and generally have more transportation options available to them. As a result, they spend relatively less on rail shipping, and therefore the costs of a complaint may offset or exceed the potential benefits of filing.", "The shippers\u2019 concerns identified in our survey are similar to those we found in 1987, when we examined the rate complaint process and contacted shippers that had filed complaints with the ICC. At that time, we found that shippers were generally dissatisfied with the rate complaint process. Shippers were concerned about the complexity of the stand-alone cost model, the costs and time involved in adjudicating a rate complaint, the lack of clear criteria for determining rate reasonableness, and fear that railroads would most likely win any rate complaint case. Of the shippers we contacted in 1987 that used the process, 53 percent indicated that they would probably use the complaint process again if they believed their rates to be unreasonable. This compares to 68 percent of rail shippers in our 1998 survey who responded that they would probably or definitely use the rate complaint process again. This could indicate that, while some shippers are dissatisfied with the rate relief process, they may recognize it as their only alternative for seeking relief from unreasonable rates.

The railroads, however, want the standard for determining market dominance to remain. This is generally the same position that the railroads held in 1987, when AAR officials stated that the railroads were generally satisfied with the standard rate complaint process and viewed the criteria for jurisdictional threshold, market dominance, and rate reasonableness as clear. In our discussions at that time, railroad officials said they found the process suitable for adjudicating larger rate complaints.

In a 1996 decision, the Board noted that it was sympathetic to shippers\u2019 concerns that increasing the filing fee could impede the filing of complaints. In an effort intended to lessen the burden of the fees, the Board tentatively set the complaint filing fee at 10 percent of the full cost of adjudicating a complaint and proposed increasing the fee 10 percent annually until the fully allocated cost level was achieved. In 1998, the Board chose to increase the fee in proportion to increases in its costs rather than by the annual 10-percent adjustment. A report by DOT\u2019s Office of Inspector General recommended that the Board either annually increase the fee to recover the full cost of complaint adjudication or convene a new proceeding to determine whether such increases are feasible and warranted. In February 1999, the Board updated its fee schedule and adjusted its complaint filing fees. As a result, the fee for filing a standard rate complaint increased from $27,000 to $54,500.

The League assembled and analyzed the disclosure requests that railroads served on the complaining shippers in seven rate cases. On the basis of its analysis, the League found that railroads submitted hundreds of questions to the shippers that required hundreds of hours of effort by lawyers, consultants, and staff. In addition, many of the questions asked for multiple pieces of information and thus complicated the shippers\u2019 efforts to answer the questions. The League contended that market-dominance discovery of this magnitude constituted a formidable barrier for the shippers.", "The railroads contended that, in order for them to successfully challenge a complaint, product and geographic competition tests are crucial to showing that sufficient alternatives exist for the shipper. The railroads acknowledged that the product and geographic competition criteria can make it unduly burdensome to litigate rate reasonableness cases before the Board. They contended that a core premise of the economics of competition is that market power can be constrained by a range of competitive forces, including product and geographic competition. The railroads agreed, however, that procedural obstacles and the cost of litigation should not be barriers to obtaining regulatory relief when such relief is warranted.

Shippers\u2019 support for arbitration as an alternative to the rate complaint process not only differed by the type of arbitration proposed but by the type of commodity shipped. Grain shippers generally favored arbitration more than coal, chemicals, and plastics shippers. In October 1998, the National Grain and Feed Association\u2019s (NGFA) signed an agreement with the class I railroads to submit certain disputes to mandatory, binding arbitration. While rate disputes are excluded from the mandatory aspect of the agreement, they can be mediated on a voluntary basis.", "AAR officials point to the NGFA arbitration agreement as evidence that the railroads are willing to work with shippers to address their concerns. Furthermore, the officials added, the agreement is a solution that addresses shippers\u2019 concerns outside of the regulatory framework\u2014at the Board\u2019s request. As a result of April 1998 hearings, the Board asked shippers and railroads to work together to recommend solutions that would improve the existing process.

The mediation process, if successful, could reduce the number of complaints. Board officials note that railroads and shippers currently have the option of agreeing to voluntary mediation or voluntary arbitration of a dispute.

AAR cited past Board decisions showing that rates greater than 180 percent of variable costs were found to be reasonable.

Shipper groups contend that increasing competition would enhance the viability of their businesses, lower the freight rates they currently pay, and diminish the overall need for the rate complaint process. The class I railroads contend that competition is greater than it has ever been and note that current rates are 46 percent lower than they were in 1982.

Of the 709 rail shippers we surveyed, an estimated 81 percent said that the Board should grant trackage rights to competing railroads to improve competition in the railroad industry. Furthermore, our estimates show that from 71 to 75 percent favored granting reciprocal switching agreements, increasing shortline railroad access to the major railroads, and expanding the relief provided in the Board\u2019s bottleneck decision.", "The railroads and AAR disagree with shippers on the need for additional competition. AAR officials contend that the Board may currently grant trackage rights and reciprocal switching where there are competitive abuses. AAR sees additional efforts to impose reciprocal switching agreements and trackage rights as a kind of \u201cforced\u201d access and greater government regulation of shipping rates that would return the industry to the poor financial condition it was in before deregulation. Furthermore, AAR stated that these methods should be used only as a remedy when needed, not as a means to create additional competition. Regarding increased access to shortline railroads, AAR officials noted that the association has recently entered into a cooperative agreement with the American Shortline and Regional Railroad Association. The 5-year agreement seeks to improve customer service through a mutual car supply policy, cooperative interchange service agreements, and reduced switching barriers. AAR officials challenged the Board\u2019s bottleneck decision in court on the grounds that it went too far in requiring railroads to provide separately challengeable rates in certain circumstances.", "Board officials agreed with AAR that requiring trackage rights and reciprocal switching agreements are remedies that are currently available to shippers and that they have been used where appropriate. However, Board officials stated that it is not authorized to grant trackage rights or reciprocal switching as a remedy for a complaint about the reasonableness of a rate because the only statutory remedies for an unreasonable rate are reparations and rate prescriptions.

They stated that many shippers assume that greater competition would lead to lower rates and improved service, without the need for differential pricing. Board officials cited a countervailing concern, however, that not all shippers would benefit equally from such changes and that the result could be a smaller rail system serving fewer shippers and a different mix of customers than are served today.

The Board also believed that we should clarify that the survey asked shippers to comment on the standard process and not the simplified procedures, even though the majority of the survey respondents would likely qualify for the simplified procedures.", "We disagree that our survey should have sought comments only from captive shippers. Such an approach would inject excessive bias into the survey and would have produced results that represented only a small segment of the shipper community. More importantly, we disagree that only captive shippers would be in a position to provide informed analysis of the rate complaint process and methods to improve it. The consolidation in the railroad industry has made all shippers keenly aware of their potential for becoming captive to only one railroad and equally aware of the means available to seek recourse should they believe that their rates are unreasonable. In addition, the Board\u2019s position is contrary to its standard practice of inviting comments from all parties during its deliberations\u2014deliberations that can vary from improvements to the rate complaint process to more complex issues, such as railroad mergers and consolidations. Therefore, we chose to survey all shippers and class I railroads to garner their insights into the rate complaint process; to discount any comment minimizes the views and opinions of the shipper community.", "Regarding the Board\u2019s comment on distinguishing between the standard and simplified procedures in the report and the survey, we have clarified the report to better differentiate between the two processes.

In addition, the Board noted that the report did not address whether the surveyed shippers were being charged higher rates than they should reasonably be expected to pay. The Board indicated that, under the demand-based differential pricing principles that the Congress has determined should apply to the rail industry, it is not necessarily unreasonable to have even one shipper paying a higher rail rate than a comparable shipper with greater transportation alternatives.", "The Board\u2019s characterization of our survey is not accurate. We did not ask shippers if they wanted lower prices. Rather, we sought to determine the barriers shippers face in filing rate complaints with the Board and options for improving this process. Furthermore, the survey was not limited to the Board\u2019s rate complaint process but also sought information about the quality of service that shippers had received from 1990 to 1997. This information is presented in our companion report. We agree with the Board\u2019s comment that we did not address whether the surveyed shippers were being charged higher rates than they should reasonably be expected to pay. Because this is the stated purpose of the highly complex and time-consuming rate complaint process, we defer these judgments to the Board.", "Finally, the Board believed we should more clearly identify the percentage of shippers that expressed a specific opinion on issues presented in the survey to avoid misleading interpretations of the survey results. For example, because 25 percent of the surveyed rail shippers found their rates to be reasonable, our presentation of the barriers shippers encounter in filing a rate complaint should only be attributed to the remaining 75 percent of rail shippers responding. In addition, the Board noted that those shippers that responded \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d or that did not answer specific questions should be included among those shippers that did not assign great importance to the choices identified rather than excluded from the total count.", "We have clarified our presentation of the survey responses to distinguish between those shippers that consider their rates to be reasonable and other shippers.

McCarty Farms alleged that Burlington Northern Railroad was charging unreasonable rates for transporting wheat from Montana to ports in Oregon and Washington State for the 2-year period ending September 12, 1980. The district court referred the matter to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to determine the reasonableness of the rates. On March 27, 1981, McCarty Farms filed a complaint with the ICC challenging not only Burlington Northern\u2019s wheat rates but also its rates for barley. McCarty Farms asked ICC to prescribe future rates. It did not limit its request for reparations to the 2-year period specified in its complaint filed with the district court. In a December 1981 decision, an administrative law judge found that (1) Burlington Northern had market dominance over wheat and barley traffic, (2) Burlington Northern\u2019s present and past rates were unreasonable insofar as they exceeded 200 percent of the variable cost of service, and (3) a revenue-to-variable-cost ratio of 200 percent would constitute the maximum reasonable rate for the transportation of wheat and barley.", "In a separate proceeding filed with the ICC on March 26, 1981, the Montana Department of Agriculture and the Montana Wheat Research and Marketing Committee (state of Montana) challenged Burlington Northern\u2019s rates for multiple-car and trainload shipments of wheat and barley and asked the ICC to prescribe rates for future shipments. In a July 1982 decision, the ICC reopened the McCarty Farms complaint and instituted a separate proceeding regarding the reasonableness of barley rates because it did not believe they were part of the district court\u2019s referral. The ICC consolidated the McCarty Farms and state of Montana proceedings.", "According to Board officials, in 1983, the ICC vacated the administrative law judge\u2019s opinion because the rate reasonableness standard used had been discredited and held the three consolidated cases in abeyance, pending its search for appropriate rate standards for noncoal cases. The ICC reopened the proceedings in September 1984 in response to a district court directive to move forward with the case. In an April 1986 decision, the ICC reopened the record for additional market-dominance evidence because of the changes made to its market-dominance guidelines in 1985. After extensive discovery, in May 1987, the ICC ruled that Burlington Northern dominated the market over wheat and barley movements from Montana to the Pacific Northwest. Having determined that Burlington Northern dominated the market for the shipments at issue, ICC turned to the rate-reasonableness analysis. ICC decided to use this case to develop a new rate test\u2014the revenue-to-variable-cost comparison. In 1988, applying the new comparison, the ICC found some of the rates unreasonable for some years (1981 through 1986) and directed the parties to calculate reparations.", "In 1991, the ICC affirmed its earlier decisions, concluding that Burlington Northern dominated the movement of wheat and barley and that Burlington Northern\u2019s rates for this traffic were unreasonable. According to Board officials, the ICC calculated the amount of reparations owed by Burlington Northern through 1988 to be $8.97 million plus interest and prescribed the level of future rates. The ICC subsequently updated the amount of reparations and interest due to $16.6 million through July 1, 1991, and removed the rate prescription as unnecessary since the rates had been in compliance with the rate reasonableness standard for the prior 5 years.", "Both Burlington Northern and McCarty Farms sought judicial review of the ICC\u2019s decision. In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit questioned the ICC\u2019s use of the revenue-to-variable-cost comparison and the reasons for not applying the stand-alone cost test to this large volume of traffic. The court sent the case back to the ICC to reconsider whether the stand-alone cost model would be more appropriate. On remand, both parties agreed to apply the stand-alone cost test and from 1993 through 1995, prepared and presented their stand-alone cost evidence. According to Board officials, the review of the stand-alone cost evidence was delayed somewhat because key ICC staff who had been working on the case left the agency as a result of the reduction-in-force implemented following the ICC Termination Act of 1995.", "In an August 1997 decision, the Board found that McCarty Farms had failed to show that Burlington Northern\u2019s rates were unreasonably high on the basis of its review of the evidence of the stand-alone cost model. According to the Board, this conclusion is consistent with the ICC\u2019s prior conclusion that certain rates during 1981 through 1986 were unreasonable. On the basis of the 20-year analysis presented in the discounted cash flow analysis in the stand-alone cost model, Burlington Northern earned more revenues in 1981 through 1986 than was necessary to cover the stand-alone costs allocated to those years. However, those additional earnings were needed to make up for shortfalls in other years. The Board discontinued the proceedings.", "In October 1997, McCarty Farms appealed the Board\u2019s August 1997 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After examining McCarty Farms\u2019 brief to the court, the Board agreed that there were certain errors in the August 1997 decision and issued a supplemental decision to correct those determinations that it agreed were erroneous. Even after it made these corrections, the Board still concluded that Burlington Northern\u2019s rates were reasonable. In a decision issued on October 20, 1998, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, agreeing that the challenged rates had not been shown to be unreasonable under the stand-alone cost test. As noted earlier, the court held that it did not have jurisdiction over claims that were initially raised by the McCarty Farms Group\u2019s complaint in federal district court and subsequently referred to the ICC.
