However, more progress and knowledge is needed to minimize the risk of cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls. The Crusader program will likely enter product development with most of its critical technologies less mature than best practices recommend. Most of the Crusader's critical technologies have been demonstrated in a relevant environment but not in the more demanding operational environment. Although the Army is reducing the Crusader's weight so that two vehicles can be deployed on a C-17 aircraft, the deployability advantage gained does not appear significant. The reduction in the Crusader system's weight would only decrease the number of C-17 flights needed to transport two complete systems and support equipment from five to four flights. A lighter system offers several other benefits, and knowing the magnitude of the deployability advantage of reduced weight would allow the Army to make better decisions on trade offs. An apparent overlap exists between the Crusader's and the Future Combat Systems' capabilities and schedules. The Army expects the Future Combat Systems to meet the same artillery missions as the Crusader and eventually replace it. The current schedules for initial fielding of the Future Combat Systems and the Crusader system occur in the same year, 2008. The extent of this apparent overlap depends more on the Future Combat Systems than the Crusader because less is known about the Future Combat Systems' technologies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To address future threats, the Army has identified a requirement for an  artillery system that has greater firepower, range, and mobility than its  current self-propelled howitzer\u2014the Paladin.

In 1994, the Army began to develop the  Crusader, an advanced artillery system consisting of a self-propelled 155- millimeter howitzer and a resupply vehicle. The Army\u2019s total acquisition  cost in the Crusader program is projected to be about $11 billion. In 2000,  the Army changed its requirements and restructured the Crusader program  to make the system lighter and more deployable. This change was in  response to the Army\u2019s planned transformation to a future force, which will  also be lighter and more deployable.

The  opportunity to take actions that can put the program in a better position to  succeed and, thus, minimize future cost and schedule increases is now,  before the start of product development. As the Army approaches that  decision point, we examined three major aspects of the program: (1) the  progress in developing Crusader\u2019s technology and software, (2) the  Crusader\u2019s requirement for improved deployability, and (3) the Army\u2019s  timetables for developing the Crusader and the Future Combat Systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Army plans to invest about $11 billion developing and procuring the  Crusader, an automated, next generation field artillery system.

The Army expects the transformation to  be at least a 30-year process and has not estimated its full cost. The  centerpiece of the lighter, more deployable future force is the Future  Combat Systems. The Future Combat Systems concept is a system of  ground and air, manned and unmanned weapon systems, each under 20  tons that is planned to replace most, if not all, of the Army\u2019s ground combat  systems without a loss in lethality and survivability.

Program officials said that a lighter system would enhance  operational flexibility in employing Crusader in support of any operation.", "The Crusader is currently in the program definition and risk reduction  phase of its development program. In April 2003, the program is scheduled  for a milestone B review to determine whether it is ready to enter its  system development and demonstration phase. Milestone B is the point at  which DOD decides whether to commit major resources to develop and  design the system and to demonstrate its integration, interoperability, and  utility.

Our  past reviews of programs incorporating technologies into new products  and weapon systems showed that they were more likely to meet product objectives when the technologies were matured before product  development started. For example, the Ford Motor Company\u2019s practice of  demonstrating new technologies in driving conditions before they are  included in a new product is essential to ensuring that the new product can  be developed on time and within budget. Similarly, we have found that the  early demonstration of propulsion and water-planing technologies,  essential to the performance of the Marine Corps\u2019 Advance Amphibious  Assault Vehicle, has been instrumental to that program\u2019s staying within  15 percent of cost and schedule estimates.", "Conversely, cost, schedule, and performance problems were more likely to  occur when programs started with technologies at lower readiness levels.For example, the enabling technologies for the Army\u2019s Brilliant Anti-Armor  Submunition program were very immature at the start of the program, and  their delays became major contributors to the program\u2019s subsequent  88-percent cost growth and 62-percent schedule slippage. Separating  technology development from product development into two distinct  program phases is a best practice of both successful commercial and  defense programs. This entails demonstrating all critical technologies at  the component or subsystem level in an operational environment during  technology development, prior to committing major funding to product  development. Under this practice, the critical technologies would be  demonstrated in component or subsystem prototypes that are nearly the  right size, weight, and configuration needed for the intended product. Such  demonstrations need not require a full system prototype of a Crusader  vehicle, but can be done using surrogate vehicles.", "Technology readiness levels (TRL) are a good way to gauge the maturity of  technologies. TRLs were pioneered by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration to determine the readiness of technologies to be  incorporated into products such as weapon systems. Readiness levels are  measured along a scale of one to nine, starting with paper studies of the  basic concept, proceeding with laboratory demonstrations, and ending  with a technology that has proven itself on the intended product. TRLs are  based on actual demonstrations of how well specific technologies perform  in the intended application. For example, a technology that has been  demonstrated in an operational environment using subsystem prototype  hardware (such as a complete cannon system) that is at or near the final  system design would be rated as a TRL 7. The individual TRL descriptions  can be found in appendix I.", "DOD has agreed that technology readiness assessments are important and  necessary in assisting officials who decide when and where to insert new  technologies into weapon system programs. In January 2001, DOD issued a  new acquisition instruction that redefined the phases in the defense  acquisition cycle and emphasized the role of technology development in  the acquisition process. Under the instruction, programs use the concept  and technology development phase, which precedes the system  development and demonstration phase, for developing components and  subsystems that must be demonstrated before integration into the system.  The first portion of system development and demonstration phase is  dedicated to integrating the components and subsystems into the system.  The instruction states that DOD prefers that technology be demonstrated in  an operational environment but must be demonstrated in a relevant  environment to be considered mature enough for product development in  the system development and demonstration phase. According to the TRL  descriptions, technology demonstrated in an operational environment is  TRL 7 and technology demonstrated in a relevant environment is TRL 6.", "Maturing technology from a TRL 6 to a TRL 7 represents a major step up in  maturity. A technology at the TRL 6 maturity level needs only to be  demonstrated as a subsystem prototype or model in a laboratory or  simulated operational environment. A technology at the TRL 7 maturity  level must be demonstrated as a subsystem prototype at or near the size of  the required subsystem outside the laboratory in an actual operational  environment. For example, operating a prototype engine on a laboratory  test stand that simulates the effects of the vehicle\u2019s weight on the engine  would be a TRL 6 level demonstration while operating an engine in a  surrogate vehicle or actual prototype that weighed 50 tons, on roads and  cross country, would be a TRL 7 demonstration.", "In June 2001, DOD issued a new acquisition regulation. It stated that  technology maturity is a principal element of program risk and directed  technology readiness assessments for critical technologies sufficiently  prior to selected milestone decision points\u2014including milestone B--to  provide useful technology maturity information to the acquisition review  process. Although the new regulation recognizes that TRLs enable  consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types  of technologies and provides the definitions of TRLs used in this report, it  permits the use of TRLs or \u201csome equivalent assessment\u201d when performing  a technology readiness assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology Maturation Will Continue into Product Development", "paragraphs": ["In June 2001, Crusader program office engineers and we assessed the  maturity of 16 critical Crusader technologies using TRLs.

However, the Army\u2019s Crusader plans will result in 10 of the critical  Crusader technologies remaining below TRL 7 at the milestone B decision  and in technology development continuing into the product development  phase. As a result, the Crusader program would not reach the low levels of  risk that best practices show is needed for meeting product development  cost and schedule commitments. Table 1 shows the results of our joint  technology readiness assessment.", "As shown in table 1, if technology develops as planned, eight critical  technologies will be at a TRL 6 level of maturity and two will be at a TRL 5  level of maturity at milestone B. While some technologies may embody  some risk in meeting requirements, for the most part, the risk in the  Crusader technologies involves the amount of time and effort needed to  reach maturity. The planned technology maturity levels for the Crusader  program at milestone B increase the probability that technical problems, if  they occur, will need to be resolved in the higher cost environment of  system development and demonstration. Confining delays in maturing  technology to a time prior to the start of product development\u2014in an  environment where small teams of technologists work in laboratories and  are dedicated to perfecting the technology\u2014is critical to saving time and  money. Conversely, if delays occur in product development when a large  engineering force is in place to design and manufacture the product, delays  would be much more costly. In fact, industry experts estimate that a delay  during product development costs several times more than a similar delay  that occurs before product development.", "Under the current Crusader acquisition plans, the critical technologies  would be demonstrated in two steps after milestone B. Program officials  are planning to demonstrate mobility component technologies first and  then the remaining critical technologies. They recognize a risk in  integrating the Crusader\u2019s mobility components\u2014track, suspension,  engine, and transmission\u2014and plan to produce a mobility test rig to  demonstrate that integration and to start accumulating reliability data on  the mobility components. The mobility test rig would have the additional  advantage of demonstrating the maturity of those technologies in an  operational environment. The contractor is scheduled to deliver the  mobility test rig in December 2003. The test rig would later be rebuilt as a  Crusader prototype.", "The remaining critical technologies would not be demonstrated until after  the contractor delivers the Crusader prototypes. The first Crusader system  prototype is scheduled for delivery in October 2004 and is to enter testing  the same month. Other prototypes would enter testing as they are  delivered. The Army plans to award contracts for low-rate initial  production long-lead items in March 2005\u2014less than a fourth of the way  through the prototype-testing schedule. This leaves little time in the  Crusader\u2019s projected system development and demonstration schedule for  solving unanticipated problems before the Army awards contracts for long- lead production items.", "The Army\u2019s approach to readying the Crusader for milestone B is to  demonstrate progress toward achieving five of the system\u2019s requirements,  two of which are key performance parameters\u2014the cannon rate of fire  and the ability to resupply the self-propelled howitzer. For example, a  Crusader key performance parameter is that the Crusader cannon be able  to fire 10 to 12 rounds per minute; however, the program only needs to  demonstrate the ability to fire 6 rounds per minute before milestone B. The  demonstrations, called exit criteria, were approved by both the Army and  DOD. Among the demonstrations required by the exit criteria, only the  cannon system is expected to be demonstrated in an operational  environment; the other critical technologies are expected to be  demonstrated in a laboratory environment.", "Moreover, like many other DOD programs, the Crusader program is using  risk management plans and engineering judgment, without the benefit of  TRLs, to assess technological maturity and mitigate program risk. Risk  management plans and engineering judgment are necessary to manage risk  in any major development effort like the Crusader. However, we have found  in our reviews that without an underpinning, such as TRLs, that allows  transparency into program decisions, significant technical unknowns may  be judged acceptable risks because a plan exists for resolving them. For  example, we recently reported that while DOD judged the technical risks  facing the Joint Strike Fighter as acceptable for starting product  development, an analysis of TRLs showed that eight critical technologies  were below TRL 7, with six technologies at TRL 4 or 5.

Improved areas include requirements generation and validation,  quality assurance, configuration management, risk management, schedule  and cost estimation, project tracking and control, and peer reviews of  software engineering products such as design documents, code, and test  plans. In addition, outside experts assisted in software analysis and design.  Others were brought in to independently assess the software recovery plan.

The Army subsequently revised the Crusader's Operational Requirements  Documents to reflect new deployability requirements. Specifically, the  documents state that the Crusader vehicles must not exceed 42 tons at curb weight and 50  tons at combat weight; any combination of two Crusader vehicles, at curb weight, must be air  transportable on both a C-5 and a C-17 aircraft; and both the C-5 and C-17 aircraft must be able to transport a single  Crusader vehicle at combat weight."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Crusader\u2019s Reduced Size and Weight May Not Provide a Significant Improvement in Deployability", "paragraphs": ["The main reason for the decision in January 2000 to restructure the  program and redesign the Crusader weapon system was to reduce the  system\u2019s weight and to improve its strategic deployability by air.

In February 1999, the Army reported to Congress that the  fielding of a lighter-weight Crusader would provide little in improved  strategic deployability over a heavier version. In May 2000, the DOD\u2019s  Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation questioned the need to improve  the Crusader\u2019s deployability, stating that it is unclear whether airlifting a  small force of the heavier Crusaders, when needed, would be a severe  burden on airlift.", "A limited Army analysis comparing the deployability by air of small  numbers of the original heavier Crusader with that of the lighter-weight  Crusader showed that the lighter-weight Crusader system might not  significantly improve the system\u2019s strategic deployability.

On the other  hand, demonstrating the critical technologies in an operational  environment before entering system development and demonstration could  necessitate more time and money than currently planned before the  milestone B decision, but such investments would be relatively small  compared to solving technical problems after the decision.", "The Army restructured the Crusader program to improve the system\u2019s  strategic deployability by reducing the system\u2019s weight. The lighter-weight  system, however, may not provide a significant improvement to strategic  deployability. At this time, the Army is making design trade-offs to meet its  weight requirement and it is not clear whether the Army can maintain its  lighter weight goals throughout the development, production, and fielding  of the Crusader system. Given the uncertainty, the Army risks making  unnecessary cost, schedule, and performance trade-offs to meet  deployability requirements that may not be clearly justified.", "The Army has not ruled out the possibility that it will field the Future  Combat Systems with the ability to meet the same artillery mission as the  Crusader in the same year the Crusader is fielded. However, the extent of  this apparent overlap will not be clear until the potential capabilities and  schedule of the initial version of the Future Combat Systems are  determined. Therefore, it is important that the Army ensure that the  projected capabilities and schedule for the initial Future Combat Systems  are considered in the Crusader milestone decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the risk of schedule delays and increased costs in the product  development phase of the Crusader program, we recommend that the  secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to dedicate the  resources necessary to ensure that the critical Crusader technologies are  demonstrated, at the component and subsystem level, in an operational  environment before the program commits to product development at  milestone B.", "To confirm the value and usefulness of the Crusader program\u2019s  deployability requirement, we recommend that the secretary of defense  direct the secretary of the army to conduct an analysis, before the decision  to enter product development, to determine how important it is to deploy  two Crusaders howitzers on a single C-17 aircraft. If it is important to the  Army, we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of  the army to establish, as a key performance parameter, the maximum per  vehicle weight that would allow the C-17 aircraft to carry two Crusader  howitzers. If the analysis determines that the redesigned Crusader does not  significantly improve the system\u2019s military utility, we recommend that the  secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to reduce the priority  placed on attaining the 42-ton weight limit.", "Finally, to ensure the Army does not invest in two weapon systems that will  meet the same artillery missions at the same time, we recommend that the  secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to determine, based  on available data, the potential capabilities and schedule of the initial  version of the Future Combat Systems and the implication of those  capabilities and schedule on the Crusader\u2019s utility to the Army before  making the decision on beginning the Crusader\u2019s system development and  demonstration\u2014currently scheduled for April 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the director of strategic and  tactical systems, within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said that DOD did not agree with  our recommendation that the Crusader technologies be demonstrated in an  operational environment before the program commits to product  development. DOD said that the Crusader program was a simulation-based  acquisition program and, as such, evaluates system, component, and  subsystem performance and technology readiness using modeling and  simulation validated with test stands, integration laboratories, and  subsystem prototypes. DOD questioned our definition of critical Crusader  technologies and said that the track, for example, was selected by us as a  critical technology and assessed as a TRL 5 despite the Army\u2019s many years  of expertise in track development. DOD also said that the Crusader is  currently demonstrating performance equal to or in excess of threshold  requirements for the final system. Finally, DOD said that changing the  Crusader\u2019s acquisition strategy to accommodate building system level  prototypes required to demonstrate TRL 7 for all critical technologies  would add significantly to the development time and expense without  significantly reducing risk or improving performance. The full text of  DOD\u2019s comments is included in appendix II.", "We agree that modeling and simulation is a key and accepted practice in  any modern development program. However, we have found that programs  need to demonstrate a high level of technology maturity before committing  to product development. As shown by our past reviews, the best practice  standard is that technology must be demonstrated, at the component or  subsystem level, in an operational environment to be considered mature  enough for entering product development. We believe that a program  should use this best practice to assure success in meeting its cost and  schedule goals.", "The determination of the critical Crusader technologies was a joint effort  between the Crusader program office and us. We defined critical Crusader  technologies as those required to meet the Crusader\u2019s key performance  parameters and developed the initial critical technology list. Crusader  program office engineers reviewed the initial list, suggested revisions, and  agreed that the revised critical technologies list was complete and  appropriate. Also, our analysts and program office engineers jointly arrived  at the appropriate TRL for each critical technology. In addition, DOD\u2019s  statement that track should not be a critical Crusader technology or should  have been assessed at a higher TRL because of the Army\u2019s many years of  expertise in track development underscores the value of the TRL  methodology. Track was included as a critical Crusader technology  because the Crusader cannot meet its mobility key performance parameter  without track. The track was assessed at TRL 5 because the Crusader  program was developing a new lighter-weight track. The Army plans to  demonstrate it in an operational environment after milestone B. TRLs  measure whether sufficient knowledge has been accumulated with respect  to each application of a technology, not the development difficulty of the  technology or whether the technology has been previously used in another  application. The issue is not whether a technology like the newly developed  track will ever work, but how much time and effort will be needed to  demonstrate its maturity in this application. The Crusader system  development and demonstration phase does not have much time between  prototype testing and procurement of long-lead items for production to  adjust for any delays or problems in prototype testing caused by  technology problems. Such delays or problems could either delay the long- lead item procurement or reduce the amount of information available when  committing to the procurement.", "DOD\u2019s assessment that the Crusader system is currently demonstrating  performance equal to or in excess of threshold requirements for the final  system is based mainly on modeling, simulations, and laboratory tests  because the program has not produced the final system. As mentioned  above, best practice calls for critical technologies to be demonstrated in an  operational environment not in models, simulations, or laboratory  environments before entering product development.", "DOD stated that building the full system prototype required to demonstrate  TRL 7 would add significant time and expense to the program. However,  demonstrating at TRL 7 does not require a full system prototype but only a  prototype of the component or subsystem that contains a new technology.  The demonstration can be accomplished by putting the new component or  subsystem, such as an engine, on a surrogate vehicle; that is, a vehicle that  already exists. The report\u2019s point is that using full system prototypes to  demonstrate the maturity of critical technologies during the product  development phase, as planned in the Crusader program, is potentially  more costly than using component or subsystem prototypes to do so during  the technology development phase. Problems that occur during required  demonstrations may cause program delays in either phase, but as noted in  the report, the delay is more expensive during the product development  phase.", "DOD stated that it partially agreed with our recommendation to conduct an  analysis to determine the importance of the deployability requirement and  said that the current requirement is not considered a key performance  parameter and, as a result, the Army is allowed to make trade-offs between  the requirement and system cost and performance. DOD further stated that  the Army plans to review the Crusader's requirements prior to the 2003  milestone B decision as required by regulations. We believe that an analysis  to determine the importance of deploying two Crusader howitzers on a C- 17 aircraft should be conducted as soon as possible to provide the Army  greater flexibility and knowledge in considering its ongoing trade-off  decisions needed to meet weight requirements.", "DOD stated that it partially agreed with our recommendation to determine  the potential capabilities and schedule of the initial version of the Future  Combat Systems before making the decision to begin Crusader product  development and stated that the Crusader\u2019s capabilities are intended to  complement rather than compete with or be redundant to the capabilities  of the Future Combat Systems. We continue to believe that DOD cannot  determine whether the two systems will be complementary or redundant  without knowledge of the initial Future Combat Systems capabilities and  fielding schedule. DOD does not have this knowledge. We continue to  believe that this knowledge needs to be considered as part of the decision  to allow the Crusader program to enter product development. We have  rewritten the recommendation to clarify its intent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the readiness of the Crusader program to enter the system  development and demonstration phase, we assessed, along with engineers from the Crusader Project Office, the current maturity of the critical  Crusader technologies using the technology readiness level tool.
