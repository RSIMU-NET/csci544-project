In assessing how these classes of ships are sustained, GAO found 150 examples of class-wide problems, such as unreliable ship systems. These problems stemmed from shipbuilding programs not identifying, evaluating, or mitigating sustainment risks during the acquisition process. GAO found that it would cost the Navy $4.2 billion to correct just the 30 percent of these problems for which the Navy had data on estimated repair costs.", "GAO found that shipbuilding programs' requirements for sustainment reflect weaknesses with how Department of Defense (DOD) policy defines these requirements for ships. Sustainment requirements should influence acquisition decisions that determine the sustainability of a ship class, such as the ship's design. However, the Navy's sustainment requirements do not provide key information on how reliable and maintainable mission-critical systems should be and, therefore, cannot adequately inform acquisition decisions.", "GAO also found that shipbuilding programs did not consistently address sustainment risks in acquisition planning documents. For example, the operating and support costs included in cost estimates did not capture all sustainment risks that could affect costs or evaluate sensitivity to changing sustainment assumptions, contrary to DOD and Navy cost estimating guidance. As a result, for six shipbuilding programs whose costs GAO could assess, the Navy had underestimated sustainment costs by $130 billion, as shown below.", "The Navy has begun making some changes to its acquisition oversight process, such as developing sustainment program baselines and adding a sustainment oversight review. While positive, these changes focus on considering sustainment after key decisions are made early in the acquisition process.

For  instance, we have previously found that in the seven-year period from  2012-2018, the Navy experienced over 27,000 days of unexpected  maintenance delays across all of its ship classes\u2014delays that increase  sustainment costs and degrade readiness. Recent events\u2014such as ship  collisions, submarines waiting idly for maintenance, and long delays in  deploying newly constructed Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)\u2014have led  members of Congress, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Navy  to re-examine how the Navy buys and sustains its ships.", "We have reported extensively on challenges with the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding  efforts and how it operates and maintains its new ships. For example, in  June 2018, we reported that the Navy consistently underestimated the  time and resources required to deliver its ships with their planned  capability, resulting in higher than expected costs, late delivery, and  defects. In 2013, we reported that the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO)  regularly accepted delivery of ships with a significant number of defects;  and, in 2017, we found that these defects were often not corrected by the  time ships were provided to the fleet. We have also reported on the  Navy\u2019s challenges sustaining its ships. Specifically, in May 2017, we  reported that the Navy\u2019s initiative to reduce the number of sailors onboard  its ships to achieve cost savings resulted in maintenance backlogs and  increased operating and support (O&S) costs.

However, the  acquisition phase of a ship\u2019s life cycle only accounts for approximately 30  percent of a ship program\u2019s total life-cycle cost. Notionally, the remaining  70 percent of the life-cycle cost of a ship program is incurred after the  Navy delivers new ships to the fleet during the phase known as O&S.  DOD guidance states that these long-term sustainment costs are  determined in large part by decisions made early in the acquisition  process. Approximately 80 percent of a program\u2019s O&S costs fixed at the  time the shipbuilding program\u2019s requirements are set and the ship is  designed. Additionally, we have found that once these decisions are  made, it can be very difficult and costly to make changes if sustainment  improvements are needed.", "According to DOD, operational support is a function of several related  factors\u2014reliability, availability, maintainability, and cost\u2014that are  determined in large part by decisions made before the start of  construction.", "Reliability is the probability that an item, such as a system, can  perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified  period of time.", "Availability is a measure of the degree to which an item is in an  operable state and can be called upon to work at the start of a mission  and at an unknown (random) point in time. In other words, the degree  to which a system is operable and available for mission tasking when  needed.", "Maintainability is the ability of an item, such as a system, to be  retained in or restored to a specified condition when maintenance is  performed by skilled personnel using prescribed procedures and  resources, at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair.", "Cost refers to the O&S costs associated with sustaining the ship.", "When planning for and executing ship sustainment, DOD guidance states  that the program manager\u2019s goal is generally to find a solution that  maximizes reliability, availability, and maintainability within cost  constraints. As the Navy acquires its ships, it makes a series of decisions  that have implications for how a ship class can be affordably sustained,  including decisions about engineering, ship design, equipment selection,  and planned maintenance approaches. As such, DOD guidance advises  acquisition programs, including Navy shipbuilding programs, to plan for  and design reliability, availability, and maintainability into the weapon  system early in the acquisition effort. For the purposes of this review, we  define early in the acquisition process as the time period between the  beginning of the program and the start of construction on the lead ship.  Giving attention to these sustainment issues early in the acquisition  process is intended to help programs ensure that their ships will be  sustainable and affordable over their entire life cycle. Conversely, if  reliability, availability, and maintainability are not adequately designed into  the ship, there is a risk the ship will cost more to own and operate than  expected and will not be available for use when needed by the fleet.", "Since Navy ships are comprised of numerous systems that need to work  together, planning for sustainment and designing reliability, availability,  and maintainability into a ship is a complicated task. Most Navy ships can  accomplish several different missions, and accomplishing these missions  usually requires a set of mechanical, electrical, combat, information  technology, and other systems to work together. Each of these systems  individually needs to be reliable, available, and maintainable in order for  the ship as a whole to be sustainable. As such, addressing sustainment  during the acquisition process is an effort that requires coordination and  input from a variety of officials associated with the program, including the  program manager, requirements officials, ship design managers,  engineers, PSMs, and others."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and Navy Policies for Acquisition Programs", "paragraphs": ["DOD acquires new weapons, including ships, for its warfighters through a  process described in two key acquisition policies: Department of Defense  Directive 5000.01, which establishes the overarching framework for the  Defense Acquisition System, and Department of Defense Instruction  5000.02, which implements the Defense Acquisition System. These  policies provide management principles and detailed procedures,  respectively, for the execution and management of defense acquisition  programs. Specifically, these policies establish the phases of the  acquisition process, key milestone decision points, required acquisition  documentation, and roles and responsibilities for acquisition officials,  among other things. Under this framework, shipbuilding programs move  through several acquisition phases, including requirements setting,  material solution analysis, technology development, ship design, ship  construction, deployment, and sustainment. In order to proceed through  the acquisition process, shipbuilding programs must be reviewed  periodically at key decision points, called milestones, at which a Milestone  Decision Authority assesses the program\u2019s progress in achieving its  goals. These milestones typically coincide with significant increases in the  resources devoted to the program. To ensure senior leadership is well- informed at these decision points, shipbuilding programs are generally  required to create or update key acquisition documents for milestone  reviews that contain information on the program\u2019s requirements, costs,  and schedule, among other things.", "The Navy has also established its own acquisition policy and processes  to supplement the DOD-wide acquisition policies and to oversee  acquisitions managed internally to the Navy. The Navy\u2019s acquisition  policy, Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5000.2, provides instructions for  implementing the Defense Acquisition System within the Navy, as well as  additional Navy-specific acquisition procedures. In particular, Navy  acquisition policy establishes a series of seven Navy decision points  throughout the acquisition process, called Gate reviews, which  complement the DOD milestones. These Gate reviews are split into two  phases that the Navy calls passes: the first is led by the CNO and  focuses on requirements setting and the second is led by the Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN (RD&A)) and focuses on acquisition. As programs move through the  acquisition process, Navy leadership\u2014comprised of officials from the  acquisition, requirements, resources, and warfighting communities\u2014 convenes Gate reviews to conduct oversight and ensure programs are on  track to achieve their acquisition and sustainment goals. Each Gate  review has a different objective and list of topics that need to be included  in the Gate briefing.

For  most shipbuilding programs, the ASN (RD&A) also serves as the decision  authority to approve the advancement of these programs through the  acquisition process at the appropriate milestones. Further, the policy  enclosures delineate various elements of acquisition programs, such as  systems engineering, testing, and sustainment planning.", "DOD and Navy acquisition policies both include requirements for  shipbuilding programs to consider sustainment throughout the acquisition  process. For instance, prior to Milestone A, DOD policy states that  sustainment planning and considerations should inform the development  of program requirements and early ship design decisions. As programs  move into the design and construction phases, programs are to develop a  comprehensive product support package and evaluate it through  engineering reviews and other tests to ensure it is sufficient to meet  sustainment requirements and affordability targets.

In part to  accommodate this extra effort, the Navy has experienced maintenance  delays and has had to defer planned maintenance for ships in operations  that the fleet determined was not as urgent as other maintenance needs.

The  effects of more onerous day-to-day maintenance costs are hard to  quantify using available Navy data. For example, the Navy used a brand  new toilet and sewage system on the CVN 77 and 78, similar to what is  on a commercial aircraft, but increased in scale for a crew of over 4,000  people. To address unexpected and frequent clogging of the system, the  Navy has determined that it needs to acid flush the CVN 77 and 78\u2019s  sewage system on a regular basis, which is an unplanned maintenance  action for the entire service life of the ship.

We compared  programs\u2019 initial life-cycle cost estimates for the six shipbuilding programs  in our scope that had available estimates to current cost estimates that  were updated after programs delivered ships to the fleet.

O&S cost  estimates for four of the six shipbuilding programs we reviewed were  based on a Navy-wide effort that began in the early 2000s to reduce crew  sizes on Navy ships and lower O&S costs by, among other things,  replacing some sailors with automated systems. We found that cost  estimators used the shipbuilding program offices\u2019 unverified assumptions  regarding crew size to develop the initial O&S estimate for four of these  six programs. Over time, the Navy found that the automated systems  were not as reliable as planned and, therefore, reduced crewing levels  were not realistic. To address this and other issues, the Navy added  sailors back on to ships\u2014resulting in increases in O&S cost estimates.  For example, cost estimators for the CVN 78 class initially estimated a 15  to 23 percent decrease in crewing levels compared to the previous class  of carriers in order to create O&S savings. However, the Navy is now in  the process of adding crew back on to the ship, even before its initial  deployment, thereby contributing to increased O&S cost estimates, as  shown in Table 4.", "Similarly, DDG 1000, LCS, and LPD 17 program officials also reported  that increasing crew sizes was a major contributor to higher sustainment  costs for these programs.", "Further, the shipbuilding programs we reviewed made assumptions  based on unproven initiatives, in conjunction with reducing crew sizes that  ended up having a greater effect on the cost of maintaining ships than  initially estimated. For example, for four ship classes\u2014SSN 774, DDG  1000, LPD 17 Flight I, and LCS\u2014the Navy originally planned to use a  maintenance initiative called performance-based logistics, which called  for the use of contractors to conduct maintenance instead of sailors on  board the ships. In 2001, DOD policy recommended that all weapon  systems use performance-based logistics and Navy shipbuilding  programs subsequently anticipated that this strategy would reduce  maintenance costs. Based on our review of shipbuilding program cost  estimates, we found that Navy cost estimators included cost savings from  these new and unproven approaches\u2014assuming that they would work as  expected. Shipbuilding program officials stated that the Navy has now  largely abandoned this approach after attempting to contract for  performance-based logistics and discovering that it was much more costly  than planned.", "Another initiative that began in the early 2000s involved the Navy using  more shipbuilder-provided commercially-bought systems on ships rather  than systems the Navy developed and provided to the ship. However,  maintaining commercial systems has been more expensive than  anticipated for a variety of reasons, such as systems becoming obsolete  and challenges acquiring manufacturer support. For example, the SSN  774 shipbuilding program made an effort to use commercial equipment  that it assumed would never need repair or replacement\u2014meaning that  these parts would last the life of the submarine\u2014without evaluating  whether these parts actually had no repair needs. Further, SSN 774  program officials told us that the program office did not plan for the Navy  to support many of the submarine\u2019s commercial components because  they initially planned to contract for logistics support. In all, the SSN 774  program asserted that over 4,000 parts on the submarine class would not  need maintenance for the duration of the submarine\u2019s life. However, since  the submarines have been operating, many of these parts are failing,  which has created unanticipated expenses.

However, for the six  cost estimates that we reviewed, the Navy did not conduct risk and  sensitivity analysis on key sustainment assumptions, such as unproven  crewing and maintenance assumptions. The Navy\u2019s cost estimators told  us that they typically only conduct sensitivity analysis on the acquisition  portion of a life-cycle cost estimate and not the O&S portion of the  estimate. Instead, cost estimators told us that they use shipbuilding  program office assumptions about the crew and how the ship class will  operate as defined requirements that will not change. However, as  discussed throughout this report, we found numerous instances in which  incorrect maintenance assumptions resulted in billions of dollars of O&S  cost growth.", "As a result, Navy\u2019s cost estimators had reduced estimated O&S costs to  reflect the programs\u2019 presumed sustainment efficiencies without  accounting for and quantifying the corresponding risk inherent in these  assumptions. As such, in several cases, shipbuilding programs had  optimistic estimates of O&S cost that later grew when unproven  assumptions did not pan out as anticipated. According to shipbuilding  program officials, their programs experienced significant O&S cost growth  because the initial cost estimate did not sufficiently account for the risk of  major changes to the program, such as revisions to the shipbuilding  program\u2019s assumptions about sustainment, that were realized once ships  were provided to the fleet. For example, on the shipbuilding programs that  adopted reduced crewing initiatives, Navy cost estimators reduced O&S  costs due to fewer planned sailors on board, but did not determine how  the O&S costs would be affected if automation did not achieve its  intended efficiencies and the Navy had to add additional sailors to the  crew. If the Navy\u2019s cost estimators had conducted risk and sensitivity analyses of the O&S costs early in the acquisition process, shipbuilding  programs could have had better insight into how much their O&S costs  might increase if the key sustainment assumptions were not correct. Such  insight into the potential sustainment cost impact could help shipbuilding  programs identify the assumptions most likely to drive O&S cost growth.  In turn, this information could help shipbuilding programs justify allocating  additional resources during the acquisition process to ensure these  sustainment assumptions are achieved, such as investing in additional  testing to ensure the reliability of automated systems needed to reduce  crewing levels.", "See figure 10 for an example of how unproven assumptions that were not  evaluated using risk and sensitivity analyses led to optimistic O&S cost  estimates for the DDG 1000 program.", "Navy officials told us that they are considering several pilot programs to  improve cost estimators\u2019 ability to conduct sensitivity analyses of  maintenance costs, but have yet to provide details on these programs or  the time frame for implementing them.

The LCSPs we reviewed that included an intellectual  property strategy, as required by DOD acquisition policy during the  operations and support phase, did not consistently address the full  spectrum of potential intellectual property related issues, such as  attaining intellectual property needed to repair and replace ship systems.  According to DOD\u2019s acquisition policy, shipbuilding programs should  document the intellectual property strategy initially in the acquisition  strategy and later in the LCSP to assess technical data needs and  determine what intellectual property deliverables and license rights the  program needs to acquire from contractors.

Without ship programs fully planning for acquiring needed  intellectual property to maintain ship systems in the LCSP, we found that  the fleet was often not aware that certain ship systems were considered  proprietary and only discovered what intellectual property was unavailable  after ship systems were broken and Navy maintainers could not repair  them. At this point, fleet maintainers stated that it is often too late to  implement proactive strategies, such as working on an agreement with  the manufacturer.

In 2012, the Navy ILA team  rated this area as low risk, specifically noting that the LCS program  had developed a wide-range of well-written, informative, and  comprehensive logistics planning documents. However, in part, since  the ILA team did not recognize that the underlying issues previously  identified by the testers had not been mitigated, the program provided  ships to the fleet that had logistics issues. Specifically, the CNO  conducted a study in 2016 that found the shipbuilding program\u2019s  logistics approach to be unstable and overly complex.

According to Navy acquisition policy,  this sustainment information should have been evaluated during all 22 of  the Gate reviews held between fiscal year 2014 and 2018 for the  shipbuilding programs included in our review.", "Instead, we found that the Gate reviews most often discussed acquisition  updates. While a focus on acquisition updates during Gate reviews is  appropriate, by infrequently devoting attention to how acquisition  decisions affect sustainment, Navy leadership is missing an opportunity to  assess the comprehensiveness and validity of shipbuilding programs\u2019  sustainment plans and cost estimates, among other sustainment factors.  As we previously discussed, shipbuilding programs\u2019 LCSPs and O&S cost  estimates were incomplete or insufficient, and, therefore, did not provide  a thorough assessment of the programs\u2019 sustainment risks. Additionally,  Navy leadership is not consistently using Gate reviews to communicate to  shipbuilding programs that achieving sustainment goals is a high priority.", "For pre-construction Gate reviews (Gates 1-5), Navy leadership  evaluated three of the programs included in our report\u2014SSBN 826,  FFG(X), and DDG 51\u2014in the 5-year period between fiscal year 2014 and  2018. These Gate review briefings included some discussion of program  sustainment but did not meet all of the objectives and goals described by  Navy acquisition policy for sustainment briefing content, as presented in  table 5. As such, the Gate reviews did not provide a complete  assessment of whether the programs\u2019 acquisition decisions about  sustainment would support the delivery of ships that could meet  sustainment requirements at an affordable cost. Officials from the majority  of programs included in our review told us that these early phases of the  program are critical because it is at this point in the program where  decisions are made that can have a long-term effect on ship sustainment,  and it is difficult to make significant changes to sustainment outcomes  after these key decisions are made.", "For example, when Navy leadership reviewed the SSBN 826 program at  a Gate 4 review in November 2015 and a Gate 5 review in September  2016, the briefing discussed the SSBN 826 program\u2019s sustainment costs  in detail, including O&S cost goals, cost drivers, and contract incentives  for O&S affordability. However, among other things, the Gate 4 briefing  did not include a review of the program\u2019s life-cycle sustainment strategy,  and the Gate 5 briefing did not verify that all critical technical data and  intellectual property issues had been addressed, which fleet and  engineering officials stated are known sustainment issues for the Virginia  class of submarines. Officials from the SSBN 826 program stated that  some sustainment information that was not discussed in the Gate reviews  was addressed in other forums. For example, leadership approved the  program\u2019s LCSP in August 2016, between the Gate 4 and Gate 5  reviews. In another example, when Navy leadership reviewed Flight III of  the DDG 51 program at a combined Gates 4 and 5 review in March 2014,  none of the required sustainment topics were included in the briefing.", "By not thoroughly assessing and resolving the sustainment effect of early  acquisition decisions during its Gate reviews, Navy leadership is missing  opportunities to ensure that shipbuilding programs are adequately  considering sustainment goals and is at risk of allowing programs to  proceed through the acquisition process without verifying that there is  adequate planning for sustainment.", "For Gate 6 reviews held between fiscal year 2014 and 2018, we similarly  found that Navy leadership did not consistently discuss sustainment, even  as programs began ship construction and delivering ships to the fleet.  Our analysis of Gate 6 documentation showed that the primary focus of  most Gate 6 briefings and meeting minutes was acquisition outcomes,  such as construction progress or follow-on ship contract awards. In  particular, we found that 16 of the 18 Gate 6 reviews we assessed for  eight shipbuilding programs did not include information about both the  program\u2019s life-cycle sustainment plan and O&S cost drivers, which are  part of the required briefing content for every Gate 6 review. Officials from  most of the programs in our review confirmed that leadership placed  greater emphasis on acquisition updates than sustainment during Gate 6  reviews. For example, the SSN 774 program is pursuing a reduction in  total ownership costs initiative for its Block IV submarines, but the  program\u2019s recent Gate 6 briefings included only limited details on design  changes that the program was pursuing to improve sustainment and no  information on the anticipated O&S cost savings from the effort. Officials  from this program confirmed that leadership has historically focused only  on acquisition issues during the Gate 6 reviews. Additionally, we found  that Navy leadership issued sustainment-related action items to only  three of the eight programs in the Gate 6 reviews we assessed, even  though all of these programs had ongoing sustainment challenges, as  discussed earlier in this report.", "Although nearly 90 percent of the Gate 6 reviews we assessed did not  include briefing content on the program\u2019s life-cycle sustainment plan and  O&S costs, as required, nearly all of the Gate 6 reviews included a  discussion of at least one ongoing sustainment challenge affecting the  ship class. In these cases, the discussion centered on mitigating realized  sustainment issues already being experienced by the fleet after ship  delivery. For example, all of the LPD 17 Gate 6 reviews over the past 5  years included updates on the activities of the LPD 17 Strike Team and  its progress in resolving class-wide design and construction issues that  negatively affected the ships\u2019 operational availability and reliability after  they began fleet operations. While Gate 6 can be used as a venue to  discuss sustainment issues that are already being experienced by the  fleet, until Navy leadership more consistently reviews programs\u2019  sustainment planning and expected outcomes during earlier Gates,  programs will continue to be at risk of delivering ships to the fleet that  have unmitigated sustainment risks or are unaffordable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Gate Process Changes Enhance Sustainment Focus, but Do Not Address the Need to Consider Sustainment Issues Earlier in the Acquisition Process", "paragraphs": ["The Navy recently updated its acquisition policy to expand the scope of  its Gate process and add a new Gate 7 for sustainment. Effective March  2019, the Gate 7 reviews will begin 5 years after shipbuilding programs  achieve initial operational capability and recur every 5 years thereafter.  As such, Navy officials told us that the scope of the Gate 7 review will be  oversight of programs that are well into production and delivering ships to  the fleet. According to the Navy\u2019s acquisition policy, Gate 7 will evaluate  the effectiveness of a program\u2019s product support strategy, compare actual  sustainment costs to estimates, discuss fleet-identified sustainment  issues, and assess sustainment risks and mitigation measures, among  other things.", "Senior officials told us that the Navy developed a Gate 7 for sustainment  for two reasons. First, similar to our findings, officials stated that the Navy  recognized sustainment was generally not being discussed during  existing Gate reviews, particularly during Gate 6 reviews as ships were  starting to be delivered to the fleet, even though this was required briefing  content for Gate 6 in the Navy\u2019s acquisition policy. Second, in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Congress  directed the military services to conduct sustainment reviews on major  weapons systems\u2014such as the shipbuilding programs included in our  review\u2014within 5 years of the weapon system achieving initial operational  capability and then periodically throughout their life cycles. Such  sustainment reviews are to assess the weapon system\u2019s product support  strategy, performance, and O&S costs. Based on our analysis of the  Navy\u2019s revised acquisition policy, the new Gate 7 appears responsive to  the Congressional requirement for sustainment reviews and, if  implemented as planned, will provide an oversight forum for addressing  realized sustainment challenges.", "However, we found that adding a new Gate to the end of the acquisition  process is too late to drive meaningful improvements to sustainment  outcomes and is not sufficient to address current shortfalls in how the  Navy\u2019s acquisition process addresses sustainment concerns. Senior Navy  officials we spoke to who had knowledge of this change expressed doubt  that a Gate 7 for sustainment would be an effective means of holding  programs accountable for addressing acquisition-related sustainment  issues, since it occurs late in the acquisition process. Whereas the Gate 7  for sustainment will occur at the end of the acquisition process, the  decisions that influence sustainment outcomes, such as decisions about  ship design and the planned sustainment strategy, are made much earlier  in the process, normally between Gates 1 and 5. Thus, while Gate 7 will  provide leadership with insight into the execution of ship sustainment and  any challenges being experienced by the fleet, it does not address the  need for Navy leadership to evaluate shipbuilding programs\u2019 efforts to  design and plan for sustainable ships during earlier Gates, when key  long-term decisions are being made. According to a senior Naval Sea  Systems Command official, Gate 7 is timed well for being able to \u201csit back  and admire the problem\u201d as opposed to preventing the issue. Until Navy  leadership brings attention to sustainment during earlier Gate reviews, it  will continue to miss opportunities to proactively ensure shipbuilding  programs are acquiring sustainable ships before they are provided to the  fleet."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Acquisition Program Baselines Currently Include Few Sustainment Goals and Ongoing Improvements Lack an Accountability Mechanism", "paragraphs": ["We found that acquisition program baselines (APB)\u2014which are intended  to be binding agreements between leadership and the program manager  and document the program\u2019s goals\u2014currently include limited information  about sustainment. While the Navy is developing a new initiative to create  a dedicated baseline for sustainment, it does not have a mechanism for  holding shipbuilding programs accountable for sustainment goals during  the acquisition process. Like all major weapon systems, shipbuilding  programs have APBs that summarize the programs\u2019 cost, schedule, and  performance goals and set the baseline from which programs must, as  appropriate, obtain approval from agency leadership to deviate and must  report certain changes to Congressional defense committees.", "Statute requires that baselines will contain information on the program\u2019s  cost estimate, schedule, performance, and supportability, among other  factors. In practice, for shipbuilding programs in our review, we found  that the program goals established in the APB are largely focused on  acquisition cost, acquisition schedule, and performance requirements,  with limited information provided on sustainment. In particular, the  sustainment information provided is generally limited to a high-level O&S  cost estimate and the sustainment key performance parameters, if the  program has them.", "A Congressionally established panel, called the Section 809 panel,  charged with making recommendations to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of DOD\u2019s acquisition process, among other things, recently  studied challenges with the sustainment of major weapon systems. It  similarly found that the APB does not provide sufficient governance of the  sustainment phase of an acquisition program since it is focused on  acquisition cost, schedule, and performance goals. The panel further  noted that program success has been measured against the achievement  of the APB\u2019s acquisition goals, so program managers have generally  prioritized the achievement of acquisition outcomes and deemphasized  sustainment. As a result, the panel recommended the creation of an  additional program baseline, called the sustainment program baseline  (SPB), to help ensure programs are held accountable for sustainment- related outcomes and establish balance between acquisition and  sustainment priorities. In March 2019, the Navy initiated an effort to begin  developing an SPB framework. Senior officials stated that the Navy  intends to pilot the SPB with a few aviation programs in fiscal year 2020  before expanding the initiative to ship classes that are already in  sustainment, and then finally to programs that are still in the acquisition  process.", "According to Navy officials involved with this initiative, the SPB is  intended to complement the APB, and Navy leadership will use the two  program baselines to review and approve the acquisition and sustainment  aspects of a program throughout the acquisition process. The  shipbuilding program should draft the initial SPB early in the acquisition  process to support Milestone A and update it as the program matures.  Officials in the office of the ASN (RD&A) told us that the Navy plans for  the SPB to be grounded in a program\u2019s sustainment key performance  parameters for operational and materiel availability and include targets for  various other sustainment metrics, such as sparing, equipment failure  rates, mission capable time, and logistics time, among others. The SPB  should also provide detailed information about all of the costs and funding  sources that will support sustainment. Navy officials identified a number  of potential improvements the SPB could offer for how shipbuilding  programs consider sustainment, such as devoting additional time and  resources to the development of sustainment metrics early in a  shipbuilding program, assessing the sustainment effect of acquisition  decisions, creating a common understanding of a program\u2019s sustainment  goals across disparate stakeholders, and providing a more accurate  accounting of sustainment funding. If the Navy implements the SPB as  described, it will likely be a positive step toward ensuring shipbuilding  programs are increasing their focus on sustainment planning during the  acquisition process.", "While the SPB could potentially provide increased attention on program  sustainment, we found that developing this new baseline may not fully  address the underlying challenge of shipbuilding programs managing to  the APB\u2019s acquisition goals and the lack of consideration of sustainment  in acquisition decision-making. This is because, according to current  proposals, programs will continue to be measured against the APB during  the acquisition process, with the SPB not serving as the governing  baseline until later in the program life cycle during the sustainment phase.  Instead, during the acquisition process, the Navy\u2019s efforts related to the  SPB will be limited to initially developing the SPB and updating it as the  program matures. While updates to the SPB during the acquisition  process could provide more transparency into the sustainment effect of  various acquisition decisions within the program and to leadership, this  approach primarily documents the sustainment effect of a decision.  Because the APB will remain the governing baseline during the  acquisition process and the program will not be measured against the  SPB until the sustainment phase, shipbuilding programs will continue to  have an incentive to prioritize acquisition outcomes over sustainment  when making acquisition decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Does Not Have Insight into Shipbuilding Programs\u2019 O&S Cost Growth during the Acquisition Process", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not provide Congress with detailed information on the extent  and causes of shipbuilding programs\u2019 O&S cost growth during the  acquisition process. For example, a mechanism for Congressional  oversight of major defense acquisition programs\u2019 unit cost growth, called  the Nunn-McCurdy statute, is focused on acquisition costs and not  sustainment cost estimates. A Nunn-McCurdy breach is triggered by  increases in a program\u2019s unit cost estimates against the acquisition unit  cost goals established in the program\u2019s APB. The Nunn-McCurdy statute  provides Congress greater visibility into major defense acquisition  programs\u2019 estimated acquisition cost growth and encourages DOD to  manage costs by requiring programs in a breach to include acquisition  cost estimates in Selected Acquisition Reports and notify Congress of a  breach. While the APB also includes O&S cost estimates, the Nunn- McCurdy statute does not require reporting of O&S cost growth to  Congress.", "The Nunn-McCurdy statute also requires DOD to take a series of actions  whenever a program experiences critical acquisition cost growth, which is  growth in the program acquisition unit cost estimate of at least 25 percent  over the current baseline estimate documented in the APB or of at least  50 percent over the initial baseline estimate. Among other things, these  actions include (1) conducting a root cause analysis of the cost growth,  (2) reassessing program costs, and (3) terminating the program or taking  other steps that include restructuring the program. If DOD decides not to  terminate a program that has critical cost growth, the Secretary of  Defense must restructure the program in a manner that addresses the  root cause of the cost growth, rescind the program\u2019s most recent  Milestone decision, and review the program regularly, among other tasks.", "As stated earlier, we found that leadership oversight during Gate reviews  and program execution is primarily focused on acquisition outcomes.  Additionally, as the Section 809 panel noted, the Nunn-McCurdy breach  provided a strong incentive for major defense acquisition programs to  control acquisition cost, but that there was not an equivalent incentive for  controlling sustainment costs. As such, the shipbuilding programs\u2019  acquisition decisions and Congress\u2019 oversight mechanisms have focused  on acquisition cost outcomes, without a comparable focus on sustainment  cost outcomes during the acquisition process. For example, when the  DDG 1000 program experienced a critical acquisition cost growth breach,  the Nunn-McCurdy statute required DOD to reassess and certify to  Congress the need for the program at the increased cost levels. DOD  was also required to identify and address the cause of the acquisition cost  growth when reassessing the program and conduct additional program  oversight, among other things. According to DDG 1000 program officials,  DOD and the Navy recognized that the acquisition decisions leading up to  and following the breach would have a sustainment effect. For example,  the decision to reduce the number of ships in the class to manage  acquisition cost growth has contributed to higher per ship O&S costs, as  the investment needed to sustain this new class is now spread across  fewer ships than initially planned. However, the focus of their restructuring  efforts was on addressing the acquisition cost growth. By contrast, there  was not a similar effort to manage growth in the program\u2019s O&S cost  estimates, which have increased by more than 50 percent on a per ship  per year basis.", "For the six shipbuilding programs with O&S cost estimates we were able  to assess, we found that four experienced cost growth greater than 50  percent for their average annual O&S per hull cost, as compared to the  programs\u2019 original estimates. Table 6 shows the extent of these  shipbuilding programs\u2019 O&S cost estimate growth over time. This level of  cost growth for acquisition costs would have constituted a Nunn-McCurdy  breach.", "While the Selected Acquisition Reports for these programs include some  information on shipbuilding programs\u2019 O&S costs, this reporting does not  provide Congress with detailed information about the causes of the cost  growth and potential program changes to address it and, therefore, does  not facilitate the same level of oversight as is given to acquisition unit cost  growth. In particular, DOD was not required to notify Congress that the  programs had experienced high levels of O&S cost growth above a  certain threshold, and DOD was not required to identify the root cause of  the O&S cost growth and restructure the programs to address the cost  growth. As a case in point, for the programs we reviewed, Navy  leadership only directed one of the programs\u2014LPD 17\u2014to identify  opportunities to reduce O&S costs following a Gate 6 review. For other  programs that had extensive O&S cost growth, the programs were not  required to take additional steps during the shipbuilding process to  manage these costs and mitigate the long-term sustainment effect of their  acquisition decisions. The LCS program, for example, has seen the  highest rate of per ship O&S cost growth among the shipbuilding  programs included in our O&S cost analysis, but Congress and agency  leadership have not required the shipbuilding program to take action to  address these issues. Instead, the shipbuilding program continues to  deliver ships to the fleet that are significantly more expensive to maintain  than initially planned and which have significant maintenance and  logistics challenges, according to sustainment officials. The fleet is now  undertaking its own efforts to improve sustainment outcomes for LCS,  such as changing its crewing and maintenance approaches, which are  further adding to the O&S cost growth for the program.", "According to DOD and Navy acquisition policy, program managers should  be the single point of accountability for the full life cycle of ship programs.  However, without a mechanism to provide Congress with more detailed  information about shipbuilding programs\u2019 O&S cost growth and the drivers  of such cost growth, Congress cannot know if shipbuilding programs are  accounting for the full life-cycle implications of their acquisition decisions.  In particular, without such a mechanism, Congress will continue to lack  full insight into the extent to which shipbuilding programs\u2019 O&S cost  estimates have grown over time and what steps DOD and the Navy could  take to better control O&S cost growth during the acquisition process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Product Support Managers Have Limited Influence in the Acquisition Process", "paragraphs": ["Congress directed DOD to establish PSMs as key sustainment managers  for weapons systems, such as shipbuilding programs. However, we found  that PSMs in the shipbuilding program offices have limited influence on  decisions made during the acquisition process that affect ship  sustainment.

According to  DOD guidance, PSMs are senior sustainment officials in program offices  who are tasked with ensuring that DOD weapon systems, including Navy  ships, are reliable and can be maintained effectively at an affordable cost.  The guidance states that PSMs should be involved in the acquisition  decision-making process to ensure the weapon system\u2014in this case a  ship\u2014can be supported throughout its life cycle.

However, a March 2019 update to the Navy\u2019s acquisition policy  established that Navy leadership should assign PSMs by initiation  (normally Milestone B). We found that this timing is too late in the  acquisition process, as critical acquisition decisions that have significant  repercussions for sustainment are made before Milestone B, such as  developing the program\u2019s requirements and initial sustainment strategy.  For example, according to DOD\u2019s PSM guidance, PSMs need to be  involved prior to initiation of the program. Among other things, the PSM  should provide a sustainment perspective into key decisions such as  developing the acquisition strategy and setting requirements. This  guidance also states that the PSM is responsible for authoring or  providing input on key program documents, such as the LCSP, which are  required by Milestone A. The Navy policy, therefore, does not facilitate  the early contributions of PSMs to key documents as described by DOD  guidance, and it does not help ensure PSMs are appointed to shipbuilding  program offices early enough to influence key decisions about the  program\u2019s sustainment.", "For its two most recent shipbuilding programs, which began after the  enactment of the PSM legislation in 2009, Navy acquisition policy has not  ensured that PSMs are involved early enough in the acquisition process  to influence decisions that affect sustainment. As a result, the programs  have appointed PSMs at different points in the acquisition process and  their ability to influence key decisions has varied, with the PSM appointed  earlier able to affect more decisions related to sustainment. For example,  the SSBN 826 program\u2019s PSM was appointed before the program  reached Milestone A. This is in line with DOD guidance but before Navy  acquisition policy requires the PSM to be appointed. As a result, the  SSBN 826 PSM stated that he was involved in the setting of the  program\u2019s sustainment requirements and has subsequently used those  requirements to ensure sustainment is being considered in the acquisition  process, including during the development of the submarine\u2019s design. By  contrast, the FFG(X) program, which began in 2017, does not yet have a  dedicated PSM as the program approaches the Milestone B review. While  this is permitted by the Navy\u2019s acquisition policy, the program has now  made critical sustainment decisions, such as developing the sustainment  strategy, the maintenance and training schedule, and the sustainment key  performance parameters, without a PSM.", "For the nine shipbuilding programs in our review that started prior to  2009, key acquisition decisions were made without the input of a senior  sustainment official who has the responsibility and authority of a PSM.  Nearly all of the PSMs for these nine programs stated they that they were  not involved in or did not have insight into key acquisition decisions that  took place early in the acquisition process, such as ship design. Instead,  PSMs told us that their job has been to implement decisions that were  already made. For example, one PSM said that \u201cthe die has been cast\u201d  once major decisions about automation, crew size, and service life are  made, and after that all the PSM can do is \u201ctry to undo the sustainment  harm that has been caused.\u201d Given these results, officials from nearly all  of the shipbuilding programs we spoke with stated that shipbuilding  programs should assign PSMs at the very beginning of the program when  key decisions are being made about how and what to acquire. In  particular, program officials stated that the PSM should be appointed at  the start of the program to ensure early decisions consider sustainment.  Such decisions include establishing the sustainment requirements,  developing the acquisition strategy, and designing the ship.

As  discussed above, Navy leadership has generally only focused on  shipbuilding programs\u2019 acquisition outcomes during the Gate process,  without considering how acquisition decisions affect sustainment. In turn,  program officials from all of the shipbuilding programs we reviewed  reported that Navy leadership had directed them to prioritize the  achievement of acquisition outcomes, such as acquisition cost goals,  during the execution of their programs, and none had been directed to  devote additional attention to sustainment. Additionally, officials in many  of the shipbuilding programs we reviewed told us that a key ASN (RD&A)  memorandum on managing acquisition costs framed their decision- making, including decisions about program changes to improve  sustainment. This focus on managing acquisition costs can run counter  to PSMs\u2019 efforts to improve sustainment outcomes, such as increasing  system reliability or providing adequate technical documentation, as these  efforts frequently require investment of additional shipbuilding funds.  Rather than investing acquisition funds to improve sustainment outcomes,  we found that shipbuilding programs instead have an incentive to delay  sustainment improvements until after ships are delivered to the fleet and  funding sources other than those managed by the shipbuilding program  can be used for these purposes. According to officials from 16 different  acquisition, engineering, and sustainment offices, because shipbuilding  programs are only responsible for ships until they are provided to the  fleet, the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding programs have an incentive to delay  sustainment improvements until after ships are delivered to the fleet,  when other parts of the Navy take over responsibility for funding them. As  one fleet official explained, shipbuilding programs are not incentivized to  address sustainment issues because the shipbuilding programs are held  responsible only for the achievement of acquisition cost goals and not for  sustainment cost goals. Some Navy officials characterized this dynamic  as throwing sustainment concerns \u201cover the fence\u201d once ships are  provided to the fleet.", "Further, we found that Navy leadership made decisions, in some cases,  even though PSMs expressed concerns about the feasibility of  implementing the decision from a sustainment perspective.

DOD\u2019s written  comments are reprinted in appendix III of this report. DOD concurred with  8 recommendations and partially concurred with 3 recommendations.  However, for at least 5 of the recommendations in which DOD partially  concurred and concurred, DOD did not describe the specific actions it is  planning to take to address our recommendations. These are discussed  below.", "In response to our first and second recommendations on operational and  materiel availability requirements, DOD stated that the Navy and Joint  Staff would revisit requirements definitions for shipbuilding programs to  better ensure that they are traceable to a ship\u2019s mission and can be used  across ship development and fielding. DOD also agreed that it will align  the sustainment definitions with how the Navy defines critical failures for  ship programs. While these are important steps, they do not fully address  our recommendations. Specifically, DOD officials told us that the  department plans to continue defining operational availability with a single  metric for an entire ship or ship class. While this approach is appropriate  for materiel availability, as we state in the report, it is misaligned with  Navy guidance for operational availability, which states that such an  approach is not mathematically feasible for ships. Until DOD ensures that  its sustainment requirements for ships are well-defined and usable during  acquisition and sustainment, shipbuilding programs will continue to  implement requirements that do not result in reliable and available ships.", "In response to our third and fourth recommendations, DOD agreed to  incorporate changes to its requirements-setting policy into new  shipbuilding programs. However, DOD and the Navy may miss key  opportunities to improve the Navy\u2019s sustainment requirements for existing  programs, including at least four ship classes that have plans for a new  flight, block, and/or major modification. This approach also excludes  existing programs that have established requirements but have yet to  start design or construction. Changing these requirements, in line with our  recommendation, would help ensure that more rigorous sustainment  requirements inform Navy ship designs. For example, as we discuss in  the report, the current FFG(X) operational availability requirement would  allow the ships to be out of service for extraordinary lengths of time. Until  the FFG(X) requirement and those for other existing ships (such as DDG  51 Flight III) are remedied, the sustainment requirements will continue to  be poorly defined and unable to influence design decisions in a manner  that results in more reliable ships.", "In response to our fifth recommendation, DOD concurred with the  recommendation because it stated that it already reports the status of  both sustainment requirements in its Selected Acquisition Reports.  However, as we state in our report, implementing this recommendation is  dependent on the Navy changing the definition of its sustainment  requirements to improve the accuracy of its reporting to Congress. Since  DOD only agreed to modify material availability requirements for existing  ship programs as it deemed appropriate, its Selected Acquisition Reports  could continue to be misleading for many of its ship programs because  they may not reflect all of the failures and factors that reduce operational  and materiel availability once ships are in the fleet.", "In addition to DOD\u2019s response, the Navy\u2019s ASN (RD&A) also submitted a  letter stating that he generally agreed with the recommendations and  indicated that his office has already started making some changes over  the last 10 years to improve consideration of sustainment while acquiring  ships. The Navy also sought to add context to some of our report findings.  We respond to the ASN RD&A\u2019s letter in appendix III. DOD and the Navy  also provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense,  Secretary of the Navy, interested congressional committees, and other  interested parties.

The scope of our  review included all shipbuilding programs for warships that had ships  under construction or in development in the last 10 years, from fiscal  years 2009 through 2019. We defined a shipbuilding program as under  construction if any ship in the class was under construction in the last 10  years. We defined a shipbuilding program as in development if the Navy  had awarded a development or design contract for the class in the last 10  years. We excluded military sealift command vessels and other Navy  vessels with logistics missions from this review to help ensure that our  resources matched the scope of our review. We assessed LHD 8 and  CVN 77 as their own classes for the purposes of our review because the  Navy considers them to be transitional designs between antecedent  classes. These parameters resulted in 11 ship classes for inclusion in our  review. We also selected several ships within these classes to serve as  case studies for additional analysis. To select these ship-specific case  studies, we reviewed all warships delivered from fiscal years 2007-2018  and selected up to four of the most recent hulls within this time frame  from each class as case studies. We selected these ships for additional  analysis because they are still relatively new, but the fleet has had  experience maintaining them and could discuss sustainment challenges  for those ships, if any. All ship classes and case study hulls in scope are  listed in table 7.", "Over the course of this audit, we interviewed officials from over 100 Navy  organizations involved in designing, building, inspecting, testing,  sustaining, and operating Navy ships to gain an understanding of the  extent to which they are involved in the acquisition process and how they  consider and manage sustainment risk during the acquisition process.  These interviews also provided information on the nature and magnitude  of sustainment issues being experienced by the fleet on recently  delivered ships. These included approximately 30 interviews with  organizations reporting to the ASN (RD&A), 31 interviews with  organizations reporting to the Chief of Naval Operations, 29 interviews  with organizations within Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA),  interviews with shipbuilders that have been awarded multiple Navy  shipbuilding contracts, and three interviews with other Department of  Defense (DOD) entities. We conducted these interviews in several  locations throughout the United States, including Washington, D.C.; San  Diego, CA; Norfolk, VA; Philadelphia, PA; and Mechanicsburg, PA.  During visits to naval bases, we toured DDG 111, DDG 1000, LHD 8,  LPD 22, LCS 3, LCS 4, CVN 77, and CVN 78.", "To identify the extent to which ships can be sustained as planned, we  interviewed shipbuilding program officials, in-service program officials,  engineers, and fleet organizations, as well as analyzed ship and system  performance data from many Navy organizations. Through this  assessment, we identified and analyzed 150 significant class-wide issues  across the shipbuilding programs in our scope that required more  sustainment resources than planned. Such issues include systems or  parts that exhibited poor design, construction, reliability, or planning;  systems that were obsolete before or soon after ship delivery; and  systems that could not be maintained by the fleet due to vendor or  manufacturer proprietary information. We counted only issues that were  class-wide, meaning they were related to ship design, equipment used  across the class, or construction procedures, rather than hull-specific  issues that could be caused by a unique accident or sailor error. We also  did not assess issues related to fleet preference. For example, one ship\u2019s  crew told us they did not prefer the location in which consoles for  operating a certain system were installed, as they are typically installed in  a different location on other ship classes. However, because the consoles  were installed in the location specified in the design, we eliminated this  issue from our analysis. We also eliminated issues if maintenance and  other work on the affected system were accounted for during the  acquisition process in the program\u2019s initial Operating and Support (O&S)  cost estimate, rather than being an unexpected expense. For example,  program offices can address expected obsolescence by budgeting for  future system modernizations or purchasing quantities of spare parts that  will last for the ship\u2019s entire life cycle.", "To identify the costs associated with fixing problems that are the result of  not being able to sustain ships as planned, we reviewed documentation  from Navy organizations, budget justifications, and estimates provided by  Navy officials. We were able to collect cost information for 30 percent of  the problems reported to us by the fleet. To assess the extent to which  maintenance schedules are executed as planned, we analyzed Navy data  on regularly scheduled, depot-level maintenance periods for surface  ships\u2014including those maintained at overseas homeports and in the  United States. NAVSEA collects and manages data on these  maintenance periods\u2014known as Chief of Naval Operations maintenance  availabilities\u2014for surface ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers. We  obtained the data on surface ship depot-level maintenance periods used  by NAVSEA\u2019s Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program and  the Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Center. We reviewed the  data we obtained for inconsistency errors and, when possible, obtained  multiple documents that discussed the same problem for validation. We  then discussed these problems with multiple officials across the Navy,  including officials involved in ship maintenance and operation. From these  efforts, we determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To assess the extent to which shipbuilding programs develop and use  effective sustainment requirements during the acquisition process, we  reviewed DOD requirements setting policy and determined the extent to  which shipbuilding programs set requirements in accordance with this  policy. In doing so, we assessed the extent to which DOD policy aligned  with fleet experience and captured all factors that influence ship  availability and analyzed any discrepancies. We then assessed the extent  to which the Navy set sustainment requirements that contributed to well- informed decision-making throughout the acquisition process and in  accordance with DOD policy and Navy guidance. To assess how  accurately the Navy measures operational availability and materiel  availability outcomes, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s operational availability  measurements as reported in Selected Acquisition Reports to Congress,  and compared these values to fleet reliability data and casualty reports,  as well as information about the ships\u2019 performance obtained in interviews  with Chief of Naval Operations and NAVSEA officials.", "To assess the extent to which shipbuilding programs effectively identify  and evaluate sustainment costs and risks in key acquisition planning  documents, we evaluated the Navy\u2019s development and use of life-cycle  cost estimates, Life-Cycle Sustainment Plans and Independent Logistics  Assessments. To evaluate the Navy\u2019s development of O&S cost  estimates, we reviewed the life-cycle cost estimates created when  programs were in development and compared them to updated estimates  of O&S costs reported in Selected Acquisitions Reports and Navy  provided data. We adjusted program estimates for quantity to more  accurately capture cost growth between initial and current O&S  estimates. Further, we adjusted the estimates for inflation to compare the  O&S estimates as accurately as possible. For programs that experienced  O&S cost growth, we interviewed program officials and Navy cost  estimators to determine the process that the Navy\u2019s cost estimators used  to build O&S cost estimates for shipbuilding programs and to discuss the  reasons for cost growth. We also reviewed DOD cost estimation guidance  to determine whether the cost estimators and programs complied with its  requirements. While we have previously found issues with the reliability of  the Navy\u2019s cost estimates, we believe that the cost estimates we  reviewed are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To  evaluate the Navy\u2019s use of key sustainment planning documents, we  reviewed LCSPs and ILAs for programs in our scope. We interviewed  program, NAVSEA, fleet, and maintenance officials to determine the  extent to which the LCSPs and ILAs for those programs were used to  plan for sustainment, including whether these documents identified and  mitigated sustainment risks. We compared the results of the ILAs to  realized ship sustainment problems that we identified through interviews  shipbuilding program officials, in-service program officials, engineers, and  fleet organizations, as well as to analyses of ship and system  performance data from many Navy organizations.", "To evaluate the extent to which Navy and Congressional leadership has  insight into and considers sustainment planning and outcomes, we  examined the Navy\u2019s Gate review process and Congress\u2019 Nunn-McCurdy  breach process. To assess the Navy\u2019s use of the Gate review process,  we reviewed Navy acquisition policy governing the reviews, as well as the  briefings and meeting minutes from reviews for programs in our scope  from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. We compared the content of the  briefings and meeting minutes to the acquisition policy to determine the  extent to which required sustainment topics were briefed and discussed  at each review and identified other mentions of sustainment issues that  were outside the scope of the policy requirements. We also reviewed a  recent revision to Navy acquisition policy that creates a Gate 7 review for  sustainment and interviewed senior Navy officials to obtain their  perspectives on how Gate 7 will affect ship sustainment. To assess Navy  leadership\u2019s effectiveness in holding shipbuilding programs\u2019 accountable  for achieving sustainment outcomes using Acquisition Program Baselines  (APB), we reviewed statute that established the APB as well as the  findings of the Section 809 Panel, which recommended the creation of the  SPB to supplement the APB. We also interviewed Navy officials involved  in developing the SPB framework in accordance with the Panel\u2019s  recommendations to obtain information on their work. To determine what  information Navy shipbuilding programs are required to provide to  Congress about sustainment cost issues during the acquisition process,  we reviewed the statutory requirements found in Nunn-McCurdy, a key  Congressional oversight tool requiring information about baselines and  cost estimate growth. We also assessed how the Nunn-McCurdy breach  influenced programs\u2019 management of acquisition and sustainment costs  by interviewing Navy officials in the shipbuilding program offices, Office of  the Chief of Naval Operations, and ASN (RD&A) offices, among others.  Additionally, we reviewed O&S cost growth for programs in our scope and  compared the percent increase to the 50 percent cost growth threshold  used for Nunn-McCurdy acquisition cost breaches to determine if the  sustainment cost growth was of a magnitude the Congress considers  critical for acquisition costs.", "To assess how shipbuilding programs leverage PSMs during the  acquisition process, we reviewed DOD and Navy acquisition guidance  governing the roles and responsibilities of program offices, program  managers, and PSMs. We interviewed officials from shipbuilding  programs in our scope about their priorities and responsibilities  throughout the life cycle of a ship class. Further, we reviewed legislation  creating the PSM role, DOD and Navy acquisition guidance regarding  PSMs, prior GAO reporting on PSMs, and interviewed PSMs from  programs in our scope. We compared the key acquisition activities that  legislation requires PSMs to participate in with the activities the PSMs  reported they had participated in. We also compared DOD and Navy   guidance on assigning PSMs to a program office to when program  officials told us the PSMs needed to be assigned to be effective. We also  reviewed findings that NAVSEA logistics officials reached about the  authority and effectiveness of PSMs.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to March 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: List of Fleet-Identified Ship Class Problems That Required More Sustainment Resources than Planned", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Response to ASN (RD&A)\u2019s Letter", "paragraphs": ["In addition to responding to our recommendations, the Assistant Secretary of the  Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN (RD&A)) provided  observations on a number of issues related to the findings in our report. In his letter,  the ASN (RD&A) agreed with our recommendations but sought to add context to our  report\u2019s conclusion that the Navy can save billions by improving its consideration of  sustainment throughout the acquisition process. Our response to the ASN (RD&A)\u2019s  letter is as follows.", "In his letter, the ASN (RD&A) highlighted a number of changes that the Navy has  instituted over the last 10 years to improve sustainment planning, including policies  pertaining to life cycle sustainment plans and independent logistics assessments,  strengthening the role of the Product Support Managers, and establishing a new  Gate 7 review focused on sustainment. We agree that the Navy\u2019s framework for  including sustainment planning in the acquisition process offers promise and we  discuss these policies and processes in depth in this report. However, we found  considerable weaknesses in the Navy\u2019s application of its own policies. Specifically,  we found that the Navy did not provid a thorough assessment of the sustainment  implications and risks in its LCSPs and ILAs and Product Support Managers aften  are not assigned until well into a shipbuilding program thereby limiting their influence  on early acquisition decisions. While adding a Gate 7 offers benefits, it is not a  substitute for discussions about sustainment concepts during earlier Gates, when  key long-term decisions are being made. Our findings and recommendations  demonstrate that DOD and the Navy should better use the policies and processes it  currently has, including the Gate reviews, as well as Product Support Managers,  LCSPs and ILAs, to improve their understanding of how their acquisition decisions  will affect sustainment.", "In his letter, the ASN (RD&A) stated that many of the Navy\u2019s ship programs were  designed with sustainment initiatives early in the acquisition process and, further,  acknowledged that these initiatives did not achieve efficiencies as initially planned.  We agree with both of these points, as we discuss in depth in this report. Whereas  the ASN (RD&A) indicated in his letter that leadership, philosophical, and technology  changes can lead to outcomes that were not originally envisioned, we found that  these initiatives largely failed because, early in the acquisition process, the Navy did  not sufficiently assess the costs or evaluate the risks associated with pursuing these  initiatives. Absent such analysis, the Navy did not mitigate the risks that threatened  their success. The ASN (RD&A) highlighted several examples of sustainment  initiatives considered early in the acquisition process for several ships. We believe  that these examples (many of which we discuss in our report) serve to further  highlight our findings. For example:", "The ASN (RD&A) discussed the use of a \u201cfull service contractor,\u201d meaning  performance-based logistics for LPD 17 class ships. According to the ASN  (RD&A), while this approach had been successfully used for aircraft, the  Navy had never applied it to ships. As we state in our report, in attempting to  use performance-based logistics for several shipbuilding programs including  LPD 17 class ships, the Navy did not consider the challenges in implementing  this radical departure from traditional ship maintenance and did not consult  the fleet on this change until after ships were delivered. The Navy\u2019s life-cycle  sustainment plans and cost estimates for several shipbuilding programs did  not articulate how much the performance-based logistics approach was likely  to cost or what sustainment outcomes the Navy expected. For instance, for  three out of the four programs that pursued performance-based logistics, the  Navy learned that this approach was cost-prohibitive once it began seeking  contractors to sustain its ships.", "The ASN (RD&A) stated that the Navy\u2019s focus on Ford class sustainment has  reduced sustainment costs and labor by an estimated $4 billion across the  Ford class carriers compared to the previous class of carriers. However, it is  too early to tell how much the Navy will save compared to the cost of its  previous class of carriers because the Navy\u2019s fleet has yet to operate the new  carrier. Further, while the O&S estimated for the Ford class may currently be  lower than the previous carrier class, our report notes that the O&S costs for  the Ford class carrier program are nearly $46 billion more than initially  estimated. Finally, in his letter, the ASN (RD&A) stated that the Navy plans to  correct the vast majority of CVN 78 sustainment problems (including those  we identified in this report) with ship construction funding\u2014and these cost will  not be passed on to the fleet. The $4.2 billion to address the 150 problems  that we identified in this report already excludes all ship construction funding  and also excludes corrections on CVN 78. Our calculation of $4.2 billion only  includes the costs to correct the problems that are not funded using ship  construction funding.", "We agree with the ASN (RD&A)\u2019s assertion that external factors can take place over  the lengthy time needed to design and build a new ship that can lead to changes that  were not initially envisioned. While the Navy cannot prepare for all of the unknowns,  it can critically evaluate sustainment assumptions that form the basis of its  shipbuilding programs early in the acquisition process. Such analysis could  significantly improve the Navy\u2019s ability to response to changes over time and  increase the likelihood of success. Further, critical analysis could also help decision  makers determine when an initiative is too risky before implementing it on an entire  shipbuilding program.", "In its letter, the ASN (RD&A) also states that a careful reading of the early program  documentation demonstrates that sustainment stakeholders were involved in the  acquisition process. We reviewed available acquisition documents for 11 shipbuilding  programs in the last 20 years and found that sustainment leadership, specifically the  CNO and other in OPNAV, attended meetings and approved sustainment planning  documents. However, we found that sustainment was rarely discussed during early  acquisition meetings\u2014even when the planned shipbuilding programs sought new  sustainment initiatives. Further, we reviewed thousands of Navy documents and met  with over 100 Navy organizations and found that sustainment organizations across  the Navy that are responsible for ship sustainment have a limited role in the  acquisition process, even when having such a role could have likely prevented many  of the problems we discuss in the report.", "As we state in our report, the quantity and breadth of the 150 problems we found\u2014 resulting in billions of dollars in unexpected costs, maintenance delays, and  unreliable ships\u2014suggest that existing policies and guidance have not ensured that  new ships are reliable and can be sustained as planned. We are concerned that the  ASN (RD&A)\u2019s letter is an indication that the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding program offices will  not take the necessary action to improve sustainment planning during the acquisition  process. The ASN (RD&A)\u2019s letter did not mention the recent establishment of a new  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Sustainment that we discuss in our report. We believe  that this office has the opportunity to contribute to improved outcomes byp providing  leadership to ensure that sustainment considerations are critically evaluated during  the acquisition process. Absent such leadership, the Navy is at risk of continuing to  provide ships to the fleet that are incomplete, unreliable, and cost more than  expected to maintain."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition the contact name above, the following staff members made  key contributions to this report: Diana Moldafsky, Assistant Director;  Laurier Fish, Analyst-in-Charge; Jillian Schofield; Sarah Evans; Lori  Fields; Ann Halbert-Brooks; Joshua Garties; Laura Greifner; Tara Kumar;  Shivarthn Maniam; Alexis Olson; Kya Palomaki; Anne Louise Taylor; and  Tonya Woodbury.
