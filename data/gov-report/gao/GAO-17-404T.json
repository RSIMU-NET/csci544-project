USPS, however, continues to  face a serious financial situation with insufficient revenues to cover its  expenses, putting its mission of providing prompt, reliable, and efficient  universal services to the public at risk. USPS continues to incur deficits  that are unsustainable.

USPS continues to have $15  billion in outstanding debt\u2014the statutory limit. These unfunded liabilities  and debt are a large financial burden, increasing from 99 percent of  USPS revenues in fiscal year 2007 to 169 percent of revenues in fiscal  year 2016.

As a result, USPS has lost  a total of $62.4 billion since fiscal year 2007.", "As we testified last year, the continued deterioration in USPS\u2019s financial  condition is due primarily to two factors.  1. Declining First-Class Mail volumes: The long-term decline of First- Class Mail volume, which USPS expects to continue for the foreseeable future, has fundamental implications for USPS\u2019s business model because this remains USPS\u2019s most profitable class of mail. Domestic First-Class Mail volume declined by 2 percent in fiscal year 2016 from the previous fiscal year to 61 billion pieces\u2014a level 41 percent below its peak in fiscal year 2001, and the smallest level since fiscal year 1981 (see fig. 2). USPS recently reported that First-Class Mail volume is declining as major commercial mailers actively  promote the use of online services, and although the rate of decline  has slowed, will continue to decline in future years with the migration  to electronic alternatives resulting from technological changes. In the  long run, USPS also faces the possibility of a future economic  downturn that could have an additional impact on First-Class Mail  volume.  2. Growing Expenses: USPS expenses increased by $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2016 from the previous year, outpacing the $2.6 billion increase in revenues. Increasing compensation and benefits expenses were a key driver of expense growth. USPS reported that compensation and benefits for active employees increased by $1.2 billion, due to contractually obligated salary escalations and additional work hours associated in large part with growth in the more labor-intensive Shipping and Packages business. In this regard, USPS reported a 14  percent growth in Shipping and Packages volume in fiscal year 2016.  However, to accommodate the surge in this volume and to minimize  service disruptions during the holiday season, USPS reported  increasing Sunday delivery service and adding non-career employees  for the holiday season. This contributed to growth in USPS work hours  in fiscal year 2016 from the previous year, when the number of USPS  career employees increased by 17,000 and the number of non-career  employees increased by 1,000. Over the past 3 years, the size of  USPS\u2019s total workforce has increased by about 22,000, including  career and non-career employees; this growth contrasts with the trend  from fiscal years 1999 through 2013, when the workforce decreased  by more than 288,000 (see fig. 3). Compensation and benefits  comprise close to 80 percent of total USPS expenses. Thus,  expenses will continue to grow if increases in salaries and work hours  continue.", "As previously discussed, USPS\u2019s unfunded liabilities and debt have  become a large financial burden, increasing from 99 percent of USPS  revenues at the end of fiscal year 2007 to 169 percent of revenues at the  end of fiscal year 2016. These unfunded liabilities and debt\u2014totaling  about $121 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016\u2014consist mostly of retiree  health and pension benefit obligations for which USPS has not set aside  sufficient funds to cover.", "When the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA)  established the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, it required  USPS to begin prefunding health benefits for its current and future postal  retirees, with annual payments of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion from fiscal  years 2007 through 2016, followed by actuarially determined prefunding  payments beginning in 2017 and every year thereafter. As of the end of  fiscal year 2016, USPS\u2019s liability for retiree health benefits was about  $104.0 billion and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund  balance was $51.9 billion, with a resulting unfunded liability of $52.1  billion. USPS has missed a total of $33.9 billion in required prefunding  payments, which represent about half of its total losses since fiscal year  2007. However, USPS would have still lost $10.6 billion during this time  period even without the annual prefunding requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPS Will Remain Unlikely to Fully Make Required Retiree Health and Pension Payments", "paragraphs": ["USPS will remain unlikely to fully make its required retiree health and  pension payments in the near future. Beginning this fiscal year (2017),  USPS is no longer required to make fixed prefunding payments. Instead,  under the requirements established by PAEA, it is required to start  making annual payments based on actuarial determinations of the  following component costs: a 40-year amortization schedule to address the unfunded liabilities for  postal retiree health benefits,  the \u201cnormal costs\u201d of retiree health benefits for current employees,  and a 27-year amortization schedule to address the unfunded liabilities for  postal pension benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System  (CSRS).", "These payments are in addition to annual payments USPS is already  required to make to finance its pension benefits under the Federal  Employees Retirement System (FERS), which consists of a 30-year  amortization schedule to address any unfunded liabilities, and the normal  costs of FERS benefits for current employees. USPS will find it very  difficult to make all of these required payments given its financial  condition and outlook. As table 1 below shows, in fiscal year 2017, USPS  will be required to make an estimated total of $10.3 billion in payments for  retiree health and pension benefits under CSRS and FERS\u2014about $3.3  billion more than what USPS paid in fiscal year 2016 for these benefit  programs.", "In addition to declining mail volumes and increased expenses, USPS\u2019s  ability to make its required payments for these retirement programs will  be further challenged due to:", "Expiration of a temporary rate surcharge: USPS has reported that the  April 2016 expiration of a 4.3 percent \u201cexigent\u201d surcharge that began  in January 2014 is reducing its revenues by almost $2 billion  annually.", "No new major cost-savings initiatives planned: USPS has made  efforts in recent years to right-size its operations to better adapt to  declining mail volumes that are adversely affecting its financial  position. For example, in fiscal year 2015, USPS reduced the hours of  over 13,000 post offices to better match retail service with demand  and reduced its physical footprint by consolidating 36 mail processing  facilities, and instituted operational changes to better utilize resources.  However, USPS has no current plans to initiate new major initiatives  to achieve cost savings in its operations. According to USPS, it will  continue to implement operational initiatives to contain costs and take  actions to maintain liquidity, but as we testified last year, such  actions will not be enough to stave off future losses and stabilize its  finances. Although USPS has faced stakeholder resistance to its right- sizing efforts, in the absence of such efforts, USPS will continue to  face challenges to appropriately match resources with mail volume  and help address its compensation and benefits costs.", "USPS has reported that without structural change to its business model  and legislative change, it expects continuing losses and liquidity  challenges for the foreseeable future. According to USPS, it has  maintained adequate liquidity only by not making required payments to  prefund retiree health benefits and deferring needed capital investments.  Looking forward, USPS has reported that, if circumstances leave it with  insufficient cash, it may prioritize payments to its employees and  suppliers ahead of some payments to the federal government, as it has  done in the past.", "Large unfunded liabilities for postal retiree health and pension benefits\u2014 which were $73.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016\u2014may ultimately  place taxpayers, USPS employees, retirees and their beneficiaries, and  USPS itself at risk. As we have previously reported, funded benefits  protect the future viability of an enterprise such as USPS by not saddling  it with bills after employees have retired. Further, since USPS retirees  participate in the same health and pension benefit programs as other  federal retirees, if USPS ultimately does not adequately fund these  benefits and if Congress wants these benefits to be maintained at current  levels, funding from the U.S. Treasury, and hence the taxpayer, would be  needed to continue the benefit levels. According to USPS\u2019s testimony last  year, \u201cabsent fundamental legislative reform, we face the prospect of  having to continue to default on these prefunding payments [for retiree  health benefits] in order to continue paying our employees and suppliers  and to provide postal services to the American public. This increases the  risk that taxpayers may ultimately be called on to fund these benefits.\u201d  Alternatively, unfunded benefits could lead to pressure for reductions in  benefits or in pay. Thus, the timely funding of benefits protects USPS  employees, retirees and their beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the USPS  enterprise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Faces Difficult Choices to Address USPS\u2019s Financial Condition", "paragraphs": ["USPS\u2019s financial situation leaves Congress with difficult choices and  trade-offs to achieve the broad-based restructuring that will be necessary  for USPS to become financially sustainable. USPS\u2019s ability to make its  required retiree health and pension payments requires a decrease in  expenses or increase in revenues, or both. Although USPS needs to take  further action to reduce costs and increase revenues, USPS\u2019s actions  alone under its existing authority will be insufficient to achieve sustainable  financial viability; comprehensive legislation will be needed.  Congressional decisions about how to address the following issues will  shape USPS\u2019s future role, services, operations, networks, and ability to  adapt to changes in mail volume. In making these decisions, Congress  could consider, among other things, the following factors:", "The level of postal services and the affordability of those services:  USPS\u2019s growing financial difficulties combined with vast changes in  how people communicate provide Congress with an opportunity to  consider what postal services will be needed in the 21st century.  Specifically, Congress could consider what postal services should be  provided on a universal basis to meet customer needs and how these  services should be provided. Congress also could consider trade-offs  in reducing the level of postal services, such as providing USPS with  the authority to reduce the frequency of letter mail delivery to enable  USPS to reduce its expenses. A key factor in any consideration to  reduce postal services would include potential effects on postal  customers, mail volumes, and employees. In particular, Congress  could consider the quality of postal service\u2014such as the frequency  and speed of mail delivery and the accessibility and scope of retail  postal services\u2014in considering any service reduction. For example,  as part of its efforts to reduce excess capacity, in January 2015 USPS  revised its standards for on-time mail delivery by increasing the  number of days for some mail to be delivered and still be considered  on time. Even with the revised standards, on-time delivery  performance declined significantly, particularly for the second quarter  of fiscal year 2015, a decline USPS attributed to operational changes  implemented in January 2015 and adverse winter weather.  Performance has rebounded since then, facilitated in part by  increases in workforce and mail transportation capacity and costs.", "Compensation and benefits in an environment of revenue pressures:  Key compensation and benefits costs for USPS employees have  increased and continue to increase, while the volume for First-Class  Mail\u2014USPS\u2019s most profitable product\u2014has declined and continues to  decline. To put USPS\u2019s situation into context, many private sector  companies (such as automobile companies, airlines, mail preparation  and printing companies, and major newspapers) took far-reaching  measures to cut costs (such as reducing or stabilizing workforce,  salaries, and benefits) when demand for their central product and  services declined. However, although USPS has taken some steps to  improve its financial situation, USPS has stated that its strategies to  increase efficiency and reduce costs are constrained by statutory,  contractual, regulatory, and political restrictions. USPS is subject to  requirements to maintain 6-day delivery, limit rate increases for most  mail within an inflation-based price cap, and participate in federal  benefit programs. Most USPS employees are covered by collective  bargaining agreements with four major labor unions which have  established salary increases, cost-of-living adjustments, and the  percentage of health insurance premiums paid by employees and  USPS. When USPS and its unions are unable to agree, the parties  are required to enter into binding arbitration by a third-party panel.  There is no statutory requirement for USPS\u2019s financial condition to be  considered in arbitration. Considering USPS\u2019s unsustainable financial  condition and the competitive environment, we continue to believe\u2014 as we reported in 2010\u2014that Congress should consider revising the  statutory framework for collective bargaining to ensure that USPS\u2019s  financial condition be considered in binding arbitration.", "USPS\u2019s dual role of providing affordable universal service while  remaining self-financing: As an independent establishment of the  executive branch, USPS has long been expected to provide  affordable, quality, and universal delivery service to all parts of the  country while remaining self-financing. USPS and other stakeholders  have considered a range of different business models to address  USPS\u2019s financial difficulties. For example, USPS\u2019s 2002  Transformation Plan included a range of alternatives from a publicly  supported model to a business model with a corporate structure  supported by shareholders. Any alternative business model would  need to address the level of any costs that would be transferred from  USPS, which is financed by postal ratepayers, to the federal  government, which is funded by taxpayers. In addition, if Congress  requires eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, as USPS  has previously proposed, it should consider the tradeoffs for the  federal budget deficit and Medicare\u2019s financial condition, as well as  the implications for affected employees.", "Finally, a fully functioning USPS Board of Governors is needed to support  USPS\u2019s ability to carry out its critical responsibilities, as certain powers  are reserved to the nine presidentially-appointed Governors who must be  confirmed by the Senate. Because the last serving Governor left the  Board in December 2016 due to term limits, the 11-member Board  currently consists of only the Postmaster General and the Deputy  Postmaster General. According to USPS, the critical responsibilities  reserved to the Governors include setting postal prices, approving new  products, and appointing or removing the Postmaster General and the  Deputy Postmaster General. USPS stated last year that, in the event no  Governors are in place, these critical duties may not be able to be  executed, potentially leaving USPS without the ability to adjust its prices  as needed, introduce new products, or appoint or replace its two most  senior executive officers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["USPS management, unions, the public, community leaders, and  Members of Congress need to take a hard look at what level of postal  services residents and businesses need and can afford.
