Although the Army is still refining its post-FCS plans, it has already taken a number of actions to comply with DOD directions and define new modernization initiatives. For instance, the Army has terminated FCS vehicle development and is preparing for a new ground combat vehicle program. Also, Army officials convened a special task force to refine future force concepts and formulate an expedited fielding strategy. The Army also announced preliminary plans for new acquisition programs. With ground force modernization efforts at an early stage, DOD and the Army face the challenge of setting the emerging modernization efforts on the best possible footing by buying the right capabilities at the best value. They have an opportunity to position these efforts for success by effectively implementing the enhanced body of acquisition legislation and DOD policy reforms as well as lessons learned from the FCS program, including lessons that underscore the use of knowledge-based acquisition and disciplined contracting strategies. Preliminary plans suggest that the Army is moving in that direction, including expectations to begin future developments with mature technologies and utilizing competitive prototyping. However, DOD recently approved, with a number of restrictions, low-rate initial production of the first increment of FCS spinout equipment, such as new radios and sensors, despite having acknowledged that the systems were immature, unreliable, and not performing as required. The restrictions include required DOD reviews of Army progress toward improving the systems' maturity and reliability. The spin out equipment was being developed within the FCS program, and the decision to approve production reflects DOD and Army emphasis on providing new capabilities quickly to combat units. However, this decision runs the risk of delivering unacceptable equipment to the warfighter and trading off acquisition principles whose validity has been so recently underscored. Detailed plans for most of the Army's new modernization efforts are still being developed and may not be available until at least later in fiscal year 2010. That will be a limiting factor as the Congress considers the Army's fiscal year 2011 budget request for these modernization efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, the Future Combat System (FCS) program has been at the  center of the Army\u2019s efforts to modernize by replacing existing combat  systems with a family of manned and unmanned vehicles and systems  linked by an advanced information network.

Specifically, the Army had not  established firm system-level requirements, mature technologies, a  realistic cost estimate, or an acquisition strategy wherein knowledge  drives schedule. In our March 2009 report, we concluded that the Army  would be challenged to demonstrate the knowledge necessary to warrant  an unqualified commitment to FCS at a congressionally mandated 2009  milestone review.", "In April 2009, the Secretary of Defense proposed restructuring the FCS  program to lower risk and address more near-term needs shortly before  FCS was to undergo the congressionally mandated review to determine its  future.

The FCS concept involved replacing existing combat systems with a  family of manned and unmanned vehicles and systems linked by an  advanced information network. The Army anticipated that the FCS  systems, along with the soldier and enabling complementary systems,  would work together in a system of systems wherein the whole provided  greater capability than the sum of the individual parts. The Army expected  to develop this equipment in 10 years, procure it over 13 years, and field it  to 15 FCS-unique brigades\u2014about one-third of the active force at that  time. The Army also had planned to spin out selected FCS technologies  and systems to current Army forces throughout the system development  and demonstration phase. In 2006, the Army established the Army  Evaluation Task Force to use, evaluate, and train with these FCS spinout  capabilities.", "The Army used a management approach for FCS that centered on a lead  system integrator (LSI) to provide significant management services to help  the Army define and develop FCS and reach across traditional Army  mission areas. Army officials have stated that they did not believe the  Army had the resources or flexibility to use its traditional acquisition  process to field a program as complex as FCS under the aggressive  timeline established by the then-Army Chief of Staff.", "As we have reported in the past, the FCS program was immature and  unable to meet DOD\u2019s own standards for technology and design from the  start (see the list of related GAO products at the end of this report).  Although adjustments were made, such as adding time and reducing  requirements, vehicle weights and software code grew, key network  systems were delayed, and technologies took longer to mature than  anticipated (see fig. 1). By 2009, after an investment of 6 years and an  estimated $18 billion, the viability of the FCS concept was still unknown.  As such, in our 2009 report, we concluded that the maturity of the  development efforts was insufficient and the program could not be  developed and produced within existing resources.", "In April 2009, the Secretary of Defense proposed a significant restructuring  of the FCS program in order to address more near-term combat needs and  incorporate a role for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)  vehicles being used in today\u2019s conflicts. The Secretary noted significant  concerns that the FCS program\u2019s vehicle designs\u2014where greater  information awareness was expected to compensate for less armor and  result in lower weight and higher fuel efficiency\u2014did not adequately  reflect the lessons of counterinsurgency and close-quarters combat  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As such, the Secretary recommended  accelerating fielding of ready-to-go systems and capabilities to all  combat brigades;  canceling the vehicle component of the FCS program, reevaluating the  requirements, technology, and approach, and relaunching the Army\u2019s  vehicle modernization program; and  addressing fee structure and other concerns with current FCS  contracting arrangements.", "Subsequently, in June 2009, DOD issued an acquisition decision  memorandum that canceled the FCS acquisition program, terminated  manned ground vehicle development efforts, and laid out plans for follow- on Army brigade combat team modernization efforts. DOD directed the  Army to transition to an Army-wide modernization plan consisting of a  number of integrated acquisition programs, including one to develop  ground combat vehicles (GCV). The memorandum also instructed the  Army to transition away from an LSI management approach.", "In recent months, the Army has been defining its ground force  modernization efforts per the Secretary\u2019s decisions and the June 2009  acquisition decision memorandum. Although the details are not yet  complete, the Army took several actions through the end of calendar year  2009. It stopped all development work on the FCS manned ground  vehicles\u2014including the non-line-of-sight cannon\u2014in the summer of 2009  and recently terminated development of the Class IV unmanned aerial  vehicle and the countermine and transport variants of the Multifunction  Utility/Logistics and Equipment unmanned ground vehicle. For the time  being, the Army is continuing selected development work under the  existing FCS development contract, primarily residual FCS system and  network development.

Additionally, the Army is transitioning from the FCS long-term acquisition  orientation to a shorter-term approach that biennially develops and fields  new increments of capability within capability packages. It now has one  approved acquisition program that will produce and field the initial  increment of the FCS spinout equipment, as well as preliminary plans for  two other acquisition programs that will define and develop follow-on  increments and develop a new GCV.

Through that process, the task force  found that some assumptions were no longer valid, such as reliance on  networking for survivability, which essentially meant trading heavy armor  for better information or situational awareness. The Army acknowledges  that this is not the best trade for the way it now has to fight. As a result of  the task force\u2019s analysis, the Army is implementing a new operational  concept and brigade combat team modernization strategy that will update  all Army combat brigades for full-spectrum operations. That is a  significant contrast to the FCS approach that would have created 15 new  FCS-unique brigades.", "The task force developed a concept of continual modernization of ready- to-go capabilities through biennial deliveries of capability packages. In  addition to select FCS systems, these capability packages could also  include materiel and nonmateriel items developed outside the FCS  program. The concept also included plans to reallocate assets, divest older  technologies, and incrementally modernize the Army\u2019s information  network. The Army expects to field the first capability package in fiscal  years 2011 through 2012, followed by additional capability packages  delivered in 2-year increments. The Army plans to align capability package  fielding with an established equipment reset and training process in order  to provide these systems to deploying units. A network effort, to include  more advanced hardware, software, and radios, will be included in each  capability package. The Army\u2019s near-term plan is to define, develop,  produce, and field capabilities to some of the Army\u2019s combat brigades, and  the long-term plan is to field those capabilities to all remaining combat  brigades.

The network integration  kit includes, among other things, the integrated computer system, an  initial version of the system-of-systems common operating  environment, early models of the Joint Tactical Radio System and  waveforms, and a range extension relay. In December 2009, the Army  requested and DOD approved, with a number of restrictions, the low- rate initial production of Increment 1 systems that are expected to be  fielded in the fiscal year 2011-12 capability package, which will be  discussed in more detail later in this report. The Army will be  continuing Increment 1 development over the next 2 years while low- rate initial production proceeds.

The Army  reviewed current fighting vehicles across the force structure to  determine whether to sustain, improve, divest, or pursue new vehicles  based on operational value, capability shortfalls, and resource  availability. Per DOD direction, the Army also collaborated with the  Marine Corps to identify capability gaps related to fighting vehicles.  For development of a new GCV, the Army\u2019s preliminary plans indicate  the use of an open architecture design to enable incremental  improvements in modular armor; network architecture; and  subcomponent size, weight, power, and cooling. Preliminary funding  and schedule information for the proposed program was recently  provided to the defense committees by way of the Fiscal Year 2011  President\u2019s Budget Request. According to a DOD official, in February  2010, DOD made a materiel development decision for the Army\u2019s  proposed GCV effort. As a result of that decision, DOD authorized the  Army\u2019s release of a request for proposals for GCV technology  development. Over the next several months, the Army will be  conducting an analysis of alternatives to assess potential materiel  solutions for the GCV. The Army expects to follow the analysis with a  Milestone A decision review on whether to begin technology  development in September 2010. After Milestone A, Army officials are  proposing the use of competitive prototyping with multiple  contractors\u2014the number of which will depend on available funding\u2014 during the technology development phase, which will feature the use  of mature technologies and the fabrication and testing of prototype  subsystems. A preliminary design review would be used to validate  contractor readiness to enter detailed design at Milestone B in fiscal  year 2013.

The Army has  defined a preliminary network strategy and is in the process of  defining what the end state of the network will need to be, as well as  how it may build up that network over an undefined period of time. In  the near term, the Army is working to establish a common network  foundation to build on and to define a common network architecture  based on what is currently available and expected to become available  in the near future. Current communications, command and control,  and networking acquisition programs will continue and will be  expected to build on to the current network foundation and  architecture over time. Networking capabilities will be expected to  meet specific standards and interface requirements. According to  Army officials, the ongoing incremental network and software  development activities and requirements will be dispersed to these  acquisition programs, where they will be considered for further  development and possible fielding.

In many ways, DOD and the Army have set  modernization efforts on a positive course by following direction from  DOD leadership, and they have an opportunity to reduce risks by adhering  to the body of acquisition legislation and policy reforms\u2014which  incorporate knowledge-based best practices we identified in our previous  work\u2014that have been introduced since FCS started in 2003. The new  legislation and policy reforms emphasize a knowledge-based acquisition  approach, a cumulative process in which certain knowledge is acquired by  key decision points before proceeding. In essence, knowledge supplants  risk over time. Additionally, DOD and the Army can further reduce risks  by considering lessons learned from problems that emerged during the  FCS development effort. Initial indications are that the Army is moving in  that direction. These lessons span knowledge-based acquisition practices,  incremental development, affordability, contract management, and  oversight. However, in the first major acquisition decision for the Army\u2019s  post-FCS initiatives, DOD and the Army\u2014because they want to support  the warfighter quickly\u2014are proceeding with low-rate initial production of  one brigade set of Increment 1 systems despite having acknowledged that  the systems are immature, are unreliable, and cannot perform as required."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Acquisition Reforms Point Way to Lower Risk", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s body of acquisition policy, which includes reforms introduced since  FCS started development in 2003, incorporates nearly all of the  knowledge-based practices we identified in our previous work (see table  1). For example, it includes controls to ensure that programs have  demonstrated a certain level of technology maturity, design stability, and  production maturity before proceeding into the next phase of the  acquisition process. As such, if the Army proceeds with preliminary plans  for new acquisition programs, then adherence to the acquisition direction  in each of its new acquisition efforts provides an opportunity to improve  the odds for successful outcomes, reduce risks for follow-on Army ground  force modernization efforts, and deliver needed equipment more quickly  and at lower costs. Conversely, acquisition efforts that proceed with less  technology, design, and manufacturing knowledge than best practices  suggest face a higher risk of cost increases and schedule delays.", "As shown above, the cumulative building of knowledge consists of  information that should be gathered at three critical points over the course  of a program:  Knowledge point 1 (at the program launch or Milestone B  decision): Establishing a business case that balances requirements  with resources. At this point, a match must be made between the  customer\u2019s needs and the developer\u2019s available resources\u2014technology,  engineering, knowledge, time, and funding. A high level of technology  maturity, demonstrated via a prototype in its intended environment,  indicates whether resources and requirements match. Also, the developer  completes a preliminary design of the product that shows that the design  is feasible and that requirements are predictable and doable. FCS did not  satisfy this criterion when it began in 2003, and by 2009, 6 years into  development, the Army still had not satisfied this criterion as emerging  designs did not meet requirements, critical technologies were immature,  and cost estimates were not realistic.", "Knowledge point 2 (at the critical design review between design  integration and demonstration): Gaining design knowledge and  reducing integration risk. At this point, the product design is stable  because it has been demonstrated to meet the customer\u2019s requirements as  well as cost, schedule, and reliability targets. The best practice is to  achieve design stability at the system-level critical design review, usually  held midway through system development. Completion of at least 90  percent of engineering drawings at this point provides tangible evidence  that the product\u2019s design is stable, and a prototype demonstration shows  that the design is capable of meeting performance requirements.", "Knowledge point 3 (at production commitment or the Milestone C  decision): Achieving predictable production. This point is achieved  when it has been demonstrated that the developer can manufacture the  product within cost, schedule, and quality targets. The best practice is to  ensure that all critical manufacturing processes are in statistical control\u2014 that is, they are repeatable, sustainable, and capable of consistently  producing parts within the product\u2019s quality tolerances and standards\u2014at  the start of production.", "In recent years, a number of specific changes have been made to DOD  acquisition policies. Further policy changes should be incorporated as a  result of the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. These  changes, if implemented properly, allow programs to achieve knowledge  at the right times by ensuring that any critical technologies to be included  in the weapon system are mature and ready for integration. The changes  provide support to program managers to keep requirements reasonable  and to keep changes at a minimum. The prototyping provisions included in  these changes call for developmental prototypes beginning very early in  the program. With FCS, the Army did not follow knowledge-based  acquisition practices, but reforms introduced since FCS\u2019s start in 2003  incorporate nearly all of the knowledge-based practices we identified in  our previous work. For example, the reforms include controls to ensure  that programs have demonstrated a certain level of technology maturity,  design stability, and production maturity before they proceed to the next  phase of the acquisition process. If the Army adheres to these acquisition  practices, it has an opportunity to increase the likelihood of successful  outcomes for follow-on Army ground force modernization efforts.  Conversely, acquisition efforts that deviate from knowledge-based  practices face a higher risk of cost increases and schedule delays. Table 2  lists some of those acquisition reforms and their potential impact.", "There are initial indications that DOD and the Army are moving forward to  implement the acquisition policy reforms as they proceed with ground  force modernization, including the Secretary of Defense\u2019s statement about  the ground vehicle modernization program\u2014to \u201cget the acquisition right,  even at the cost of delay.\u201d In addition, DOD anticipates that the GCV  program will comply with DOD acquisition policy in terms of utilizing  competitive system or subsystem prototypes.

In  December 2009, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics approved low-rate initial production of  Increment 1 equipment for one infantry brigade but noted that there is an  aggressive risk reduction plan to grow and demonstrate the network  maturity and reliability to support continued Increment 1 production and  fielding. In the associated acquisition decision memorandum, the Under  Secretary acknowledged the risks of pursuing Increment 1 production,  including early network immaturity; lack of a clear operational perspective  of the early network\u2019s value; and large reliability shortfalls of the network,  systems, and sensors. The Under Secretary also said that he was aware of  the importance of fielding systems to the current warfighter and that the  flexibility to deploy components as available would allow DOD to \u201cbest  support\u201d the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction to \u201cwin the wars we are in.\u201d  Because of that, the Under Secretary specified that a number of actions be  taken over the next year or more and directed the Army to work toward  having all components for the program fielded as soon as possible and to  deploy components of the program as they are ready. However, the Under  Secretary did not specify the necessary improvements that the Army  needed to make or that those improvements are a prerequisite for  approving additional production lots of Increment 1.", "The approval for low-rate initial production is at variance with DOD policy  and Army expectations. DOD\u2019s current acquisition policy requires that  systems be demonstrated in their intended environments using the  selected production-representative articles before the production decision  occurs. However, the testing that formed the basis for the Increment 1  production decision included surrogates and non-production- representative systems, including the communications radios. As we have  previously noted, testing with surrogates and non-production- representative systems is problematic because it does not conclusively  show how well the systems can address current force capability gaps.  Furthermore, Increment 1 systems\u2014which are slated for a fiscal year  2011-12 fielding\u2014do not yet meet the Army\u2019s expectations that new  capabilities would be tested and their performance validated before they  are deployed in a capability package. As noted in 2009 test results, system  performance and reliability during testing was marginal at best. For  example, the demonstrated reliability of the Class I unmanned aerial  vehicle was about 5 hours between failure, compared to a requirement for  23 hours between failure. The Army asserts that Increment 1 systems\u2019  maturity will improve rapidly but admits that it will be a \u201csteep climb\u201d and  not a low-risk effort.", "While the Under Secretary took current warfighter needs into account in  his decision to approve Increment 1 low-rate initial production, it is  questionable whether the equipment can meet one of the main principles  underpinning knowledge-based acquisition\u2014whether the warfighter needs  can best be met with the chosen concept. Test reports from late 2009  showed conclusively that the systems had limited performance, and that  this reduced the test unit\u2019s ability to assess and refine tactics, techniques,  and procedures associated with employment of the equipment. The  Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, recently reported that none of  the Increment 1 systems have demonstrated an adequate level of  performance to be fielded to units and employed in combat. Specifically,  the report noted that reliability is poor and falls short of the level expected  of an acquisition system at this stage of development. Shortfalls in meeting  reliability requirements may adversely affect Increment 1\u2019s overall  operational effectiveness and suitability and may increase life cycle costs.  In addition, in its 2009 assessment of the increment\u2019s limited user test\u2014the  last test before the production decision was made\u2014the Army\u2019s Test and  Evaluation Command indicated that the Increment 1 systems would be  challenged to meet warfighter needs. The Evaluation Command concluded  that, with the exception of the non-line-of-sight launch system, which had  not yet undergone flight testing, all the systems were considered  operationally effective and survivable, but with limitations, because they  were immature and had entered the test as pre-production representative  systems, pre-engineering design models, or both.

Full  details of the Army\u2019s network strategy are still being developed, including  the desired end state, incremental steps to that end state, and its costs.  However, the Army anticipates that the new network will be bounded by  available funding as well as technology readiness. It also expects, as with  capability packages, to field network capability sets on a biennial basis.  Network capability sets feature multiple pieces of the network that have  been integrated and demonstrated. Near-term goals for the network  include starting to connect the individual soldiers, expanding situational  awareness to the company level, and expanding interoperability. As the  Army envisions the network strategy, it will leverage network investments  in systems already procured for ongoing wars, build upon a core set of  network-related foundation products, and develop network packages that  can be customized in support of current and future force platforms. These  packages will include software, computers, and radios."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensure Affordability with More Knowledge and Realism Up Front", "paragraphs": ["Lesson: The affordability of FCS was always in doubt and, in the end, was  a contributing factor to the decision to cancel the program. Ultimately,  FCS affordability depended on two factors: the actual cost of the program  and the availability of funds. The Army could not provide confident cost  estimates for the actual costs of FCS because of the low levels of  knowledge within the program. Instead, it indicated a willingness to  accept the program\u2019s high risks and make trade-offs in requirements for  FCS and other programs to accommodate FCS\u2019s growing costs. When the  Army\u2019s predicted costs for FCS rose from $92 billion in 2003 to $159 billion  by 2009, the Army indicated that it would defer upgrades to current force  systems, such as the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle, to free up  funds for FCS. In the end, the competition for funds\u2014within the Army,  among Army programs and other DOD programs, and among DOD  programs and other federal government needs\u2014was a factor in the  decision to end the FCS program. According to a September 2009 letter  from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics, the FCS acquisition could not be developed and produced within  existing resources. Additionally, the Under Secretary noted that based on  an evaluation of the overall priorities for Army modernization, developing  and procuring FCS brigades was not fiscally viable given DOD priorities.", "Action being taken: The Army has not yet fully defined major  predictors\u2014content, pace, and costs\u2014for long-term affordability of  ground force modernization efforts. It has indicated that work is ongoing  to develop priorities and resource plans for fiscal years 2011 through 2015,  including fielding capability packages, incrementally improving the  network, and establishing a new GCV program. The Army has also  indicated that funding will drive capability trades. For example, the  content and quantity of capability packages could be decreased or  increased depending on available funding. Additionally, the Director of  Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation prepared an independent cost  assessment for Increment 1. This independent estimate was very close to  the Army\u2019s cost position for Increment 1 development and production.", "In its fiscal year 2011 budget request, the Army asked the Congress to  approve funding for further Increment 1 development and production,  Increment 2 development, GCV development, and some network  development.

The Army did not have the expertise to  develop the FCS information network or enough people to support the  program had it been organized into separate program offices. Through its  relationship with the LSI, the Army believed that it found a partner that  could help to define and develop FCS and reach across the Army\u2019s  organizations. In our 2007 report, we pointed out that the close partnerlike  relationship between the Army and the LSI posed risks to the Army\u2019s  effective management and oversight of the FCS program. As a result, the  June 2009 acquisition decision memorandum that outlined plans to cancel  the FCS program also articulated a desire to move away from industry-led  integration activities.", "Action being taken: While Army officials have acknowledged the Under  Secretary\u2019s direction to transition away from reliance on the LSI and  affirmed their desire to comply with that direction, the transition will not  happen right away. The Army is beginning a deliberate process to  transition system engineering and integration activities from the LSI to the  government. For example, Army officials stated that the Army will be  contracting with the LSI for the procurement of the first three brigade sets  of Increment 1 equipment. When these systems move into full-rate  production, the Army may be in a better position to contract directly with  the original equipment manufacturers and without the assistance of an  LSI. According to the Army, the development of Increment 2 may be  jointly managed by the LSI and the original equipment manufacturers.  Likewise, the first lot of Increment 2 production may be jointly managed  by the LSI and the original equipment manufacturers; the other production  lots may be managed directly by the original equipment manufacturers.", "In September 2009, the Army established the Program Executive Office for  Integration to oversee coordination of the three separate but integrated  programs and the network development. Roles and responsibilities have  not yet been fully defined. According to Army officials, the office will be  modeling the various brigade architectures and infrastructures to better  understand how they currently function and to facilitate adding  capabilities to the brigades. They also expect the office to work with the  individual acquisition programs to ensure that the programs are properly  integrated with other elements of each capability package and equipment  already fielded in the various brigades. As the integration issues are  addressed, the individual acquisition programs will be responsible for  execution. Additionally, the office will perform system engineering and  integration via in-house capabilities and supplemented by federally funded  research and development centers or contractors for the capability  packages. The Army is also establishing an organization above the  program executive office level to integrate ongoing network acquisition  efforts to better capture new network technologies, expand technologies  in the field so that they work better together, and provide better  networking capability to more units.

Despite the  fact that the program did not meet the requisite criteria for starting an  acquisition program, DOD approved the program\u2019s entrance into system  development and demonstration in 2003. DOD later reevaluated the  decision and decided to hold a follow-on review with a list of action items  the program had to complete in order to continue.

For instance,  at an October 2009 DOD review, the Army offered preliminary plans for  post-FCS efforts. While DOD agreed to schedule an Increment 1  production decision and a GCV materiel development decision, DOD also  noted that additional clarity was needed for development and  procurement of follow-on items beyond Increment 1, as well as for  transition of the integration activities from the current FCS contractors to  the Army. DOD noted in its decision memorandum that it requires these  plans before it will approve any acquisition strategy for modernization  activities other than Increment 1 and GCV development. Additionally,  while DOD did not hold the Army accountable to knowledge-based  principles when it approved Increment 1 for low-rate production, DOD did  limit low-rate initial procurement quantities to one brigade\u2019s worth of  equipment. DOD also required the Army to prepare for two additional  reviews in 2010\u2014one review to provide a status report on non-line-of-sight  launch system testing and a report detailing the network maturity plan for  Increment 1, and another review for examining the results of additional  testing performed on Increment 1 systems.

Additionally,  prior defense acquisition contracts, including the FCS contract, have complied with preferred DOD guidance for structuring incentive and  award fees. In 2007, we reported that the Army\u2019s contract with the FCS LSI  contained fee provisions that did not tie fees to demonstrated  performance, and it rewarded the LSI too early in the development   Specifically, we reported that the Army would be paying 80  process. percent of the total incentive fee before the LSI conducted the critical  design review. We viewed this arrangement as risky because most of a  program\u2019s cost growth occurs after the critical design review.", "Action being taken: In April 2009, when the Secretary of Defense  announced his plans to significantly change the FCS program, he noted  that he was troubled by the terms of the contract, particularly in its very  unattractive fee structure that gives the government little leverage to  promote cost efficiency. Previously, in an April 2008 memorandum, DOD  stated that a more typical fee arrangement would be significantly less than  what the Army featured in the FCS contract, and that fees should be based  on demonstrated performance to the government. In September 2009,  DOD issued another memorandum to the military services, instructing the  acquisition officials to (1) be more consistent in applying the department\u2019s  guidance, (2) be more judicious in their reviews of fees to ensure that they  are tied to demonstrated performance, and (3) collect additional fee data.  These two memorandums indicate that the department appears focused  on achieving more disciplined award and incentive fee practices. In  addition, DOD officials have recently stated that they expect future Army  contracts for ground force modernization to incorporate a fee structure  with a \u201cmore classic and reasonable\u201d form, in accordance with the  Secretary\u2019s direction and the September 2009 memorandum.", "In October 2009, the Army negotiated a contract modification for  additional development of Increment 1 systems.

As  they transition away from the FCS concept, both the Army and DOD have  an opportunity to improve the likely outcomes for the Army\u2019s ground force  modernization initiatives by adhering closely to recently enacted  acquisition reforms and by seeking to avoid the numerous acquisition  pitfalls that plagued FCS. As DOD and the Army proceed, they should keep  in mind the Secretary of Defense\u2019s admonition about the new ground  vehicle modernization program: \u201cget the acquisition right, even at the cost  of delay.\u201d Based on the preliminary plans, we see a number of good  features. For example, we applaud the Army\u2019s decision to pursue an  incremental acquisition approach for its post-FCS efforts. However, it is  vitally important that each of those incremental efforts adheres to  knowledge-based acquisition principles and strikes a balance between  what is needed, how fast it can be fielded, and how much it will cost.  Moreover, the acquisition community needs to be held accountable for  expected results, and DOD and the Army must not be willing to accept  whatever results are delivered regardless of military utility.", "We are concerned that in their desire for speedy delivery of emerging  equipment to our warfighters in the field, DOD and the Army did not strike  the right balance in prematurely approving low-rate initial production of  Increment 1 of brigade combat team modernization. Although the Army  will argue that it needs to field these capabilities as soon as possible, none  of these systems has been designated as urgent and it is not helpful to  provide early capabilities to the warfighter if those capabilities are not  technically mature and reliable. If the Army moves forward too fast with  immature Increment 1 designs, this could cause additional delays as the  Army and its contractors concurrently address technology, design, and  production issues. Production and fielding is not the appropriate phase of  acquisition to be working on such basic design issues.", "While the Army has not yet finalized its plans for its post-FCS initiatives,  one thing is certain\u2014these programs are likely to require significant  financial investments. In its fiscal year 2011 budget request, the Army has  asked the Congress to approve funding for Increment 1 development and  production, Increment 2 development, GCV development, and some  network development. At this time, detailed plans for these efforts are still  being developed and were not yet available as of early January 2010. This  means that the Congress will have limited information on which to base its  funding decisions. The Army\u2019s fiscal year 2011 budget request does not  provide sufficient details to allay all concerns. DOD and the Army need to  clearly define and communicate plans in order to ensure broad agreement  among all stakeholders, including the Congress.
