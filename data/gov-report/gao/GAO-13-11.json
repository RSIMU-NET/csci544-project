DHS defines resilience as the ability to resist, absorb, recover from, or adapt to adversity, and some high-level documents currently promote resilience as a key national goal. Specifically, two key White House documents emphasize resilience on a national level--the 2011 Presidential Policy Directive 8 and the 2012 National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security. Since 2009, DHS has emphasized the concept of resilience and is currently in the process of developing a resilience policy, the initial steps of which have included creating two internal entities--the Resilience Integration Team and the Office of Resilience Policy (ORP). According to ORP officials, they saw a need to establish a policy that provides component agencies with a single, consistent, departmentwide understanding of resilience that clarifies and consolidates resilience concepts from high-level guiding documents, and helps components understand how their activities address DHS's proposed resilience objectives. ORP officials hope to have an approved policy in place later this year. However, DHS officials stated that currently there are no plans to develop an implementation strategy for this policy. An implementation strategy that defines goals, objectives, and activities; identifies resource needs; and lays out milestones is a key step that could help ensure that DHS components adopt the policy consistently and in a timely manner. For example, an implementation strategy with goals and objectives could provide ORP with a more complete picture of how DHS components are implementing this policy.", "The Coast Guard and the Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP) work with stakeholders to address some aspects of critical infrastructure resilience, but they could take additional collaborative actions to promote portwide resilience. The Coast Guard is port focused and works with owners and operators of assets, such as vessels and port facilities, to assess and enhance various aspects of critical infrastructure resilience in ports--such as security protection, port recovery, and risk analysis efforts. In contrast, IP, through its Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP), conducts assessments with a broader regional focus, but is not port specific. An RRAP assessment is conducted to assess vulnerability to help improve resilience and allow for an analysis of infrastructure \"clusters\" and systems in various regions--for example, a regional transportation and energy corridor. The Coast Guard and IP have collaborated on some RRAP assessments, but there may be opportunities for further collaboration to conduct port-focused resilience assessments. For example, IP and the Coast Guard could collaborate to leverage existing expertise and tools--such as the RRAP approach--to develop assessments of the overall resilience of specific port areas. Having relevant agencies collaborate and leverage one another's resources to conduct joint portwide resilience assessments could further all stakeholders' understanding of interdependencies with other port partners, and help determine where to focus scarce resources to enhance resilience for port areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS develop an implementation strategy for its resilience policy and that the Coast Guard and IP identify opportunities to collaborate to leverage existing tools and resources to assess port resilience.

The Office of Infrastructure  Protection (IP) in the National Protection and Programs Directorate  employs a number of activities designed to enhance critical infrastructure  resilience across a number of sectors. At the department level, DHS  focuses on an all-hazards approach to infrastructure protection and risk  management, as enhancing resilience is one way to increase protection  and reduce risks. Accordingly, each of the four elements of DHS\u2019s  resilience definition broadly corresponds to some resilience-enhancing  measure. For example, resilience involves preparation before, mitigation  during, response immediately following, and recovery after an adverse  event. Another key aspect of critical infrastructure resilience relative to  ports involves understanding the interdependencies that exist between  assets and critical infrastructure sectors (e.g., energy and water)  necessary for operation of the port system as a whole.

In addition, NIAC supports further use of RRAPs,  reporting that the RRAP is viewed in the field as a \u201cmodel of  collaboration\u201d in understanding regional and community resilience and  recommended that its use be expanded \u201cas quickly as feasible.\u201d ORP  officials have also stated that having Coast Guard and IP leverage  resources and collaborate on systematic portwide resilience assessments  could be beneficial.", "In addition, during the course of our review, we learned of a state-led,  ongoing effort to assess portwide resilience at one port area that could  prove to be an example of beneficial collaboration that enhances the  understanding of port resilience. The New Jersey Office of Homeland  Security and Preparedness is leading an effort to develop a computer- based decision support tool that could model the impacts of various  disruptions on all critical infrastructure owners and operators within the  New York/New Jersey port area. The project team\u2014in collaboration with  federal, state, local, and private stakeholders\u2014is examining data from  critical facilities and prior assessments to develop decision-making tools  to model various scenarios. In addition, according to involved officials, the  model is designed to be expandable and transferrable to other ports.  Project officials stated that cooperation by critical industry stakeholders  has been a key factor in the project\u2019s development so far. These officials  stated that they hope to develop three key tools: (1) a decision support  tool that identifies port area vulnerabilities; (2) a port recovery and  resumption-of-trade plan that helps to develop strategic issues to be  addressed; and (3) a compendium of specific recommendations in the  area of resilience, some aimed at specific facilities, some requiring  portwide cooperation to address.", "Various stakeholder groups have noted that in addition to the  development of tools to enhance resilience, collaboration among partners  is also key because of the expertise that each party can contribute to a  better understanding of resilience. For example, NIAC and the State,  Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government Coordinating Council have  reported on a general lack of understanding by state and local community  partners of the nature of interdependencies among infrastructure sectors  and across communities. Both organizations recommended that IP take a  lead role in developing tools and techniques that could help community  partners at the state and local levels identify and assess infrastructure  interdependencies.", "We have reported in the past on how collaborating agencies can better  identify and address needs by leveraging one another\u2019s\u2019 resources to  obtain additional benefits that would not be available if they were working  separately.also states that program management should ensure there are adequate  means of communicating with, and obtaining information from, external  stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving   Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  its goals. Thus, a collaborative effort between the Coast Guard and IP to  assess portwide resilience\u2014leveraging tools and assessment  approaches developed by either component, which could include MSRAM  and the RRAP\u2014could yield benefits. Specifically, the Coast Guard\u2019s  assessments of port/maritime assets coupled with IP\u2019s assessments of  other critical infrastructure with a port nexus could lead to a better  understanding of the interdependencies critical to keeping a port  operational. DHS officials have stated that any collaborative efforts to  assess portwide resilience must take into account the difference between  the Coast Guard\u2019s regulatory and IP\u2019s voluntary missions. For example,  certain information gathered by IP from industry through voluntary  assessments, surveys, or programs such as RRAP cannot be shared with  the Coast Guard (or other federal entities) for regulatory purposes, though  it can be shared for conducting other types of analyses, such as port  security reviews.structuring any such collaboration, DHS would have to protect such  information. DHS\u2019s support for enhancing resilience is already evident in  IP\u2019s voluntary assessments, as well as DHS\u2019s involvement in and  endorsement of the New York/New Jersey port area project. Identifying  opportunities to leverage tools and resources to collaboratively conduct  portwide resilience assessments could enhance stakeholders\u2019  understanding of interdependencies with other port partners, and help to  focus scarce resources to enhance resilience for the port area. This  understanding is important to maintaining port operations, thus minimizing  the potential adverse economic impact on the U.S. economy in the event  of a disruption in port operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS has taken initial steps to emphasize the concept of resilience among  its components by developing a resilience policy. This has been an  important step and is appropriately intended to provide component  agencies with a single, consistent, departmentwide understanding of  resilience. Developing an implementation strategy for this new policy is  the next key step that could help strengthen DHS\u2019s resilience efforts. For  example, an implementation strategy that identifies goals and objectives  could help DHS components to identify, among other things, the actions  that are most critical to addressing DHS\u2019s policy objectives. Similarly, an  implementation strategy that identifies responsible entities and their roles,  as well as specific milestones and performance measures, could provide  components with clear expectations for collaborating with other partners,  and enhance DHS\u2019s awareness of components\u2019 understanding and  implementation of the policy. This collective information, in turn, would  allow DHS to better assess the progress being made by its components  in addressing DHS resilience objectives.", "At the port level, U.S. ports, waterways, and vessels are part of a major  economic engine, and a significant disruption to this system could have a  widespread impact on the U.S. economy, as well as global shipping,  international trade, and the global economy. Coast Guard and IP actions  have addressed some aspects of critical infrastructure resilience, but the  Coast Guard and IP could take additional action to enhance their  collaboration and use existing tools and resources to promote portwide  resilience. For example, IP and the Coast Guard could leverage existing  expertise and tools\u2014such as IP\u2019s RRAP approach\u2014to develop  assessments of the overall resilience of one or more port areas. Having  relevant agencies collaborate and leverage one another\u2019s resources to  conduct joint portwide resilience assessments could further all  stakeholders\u2019 understanding of interdependencies with other port  partners, and better direct scarce resources to enhance port resilience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure consistent implementation of and accountability for  DHS\u2019s resilience policy, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the Assistant Secretary for Policy to develop an  implementation strategy for this new policy that identifies the following  characteristics and others that may be deemed appropriate:  steps needed to achieve results, by developing priorities, milestones,  and performance measures; responsible entities, their roles compared with those of others, and  mechanisms needed for successful coordination; and sources and types of resources and investments associated with the  strategy, and where those resources and investments should be  targeted.", "To allow for more efficient efforts to assess portwide resilience, the  Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the Assistant Secretary of  Infrastructure Protection and the Commandant of the Coast Guard to look  for opportunities to collaborate to leverage existing tools and resources to  conduct assessments of portwide resilience.
