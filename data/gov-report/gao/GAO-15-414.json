We have periodically  reviewed UN efforts to develop and implement the CMP and reported on  the progress of the project. In our most recent review in 2012, we found  that the CMP faced risks related to meeting its completion schedule and  delivering its agreed upon scope. We also found that the CMP was about  $430 million over budget, as of February 2012.", "Separate from the CMP, the UN General Assembly has stressed the  need for a long-term strategy to meet the office space needs at the UN  headquarters in New York. In 2012, we found that the UN estimated that  its future office space needs would exceed the capacity of its real estate  portfolio in New York by 2023, primarily due to expiring leases. We  reported that, as a potential solution, the city and state of New York  proposed the construction of a new UN Consolidation Building known as  DC-5. We found that, as of July 2012, the UN had not developed a cost  estimate for the building and recommended that the Department of State  (State) direct the UN to ensure the development of such an estimate  using GAO\u2019s best practices for cost estimation. Recently, in addition to  DC-5, the UN General Assembly has been considering other options for  its long-term office space needs, such as constructing a new building on  the north lawn of the UN campus, an idea first considered in 2006.", "You asked us to provide updated information on the CMP\u2019s progress and  on the UN\u2019s efforts to address its future office space needs.

As criteria, we  used a UN General Assembly resolution adopted in December 2006 that  approves the CMP\u2019s original scope and states that the CMP is to be  completed within a specific timetable and at a cost not to exceed the  approved budgeted amount of $1.88 million. We also examined other  relevant CMP documentation, including monthly reports and procurement  information. Although we did not audit the CMP cost data and are not  expressing an opinion on them, based on our examination of the  documents received and our discussions with cognizant officials, we  concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Additionally, we interviewed officials from State and relevant UN  offices, including the CMP office, UN Office of Central Support Services.  We also interviewed officials from the UN Board of Auditors, and visited  the CMP project site. To assess the UN\u2019s application of lessons learned  from the CMP to other UN capital projects, we reviewed relevant UN  documents. We also assessed the UN\u2019s collection of lessons learned  from the CMP against UN and federal standards for internal control  related to designing control activities. We also interviewed UN officials  from the Strategic Heritage Plan, a UN capital project underway in  Geneva, Switzerland, to determine which of the lessons learned identified  in UN studies they planned to apply to their project. Finally, to evaluate  how the UN determines and plans to address future office space needs at  its headquarters, we reviewed UN documents such as the Secretary- General\u2019s Study on the Long-Term Accommodation Needs at United  Nations Headquarters 2014\u20132034 and a related report by the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to understand the  UN\u2019s long-term office space needs and identify UN recommendations to  address them, the assumptions upon which the recommendations were  based, and the justifications for those assumptions.

Additionally, the CMP included landscaping,  demolition of the temporary north building, security upgrades, measures  to promote environmental sustainability, and improvements to the  reliability and redundancy of headquarters systems such as emergency  power.", "To finance the CMP, the UN General Assembly approved a plan to  assess member states for the cost of the CMP, under which they could  choose to pay their assessment in either a lump sum or over a 5-year  period, from 2007 to 2011. CMP assessments, whether collected as  lump-sum or multiyear payments, were invested to earn interest. The UN  General Assembly also approved a $45 million working capital reserve for  the CMP to cover any temporary cash flow deficits. According to CMP  office documents, member states would receive this reserve back in the  form of a credit at the end of the project\u2019s construction phase. In the  resolution approving the CMP, the UN General Assembly decided that, in  the event of cost escalations over the approved budget of $1.88 billion,  member states would be subject to a further assessment to meet the  revised requirements of the CMP. The United States has contributed  approximately $488 million to the CMP, broken down as follows: $378 million in assessed contributions, paid in five annual payments  of $75.5 million from 2007 to 2011; $9.9 million in assessed contributions in 2007 to support the CMP\u2019s  working capital reserve; and $100 million in UN Tax Equalization Fund credits attributable to the  United States in 2011 to fund additional security enhancements,  including adjustments to the Conference Building and installing  protective structures, including bollards and gates along the perimeter  of the UN complex.", "In several resolutions, the UN General Assembly has noted that it has the  sole prerogative to decide on any changes to the CMP\u2019s scope, budget,  and implementation strategy. The UN General Assembly has exercised  this prerogative to make changes to the CMP or authorize changes  proposed by the Secretary-General. These changes include:  In December 2007, the UN General Assembly approved an expedited  strategy for the CMP known as accelerated strategy IV. The strategy  expedited the schedule for the Secretariat Building\u2019s renovation by  reducing construction time from 6 to 3 years. The expedited schedule  required the UN to vacate most of the Secretariat Building during the  renovation\u2014which required the CMP office to increase the amount of  leased space. Under the accelerated strategy, all CMP activity was  projected to be completed in mid-2013. According to an August 2014  Secretary-General report, the CMP Office will be disbanded in June  2015 and post renovation and close-out activities will continue under  the management of the UN\u2019s Office of Central Support Services  (Central Support Services).", "In April 2009, the UN General Assembly decided that certain costs  related to the CMP\u2014known as associated costs\u2014would be financed  from within the $1.88 billion CMP budget.

As  shown in table 2, these unfinished tasks include reconfiguring the 42nd  Street and 48th Street vehicle entrances and service drives, demolition of  the temporary North Lawn Building, and site landscaping. The work on  the vehicle entrances was delayed due to the CMP office lacking the  necessary permits to begin construction. The demolition of the temporary  North Lawn Building has been delayed until the structure is no longer in  use as interim office space, and site landscaping can only be completed  once the temporary North Lawn Building has been removed.

While not parties to the agreement, the use  of the site for construction of DC-5 requires that UNDC and the UN fulfill  certain requirements. For example, UNDC and the UN would have to  agree on a lease by the UN of DC-5 from UNDC, potentially in a lease-to- own or similar arrangement.", "To date, the UN has not entered into any agreements with UNDC  regarding the DC-5 project. UN officials informed us the UN wants a more  precise cost estimate, which will not be possible until a later date. In  December 2014, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution asking  the Secretary-General to provide a preliminary UN credit rating, proposed  lease terms and accurate cost projections. The UN credit rating would  affect the interest rate on the bonds financing the DC-5 project. According  to UNDC officials, UNDC can only rent space in DC-5 to UN entities, and  before the issuance of bonds to finance the project could occur, UNDC  would have to make a major investment in the project. As of late March  2015, UNDC reported that it had already incurred design and planning  costs of approximately $14 million for the project and foresaw additional  costs of approximately $25 million for development of a full design  package to be recouped in the future financing arrangement.", "UNDC expects that extending the MOU\u2019s December 31, 2015 expiration  date may be possible as the city of New York has a strong commitment to  the project. According to the MOU, the financing for the DC-5 project is  required to provide a $70 million payment to the city of New York to fund  a greenbelt or parkland along the East River that would benefit the larger  New York community. In October 2014, UNDC officials told us that if a  UN agreement on DC-5 were to happen soon, the new building could be  ready for occupancy in 2021.

According to the UN Secretariat,  renegotiating these leases beyond 2023 would likely result in lease rates  set at projected commercial rates of $65 per square foot per month,  rather than the favorable below-market rates the UN now pays.

The resolution noted that  previous information provided to the UN General Assembly was not  precise or comprehensive enough to facilitate its decision making.", "In prior work, we have also supported precise and comprehensive  analyses to justify executive decision making on alternative actions facing  an organization. For example, we have found that the process for  analyzing alternatives can be enhanced by using generally accepted  practices, including documenting all steps taken to identify, analyze, and  select alternatives in a single document; documenting and justifying all  assumptions and constraints used in the analysis; identifying and  considering a diverse range of alternatives to meet the mission need; and  including one alternative representing the status quo to provide a basis of  comparison among alternatives.", "The Secretary-General\u2019s February 2014 report, Study on the Long-Term  Accommodation Needs at United Nations Headquarters for the Period  from 2014 to 2034, analyzes UN workforce requirements and the  potential impact of flexible workplace policies as called for by the UN  General Assembly, but the report does not clearly document the  justification for assumptions underlying its analysis of these and other  factors. For example:", "Workforce requirements: The report states that it based a projected  1.1 percent workforce growth rate on historical trends of the past 20  years but does not provide a similar justification for its no-growth  scenario, citing only future program increases and decreases.  Similarly, the report states that a projected 0.5 percent workforce  decrease is based on program increases and decreases, partially  offset by changes in work practices, without specifying what work  practices or other factors underlie this assumption. In addition, while  the report assumes a time frame of 2014 through 2034 for its  workforce growth-rate scenarios, its cost estimate projections for the  three options the Secretary-General deemed viable are through 2064.  According to the Secretariat, the UN did not extrapolate workforce  figures after 2034 because it considered that period to be too far into  the future to make assumptions useful for planning purposes.", "Flexible workplace policies: The report on long-term accommodation  needs assumes that the UN plans to implement flexible workplace  policies, such as telecommuting and desk-sharing that will reduce its  office space needs. For example, the report states that a flexible  workplace will reduce gross square feet per workspace needed by 20  percent, assuming a no-growth workforce. However, the report does  not provide any methodology or calculations to support this reduction  in needed workspace, nor does it provide any workspace reduction  predictions for the other two workforce scenarios\u20141.1 percent growth  and 0.5 percent decrease. In a March 2014 report, the UN Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)  called the estimated 20 percent reduction in workspace \u201cindicative at  best\u201d and recommended that the Secretary-General conduct further  analysis.", "Lease rates: The report also does not fully document how it derived  the total projected costs for the status quo option. As mentioned  earlier, the UN Secretary-General based the total cost estimate for the  status quo on the assumption that rental rates for currently leased  space (DC-1 and DC-2) will rise to market rates in 2023. According to  the Secretary-General\u2019s February 2014 report, the total estimated cost  (2014-2064) for the status quo option is $10.73 billion. In March  2014, the Secretary-General provided additional information on its  methodology for calculating this total. That is, the Secretary-General  showed that this amount was derived by totaling the annual rents the  UN would pay for UN leased space from January 1, 2014, through  December 31, 2063. However, this information did not clarify whether  these rents per year included those only for DC-1 and DC-2 or for all  of the UN\u2019s leased space. For example, according to the Secretariat,  the UN\u2019s total annual rent for DC-1 and DC-2 in 2014 was $21.85  million. Yet, the Secretary-General used $56 million in its cost  estimate for the status quo, a dollar amount that is closer to the total  rent the UN paid for all of its leased property in 2014 ($54,402,628).  Including all of the UN leases might make sense, but the UN  Secretary-General did not document how or whether it factored in the  different lease expiration dates into its estimates. According to the  Secretary-General, most UN leases expire before 2023, which could  affect the total lease costs. For example, according to the Secretary- General, the UN\u2019s lease with the Albano Building, where it rents  187,060 square feet of space, expires in July 2017 with no option for  renewal. In addition, the Secretary-General has reported on the  difficulty of predicting market fluctuations as rents go up and down in  response to many factors, including conversions from commercial to  residential use or rezoning. For example, the Wall Street Journal  reported in February 2015 that the ALCOA building, where the UN  leases 30,385 square feet of office space, is to be converted to  condominiums. (See app. III for more information on UN rented  property.)", "Size of proposed North Lawn Building: In addition, the February 2014  report assumes the size of the North Lawn Building (option 1) to be  816,337 square feet. However, according to UN officials we spoke  with, the actual size of a new North Lawn Building will likely be smaller  (500,000 square feet). The reduction in the planned size of the  building can be attributed to physical limits on building footprint and  height to preserve the architectural integrity of the UN campus, as  desired by member states. As a result, according to these officials, the  cost estimate in the February 2014 report is likely to be understated  because it does not include the cost of the additional rental space  needed to compensate for a smaller building.", "UN credit rating: Furthermore, the February 2014 report notes that,  because DC-5 is to be financed by proceeds from a bond issuance, its  projected cost will be affected by the UN\u2019s credit rating (yet to be  determined) because the credit rating determines interest rates for  financing the project which, in turn, affect the cost of repaying the  bond. The report presents indicative 30-year taxable fixed interest  rates and their respective credit ratings, ranging from 5.75 percent for  the highest credit rating to 6.95 percent for the lowest. In costing out  the DC-5 project, the report used a mid-range credit rating with a 6.2  percent interest rate. However, while the report estimates that the  lowest credit rating considered would increase overall project costs by  $200 million, it does not estimate the potential cost savings from the  highest credit rating.", "In seeking solutions to its future office space needs, the UN has made  important assumptions, including future UN workforce levels in New York  City, the extent to which that workforce will use telecommuting or other  nontraditional work environments, the future cost of UN rental space, the  size and scale of proposed new construction, and the estimated interest  rates for financing new construction.

For our  baseline comparison, we referred to UN General Assembly resolutions  that approved the planned renovation scope and schedule from  Accelerated Strategy IV in 2007 and the $1.88 billion budget for the CMP  in 2006. Further, we examined other relevant CMP documentation,  including monthly reports and procurement information. To understand  the project\u2019s cost estimates, we examined materials provided by the CMP  office to the UN General Assembly\u2019s Fifth Committee documenting the  project\u2019s financial condition as of June 2014, and analyzed reports on  CMP progress. We also traveled to New York City, New York, to tour the  renovation sites and observe the progress of the CMP.

Further, we held discussions with officials from the  CMP office, Office of Program Planning, Budget, and Accounts, UN  Board of Auditors, and State\u2019s Bureau of International Organizations to  understand the various options. For criteria we used a UN General  Assembly resolution issued in March 2007 that approves the CMP\u2019s  original scope and states that the CMP is to be completed within a  specific time table and at a cost not to exceed the approved budgeted  amount of $1.88 billion.
