Agencies classify this information or designate it sensitive but unclassified to protect and limit access to it. The National Archives' Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) assesses agencies' classification management programs, and in July 2004 and April 2005 recommended changes to correct problems at the Justice Department (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). GAO was asked to examine (1) DOJ's and FBI's progress in implementing the recommendations and (2) the management controls DOJ components have to ensure the proper use of sensitive but unclassified designations. GAO reviewed ISOO's reports and agency documentation on changes implemented and controls in place, and interviewed security program managers at DOJ, its components, and ISOO to examine these issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At the time of GAO's review, DOJ and FBI had made progress implementing ISOO's recommendations aimed at correcting deficiencies in their programs to properly classify information. FBI had taken action on 11 of 12 recommendations, including issuing security regulations governing its program and updating most of the classification guides that employees use to help them decide what information should be classified. FBI is also correcting deficiencies in its training and oversight activities. If FBI completes all recommendations, this will help to lower program risk since it makes 98 percent of DOJ's classification decisions. DOJ had taken action on 5 of 10 recommendations, including fixing problems with outdated and insufficient training and insufficient monitoring of components' programs. DOJ, however, has taken no action on the most important recommendation, addressing its staff shortages, which continue to place its program at risk given that it sets policy, provides training, and oversees classification practices departmentwide. DOJ said it did not have staff resources to address other shortcomings in its training and oversight activities that ISOO recommended it correct. DOJ is trying to address its resource constraints, a long-standing problem that GAO identified as early as 1993, by requesting additional funds from an administrative account in fiscal year 2007. However, DOJ does not know the optimum number of staff it needs for the program because it has not assessed its needs. It also does not have a strategy that identifies how it will use additional resources to address remaining deficiencies so as to reduce the highest program risks, such as whether to first address training, oversight, or other program gaps. For sensitive but unclassified information, the five components in our review--Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Criminal Division; Drug Enforcement Administration; FBI; and U.S. Marshals Service--had orders and directives that identified and defined the various designations components were using, such as Law Enforcement Sensitive, to protect information, such as information critical to a criminal prosecution. But the components did not have specific guides, with examples, to help employees decide whether information merits a sensitive but unclassified designation. Furthermore, none of the components had training to help employees make these decisions or oversight of their designation practices. Without these controls, DOJ cannot reasonably ensure that information is properly restricted or disclosed and that designations are consistently applied. GAO recently identified similar problems at several other agencies and recommended that they implement such controls, and the agencies agreed to do so. According to security officials, DOJ is waiting for the results of an interagency working group established to set governmentwide standards for sensitive but unclassified information before considering additional changes in its sensitive but unclassified practices or those of its components. The final results from the working group are due by the end of December 2006. Once standardization is realized, it is important for DOJ to ensure that sensitive but unclassified practices across the agency provide employees with the tools they need to apply designations appropriately."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the former Vice Chair of the National Commission on  Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission), the  government\u2019s single greatest failure in the lead-up to the September 11,  2001, attacks was the inability of federal agencies to share information  about suspected terrorists and their activities. Likewise, as we have  previously reported, critical to homeland protection efforts is the ability to  share information among key homeland security stakeholders so they can  coordinate their antiterrorism activities yet also protect sensitive  information from unauthorized access that could compromise our nation\u2019s  security. As part of these protection efforts, pursuant to Executive Order  12958, as amended, the federal government routinely classifies certain  documents and other information critical to our national security as Top  Secret, Secret, or Confidential. These classification levels indicate the  degree of damage that could be reasonably expected from unauthorized  disclosure. Classified information can only be used by individuals who  have an appropriate security clearance and a need to know and must be  safeguarded from unauthorized access and disclosure. A critical  component of balancing the competing interests of the need to share and  the need to protect information is the establishment of clear policies and  procedures to guide decisions on whether information should be  classified.", "Reviewing classified information to determine if it must continue to be  restricted or if it can be declassified and be made publicly available and  shared is also a vital part of the classification system. For example, under  a provision in the executive order, all records of a permanent historical  value over 25 years old that contain classified national security  information will be automatically declassified on December 31, 2006, and  each year thereafter, and may be available for public disclosure. Before  this date, agencies may review applicable records to determine if they  qualify for certain exemptions\u2014for example, information about the  confidential human sources of intelligence information cannot be  disclosed\u2014if they should be reclassified, or if they should be withheld for  reasons such as concerns about an individual\u2019s privacy rights.", "Government agencies may also designate other types of information  important to their missions, such as law enforcement information critical  to a prosecution, as sensitive but unclassified. Agencies have employed a  number of different sensitive but unclassified designations, such as Law  Enforcement Sensitive, For Official Use Only, and Limited Official Use,  which have associated restrictions on handling and sharing such  information with other government entities and with the public. Sensitive  but unclassified information generally must be safeguarded from public  release and can only be used by those with a need to know. Unlike  classified information, generally, a security clearance is not required for  access to sensitive but unclassified information, and there is no time limit  on the designation indicating when it can be removed.", "As part of the post-September 11 efforts to better share information  critical to homeland protection, agencies\u2019 classification and sensitive but  unclassified information security programs have come under scrutiny. In  response to congressional requests, we have recently published several  reports assessing various executive branch agencies\u2019 programs for  designating and sharing classified and sensitive but unclassified  information. (See app. I for summaries of each of our related reports.) This  work noted that agencies needed to enhance their policies and procedures  governing classified and other sensitive information to help ensure they  were appropriately protecting it. For example, we found that the  Department of Defense\u2019s information security program had weaknesses,  such as in the training provided employees on the classification program,  and in the use of self-inspections to monitor program implementation. In  addition, congressional committees have conducted a number of hearings  on agencies\u2019 information security efforts that raised issues such as  whether some agencies have been overclassifying documents, thereby  restricting public access to important historical information.", "The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO), an office within the  National Archives and Records Administration, is responsible for issuing  directives to implement the executive order that governs classified  information. The office is also responsible for overseeing executive branch  agencies\u2019 national security information classification programs for  compliance with the order and implementing directives. The office is not  responsible for overseeing agencies\u2019 sensitive but unclassified information  security programs, which is the responsibility of each agency. ISOO\u2019s  oversight consists of performing on-site inspections of classification  programs, conducting classified document reviews, evaluating agency  security education and training programs, and recommending corrective  actions to agencies when it finds violations under the order or directives.  According to ISOO, while the order provides it with the authority to make  such recommendations, it cannot require agencies to implement them.  ISOO is also required to report at least annually to the President on the  status of federal agencies\u2019 national security information classification  programs.", "The Department of Justice (DOJ), the nation\u2019s top law enforcement  agency, is the third largest classifier of information in the executive  branch, following the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence  Agency, based on information that these agencies reported to ISOO.  Furthermore, one component within DOJ, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), makes up 98 percent of the department\u2019s total  classification decisions. Thus, it is important that both organizations have  effective information classification programs. In July 2004, ISOO made   10 recommendations to DOJ to correct deficiencies in its policies and  procedures for classifying and declassifying national security information.  For example, ISOO found gaps in the level of resources DOJ had available  to oversee its classification management program, in its employee training  programs, and in the use of inspections to ensure employees were making  proper classification decisions. In response, ISOO recommended that DOJ  provide more resources, update and more consistently provide employee  training, and conduct more regular inspections of how well its  classification management program is working to correct these  deficiencies. Likewise, ISOO made 12 recommendations to the FBI in April  2005 to address deficiencies in that component\u2019s program, including gaps  in the guidance employees can use to make classification decisions,  outdated training, and little program oversight. ISOO recommended that  the FBI issue regulations governing the program, update or create  classification and declassification guides to help employees properly  classify information, update employee training, and use more regular  inspections to test program effectiveness.", "In response to your request, this report examines matters related to DOJ\u2019s  management of classified and sensitive but unclassified information. More  specifically, we address the following questions:  1.  To what extent has DOJ implemented ISOO\u2019s recommendations?  2.  To what extent has FBI implemented ISOO\u2019s recommendations?  3.  What policies, procedures, and internal controls are in place in  selected DOJ components to properly use sensitive but unclassified  designations?  4.  What processes are in place at selected DOJ components to respond to  intragovernmental requests to share national security and sensitive but  unclassified information?", "To determine the extent of changes that DOJ and the FBI have made to  implement ISOO\u2019s recommendations and other changes made to improve  their classification management programs, we (1) reviewed the results of  ISOO\u2019s audits; (2) obtained supporting documents that addressed these  changes, when available; and (3) discussed challenges that DOJ and FBI  managers responsible for implementing and overseeing these programs  faced in making these changes. While these results cannot be generalized  to all classified documents, we determined the methodology ISOO uses to  conduct its reviews is adequate to support its recommendations.", "To determine the extent of policies, procedures, and internal controls that  selected DOJ components have in place for designating information as  sensitive but unclassified, we used our Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government to provide criteria to assess the components\u2019  sensitive but unclassified designation practices. We selected five DOJ  components for our review: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives (ATF); Criminal Division; Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA); the FBI; and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). We selected these  components because, on the basis of data we collected as part of our prior  governmentwide assessment of 26 agencies\u2019 sensitive but unclassified  information programs, we determined that each of these components had  adopted one or more sensitive but unclassified designations, in addition to  the Limited Official Use designation used across the department. We  reviewed the available data collected on these five components as part of  the governmentwide review. We had determined these data were reliable  enough for our purposes, and we conducted follow-up interviews with  each component\u2019s security officials and senior program officials on these  issues.", "To determine how selected DOJ components respond to federal  intragovernmental requests for classified and sensitive but unclassified  information, we reviewed supporting documents when available,  interviewed these same security officials, and compared the components\u2019  processes for responding to requests, but we did not independently test  the effectiveness of these processes. We conducted our work from June  2005 through August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. More detailed information about our  scope and methodology appears in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government classifies information that it determines could  reasonably be expected to damage the national security of the United  States if disclosed publicly. Since 1940, the classification of official secrets  has been governed by policies and procedures flowing from executive  orders issued by presidents, largely based on authority granted under  Article II of the Constitution. Current classification and declassification  requirements are mandated by Executive Order 12958, Classified National  Security Information, as amended. The order establishes the basis for  classifying national security information at one of three levels\u2014Top  Secret, Secret, or Confidential\u2014depending on the degree of damage that  unauthorized disclosure of this information could reasonably be expected  to cause to the national security of the United States. Pursuant to the  executive order, designated individuals, called original classifiers, exercise  original classification authority, meaning they can classify national  security information for the first time. Such individuals, including the  President, agency heads, and other government officials that have been  delegated this authority determine the degree of damage that disclosure  could cause, decide on a classification level for the information, and  attempt to establish a date or event for its declassification.", "Declassification is a vital part of the classification system because it  prompts the change in status of the information from classified to  unclassified, which may make it available for others to access and use,  such as members of the general public, researchers, historians, or other  parties. Under the automatic declassification provision of the executive  order, all records of a permanent historical value over 25 years old that  contain classified national security information will be automatically  declassified on December 31, 2006, and each year thereafter, and may be  available for public disclosure, unless an agency head or senior agency  official determines that these records fall within an exemption that  permits continued classification as approved by the President or the  Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel. Examples of  exemptions include information that, if released, could be expected to  seriously impair relations between the United States and a foreign  government; undermine diplomatic activities of the United States; identify  a human intelligence source; or violate a statute, treaty, or international  agreement. Information that is automatically declassified as of December  31, 2006, will not necessarily enter the public domain. According to ISOO  officials, declassified information may continue to be withheld from public  disclosure for reasons under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or  other legal authority or may be reclassified in accordance with the  executive order.", "The order also requires ISOO to implement directives and perform  oversight inspections of executive branch agencies\u2019 national security  information classification programs to ensure these programs are in  compliance with the order. When the oversight inspections result in  findings of noncompliance with the order, ISOO recommends corrective  actions to the agencies. However, according to ISOO, it cannot require  agencies to implement the recommended corrective actions.", "According to ISOO, DOJ is the third largest classifier of information in the  executive branch, although this represents about 2 percent of all executive  branch classification decisions during fiscal years 2000 through 2004, as  the vast majority of classified information originates in the Department of  Defense. Nevertheless, DOJ is responsible for a large volume of classified  information, some of which if improperly disclosed could harm the  national security of the United States. The majority (approximately   98 percent) of classification activity within DOJ occurs at the FBI.", "DOJ also designates certain information as sensitive but unclassified and  prescribes specific requirements for handling and sharing this information  to ensure that harm is not caused to governmental, commercial, or privacy  interests as a result of disclosing it to the public or persons who do not  need such information to perform their jobs. DOJ components in our  review use a number of sensitive but unclassified designations, such as  Law Enforcement Sensitive, For Official Use Only, and Limited Official  Use, to identify information as sensitive but unclassified. Such information  at DOJ could include that which is critical to a criminal prosecution. As  such, the department would protect this information from inappropriate  dissemination by designating it Law Enforcement Sensitive and applying  prescribed dissemination and handling procedures that correspond with  the designation. Information designated as sensitive but unclassified  remains so indefinitely, unless it is reviewed, for example, pursuant to a  request under FOIA. That act requires federal agencies to disclose records  requested in writing by any person unless one or more of the nine  exemptions and three exclusions authorize the agency to withhold the  requested information. For example, law enforcement records may be  withheld if their release could reasonably be expected to interfere with  enforcement proceedings.", "Within DOJ, the Office of Information Safeguards and Security Oversight,  which is part of the Security and Emergency Planning Staff (SEPS), is  responsible for developing security policy and administering and  overseeing the department\u2019s programs for managing classified and  sensitive but unclassified information. This office currently has a total of  13 staff, of which 1 is responsible for policy development and training, and  3 are responsible for program oversight. The remaining 9, among other  things, administer the department\u2019s sensitive compartmented information  program, reviews information technology security policies developed by  the department\u2019s Chief Information Officer, and ensures the development  and implementation of departmentwide policies and procedures that  govern certain security related activities. Figure 1 shows an excerpt of  DOJ\u2019s organizational chart that features the offices responsible for  classification management.", "At the component level, security program managers are responsible for  implementing component-specific security activities, such as conducting  internal inspections and training employees on their responsibilities in  relation to DOJ\u2019s security programs.

The ISOO recommendations were to correct,  among other things, resource constraints, a lack of sufficient training on  how to classify information, and inadequate oversight to ensure its  classification management practices were working well.

DOJ also  built in the requirement that all components submit inspection reports for  each fiscal year no later than October 15 of the following fiscal year, but at  the time of our review, a SEPS official noted that none of the components  had submitted inspection reports for fiscal year 2005.", "Through SEPS, DOJ has partially implemented 2 other recommendations.  First, in response to ISOO\u2019s recommendation that security program  managers hold security clearances at levels appropriate for the activity of  their office, SEPS reported that all of its component security program  managers who handle classified information had security clearances, but  SEPS was considering revising the order on security programs and  responsibilities to include a requirement for these managers to hold  clearances. Second, as of April 2006, SEPS reported that it has taken steps  to make refresher training, including how to mark classified documents,  available to all staff in all DOJ components. According to DOJ security  officials, SEPS has developed a computer-based refresher training module,  which is estimated to be available to employees by December 2006.", "DOJ disagreed with an ISOO recommendation to examine the placement  of SEPS within the department\u2019s organizational structure and consider  repositioning it to afford it higher visibility and increased stature. DOJ\u2019s  Assistant Attorney General for Administration informed ISOO that SEPS\u2019s  reporting to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Administration  does not hinder it from fulfilling its responsibilities, and SEPS\u2019s director  has access to the department\u2019s senior leadership whenever needed.  However, ISOO still maintains this change is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ\u2019s Inaction on Staff Resource Issues Impedes Full Implementation of ISOO\u2019s Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["ISOO reported that SEPS lacked sufficient staff resources to effectively  implement DOJ\u2019s classification management program and recommended  that measures be taken to correct this deficiency. ISOO\u2019s recommendation  to DOJ on resources for classification management is consistent with the  executive order governing classified information that requires agency  heads to commit the resources necessary to effectively implement a  national security information program. The order also requires the senior  agency official\u2014who is designated by the agency head to direct and  administer the agency\u2019s classified national security information program\u2014 in part, to establish and maintain programs to (1) train and educate  employees on the need to properly classify and mark national security  information and prevent unnecessary access to and unauthorized  disclosure of classified information; and (2) provide oversight of the  program through mechanisms such as ongoing internal inspections.   These requirements are also consistent with federal standards for   internal control.", "ISOO reported that SEPS\u2019s lack of resources is particularly significant  because of DOJ\u2019s large volume of classification activity\u2014especially when  SEPS is compared to security offices at other federal agencies of similar  size and structure. DOJ, the third largest classifier of information in the  federal government, has 13 full-time positions devoted to information  security. Four of the 13 are dedicated to DOJ\u2019s classification management  training and program oversight departmentwide, 1 to provide and oversee  training across the department and components and 3 to conduct security  compliance reviews at DOJ\u2019s 3,500 locations. DOJ does have security  program managers at each of its components to provide training and  program oversight for that component that helps to supplement  departmental activity. Nevertheless, in comparison, the Department of  Energy, the fifth largest classifier, has 23 full-time positions, and the  Department of State, the fourth largest classifier of information, has   8 full-time positions to cover its classification management program at  headquarters alone, according to ISOO.", "SEPS did not receive additional resources, as requested, nor did DOJ  reallocate resources to SEPS from other activities, according to DOJ  security officials, although they would not provide additional information  explaining the reasons why funds were not made available. This problem  is longstanding. In 1993, for example, we reported that limited staff  resources in SEPS\u2019s Security Compliance Review Group affected its ability  to conduct compliance reviews of all DOJ locations in overseeing the  department\u2019s security program. In addition, during 1991 and 1992, the  group had 6 employees to conduct reviews of 1,300 DOJ locations  compared to half as many staff to cover almost three times as many  locations today. Moreover, in 1993, we reported that DOJ requested, but  was not authorized, additional staff, and we recommended that the  Attorney General direct SEPS\u2019s Security Compliance Review Group to  explore other alternatives for selecting and conducting these annual  reviews to maximize the use of its limited resources. In response, DOJ  devised a strategy to use components\u2019 security specialists to help with  compliance reviews and their inspection reports to target locations to  review. As a result, DOJ reported that the number of compliance, follow- up, and unscheduled reviews increased. However, at the time of our  review, SEPS indicated that security program officials only perform  oversight of their components\u2019 security programs. Despite the progress  reported after our 1993 report, ISOO found over 10 years later that DOJ  was not able to compensate for its lack of resources and provide sufficient  oversight.", "As a result of these staff resource limitations, DOJ security officials stated  that SEPS had only been able to partially implement 2 ISOO  recommendations and had not taken steps to address 3 others. DOJ had  partially responded to ISOO\u2019s recommendation that department security  program managers be given consistent and regular training they need to  understand their responsibilities for managing their respective  component\u2019s classification activities. SEPS agreed to provide training to  these managers in two ways: (1) an annual conference, at which  attendance is not required, that the department has hosted since 2003 and   (2) detailed training workshops on handling and safeguarding classified  information, such as marking documents, conducting self-inspections, and  managing classification programs, which are provided only upon request.  However, DOJ does not have a mechanism, as called for in our federal  internal control standards, and sufficient staff, as ISOO noted in its report,  to ensure all security program managers consistently receive the training  they need. In addition, SEPS has implemented a database to track security  incidents departmentwide, such as classification program violations, as  ISOO recommended. However, SEPS officials reported that they have not  been able to monitor security violations and incidents to identify patterns  and trends and incorporate these lessons learned into the department\u2019s  security education and training program because they lack the staff to   do so.", "The three recommendations SEPS had not taken any action on primarily  related to monitoring aspects of the classification management program.  First, ISOO found that SEPS was not conducting frequent reviews of the  department\u2019s compliance with the security program, as a whole, and that  the components were not supplementing these department-level reviews  by conducting self-inspections of compliance with their security programs  on a frequent and consistent basis to ensure that sound security practices  are maintained. SEPS\u2019s team of three reviewers was responsible for  conducting security program compliance reviews at an estimated   3,500 DOJ facilities currently located worldwide. ISOO also found that  SEPS had not established a mechanism to ensure that components were  conducting the self-inspections. ISOO recommended that DOJ correct  these deficiencies.", "Second, ISOO also found that classified documents were not always  marked as required. Over half of the 81 classified documents that ISOO  reviewed did not meet the marking requirements of the executive order.", "The most frequent marking errors consisted of a lack of, or incomplete,  portion markings (27 documents) and missing, incomplete, or improper  declassification instructions (23 documents). Therefore, ISOO  recommended that DOJ review classified documents on a regular basis to  determine if staff are properly applying the marking requirements after  employees have been trained on these requirements. According to SEPS  officials, because of related resource constraints, the office had not taken  action to institute these reviews.", "Third, DOJ had not taken action on ISOO\u2019s recommendation that  employees receive security debriefings upon leaving the department.   ISOO reported that such termination briefings are essential to informing  employees that were leaving the agency of their continuing responsibility  to protect classified security information. This recommendation is  consistent with the executive order and implementing directives, federal  standards for internal control, and DOJ\u2019s own Security Program  Operating Manual. DOJ reported that it enforces this requirement by  checking to see if components are providing the briefings when SEPS  conducts components\u2019 security compliance reviews. However, ISOO found  that SEPS did not conduct these reviews frequently enough to ensure that  sound security practices are maintained. Furthermore, DOJ officials  concurred with ISOO\u2019s position on this matter and attributed the  department\u2019s insufficient reviews to its resource limitations. As an  alternative, ISOO suggested to us that DOJ might coordinate with its  human resources department to establish a system to track whether  employees received the termination briefings before departure.", "To address its resource constraints, SEPS expects to add 9 more staff\u2014  5 full-time employees and 4 contract employees\u2014to the 13 it currently has  on board, pending the department\u2019s Customer Advisory Board approval of  funds from its Working Capital Fund. This fund is an administrative  account generally intended to recover operating costs by having the  department charge components fees for common administrative  services\u2014such as financial, telecommunications, and personnel services\u2014 that the department provides to them. DOJ officials were not certain how  all 9 staff would be divided across the training, oversight, technical  security policy reviews, and other functions within SEPS. A SEPS official  said that 3 of the 9 staff are to be allocated to oversight but noted that  while the additional staff would help, they most likely would still not be  enough to implement an effective classification management program.  However, although DOJ includes SEPS in its departmentwide workforce  analysis, that office has not separately determined the optimal level of  resources needed to administer an effective security program. This is an  important first step to resolving its resource constraints and complying  with ISOO\u2019s recommendations.", "In addition, SEPS does not have a strategy that lays out how it can best use  anticipated resources to address the remaining deficiencies ISOO  identified in ways that reduce the most risks to protecting national  security information, such as whether to focus on addressing training,  oversight, or other program gaps first. According to the program manager,  with only 4 staff to cover departmentwide training and oversight issues,  the office had not been able to be more proactive and strategic, achieving  more comprehensive monitoring to prevent problems, and instead had to  be more reactive and address classification concerns as they arose. In  providing technical comments on a draft of the report, DOJ acknowledged  that it has not conducted a formal assessment of the optimal level of  resources SEPS needs to administer the information security program.  DOJ also stated that SEPS identified in budget documents how the   9 additional staff would be allocated to address the remaining deficiencies  identified by ISOO. However, DOJ provided no evidence of SEPS\u2019s strategy  for allocating these additional staff.", "Our previous work notes the importance of having a workforce analysis  and developing a strategy to fill staffing gaps, both of which are  characteristic of best practices followed by high-performing organizations.  In A Model of Strategic Human Capital Management, we highlighted the  importance of identifying current and future staffing needs, including the  appropriate number of employees and the correct mix of skills, for  maximizing the value of employees and managing risk. Also, we have  emphasized that an essential element of effective workforce planning is  aligning human capital strategies to eliminate gaps. We have previously  recommended that specific agencies adopt these practices. For instance,  in a 2001 review of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we  recommended that EPA direct its major program offices to perform  workforce analyses and then focus hiring and recruitment to fill any  identified gaps. Similarly, we recommended in 2003 that the Government  Printing Office complete a workforce analysis to identify gaps in skills and  competencies and develop strategies to address any gaps. SEPS might  benefit from adopting these human capital practices as part of a broad  strategy to respond to ISOO\u2019s recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The FBI Has Begun to Implement All but One of ISOO\u2019s Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["The FBI has begun or completed actions on all but one of ISOO\u2019s  recommendations to correct several deficiencies ISOO identified in the  FBI\u2019s classification management program.

ISOO recommended the guides be updated. One had not been revised for   9 years, even though ISOO\u2019s directive implementing the executive order  governing classified information calls for updates at least every 5 years.  Classification guides are key to helping ensure employees have current,  clear, and consistent guidance to make decisions about what information  needs to be protected and restricted and what information can be released  and shared, according to ISOO. FBI had complied with this  recommendation for most of its guides. Security officials stated that  although it had drafted an update of its primary classification guide,  entitled Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations Classification Guide,  it had not yet been issued because ongoing discussions between the FBI  and DOJ\u2019s Office of Intelligence Policy and Review about various  intelligence-related issues will affect the guide\u2019s content. As of August  2006, the FBI officials did not know when these issues would be resolved.", "ISOO also found that the FBI lacked a guide for how to declassify  documents, as the executive order requires and recommended that the   FBI develop such a guide and submit it to the Interagency Security  Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP) for approval. According to FBI  security officials, the guide has been drafted but not issued because the  bureau was responding to panel comments on the draft. This guide is  important because, among other things, it was to formally establish those  exemptions the FBI could use when reviewing records to comply with the  December 31, 2006, automatic declassification mandate. Delays in issuing  the guide and establishing exemptions make it difficult for FBI to have  time to complete its review because of the volume of records it has to  address, which could be as many as 110 million records, according to  bureau estimates. ISOO noted that the FBI has taken positive steps to try  to meet the date, such as drafting its declassification guide, identifying  information that it could present to ISCAP for exemption from the  automatic declassification requirement, and authorizing bulk  declassification of documents. But even with these initiatives, the bureau  could still have up to 30 million records to review, which is why delays in  issuing the guide and establishing exemptions may hinder completion of  this review. As a result, some information that should remain protected  could be available for public release, although the FBI could still try to  reclassify it, deny release to protect individual privacy rights, or deny  release for other reasons, such as to protect the identity of individuals who  provide intelligence information to the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Updated Training on Classification and Marking Procedures", "paragraphs": ["ISOO reported that although the FBI had some very sound training tools  and to some extent provided excellent training, it was not thorough and  offered consistently across the bureau.

ISOO recommended that the FBI ensure  that all employees with security clearances receive sufficient annual  refresher training on the classification program. In response, FBI security  officials stated that the agency has instituted a security awareness  program that includes the refresher training, which is offered continuously  rather than annually. The training is provided through means such as  posting security tips as well as classification and marking materials on the  FBI\u2019s intranet; having chief security officers distribute security awareness  materials to employees; and providing live presentations and webcasts to  all employees on classifying and marking practices. Although FBI has  made this material available, it acknowledged that it does not have a  system in place to track and ensure that all employees have received the  information because, according to FBI, tracking would be administratively  burdensome considering the methods used to convey the information,  which is not consistent with ISOO\u2019s directive. The directive requires  agencies to maintain records of the training programs offered and  employees\u2019 participation in them.", "ISOO also noted that the FBI had outdated and insufficient training  materials for those staff who are the primary classifiers of information,  known as original classification authorities. ISOO found that the FBI\u2019s  practice of waiting for these classifiers to contact the Security Division  with questions about their responsibilities does not ensure they have a  complete understanding of their role, as well as the executive order and  implementing directives, and that this was critical since these individuals  determine whether information meets the standards of potential damage  to national security and should be classified. ISOO recommended that the  FBI update this training, and the FBI expects to do so but is waiting until  its classification and declassification guides are issued so that it can cover  them in the training. FBI security program managers point out that more  and more, these individuals are making declassification rather than  classification decisions, and have been getting some training on their  responsibilities for these decisions through one-on-one training, electronic  communications, and participation in related training programs.", "In almost half of the 575 classified FBI documents ISOO reviewed, it found  marking errors. For example, ISOO found that portions of 110 documents  (19 percent) appeared to be unnecessarily classified, while another   8 (1 percent) were clearly overclassified. To help eliminate these  discrepancies, ISOO recommended that employees be provided refresher  training on marking requirements and classifiers be trained in the updated  classification guide when implemented. Otherwise, an ISOO official said,  without proper guidance, employees tend to take a conservative approach  and err on the side of classifying information.

DOJ indicated that it is waiting for the results of a  governmentwide working group that will determine what designations  agencies are to use before considering any modifications to how it  manages this type of information.

However, the five DOJ components we reviewed  do not have specific guidance to help employees determine how to apply  their sensitive but unclassified designations. Additionally, our  governmentwide review of agencies\u2019 sensitive but unclassified designation  practices also points to the importance of having formal, written guidance  to give agency personnel a consistent understanding of whether and when  to apply such designations, and we recommended in our March 2006  report that the Office of Management and Budget ensure agencies have  this internal control in place. Written guidance is important because,  according to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, information must be communicated in a suitable form and in  a timely manner to those within an organization who need it to carry out  their responsibilities. Furthermore, on the basis of our previous  recommendations, other federal agencies have taken initiatives to enhance  their guidance for their sensitive but unclassified designation processes.  For example, earlier this year, the Department of Energy agreed with a  recommendation we made to clarify its guidance on this subject and said  that it is also planning ways to explicitly define for its employees what  would be an inappropriate application of the sensitive but unclassified  designations so that information is properly designated and handled.  Similarly, in part because of our past recommendation to the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s Transportation Security Administration, that office  has begun to develop internal guidance that expands its existing  regulations for sensitive security information\u2014a category of sensitive but  unclassified information\u2014by providing personnel with examples of the  types of information that should fall within various categories of sensitive  security information. By taking similar actions, DOJ could reduce the  likelihood of errors and inconsistencies in applying the sensitive but  unclassified designations throughout the department.", "The existing policy guidelines for the five components we reviewed do not  provide employees the level of specificity needed to adequately guide their  decision making on applying the designation. For example, in its policy,  the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) definition of sensitive  information includes any information and materials that are investigative  in nature, critical to the operation and mission of the agency, would  violate a privileged relationship, or have its access restricted by law.  However, the policy provides no explanation, guidance, or examples of the  information that would meet any of these criteria, for instance,  information that could be categorized as critical to DEA\u2019s mission.  Similarly, the FBI\u2019s Intelligence Policy Manual sets forth definitions of  various sensitive but unclassified categories, such as Law Enforcement  Sensitive and For Official Use Only, but does not have specific guidance  for designating documents, such as identifying the criteria for determining  whether text in a document should be Law Enforcement Sensitive  because, for example, it is associated with an ongoing criminal  investigation. Finally, neither DEA nor FBI guidance contains examples of  inappropriate applications of sensitive but unclassified designations.  Without explicit language identifying appropriate and inappropriate use of  the designation, DOJ components cannot be confident that their personnel  are making correct and consistent decisions.", "Moreover, the components in our review use five different sensitive but  unclassified designations, as table 3 shows.", "Within a single DOJ component, employees could be confronted with  making decisions on the sensitive but unclassified designation that might  involve up to four categories, each with its own unique definition and  safeguarding requirements, yet not have specific guidance on the types of  information that merit each designation. For example, an employee at  DEA can designate information Limited Official Use (LOU), Law  Enforcement Sensitive, or DEA Sensitive (DEA-S), and each has different  requirements. DEA requires administrative controls and additional  safeguards for storage and transmission of DEA-S information that is  equivalent to those for classified information. This means that DEA-S  information must be locked, for example, in a General Services  Administration (GSA)-approved security container when not in the  custody of an individual with a need to know that information. The LOU  category, however, carries less stringent handling requirements that do  not, for example, involve storing documents in a GSA-approved locked  cabinet. Consequently, in such an instance, information that would  warrant the DEA-S protection may not be adequately safeguarded from  unintended disclosure. This underscores the need for employees to have  specific guidance and examples to use to be able to clearly determine  which information should be protected under these categories.", "According to DOJ security officials, additional changes affecting the  departmentwide guidance on sensitive but unclassified policies and  procedures have been suspended pending the results of efforts connected  to a December 2005 presidential memorandum. This calls for, among  other things, the development of standardized procedures across the  federal government for designating, marking, and handling sensitive but  unclassified information, in part, to promote effective and efficient use and  sharing of this information. In general, the memorandum requires  executive departments and agencies to inventory and assess their sensitive  but unclassified procedures and determine the underlying authority for  each procedure. For example, it mandated the submission of  recommendations to the President for standardizing sensitive but  unclassified procedures across the federal government for homeland  security, law enforcement, and terrorism information, and the  recommendations are expected by the end of December 2006. Once  governmentwide standards have been established and a final decision is  made on what sensitive but unclassified designations DOJ and its  components will use, it will be important for them to develop specific  guidance for employees that provides them with a clear understanding  about when to apply each designation to ensure information is properly  designated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training and Oversight for Their Designation Programs Are Limited for Selected DOJ Components", "paragraphs": ["Federal internal control standards discuss the need for both training and  continuous program oversight as necessary elements to ensure effective  program implementation.

Although the Criminal Division and DEA offer training on  handling and protecting sensitive but unclassified documents and material  as part of periodic security awareness briefings, this training does not  cover how to decide what information merits the designation. Specifically,  security officials at the Criminal Division reported that the unit\u2019s  classification briefing includes a section on sensitive but unclassified  information. However, this training only provides employees with a  definition of the various categories of information, such as grand jury  information, informant and witness information, and investigative  material, and not specific guidance on how to determine if specific  information qualifies for one of these categories. Similarly, DEA provides  employees computer-based training and briefings but only to convey  information on handling, but not designating, sensitive but unclassified  information. Without such training, employees may be at higher risk of  improperly designating or not designating information as sensitive but  unclassified. We have previously recommended that other agencies  develop training to cover designation of sensitive but unclassified  information, and all have agreed to initiate such training.", "In addition to having limited training programs, none of the components  we reviewed have formally established policies and procedures regarding  how they will monitor employees\u2019 appropriate and consistent application  of sensitive but unclassified designations. Federal internal control  standards call for, among other things, ensuring that ongoing oversight\u2014 such as self-inspections and supervisory reviews\u2014occurs in the course of  normal operations. The lack of such internal controls over sensitive but  unclassified designations increases the potential that different  components could designate the same information differently without  detecting inconsistencies. Some components told us they rely on their  unit\u2019s periodic security compliance reviews to assess how sensitive but  unclassified information is handled and protected. However, some of these  reviews have been conducted at up to 3-year intervals and, according to  DEA security officials, are not designed to verify the accuracy of  employees\u2019 sensitive but unclassified decisions. On the basis of our  previous work, other agencies have acknowledged the role of effective  oversight procedures for the designation process and have taken actions  to implement our recommendations to strengthen their procedures. For  example, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, in  response to our recommendations, have agreed to include oversight  reviews of the sensitive but unclassified process as part of their routine  security oversight assessments. Without similar actions, DOJ does not  have reasonable assurance that the designations are applied accurately  and consistently throughout the department.", "The lack of guidance, training, and oversight is of particular concern in   three of the five components we reviewed because these components do  not limit the number of employees who can designate information as  sensitive but unclassified. ATF and DEA restrict those authorized to make  designations to a limited number of senior level employees. At the other  components, however, any employee at any level is authorized to make  these decisions. For example, at the FBI, any employee or contractor in  the course of performing assigned duties may designate information Law  Enforcement Sensitive. Yet in these components, employees do not have  guides to consult and adequate training to help them make decisions on  which information warrants a sensitive but unclassified designation, and  the agencies do not have processes in place to oversee employee decision  making in these instances.

According to the components, the response process may differ for various  reasons, such as the nature of the request and the requester\u2019s needs.
