The program is unique in its reliance upon the participating communities\u2019 own approaches and strategic plans for improvement. In addition, the program fosters partnerships between a variety of social service and economic resources, including those available through federal and state programs, private and nonprofit organizations, and others. Of the 227 rural communities nationwide that applied to the program, the Secretary of Agriculture, in December 1994, designated three rural areas as EZs and 30 as ECs, primarily on the basis of their strategic plans. Over a 10-year period, both the EZs and the ECs will receive federal assistance through EZ/EC Social Services Block Grants (SSBG) and special tax incentives, technical assistance, and special consideration in many federal competitive grant and loan programs. Each of the EZs will receive $40 million over the 10-year life of the program; each of the ECs will receive about $3 million. Additionally, the businesses located in the EZs are eligible for more tax incentives than the businesses in the ECs. Several proposals have recently been introduced into the Congress to expand or revise the EZ/EC program.", "This report responds to your request that we review selected aspects of the rural EZ/EC program. Specifically, you asked that we (1) estimate the federal funding levels of the rural EZ/EC program over the 10-year life of the program, (2) determine the status of the implementation of the program, (3) identify the difficulties that the communities have encountered in implementing their plans, and (4) examine the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) oversight of the program. We visited all 3 of the rural EZs and 5 of the 30 rural ECs. Additional information about the communities we visited is provided in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress established the EZ/EC program in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66, Aug. 10, 1993). Under the act, the communities that wanted to participate in the program had to (1) meet specific criteria for characteristics such as geographic size and poverty rate and (2) prepare a strategic plan for implementing the program. The act also specified that the Secretary of Agriculture could designate up to 3 rural EZs and 30 rural ECs on the basis of their strategic plans.", "The act also amended title XX of the Social Security Act to authorize the use of the EZ/EC SSBG funds for the program and placed increased authority for funding decision-making with the local EZ/EC governance structures. Historically, the funds from the SSBG program that were allocated to the states could be used only for social service activities, such as programs to assist and feed children. However, under the EZ/EC program, the act expanded the permissible uses of the SSBG\u2019s funds by allowing their use for such activities as purchasing or improving land and facilities or for providing cash payments to individuals for medical care.", "In addition to the EZ/EC SSBG funds, all of the designated communities are expected to receive several types of federal assistance. The businesses located in the EZs and the ECs are eligible for low-interest loans, resulting from the tax-exempt bonds issued by the state or local governmental unit, to be used to provide facilities and land for the businesses in the communities. In addition, the businesses located within EZs (1) are eligible to receive tax credits on the wages paid to the employees who live and work in the EZ and (2) may deduct higher levels of depreciation expenses. A number of federal departments and agencies also made a commitment to give all EZs and ECs special consideration in the competitions for funds from many other federal programs and to work cooperatively with them in overcoming regulatory impediments.", "The federal assistance received by the EZs and ECs must be spent in accordance with the communities\u2019 strategic plans. These plans outline how the communities would achieve their goals, including ensuring the active participation of the members of the community, the local private and nonprofit entities, and the federal, state, and local governments. The EZs\u2019 and ECs\u2019 progress in achieving their goals is to be based on the performance benchmarks established by the communities, not on the amount of federal money spent. These benchmarks explain in some detail how the locality intends to achieve its goals. The benchmark document, which becomes a part of the overall plan, includes the specific projects that the EZ or EC will undertake and timelines showing when the projects will be instituted or completed. The benchmark document, which generally looks ahead 2 years, requires continuous review and modifications to accommodate the changes in the community\u2019s needs as well as scheduling problems. These benchmark projects are to serve the EZs and ECs, as well as USDA, as an important management tool and provide the primary basis for evaluating the progress being made.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), USDA, and the states play key roles in administering the program. HHS makes grants to the states, and the designated state agency obligates the funds to the EZs and ECs as it receives, reviews, and approves requests from them to draw down funds for a particular benchmark project. In addition, the state must ensure that the requested expenditure is allowable under the state\u2019s standards. USDA, as the lead federal agency for the rural EZ/EC program, is responsible for helping the rural EZs and ECs achieve their goals by evaluating their progress and providing technical assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Funding for the Rural EZ/EC Program Is Likely to Total Over $1 Billion", "paragraphs": ["The federal funds invested in the rural EZ/EC program, including loans, grants, and forgone tax revenues, will far exceed the $208 million in EZ/EC SSBG funds allocated to the program. In fact, we estimate that federal funds exceeding $1 billion will be invested in the program over its 10-year life. This estimate includes the EZ/EC SSBG funds, plus an estimated $428 million from tax incentives and about $600 million from USDA\u2019s loan and grant programs. This $1 billion estimate does not include the other significant sources of investments in the program that will be provided by other federal agencies. Estimates from these sources were not available.

The first two, available only to EZs, are (1) the Empowerment Zone Employment Credit, which provides qualified employers with a tax credit of up to $3,000 for each employee who lives and works in the EZ, and (2) the Empowerment Zone Expensing Allowance, which allows a qualified business to take a special depreciation deduction of up to $20,000 (for an annual total of up to $37,500) for equipment purchases each year. The third incentive, available to both the EZs and the ECs, is the Enterprise Zone Facility Bond, which provides up to $3 million in tax-exempt bond financing to qualified businesses for buildings or equipment.", "Using the data and assumptions from the Internal Revenue Service, we estimate that the cost of the EZ/EC tax incentives in rural areas will be about $428 million over the 10-year period. The EZs\u2019 employment credit will account for $406.5 million of that total; the facility bonds and the expensing allowances will make up the remainder at $4.3 million and $17.2 million, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Information Is Available on the Extent of Preferential Treatment", "paragraphs": ["USDA, HHS, and 13 other federal agencies have agreed to give special consideration to eligible EZ/EC applicants by giving them preferential treatment for funds from the agencies\u2019 existing funding sources over the life of the program. Most federal agencies had not estimated the amount of support they expect to invest in the rural EZs and ECs over the 10-year life of the program. USDA, however, indicated that it alone intends to provide about $246 million to rural EZs and ECs over the first 4 years through existing funding sources such as its Rural Business Enterprise Grant program and the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant programs. If this funding level is maintained over the 10-year life of the program, an assumption that USDA officials consider a reasonable expectation, USDA will provide about $600 million to EZ/EC communities. USDA officials noted that these funds, as well as those from the other agencies that have pledged to provide special consideration to EZ/ECs, represent existing appropriations that would be expended\u2014not new moneys.", "In addition to the funds provided by federal agencies, the rural EZs and ECs are expected to obtain assistance from state, local, and private sources. Some EZs and ECs are using the EZ/EC SSBG funds as seed money to attract even larger amounts from nonfederal sources, such as foundations. USDA provided data showing that for the 3 EZs and 25 of the ECs, the communities were receiving more than one dollar from their state and local governments and from private and nonprofit organizations for every dollar of EZ/EC SSBG funds received. To the extent that the loans are repaid and that new jobs result in increased tax revenues and reduced welfare payments, the federal investment in the rural EZ/EC program will be offset."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EZs and ECs Vary in Their Progress Toward Implementing the Program", "paragraphs": ["The 33 EZs and ECs have established the structures and procedures needed to implement their strategic plans.

Overall, progress on these projects has varied widely."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most EZs and ECs Have Created the Basic Foundation for Managing Development", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA officials, all communities have taken the initial necessary actions to manage and begin implementing their strategic plans, such as establishing a board structure and basic operating principles. These actions had to be formally agreed upon by the community, the state, and USDA in a memorandum of agreement. In order to complete a memorandum of agreement, the communities had to, among other things, establish their benchmarks and develop a budget for the first 2 years of implementation; create the bylaws and/or articles of incorporation for the group, known as the lead entity, that will manage the EZ or EC program; and establish the EZ\u2019s or EC\u2019s board structure. In addition, USDA reviewed the documents prepared by the lead entities to ensure that they had a policy to prevent conflicts of interest and strategies for ensuring broad participation within the community.", "We visited all three EZs and found that they were generally well-organized to manage the implementation of their strategic plans. For example, while the geographical boundaries of all of the EZs cut across several local government boundaries, such as county lines, they had all developed mechanisms for overcoming the potential problems in having the EZ work with more than one political entity. One EZ that spanned parts of four counties created four subzone boards to overcome the political divisions inherent in its organization. These subzones consider the communities\u2019 proposals for implementing the benchmark projects that originate in their area. The proposals approved at the subzone level are then considered by the EZ\u2019s full board. As of June 1996, nearly 1 year after the memorandum of agreement, the EZ reported some progress toward 45 of the 49 projects serving the subzones. Some of these projects served several subzones, while others served only one.", "Although the EZs appear to be well organized, two of the ECs that we visited were experiencing problems. For example, at one EC we visited, the board members were in such disagreement with the lead entity over the control of the EC funds that little business has been conducted, and the program has not been moving forward. At another EC, the state agency found that the board members were, among other things, submitting applications for projects that would benefit them financially."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EZs and ECs Vary in Implementing Their Benchmark Projects", "paragraphs": ["USDA requires EZs and ECs to report periodically on the progress they are making toward implementing the benchmark projects.

Progress, by these measures, varied widely among the 14 communities we examined. For example, one community reported that it had made at least some progress toward implementing all of the benchmark projects scheduled to start prior to December 1996 and that one project had been completed. On the other hand, two communities reported that either no progress had been made on projects or that they had not finished any of the projects scheduled for completion prior to December 1996.

The difficulties were the short time frame allowed for applying to the program and the misinformation provided by officials at USDA headquarters about the program\u2019s basic operations. While these difficulties have been or are in the process of being resolved, two other issues continue to be of concern. These issues are a lack of clarity about which standards the communities should follow for construction projects when using EZ/EC SSBG funds and the disparity between HHS\u2019 verbal guidance and written guidance to the states on their responsibilities for releasing the EZ/EC SSBG funds to the communities for the EZ/EC program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Short Time Frames Caused Organizational and Planning Concerns for Communities", "paragraphs": ["Officials at each of the rural EZs and ECs we visited commented that the period for preparing an application for the EZ or EC designation was too short for the amount of work required. The communities applying for the program had 5-1/2 months after the President announced the program to submit an application. During that time, they had to achieve grass-roots involvement, gain consensus on the needs and vision of the community, elect a board of directors, produce a strategic plan, and prepare to begin operating. These tasks were particularly difficult to carry out in rural areas that often (1) did not have organized coalitions or the expertise available to articulate a vision and develop a complex strategic plan and (2) are spread out over a large geographical area, which makes putting together all parts of the application more difficult.", "While the communities met their application deadlines, some officials believe that a longer period to organize would have allowed them to better galvanize the public\u2019s support and involvement and that, in some instances, they would have been better able to identify their needs and establish appropriate goals.", "USDA and HHS officials acknowledged that the communities faced short time frames. Some USDA officials stated that the short time frames required that the rural communities act quickly both to generate local involvement and to create the vision and strategic plan required to meet the application deadline. They noted that the federal agencies involved faced organizational pressures as well. The EZ/EC program\u2019s timetable required the federal agencies to develop their coordination strategy, perform detailed planning, hire and train staff, and begin operating the program within the 16 months between the passage of the legislation and the designation of the EZs and the ECs.", "HHS and USDA officials generally agreed that, should a second round of EZs and ECs be authorized, it may be beneficial to allow the communities a somewhat longer time to apply in order to facilitate broader public involvement and a fuller consideration of the vision and the steps needed to accomplish it. Furthermore, some officials said that, if a second round is authorized, the federal government may need to provide more guidance on how to prepare the application documents to ensure a somewhat greater uniformity than they had experienced in the current program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Misstatements by USDA Officials Contributed to Implementation Problems", "paragraphs": ["At seven of the eight rural EZs and ECs we visited, officials noted that erroneous information, provided primarily by officials from USDA headquarters at meetings around the nation, caused misunderstandings about the operations of the EZ/EC program. At some of the meetings, the federal headquarters officials said that the EZs and ECs would receive the EZ/EC SSBG funds directly. Two of the EZs expected to receive the total amount of the EZ/EC SSBG funds\u2014$40 million\u2014in two consecutive annual payments, while some ECs believed that they would receive their total payment of about $2.9 million shortly after they were selected. In fact, as we discussed earlier, the communities are receiving their funding incrementally through the state agency as needed to pay for benchmark activities. Furthermore, some communities were told, incorrectly, that they did not have to get approval from any federal or state entity to use the funds for projects that were consistent with the strategic plan.", "The incorrect information provided by USDA officials caused difficulties for several state agencies and rural communities. For example, one EC had to revise its plan when it learned how the funds were actually to be distributed. The community had planned to obtain the lump-sum payment, put it into an interest-bearing account, and use the interest, which would have been considerable, to fund some part of certain projects. Since no lump sum was made available, the EC revamped its plan to obtain alternative sources of funding for some of its projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Not Provided Clear Guidance on the Applicability of Federal Standards", "paragraphs": ["Several of the EZs and ECs that we visited have encountered some difficulty in sorting out which federal standards apply to certain types of projects financed with EZ/EC SSBG funds.

However, the act did not specify any standards for these new allowable uses. As a result, the communities have been deciding for themselves which construction standards they will follow.", "The communities have taken different approaches to address this difficulty. For example, officials at one EZ seeking to build a water system told us that they were unable to get guidance from HHS and decided to follow the environmental regulations that they considered most appropriate\u2014those governing the use of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Community Development Block Grant program\u2014for that project and for any other project that might involve environmental issues. Faced with a similar dilemma, another EZ took a different approach, deciding to follow the environmental regulations associated with the primary funding source for a given project.", "Some rural EZ officials seeking clarification on this issue contacted HHS, which oversees the EZ/EC SSBG funds. According to these officials, HHS did not indicate what construction standards should be used. Consequently, the community officials have used their best judgment on how to proceed with specific projects and activities. Some EZ officials added that they are concerned that they may be legally liable if they choose to follow an incorrect standard and may have to replace such things as improperly sized water or sewer pipes, thereby incurring considerable costs and causing disruption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019 Verbal Instructions to the States on Administering EZ/EC SSBG Funds Appear to Conflict With HHS\u2019 Regulations", "paragraphs": ["According to the HHS regulations and the Terms and Conditions of the EZ/EC program, the financial standards that the states are to apply in administering the EZ/EC SSBG funds are the standards that they use for expending their own state funds. However, officials in three of the states we visited told us that HHS program officials had verbally appealed to them to be flexible in applying their standards.", "This conflicting guidance has led to disagreements between some of the state agencies and the EZs and ECs over who has oversight responsibility. For example, when one EC requested a drawdown of funds for expenses that included liquor, the state agency disallowed payment for the liquor. The state agency argued that Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, the standard adopted by the state, did not allow expenditures of federal funds for liquor. State agency officials told us that HHS verbally asked the state agency to be flexible and allow the expenditure and advised them not to worry about having to repay the expenditure at a later date. The state agency officials told us that they wanted to cooperate with HHS in the EZ/EC program, but they also wanted the state to comply with its own regulations, including Circular A-87. The state ultimately disallowed the expenditure.", "In another state, the EZ submitted 22 project proposals to the state agency for its review prior to a formal request to draw down funds.

We believe the commitment and actions outlined by USDA to address the recommendations in our report go a long way toward correcting the problems we noted concerning the need to upgrade the Office of Community Development\u2019s monitoring system. 4. We have modified our report to include USDA\u2019s concurrence that all parties agreed that the initial time frames permitting communities to apply for EZ or EC status were inadequate. 5. We have deleted the references to supplantation in the report. A discussion of supplantation was not needed to illustrate our concern about the possible conflicts between verbal instructions and written regulations on administering EZ/EC SSBG funds. 6. We have added statements about USDA headquarters staff members\u2019 visits to rural EZs and ECs and about the responsibilities of the state coordinators. 7. We agree with USDA that situations such as the one portrayed in our report will arise. This is precisely the reason why we believe that USDA needs a strong oversight capability, i.e., one that will identify problems early on and help focus the assistance, training, and consultation needed to help the EZs and ECs resolve the problems. 8. We have clarified the language to recognize that the report\u2019s estimates of total EZ/EC funding includes funds that would not represent additional appropriations but, rather, a special targeting of appropriations that would have been made in any case in order to support rural communities under the various programs of the participating agencies. We have also added language to the report which notes that there may be some offsetting benefits to the government, such as increased tax revenues, resulting from the creation of new jobs.
