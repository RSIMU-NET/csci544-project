The ATC component of this program, which is designed to replace aging equipment and accommodate predicted growth in air traffic, has had difficulty for more than two decades in meeting cost, schedule, and performance targets. The performance-based Air Traffic Organization (ATO) was created in February 2004 to improve the management of the modernization effort. On October 7, 2004, GAO hosted a panel to discuss attempts to address the ATC modernization program's persistent problems. Participants discussed the factors that they believed have affected FAA's ability to acquire new ATC systems. Participants also identified steps that FAA's ATO could take in the short term to address these factors, as well as longer term steps that could be taken to improve the modernization program's chances of success and help the ATO achieve its mission. The participants included domestic and foreign aviation experts from industry, government, private think tanks, and academia. They are recognized for their expertise in aviation safety, economics, and engineering; transportation research and policy; and government and private-sector management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["What Participants Said: Overall, the participants identified cultural, technical, and budgetary factors that, in their view, have affected the progress of ATC modernization. To address these factors, they proposed what one participant termed a \"two-pronged\" approach--simultaneously taking care of \"the here and now\" and building a \"viable future\" for the ATO. Cultural and Technical Factors Have Impeded ATC Modernization: According to participants, the key cultural factor impeding modernization has been resistance to change. Such resistance is a characteristic of FAA personnel at all levels, participants said, and management, in the experience of some, is more resistant than employees who may fear that new technologies will threaten their jobs. The key technical factor affecting modernization, participants said, has been a shortfall in the technical expertise needed to design, develop, or manage complex air traffic systems. Without the technical proficiency to \"scrub\" project proposals for potential problems early and to oversee the contractors who implement its modernization projects, they said, FAA has to rely on the contractors, whose interests differ from its own. Budgetary Factors Have Constrained ATC Modernization: The most immediate budgetary constraint, participants said, is the multibillion-dollar shortfall that FAA is projecting between available revenues and modernization needs over the next 4 years. Participants also identified features of the federal budget process as constraints, noting, for example, that the federal budget cycle is too long and inflexible to meet the needs of a dynamic ATC system that requires much more managerial freedom and short-term decision making. They further noted that the budget process is influenced by the political process, and that the funding for capital projects is sometimes spread out over so many years that technologies are out of date by the time they are deployed. Annual funding uncertainties discourage strategic and capital planning, they said, and the budget fails to show priorities and relationships among proposed investments. Short-term and Longer Term Changes Could Promote Success: Participants suggested that the ATO could facilitate cultural transformation by creating a vision and strategy that would unite stakeholders and by assembling project teams with different skills and interests whose members could forge common organizational interests by working together to solve common technology development problems. To help offset technical inadequacies, the participants suggested that the ATO could consult an advisory board, identify and consider purchasing needed technologies that other countries have developed, and hire more skilled engineers to provide in-house expertise. To address budgetary constraints, participants suggested, among other short-term steps, reducing spending to match revenues and developing strategies for presenting FAA's budget request more clearly to Congress. Longer term suggestions included giving the ATO the predictable funding and decision-making authority it needs to carry out a \"sensible\" capital investment plan."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1981, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began what it initially  envisioned as a 10-year modernization program to upgrade and replace the  national airspace system\u2019s (NAS) facilities and equipment to meet  projected increases in traffic volumes, enhance the system\u2019s margin of  safety, and increase the efficiency of the air traffic control (ATC) system\u2014a  principal component of the NAS. Through the ATC component of this  modernization program, FAA planned to acquire a vast network of radar,  navigation, communications, and information processing systems that  would enhance aviation safety and accommodate predicted growth in air  traffic in the NAS. However, the program has proved to be more  challenging than anticipated, in terms of both technology and management,  and FAA\u2019s efforts to achieve desired improvements in performance have  typically taken longer and cost more than anticipated. As a result, planned  improvements in safety and capacity have been delayed, and the costs,  both of maintaining existing technologies and of replacing outdated ATC  systems and infrastructure, have grown. FAA no longer sees its  modernization program as a multiyear initiative with a defined end; rather,  it now sees the program as an ongoing investment in technological  advances designed to improve aviation safety and capacity. To date, FAA  has spent $43.5 billion on NAS modernization, and it expects to spend an  additional $9.6 billion through 2009, primarily to upgrade and replace ATC  facilities and equipment. Of the $43.5 billion spent thus far, about $25.1  billion, or 58 percent, has gone to ATC upgrades and replacements,  according to FAA.", "To improve FAA\u2019s management of the modernization program, Congress, in  1995, gave the agency acquisition and human capital flexibilities, which  FAA has largely implemented. According to our most recent work, FAA  has made important progress and improvements in its acquisition of major  systems, but the modernization program remains challenging and some  problems have persisted. In 2000, Congress and the administration took  further steps to improve the modernization program\u2019s management.  Through legislation and an executive order, they laid the foundation for a  new, three-component structure, including an oversight body, called the Air  Traffic Services Subcommittee; a Chief Operating Officer; and the Air  Traffic Organization (ATO), a performance-based organization to manage  FAA\u2019s ATC investments and operations. In February 2004, FAA merged its  Office of Air Traffic Services, Office of Research and Acquisitions, and Free  Flight Program Office to create the ATO. The new organizational structure  sought to break some of the existing \u201cstovepipes\u201d and bring together the  key organizational units responsible for, among other things, ATC  modernization.", "The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, temporarily reduced airport  congestion, but a number of factors\u2014including a drop in air traffic in the  years following the attacks, the economic slowdown, and an increase in  businesses\u2019 use of low-cost carriers\u2014led to a significant decline in airline  ticket tax receipts and in the Aviation Trust Fund, where the receipts are  deposited. Today, air traffic has rebounded to near pre-September 11 levels  and congestion is increasing, but the Aviation Trust Fund balance appears  to be smaller than expected. For fiscal year 2005, for example, FAA  reduced its original estimate of this fund balance by nearly $3.5 billion, and  the agency is reviewing its estimates for future years.", "The House Committees on Government Reform and Transportation and  Infrastructure asked us to conduct a comprehensive review of the NAS  modernization program\u2019s ATC modernization effort, the performance-based  organizational initiatives resulting in the creation of the ATO, and the  funding challenges that the changed budget situation poses for the  modernization program. As part of our efforts to respond to the  committees\u2019 request, which we plan to address through two separate  ongoing studies, we convened a panel of international aviation experts and  asked them the following questions:     What factors have affected the schedule, cost, and performance of FAA\u2019s  ATC modernization program, and what steps could the ATO take in the  short term to address these factors?", "How have federal budget constraints affected ATC modernization, and  what steps could the ATO take in the short term to address these  constraints?", "What steps could FAA take in the longer term to improve the  modernization program\u2019s chances of success and help the ATO achieve  its mission?", "This report summarizes the panelists\u2019 responses to these and related  questions that arose during the panel discussions.", "The panel consisted of foreign and domestic aviation experts from industry,  government, private think tanks, and academia.

As such, it  brought together generalists, rather than specialists, to address broad  themes and consider how to organize a more comprehensive approach.  Because our scope was limited, we could not include a large number of  leading experts, institutions, and networks involved in specialized efforts.  Furthermore, although many points of view were represented, the panel  was not representative of all potential stakeholders.", "Second, even though we, in cooperation with the National Academies,  conducted preliminary research and heard from national experts in their  fields, a day\u2019s conversation cannot represent the current practice in this  vast arena.

A government  organization is insulated from the economic pressures that the private  sector faces, one of the panelists indicated. In his view, federal employees  do not have the firsthand experience with layoffs and business failures to  understand, as private aviation industry employees do, why improvements  to the ATC system\u2019s efficiency are needed to help revitalize the struggling  aviation industry.", "Other panelists emphasized the reluctance of management to change.  According to a panelist with experience in restructuring a foreign air traffic  organization, the senior and middle managers could not or would not  adjust to the change and had to be let go within the first 2 years. The other  employees also had difficulty adjusting and were still adjusting in some  respects, he said, but getting management on the right page was the real  challenge. Another panelist emphasized that cultural change starts at the  top and questioned why the ATO\u2019s new COO had, according to the  panelist\u2019s count, replaced only two top managers in the ATO and simply  reassigned other managers. Still another panelist suggested that cultural  change within the ATO alone would not be sufficient to ensure the ATO\u2019s  success, because so much of the ATO\u2019s fate depends on other  organizations, including FAA, DOT, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), and Congress.", "A number of panelists described the air traffic controllers\u2019 union as also  resistant to change. According to one panelist, for example, the union  delayed the adoption of technologies such as the User Request Evaluation  Tool (URET) because some controllers saw them as a threat to its  membership. Another panelist cited the union\u2019s long-term opposition to  the implementation of a software program that tracks productivity\u2014a key  measure for a performance-based organization. The union is \u201cvery  political,\u201d several panelists asserted, and one panelist charged that it was  \u201chindering the progress\u201d of a performance-based organization.", "Resistance to change can be an issue outside FAA as well as within it,  panelists noted. For example, one panelist questioned how much support  the ATO was getting from DOT, OMB, and congressional committees for  changing \u201csome extremely entrenched political fiefdoms.\u201d Another panelist  said that he had found the congressional authorizing committees amenable  to changes, but the appropriators liked things the way they were."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Panelists Suggested Steps That the ATO Could Take in the Short Term to Address Cultural Impediments to Modernization", "paragraphs": ["what is expected of them, how they fit into the strategy, and what the  vision is for their organization.", "In addition to having a vision, another panelist said, it is important for  the ATO to tie that vision to the user constituency, not confine it to the  agency. FAA cannot do everything alone from the inside, because  airplanes and airports, for example, need to be equipped with the  technologies that will help realize the vision.", "Employing a team concept could help overcome resistance to the  implementation of new technologies, according to another panelist.  Putting engineers, finance people, controllers, and electronic  technologists together, all on the same team, he said, could unite them  as they moved through the stages of implementation. Therefore, when  the time comes to field a technology, the focus would be on getting it up  and running and operating safely\u2014not, the panelist implied, on  obstructing its implementation because it might threaten jobs.", "A change in management\u2019s approach could go a long way toward  overcoming controllers\u2019 and other employees\u2019 resistance to change, one  panelist noted. One foreign air traffic organization changed its whole  approach to the unions and the staff, started talking to them as people,  and began executing \u201cparticipative working\u201d programs, according to the  panelist. Union representatives and managers take the same courses  together and address issues of affordability together, he said, and, as a  result, controllers\u2019 pay has increased, costs have dropped, and  productivity has risen. The key to these positive results, he said, is  psychological change\u2014managers have stopped seeing employees as a  problem and have started to see them as part of the solution.", "According to other panelists, however, people find it very difficult to  change, and the only way to bring about a cultural transformation is to  replace those who resist change, either by allowing them to retire or by  hiring others to take their places. In the corporate world, one panelist  observed, a new executive brings in a new management team to support  a cultural turnaround. The new team is then loyal to the new executive.  In the view of this panelist, the COO\u2019s hiring of only two new managers  and reassignment of other managers would not be sufficient to turn the  ATO\u2019s culture around.

He also  noted that FAA plans to train or hire people with needed skills to address  shortfalls in technical expertise. The following summarizes some of his  key observations on FAA\u2019s culture and provides additional information  from previous GAO reports and work in progress on how FAA is  addressing some of the cultural and technical factors panelists identified  as affecting ATC modernization: Recognizing that cultural factors can play a critical role in an  organization\u2019s success, the ATO has initiated organizational changes  that are designed to create a foundation for cultural change and deliver  benefits to customers efficiently. For example, the ATO  established collaborative teams of technical experts and ATC system   reorganized air traffic services and the research and acquisition  organization along functional lines of business to bring stakeholders  together and integrate goals, as well as reward cooperation by linking  investments to operations;    reduced layers of management from 11 to 7 to help address the  hierarchical nature of the organization; and  conducted an organizationwide activity value analysis to determine  the full range of activities that ATO headquarters is engaged in, the  value customers place on those activities, and the potential for  conducting any of those activities more effectively and efficiently. indicating a desire to improve the flow of information within the agency  by sending a large number of detailed e-mails in response to a call for  recommendations to improve internal communications.", "In the past, according to the ATO\u2019s COO, FAA\u2019s management culture was  \u201cintensely hierarchical, risk averse,\u201d and \u201creactionary.\u201d But now, he  said, FAA is attempting to foster \u201cresults-focused, proactive and  innovative behavior.\u201d Changing the agency\u2019s leadership model is also  designed, he said, to replace a \u201cpersonality-driven culture\u201d with a  sustainable, stable, viable organization that can make rational decisions  that transcend changes in political leadership.", "The ATO is trying to better align FAA\u2019s priorities and stakeholders\u2019  interests by developing a strategy map that captures the outputs desired  by the ATO\u2019s owners and customers, along with the outputs that must be  achieved. Called the Strategic Management Process, this effort borrows  heavily from a private-sector model and uses the ATO\u2019s strategic goals  and objectives to drive investment decisions. According to FAA, the  strategy map will enable owners and customers to clearly understand  both the services that the ATO is providing and the effects of products in  development on those services. As a result, FAA says, future budgetary  conversations will revolve around the desired level of service, instead of  focusing on a product, as past discussions typically did. According to  FAA, the Strategic Management Process will ensure linkage between  FAA\u2019s operating and capital budgets.", "To become a \u201cperformance-based organization\u201d and identify customer  groups and their service needs, the ATO created \u201cvalue-based\u201d  performance metrics; that is, it defined its performance in terms of  customers\u2019 needs and connected efforts to satisfy those needs with cost.  Ultimately, the ATO wants to know how much every unit of output costs  so that it can allocate and compare costs and measure productivity.  Thus, each organizational unit and facility is developing applicable  metrics for performance so that the ATO can compare costs, identify  factors that affect costs, and use this information to improve  performance. For example, each en route facility is determining its  hourly cost to control flights. The ATO can then compare and analyze  these costs to identify positive and negative factors affecting  performance and productivity. plan is a response to a congressional mandate, based on a  recommendation we made in 2002, that FAA develop a plan for  addressing an impending wave of controller retirements and deal with  productivity issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Panelists Said Funding Shortfall and Features of the Federal Budget Process Affect ATC Modernization and Suggested Short-term Steps to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["The panelists identified and discussed the impact of funding constraints  and the federal budget process on ATC modernization.

They said, for example,  that the ATO could pursue procedural and regulatory changes that would  take advantage of existing technologies to increase capacity, pilot test  contracts with the private sector to provide certain air traffic services, and  obtain information on technologies and procedures developed in other  countries that could be used in the United States.", "Regulatory and Procedural Changes Could Allow the Use of  Existing Technologies to Enhance Capacity and Efficiency Several panelists discussed the potential benefits of a more widespread use  of a concept called area navigation (RNAV), which allows operators of  properly equipped aircraft to use onboard navigation capabilities to fly  desired flight paths without requiring direct flight over ground-based  navigation aids. This provides for more direct routing, avoiding suboptimal  routes prescribed by conventional \u201chighways in the sky\u201d that are defined by  point-to-point flying over ground-based navigation aids. The RNAV concept  and a major new method for exploiting it, called required navigation  performance (RNP), permit flight in any airspace as long as aircraft have  been certified to meet the required accuracy level for navigation  performance. RNAV and RNP hold promise for saving system users time  and money\u2014largely by reducing flight times and fuel consumption by  allowing users to fly shorter routes or avoid bad weather. In addition, RNAV  and RNP could potentially increase the capacity of the ATC system to  handle air traffic by reducing the required distance (separation) between  aircraft equipped with advanced navigation capabilities if the aircraft can  safely operate closer to one another than FAA\u2019s regulations currently allow. able to use these capabilities to their full potential in the United States  because FAA has not approved procedures for its use. However, the airlines  are \u201ccrying for\u201d FAA to approve RNP, one of the panelists said, because  aircraft equipped with RNP capabilities could then fly alternative rolling,  moving routes to avoid weather delays. Service would improve for  travelers, and the airlines would avoid the substantial costs of delays, he  said. Implementing RNP could also eventually lower the ATO\u2019s costs,  another panelist said, since RNP does not require any ground equipment.", "RNP technologies have been installed on larger aircraft for so long that  some aircraft equipped with the technologies have already been retired to  the desert, one panelist said. In addition, pilots have been trained to use the  technologies, and the technologies are already being used in some other  countries, including Canada, where a private airline company (West Jet)  developed implementation procedures in collaboration with the Canadian  ATC regulatory agency and the Canadian air traffic management  organization.", "As a first step toward obtaining FAA\u2019s approval of procedures for using  RNP, a panelist said, the ATO could make policy announcements to set a  tone and direction. These announcements would enlist the user  community\u2019s support at little or no cost to the ATO, give the ATO an early  success, and help tie customers to the ATO\u2019s mission. However, he also  cautioned, it would be important for FAA to implement RNP in a way that  did not \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d general aviation interests and regional carriers  whose aircraft are not already equipped with RNP technologies.", "Two panelists expressed concerns about the government\u2019s approach to  regulating the use of onboard navigation equipment and the associated  procedures needed to implement RNP. According to one of these panelists,  FAA has \u201cthe wrong conceptual framework\u201d for developing regulations to  implement new procedures. Its current approach is disproportionate, he  said, because it establishes the same safety standards for aircraft of all  sizes. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep treating airplanes that need 100 cubic miles of  airspace the same from a cost and benefit point of view as airplanes that  need a quarter cubic mile of airspace,\u201d he said. In his view, FAA needs to  revise its approach to assessing and balancing risks. He maintained that the  role of regulatory management on the evolution of the ATC system has  been underestimated and called for significant investment in understanding  risk management.", "The other panelist who expressed concerns about the government\u2019s  regulatory approach argued that navigational technology is evolving and  shifting from ground-based to cockpit-based systems. He maintained that  \u201cyou\u2019ve got to get aircraft closer and closer together to be able to increase  capacity,\u201d and said that the government should allow the ATO to change its  policies on aircraft separation to permit \u201cthe technology that exists on  airplanes today to do the job.\u201d He suggested that the private sector could  assume the cost of capitalizing the equipment, but \u201cthe government\u2019s got to  allow that technology to be used, and it hasn\u2019t.\u201d", "Although one panelist emphasized the importance of conducting thorough  technical evaluations of RNP to identify any roadblocks to its use, the  panelists generally considered it a highly promising, low-cost option for the  ATO to improve service.

The panelists, who generally assumed that the  private sector could provide flight service station services and other air  traffic services more efficiently than the government, suggested that if  contracting for flight service station services proved to be effective, FAA  could contract for other air traffic services, such as oceanic, night, en  route, or airways facilities services. The A-76 process would then serve not  only as a way of saving money but also as \u201ca pilot program for how things  could get done,\u201d one panelist said.

A shared vision is crucial for a globally based air traffic system,  one panelist said. If every country or continent had its own technical  standards\u2014a North American switch, a European switch, a South  American switch, and an Australian switch, for example\u2014an international  system could not function effectively.", "The following provides additional information from the ATO\u2019s COO and  from previous GAO reports and work in progress on how FAA is  addressing some of the funding shortfalls and features of the federal  budget process that panelists identified as affecting ATC modernization:  The ATO\u2019s COO believes that good financial management means linking  FAA\u2019s capital and operating budgets. Previously, FAA developed separate  capital (Facilities and Equipment) and operating (Operations) budgets.  But the ATO recognizes that capital expenditures directly affect  operating costs over time, and therefore the two budgets must be  developed together. Creating this linkage is important for the ATO to  respond to concerns expressed by its owners and customers as well as to  address internal issues, such as training, staffing, pay disparities, and  infrastructure. Using the Strategic Management Process to drive budget  decisions will help to ensure the establishment and maintenance of a  linkage between the capital and operating budgets. financial management systems it has been putting in place. As steps  toward that goal, the ATO expects everyone to learn the difference between  cost and cash flow and get a better handle on unit costs as better cost  accounting data become available. To gain a more complete  understanding of its costs, FAA is revising its cost accounting practices  and changing from a cash flow to a total cost business model for the ATO,  and the ATO is developing management training in cost accounting and  budgeting. Moreover, FAA plans to finish putting a new cost accounting  system in place by 2006 that will allow it to assign, track, and better  control costs.", "In the fall of 2004, FAA updated its cost estimates in light of OMB\u2019s  revenue projections for the next 4 years and arrived at a cumulative  shortfall for the period of $5 billion for the operating budget and $3.2  billion for the capital budget. According to FAA, a business plan that the  ATO was preparing at that time will show, when completed, how large a  funding gap the ATO faces and how far it will have to go to address that  gap. Whatever the exact size of the gap may be, FAA says that it is  prepared to identify and eliminate redundancies in the NAS and to  review its long-term ATC modernization priorities.", "FAA has already taken some steps to control the costs of ATC  modernization. For example, it has adopted the phased approach to  implementing new ATC systems that it used under Free Flight Phase 1,  called \u201cbuild a little, test a little.\u201d This approach relies on the early and  ongoing investment of stakeholders, who review the progress of new  projects regularly and identify critical omissions and \u201cno go\u201d items that  would prevent a system from operating as intended. Reviews of three  projects with cost, schedule, and performance issues that our reports had  identified\u2014the Local Area Augmentation System, Controller-Pilot Data  Link Communications, and Next-Generation Air-to-Ground  Communications System\u2014led FAA to reduce the funding for them in  FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget request. The ATO says it plans to continue  this phased approach to acquiring new systems. customers that do equip. Now, during the first phase, FAA is  implementing the redesign at very high altitudes. In January 2005, FAA  doubled the airspace routes between 29,000 feet and 41,000 feet by  spacing aircraft 1,000 feet apart instead of 2,000 feet. The procedure,  invisible to passengers, is called Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum  and is expected to save airlines $400 million in fuel costs during the first  year. As technology allows, FAA says, more flight altitude levels will be  added. Currently, FAA is implementing a number of improvements to  airspace and procedures using RNP.

Another issue that would have to be worked out, is how the common costs  of air traffic services (e.g., the costs of activities in the ATC system  operated by the Department of the Air Force) should be allocated\u2014 whether users should pay only for the incremental costs of the services  they use, as most users would argue, or whether some cross-subsidies  should continue. Another panelist pointed out that implementing a user fee  alone would not guarantee efficiency, because the air traffic services  provider could simply raise the fee when costs increased and the users  would have to pay, since the service is a monopoly.
