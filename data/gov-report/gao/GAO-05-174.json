Further, a congressional commission reported in 2002 that investment in affordable housing is decreasing, although the elderly population is expected to increase. A number of federal housing programs provide assistance, including rent subsidies, mortgage insurance, and loans and grants for the purchase or repair of homes, to low-income renters and homeowners. These programs are administered primarily by HUD or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). GAO was asked to determine the extent to which federal housing programs provide benefits to elderly households, summarize information on the programs' effectiveness in assisting the elderly and supportive services, and determine how HUD and USDA avoid overlap and duplication in their programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A total of 23 federal housing programs target or have special features for the elderly. Specifically, one HUD and one USDA program target the elderly exclusively, while three HUD programs target the elderly and disabled. The remaining 18 programs serve a variety of household types but have special features for elderly households, such as income adjustments that reduce their rents. The 13 programs for which data were available provide about 943,000 housing units designated for occupancy by the elderly. However, many programs also serve the elderly in undesignated units. Available occupancy data show that the elderly occupied at least 1.3 million units under rental assistance, public, and multifamily housing programs as of spring 2004. Information on the effectiveness of housing programs that assist the elderly is limited. HUD has an overall goal related to elderly housing, but not all individual programs that assist the elderly are explicitly linked to this goal. USDA does not have specific goals related to elderly housing. Most of the 23 housing assistance programs we reviewed are not designed to provide supportive services for the elderly. Four programs require the owners of program properties to ensure that services such as meals or transportation are available to their residents. In addition, HUD administers four programs--for example, the Service Coordinator Program--that can be used in conjunction with various housing programs to help the elderly obtain supportive services. Supportive services are also available to elderly residents of subsidized housing through partnerships between individual properties and local organizations. To avoid overlap and duplication in the development of rural housing for the elderly, HUD and USDA have established policies and procedures that require field offices from both agencies to notify their counterparts of applications to build new housing and consider each other's input on local market conditions. GAO visits to selected HUD field offices and state USDA offices revealed that staff were not consistently following these policies and procedures but were analyzing markets to ensure the need for proposed housing. Overall, however, funding and geographic constraints limit the potential for overlap and duplication in the construction of rural housing for the elderly."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the 2003 American Housing Survey sponsored by the U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), nearly one-third of  elderly households\u2014generally those whose head is aged 62 or older\u2014were  experiencing housing affordability problems. Whether homeowners or  renters, these households were spending more than 30 percent of their  incomes on housing. Further, according to a Congressionally-established  bipartisan commission, decreased investment in affordable housing and a  burgeoning elderly population that is projected to grow from about 12  percent of the population in 2002 to 20 percent by 2030 are likely to  increase the number of elderly who must spend large portions of their  incomes on housing.", "Housing affordability is an even greater problem for low-income elderly  households\u2014those with incomes of less than 80 percent of area median  income. The 2003 American Housing Survey estimated that 66 percent of  low-income elderly renters spent more than 30 percent of their income on  housing. Like these renters, low-income elderly homeowners also have  affordability problems. While approximately 80 percent of the elderly own  their homes, about two-thirds of these households are considered low  income. In 2003, about 40 percent of these low-income homeowners were  spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing.", "Since the 1930s, a number of federal housing programs have provided  assistance to low-income renters and homeowners, including rent  subsidies, mortgage insurance, and loans and grants for the purchase or  repair of homes. These programs are administered primarily by HUD or the  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, these programs do not  reach all needy households, and waiting lists for many types of subsidized  housing, including housing for the elderly, are often long.", "You requested that we review federal housing assistance programs that can  benefit the elderly. This report discusses (1) the extent to which federal  housing assistance programs provide benefits to elderly households and  what is known about the effectiveness of these programs in assisting the  elderly, (2) the types of supportive services that these programs provide for  the elderly, and (3) how HUD and USDA avoid overlap and duplication in  programs that offer similar types of housing assistance to the elderly. As  requested, we also obtained information on the status of HUD\u2019s efforts to  implement GAO\u2019s earlier recommendations to improve the timeliness and  oversight of the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section  202) program, which subsidizes the development of rental housing and  provides rental assistance for elderly households with very low incomes.  This information is included in Appendix II.", "To address these objectives, we consulted with HUD and USDA officials to  identify housing assistance programs that benefit the elderly. We reviewed  laws and regulations to categorize the programs as either targeted  exclusively to the elderly, targeted at the elderly and disabled, or not  targeted but with special features for the elderly. We included housing  assistance programs that (1) subsidize mortgage interest rates, rent, or  housing repair or rehabilitation; (2) provide mortgage insurance, loan  guarantees, or direct loans for single-family or multifamily housing; or (3)  support the construction, rehabilitation, or purchase of multifamily  housing or assisted living facilities. Appendix III summarizes each of the  programs we include, and Appendix IV describes other housing-related  programs that can benefit the elderly but do not fit our three categories.", "We also analyzed data from HUD and USDA databases to determine the  number of units designated for or occupied by the elderly in federally  subsidized or insured housing. We reviewed studies and reports by federal  agencies, including the HUD and USDA Offices of Inspector General;  research institutions; and others for information on the effectiveness of  these programs. These reports included the HUD and USDA fiscal year  2003 Performance and Accountability Reports. We obtained information  about supportive services from program descriptions and agency officials.  We also reviewed agreements, policies, and procedures HUD and USDA  have established to coordinate the development of subsidized housing in  rural areas and visited selected HUD and USDA field offices to determine  whether and how they coordinated with one another. Finally, we  interviewed HUD officials and reviewed related documentation to obtain  information on the status of GAO\u2019s earlier recommendations for the  Section 202 program. Appendix I provides more detailed information on  our scope and methodology.", "We conducted our work in Baltimore, Maryland; Greensboro and Raleigh,  North Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Oklahoma City and Stillwater, Oklahoma,  and Washington, D.C., between December 2003 and December 2004, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has helped provide affordable housing to low- income households since the 1930s. Since then, a number of federal  housing programs have subsidized the construction of housing for the poor,  provided rental assistance to tenants in existing privately owned housing,  and insured mortgages for both single- and multifamily properties. Today,  HUD administers the majority of federal housing assistance programs in  urban areas, and USDA\u2019s Rural Housing Service (RHS) implements housing  programs in rural areas.", "In general, both HUD and USDA programs target families at lower income  levels. HUD programs target families with incomes that are: extremely low  (no more than 30 percent of an area\u2019s median), very low (no more than 50  percent of an area\u2019s median), and low (no more than 80 percent of an area\u2019s  median). USDA programs also target families with incomes that are very  low and low. In addition, some USDA programs target families with  moderate incomes (no more than 115 percent of an area\u2019s median).", "HUD and USDA provide many types of housing assistance programs,  including single-family programs, multifamily programs, rental assistance  programs, and public housing. Housing developments can be assisted by  multiple programs. For example, a loan or mortgage on a multifamily  property may be insured through a HUD or USDA program, and the  property may have tenants that receive rental assistance from these  agencies. Federal housing assistance can generally be categorized as  follows:  Single-family programs that provide mortgage insurance, loan  guarantees, or direct loans for homeowners and grants or loans for  home repairs or modifications;  Multifamily programs that provide loans, subsidies, mortgage insurance  or loan guarantees, or a combination of these to support the  development and rehabilitation of rental properties, including:   Production programs that provide federal funds to construct or  substantially rehabilitate units for households with extremely low to  moderate incomes; and   Mortgage insurance/loan guarantee programs that provide incentives  for lenders to finance rental housing by reducing risk;   Rental assistance programs, which can be used for multifamily and  some single-family housing and generally pay property owners the  difference between 30 percent of a household\u2019s adjusted income and its  rent, including:   Tenant-based rental assistance that provides vouchers for eligible  tenants to rent privately owned apartments or single-family homes  and that tenants can use in new residences if they move; and   Project-based rental assistance that is attached to specific properties  and is available to tenants only when they are living in units at these  properties; and   Public housing, which is provided through HUD and offers units for  eligible tenants in properties administered by public housing authorities.", "The RHS implements all of the USDA programs we reviewed. Two offices  administer the HUD programs covered in this report:  The Office of Housing, which administers multifamily subsidy and  mortgage insurance programs, multifamily production programs, and a  variety of single-family programs; and   The Office of Public and Indian Housing, which administers the Public  Housing, Housing Choice Voucher, and Section 8 Moderate  Rehabilitation Programs.", "HUD has specific goals for increasing housing opportunities for the elderly.  As outlined in its fiscal year 2004 Annual Performance Plan, these goals  include (1) increasing the availability of affordable housing for the elderly,  (2) increasing the number of assisted-living units, (3) increasing the  number of elderly households living in privately owned, federally assisted  multifamily housing served by a service coordinator, and (4) increasing  elderly families\u2019 satisfaction with their Section 202 units.", "USDA does not have specific goals related to the elderly in its fiscal year  2004 Annual Performance Plan. However, USDA does have the broad  objective of improving the quality of life of rural families by financing,  among other things, quality housing. To reach this objective, USDA has  established two housing-related goals: (1) to increase financial assistance  to rural households to buy a home, and (2) to increase the number of  minority homeowners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Housing Programs Offer Assistance for the Elderly, but Information on Their Effectiveness Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["We identified a total of 23 federal housing programs that are targeted at or  have special features for the elderly: 2 that are intended for the elderly only,  3 that are targeted to the elderly and disabled, and another 18 that have  special features, such as properties designated for elderly occupants and  income adjustments that lower elderly households\u2019 rental payments. Some  or all units in many multifamily and public housing properties are  designated for the elderly.

Three multifamily programs target the elderly and the  disabled: HUD\u2019s ALCP and two mortgage insurance programs (Section 231  and Section 232). Although not targeted to the elderly, another 18 programs  have special features for them. For example, public housing and some  multifamily programs allow properties to be wholly or partially designated  for occupancy by the elderly. Also, rental assistance programs and USDA  single-family programs make adjustments to elderly households\u2019 incomes  when determining program eligibility or calculating benefits. These  programs are briefly described in Figure 1, and in more detail in Appendix  III. Although most of the 23 programs are intended for households with  low, very low, or extremely low incomes, 7 of the multifamily insurance  programs may provide benefits for households of all income levels (that is,  there are no income restrictions or limits).", "Among these 23 programs, 13 have approximately 943,000 units designated  for the elderly, based on available data (fig. 2). Some public and multifamily  housing programs may designate properties wholly or partially for the  elderly, but the number of units set aside varies across programs. As figure  2 shows, the Section 202 and Section 231 programs have designated most  of their units for the elderly (84 percent and 90 percent, respectively),  consistent with these programs\u2019 targeting of the elderly or the elderly and  disabled. The Section 202 program designates the most units for the  elderly\u2014about 268,000 units.", "HUD, USDA, and other agencies also administer other housing programs  for which the elderly are eligible, but which do not have special features for  the elderly. For example, under the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit  program, the largest active multifamily housing production program, states  receive annual allocations of tax credits and distribute them at their  discretion. In their guidelines for the distribution of tax credits, some states  have established preferences for properties intended for the elderly, but the  federal government does not require such preferences. Similarly, HUD\u2019s  single-family mortgage insurance program does not have features that  apply only to elderly borrowers. HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage  program, which targets only elderly homeowners, did not meet our  definition of housing assistance for this review. This program allows elderly  homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes and defer  repayment for as long as they occupy their homes, but the money can be  used for any purpose, not just housing.

Specifically, USDA\u2019s Section 504 grants program, which provides home  repair grants to elderly homeowners, made at least 40,697 grants to elderly  recipients during that period. Also, the Section 502 Rural Housing Loans  (Direct), Section 502 Direct Housing Natural Disaster Loans, and Section  504 Rural Housing Repair and Rehabilitation Loans programs, which offer  loans for home purchase or repair, had at least 28,953 elderly borrowers.

For example, HUD\u2019s fiscal year  2003 Performance and Accountability Report has an indicator to track the  share of units receiving assistance through these programs that are  occupied by the elderly, but HUD has not established goals for this  indicator because housing providers have discretion regarding admissions  policies.", "USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has reported on how effectively  USDA\u2019s multifamily housing programs are implemented.

Similarly, HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2003 report identifies  such goals for only 3 of the 23 programs we reviewed. Further, HUD\u2019s goals  are not necessarily specific; for example, although information was  available on HUD\u2019s Section 232 program, targeted goals were not  established for this program, such as increasing the number of assisted- living units through Section 232 insurance by a specific percentage.

In 1991 HUD and USDA signed a Memorandum of Understanding  and agreed to maintain an on-going working relationship to address issues  related to providing housing assistance to rural areas in a cooperative, cost  effective, and nonduplicative manner. As a result of this agreement, HUD  and USDA issued guidance, in 1991 and 1992 respectively, specifying how  the agencies should coordinate. Specifically, the guidance outlined  coordination procedures that each agency should follow when reviewing  applications for funds to develop rental units. For HUD, this policy applied  to several programs, including the Section 202 program. For USDA, this  policy applied specifically to the Section 515 program, which can be used  to develop properties for families or the elderly. Among the programs we  included, HUD\u2019s Section 202 program and USDA\u2019s Section 515 program are  the only two that actively produce rental units for the elderly in rural  areas.", "While neither the original agreement between HUD and USDA nor the  resulting guidance has been updated since the early 1990s, the Section 515  program instructions and the Section 202 program\u2019s annual Notice of  Funding Availability, which announces the availability of funding as well as  program requirements, describe current procedures. According to the  Section 515 program instructions, the purpose of the coordination effort is  to (1) foster better communication, (2) obtain additional documentation to  determine market feasibility, (3) prevent overdevelopment of subsidized  housing, and (4) prevent adverse effects on proposed or existing units that  provide similar types of rental housing. The program instructions also state  that state USDA offices will forward basic loan information on Section 515  loan applications that are selected for further processing to the applicable  HUD field office. HUD field office staff will identify any pending,  authorized, or existing units in the market area and provide comments,  positive or negative, on the proposed market area to USDA within 2 weeks.  When HUD staff have concerns about market feasibility or the impact of a  proposed project on existing or authorized HUD units, they also provide  documentation to support their concerns. HUD has established a similar  process for notifying USDA of proposed developments. HUD\u2019s fiscal year  2004 Notice of Funding Availability for the Section 202 program requires  HUD to seek USDA\u2019s input on Section 202 applications, giving USDA the  opportunity to respond if it has concerns about the demand for additional  assisted housing or possible harm to existing housing in the same market  area.", "In addition to seeking input from one another on the markets in which new  rural rental housing is proposed, both HUD and USDA assess market  conditions when they evaluate applications for Section 202 and Section 515  funds. For example, HUD\u2019s guidance instructs HUD\u2019s economists to  evaluate the markets in which all Section 202 applications propose  development to determine if sufficient demand for the units exists and to  assure that any new units will not have a long-term adverse impact on  existing assisted housing for the elderly. If this analysis shows that  sufficient demand for the units proposed in an application does not exist,  then the application cannot be funded. Similarly, according to USDA  officials, USDA state office staffs analyze market data to determine need  and demand for the units proposed in Section 515 applications.  Applications are not approved if:  another rural rental housing loan has already been selected for further  processing in the same market;   a previously authorized USDA, HUD, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit,  or similar type of project in the same market area has not been  completed, has not reached its projected occupancy level, or is  experiencing high vacancies; or   the need in the market area is for additional rental assistance and not for  additional housing units.", "We visited HUD field offices and USDA state offices in North Carolina,  Ohio, and Oklahoma to determine whether and how these offices were  following these policies and procedures. We chose these states because  they had the largest numbers of approved Section 202 grants in rural areas  and Section 515 loan awards in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 (see Appendix I).  Our observations from the site visits are not necessarily representative of  all field offices.", "Overall, the HUD and USDA field offices in the three states we visited did  not consistently follow the policies and procedures designed to facilitate  coordination in fiscal years 2002 or 2003. For example, while local USDA  officials in North Carolina and Oklahoma obtained input from HUD on  Section 515 loan applications in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, USDA officials  in Ohio did not. According to a senior official from USDA\u2019s Ohio state  office, the agency did not seek HUD\u2019s input on the sites funded in fiscal  years 2002 or 2003 because USDA determined that market demand existed  for the units. Moreover, this official stated that they had sought HUD\u2019s input  on Ohio\u2019s list of \u201cdesignated places\u201d\u2014cities, towns, and communities for  which USDA could approve new Section 515 development. Based on  input from HUD and USDA field offices, USDA state offices can remove  places from the list if a market for additional rental housing does not exist.", "Since HUD officials had not raised concerns about the two places on Ohio\u2019s  list for which Section 515 housing was proposed in fiscal years 2002 and  2003 and funds were ultimately allocated, USDA officials did not think that  it was necessary to request their input again.", "Only one of the HUD offices visited sought USDA\u2019s input on Section 202  grant applications in fiscal year 2002, and none sought USDA\u2019s input in  fiscal year 2003. According to HUD officials in the field offices we visited,  HUD offices did not seek input for various reasons. For example, in North  Carolina and Oklahoma there were staffing changes. In Ohio, funds were  awarded to a site that had been funded in fiscal year 2002. Since contact  was made with USDA officials in fiscal year 2002 regarding this site, HUD  officials did not see a need to contact them again in fiscal year 2003.", "Although coordination between the HUD and USDA offices we visited was  inconsistent in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, we found that these offices  based their funding decisions on market analyses. For example, HUD  economists evaluated the markets in which all Section 202 applications  proposed development. If the economists determined that a sufficient  market for development did not exist, the application was not funded.  Similarly, in each state USDA office we visited, officials explained that if  they determined that the market for Section 515 development was  insufficient in a place where development was proposed, they would not  fund the application.

First, the way that Section 202 funding is allocated and the amount of  Section 515 funding limit the number of units these programs produce in  rural areas. HUD generally allocates only a portion of Section 202 funds to  nonmetropolitan areas, which are more likely than metropolitan areas to  be considered rural and thus eligible for USDA funds. In fiscal years 2002  through 2004, for example, HUD set aside enough funds for each of its local  offices to fund a minimum of five units in nonmetropolitan areas and  allocated 15 percent of all funds appropriated for the Section 202 program  to these areas. And although the Section 515 program provides funding  exclusively in rural areas, funding for this program has fallen sharply since  its peak in 1979. During the peak funding years, the program produced  more than 20,000 new units annually. Since 2000, fewer than 2,000 new  units have been produced annually. Also, not all new Section 515 units are  for the elderly, further reducing the potential for overdevelopment of  elderly housing in rural areas.", "Second, geographic restrictions on areas where Section 515 funds can be  used limit the extent to which the Section 515 and Section 202 programs  can overlap. Section 202 properties can be developed anywhere in the  United States. In contrast, not only must Section 515 properties be in rural  areas, but also new development can occur only in designated places. State  USDA offices develop lists of places with a need for multifamily rental  housing, and invite Section 515 applications for these places. According to  the USDA officials we interviewed, this list can be refined through input  from HUD and USDA field offices. As a result, new Section 515 properties  could potentially be developed and overlap with new Section 202  development only in a small number of areas.", "Finally, officials at the HUD field offices and state USDA offices we visited  told us that oversaturating a market with both HUD and USDA units for the  elderly was not a concern for several reasons, including a high demand for  such units. In some cases, they said, existing elderly properties had waiting  lists, and new properties generally rented quickly.

Unit counts were not available for 42 percent of the  Section 207 Manufactured Home Parks properties, 57 percent of Section  232 properties, and 23 percent of Section 542(b) and (c) properties, so  we could not produce a reliable count of the total number of units for  these programs. For the other HUD multifamily programs, fewer than 2  percent of the properties were missing unit counts (except that 4.5  percent of Section 207/223(f) properties were missing unit counts), so  we considered the data sufficient for our purposes. We combined these  data with the results of HUD\u2019s Multifamily Housing Inventory Survey,  conducted between June 2002 and January 2003, to determine the  number of multifamily units designated for the elderly under each  program.", "To determine the number of elderly households living in properties  under HUD\u2019s multifamily programs, we used data from HUD\u2019s Tenant  Rental Assistance Certification System as of May 25, 2004.

Among  other things, the report found that many Section 202 properties  encountered delays before beginning construction, and we made several  recommendations to improve the program\u2019s timeliness and oversight.  Specifically, we recommended that HUD:  Evaluate the effectiveness of the current methods for calculating the  capital advances that project sponsors receive and make any necessary  changes to these methods, based on this evaluation, so that capital  advances adequately cover the development costs of Section 202  projects consistent with HUD\u2019s project design and cost standards;  Provide regular training to ensure that all field office staff are  knowledgeable of and held accountable for following current  processing procedures required to approve projects to begin  construction;  Update the Section 202 program handbook to reflect current processing   Improve the accuracy and completeness of information that field staff  enter in the program\u2019s database system and expand the system\u2019s  capabilities to track key project processing stages.", "At the time we completed our work, HUD had made some progress but had  not fully implemented these four recommendations. First, in our 2003  report, we found that construction of Section 202 properties was  sometimes delayed, in part because HUD awarded inadequate capital  advance amounts. As a result, sponsors had to put off construction while  they sought additional funding. We recommended that HUD evaluate the  effectiveness of its methods for calculating capital advances and make any  changes necessary to cover the development costs of Section 202 projects.  HUD commissioned a study to examine how the development cost limits  used to calculate capital advance amounts compared with indicators of  local construction costs and to recommend any needed changes in limits  for high-cost areas. A HUD official said that the agency received the results  of the study in the fall of 2004, but had not determined whether to make any  changes in its methods for calculating capital advances.", "In addition, HUD had not implemented the two recommendations related  to training field staff and updating the Section 202 program handbook. We  concluded in our 2003 report that providing adequate formal training for  field office staff responsible for reviewing Section 202 properties before  approving them to begin construction and issuing an updated program  handbook could reduce delays in approving projects for construction by  ensuring that staff were accountable for applying and interpreting HUD  policies and procedures consistently. HUD agreed with these  recommendations. According to senior agency officials, HUD\u2019s goal at the  time we completed our work was to provide formal training to field staff in  fiscal year 2005 in the technical implementation of the agency\u2019s new rules  for using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits or other mixed financing to help  fund Section 202 properties.

To improve  HUD\u2019s oversight of the Section 202 program, we recommended that HUD  improve the accuracy and completeness of information entered into its  program database and expand the system\u2019s capabilities to track key stages  of the development process. Senior HUD officials said that the agency had  hired a new contractor in the summer of 2004 to work on the program  database and had developed a list of needed enhancements that would  address our recommendation.
