These systems are being developed in order to modernize and improve materiel management business operations and processes. The effort involved developing a standard suite of nine separate materiel management systems, or applications, to form the Materiel Management Standard System (MMSS). The program is also part of Defense\u2019s Corporate Information Management (CIM) initiative\u2014a departmentwide effort to improve operations and reduce costs by streamlining business processes, consolidating information systems, and standardizing and integrating data. As of July 1995, Defense estimated that it would spend about $5.3 billion to develop, deploy, and maintain the system at 17 inventory control points, and it expected the effort to produce as much as $15 billion in savings over a 15-year period. At the close of fiscal year 1995, Defense had spent a reported $714 million on development.", "During the course of our review, however, Defense decided to undertake a different approach to developing materiel management systems because of funding cuts, cost overruns, and schedule delays. Also, individual services were pressing for quicker system deployment. Under the new approach, the materiel management systems will not be standard or integrated. Instead, each of the nine system applications will be individually and incrementally developed and deployed at selected inventory control points between fiscal years 1996 and 1999. The military services and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will choose which applications they want, and some inventory control points may never receive new systems. Deployment will be constrained by available funding. This is a major departure from DOD\u2019s previous goal of eliminating multiple and redundant business processes and hundreds of legacy (current) systems and moving to a standard, corporate DOD logistics process and system.", "Because of this change, we focused our review primarily on Defense\u2019s new strategy and the extent to which it will facilitate improvement of materiel management business processes and reduce costs associated with inventory, personnel, and inefficient legacy systems.

We interviewed officials responsible for the old and new materiel management strategies as well as those in charge of developmental testing and those who participated in the early deployment of some applications. We also analyzed system design documents, program assessments, acquisition methodologies, and strategies. Our audit was performed from January through May 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We performed our work primarily at the offices of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics (DUSD(L)) in Washington D.C.; the Joint Logistics Systems Center (JLSC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; and the MMSS prototype site at the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia.

Materiel management business operations incorporate four major business activities\u2014asset management, requirements determination, supply, and technical data support. Annually, the Department spends about $19 billion on materiel management operations, and it currently manages a reported 6.3 million inventory items valued at a reported $73.6 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Materiel Management Business Strategies Are Changing", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s worldwide logistics operation includes about 1,400 warehouses at 27 distribution depots and other locations that provide supplies such as electronics, construction, and industrial items to the military services. The military services use large amounts of these items to maintain and repair weapon systems and other equipment. For example, the three services operate a total of about 25 facilities that perform detailed, time-consuming maintenance of major weapon system components such as radars, navigation aids, and various types of communication equipment. The services also store supplies (known as retail inventory) in warehouses at or near these maintenance facilities. From these warehouses, supplies are distributed to the mechanics or end-users when needed. The mechanics also hold some of these same items in nearby storage bins.", "We have previously reported that DOD\u2019s large inventory levels reflect the management practice of buying and storing supplies at both wholesale and retail locations to ensure that they are available to customers\u2014sometimes years in advance of when actually needed. DOD often stores inventories in as many as four different layers between suppliers and end-users. Storing inventory at many different locations results in inventory that turns over slowly, which produces large amounts of old, obsolete, and excess items. DOD\u2019s multilayered supply system also increases the amount of supply on hand and drives up the cost of holding inventory. As discussed in previous reports in 1993 and 1994, this is a philosophy that private firms have moved away from in an attempt to lower the cost of doing business, provide better service, and remain competitive.", "For example, during the past decade, the private sector instituted a logistics management philosophy that provides a sharp contrast to DOD\u2019s methods of managing and distributing inventories. Some private sector companies have avoided inventory management problems by using modern, \u201cjust-in-time\u201d business practices that shift responsibilities for storing and managing inventory to suppliers. In fact, companies that are using the most aggressive practices no longer store inventory in intermediate locations at all; their suppliers deliver inventory to them only when needed. Some companies have achieved large savings for certain items by standardizing items being used, eliminating bulk storage locations and, most importantly, relying on prime vendors to deliver small quantities when and where needed.", "A major characteristic of these new logistics practices is the way the companies buy supplies. Companies have reduced the number of suppliers they use by establishing long-term agreements with only a few key suppliers. Typically, suppliers are contracted to provide a company\u2019s supplies for a particular commodity. Thus, most of the management responsibilities are shifted from the company to the suppliers. The suppliers take on these responsibilities because they are promised a long-term relationship with the company. Other steps companies have taken to change their inventory management practices include using direct delivery programs, primarily through the use of a prime vendor . By using direct delivery programs, companies bypass the need for intermediate storage and handling locations. Once the end-users order supplies, the suppliers deliver the items directly to the user\u2019s facility close to the time when the items are needed. Also, to facilitate communication channels with the suppliers, electronic ordering systems and the use of bar coding are often used to eliminate paperwork and speed up the ordering process.", "DOD is beginning to move away from its current multilayered inventory management philosophy by developing initiatives, similar to those adopted in the private sector, which involve some combination of long-term contracting agreements, direct delivery of items from suppliers to the services, and electronic data interchange for streamlining the ordering process. The use of these initiatives is allowing DOD to (1) decrease procurement lead times, (2) increase accuracy in forecasting future item demands, (3) reduce paperwork, and (4) reduce inventory levels. While DOD has used these commercial practices, the initiatives generally have been limited in scope and represent only a small portion of its overall operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Materiel Management Systems Intended to Improve Various Business Processes", "paragraphs": ["Defense wants to develop and deploy materiel management systems to improve business operations and processes nationally for DOD materiel management and reduce the costs associated with inventory, personnel, and inefficient systems. Historically, while the services and DLA have had similar logistics activities, they employed widely different processes and supporting information systems. Currently, Defense relies on over a reported 500 legacy systems to carry out wholesale logistics operations. As these systems become fragmented, outdated, and inefficient, they require billions of dollars in maintenance costs. According to Defense, because today\u2019s materiel managers do not have access to timely, accurate, and reliable logistics information, they increasingly make unnecessary requisitions, which, in turn, result in excess inventory and waste. In addition, according to Defense, fragmented systems and the lack of current technology have severely affected the ability to achieve greater asset visibility; quickly adjust requirements for materiel supply items to support military operations; standardize planning, requisitioning, and inventory control; and provide greater support with fewer resources.", "By embarking in 1992 on a strategy to develop the materiel management standard system (MMSS), Defense sought to replace hundreds of service-unique legacy systems being used to acquire, manage, move, and maintain inventory items with nine standard systems. These are the (1) Central Secondary Item Stratification System, (2) Configuration Management Information System, (3) Deficiency Reporting System, (4) Initial Requirements Determination/Readiness Based Sparing System, (5) Maintenance Planning and Execution System, (6) Production Definition Support System, (7) Provisioning Cataloging Technical Support System, (8) Requirements Computation System, and (9) Stock Control System. The specific functions of each of these nine systems are described in appendix III. Generally, these systems are intended to improve business operations in the following ways:", "Asset management\u2014provide greater asset visibility from the time of purchase to use and the capability to track and monitor product quality using automated deficiency reports during the wholesale process.", "Requirements determinations\u2014better define initial and repair requirements for supply items based on readiness scenarios and automate the computation of repair schedules and budgets.", "Supply and technical data\u2014automate paper copy guidebooks, procedures, and regulations needed to catalog new inventory items and provide managers with greater configuration control of inventory items.", "Defense referred to this program as the \u201cBig Bang\u201d strategy because it involved installing the entire suite of applications at each of the 17 inventory control points, rather than deploying each application as it was developed. The new systems were to be integrated so that the services and DLA could communicate and exchange data with each other and across business activities outside materiel management, such as finance, procurement, personnel, and logistics. JLSC planned to field MMSS across all 17 inventory control points and have the system be fully implemented in 7 to 8 years. JLSC expected this standard system to save billions of dollars in logistics costs by consolidating and streamlining management operations, improving the responsiveness, accuracy, and timeliness of data, and eliminating the cost of maintaining some information systems that support the same business processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Problems in the Materiel Management Migration Strategy", "paragraphs": ["From 1992 to late 1995, Defense spent about $714 million developing standard systems with minimal results. During that time, there were dramatic changes in the goals and expectations for the program and only one application was partially deployed. Because of changes in objectives and scheduling and problems in development, prospects for achieving the original objective of implementing a standard suite of integrated materiel management systems appeared dim. At the same time, the services and DLA were asking for quicker system deployments.", "As table 1 shows Defense began the migration strategy in 1992 with the intent of implementing an integrated MMSS system in 7 to 8 years. But only a year later, it decided to implement the system in 3 years. About 2 years after that, the program was completely rebaselined because of funding cuts, cost overruns, schedule slippages, and poor contractor performance. During the same time period, the objectives of the program changed: at the start of the program, business process improvements were to be identified while systems were under development; in 1993, improvements were to be identified after implementation. Taken together, these changes raised serious concerns about MMSS among the services and DLA.", "For the one application that was deployed (the Stock Control System), the development and scheduling problems were particularly evident. As appendix V further details, JLSC shifted system testing onto the users in order to meet milestone dates. One official told JLSC that its scheduling of testing actually extended time frames and resulted in a loss of confidence from users. This, coupled with other SCS problems related to resolving deficiencies discovered during user testing, poor training, and inadequate system documentation, prevented the application from providing the benefits originally anticipated.", "Because of the development and scheduling problems, the services and DLA reported serious reservations about implementing several of the new systems because they believed that some of their existing legacy systems were better than the planned standard systems. They concluded that in some cases, the new systems, such as the Stock Control System and the Initial Requirements Determination/Readiness Based Sparing system, either would not meet their operational requirements or lacked the necessary functionality to allow them to shut down existing legacy systems as planned. Nevertheless, the services and DLA claimed that some of their legacy systems were quickly deteriorating and that they could not fund necessary upgrades. Therefore, they demanded deployment of the new systems as quickly as possible based on their individual service needs.", "In April 1995, a Defense evaluation team, comprised of representatives from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, JLSC, DLA, the military services, and independent contractors, reviewed selected DOD inventory control point processes and concluded that the migratory systems approach to standardizing and upgrading materiel management automated data processing systems in DOD is not workable. The team recommended that JLSC discontinue its current efforts to develop MMSS and advised the Secretary of Defense to redirect JLSC, the services, and DLA toward a long-term effort to develop a unified automated data processing supply system using an independent contractor to design, develop, and prototype the system.", "Nevertheless, in December 1995, because of pressure from the services and DLA and the problems they were experiencing with the MMSS migration strategy, DOD dramatically changed the MMSS scope and implementation approach. Program officials believed that if systems were not deployed quickly, the entire materiel management system program would be vulnerable to additional funding cuts, thus jeopardizing the entire program and risking total failure. The commander of JLSC stated that if customers did not see immediate results, his organization would be in danger of \u201cgoing out of business.\u201d In order to accelerate deployments under the revised approach, JLSC no longer plans to deploy a standard materiel management system. Instead, it will deploy applications incrementally as they are developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Materiel Management Strategy Faces Serious Flaws", "paragraphs": ["In December 1995, Defense embarked on an accelerated deployment strategy of the nine applications that make up MMSS in order to meet services and DLA priorities and to realize operational benefits sooner than originally planned. Under this strategy, JLSC will no longer deploy an integrated suite of standard MMSS systems. Rather, it now plans to individually deploy each of the nine system applications as they are developed at selected sites from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 1999. The services and DLA will choose which applications they want, when and where they will be deployed and, as a result, some inventory control points may never receive new systems. Deployment will be constrained by available funding. JLSC and DUSD(L) refer to the new strategy as \u201cdeploy or die\u201d since program officials believed that unless these systems were deployed quickly, the entire materiel management system program would be vulnerable to additional funding cuts, thus placing the program in serious jeopardy of total failure. The current deployment schedule of these systems is provided in appendix IV. Table 2 reflects the differences in the two strategies.", "In turning to the new materiel management systems strategy, Defense is now intent on delivering new applications to customers as soon as possible. But this haste puts the new materiel management systems development at higher risk than the previous one. As the following sections discuss, Defense will begin deploying new systems before it clearly defines its approach, ensures adequate oversight, and plans for economic and technical risks. Defense will also begin deployments without considering the effects of major upcoming changes to materiel management operations. In addition, Defense will be deploying all applications before critical necessary testing is complete. We believe that these steps are all critical to ensuring that Defense gets the most from each dollar it invests in materiel management systems.

This is a major departure from Defense\u2019s previous goal of eliminating hundreds of redundant legacy systems and varied business processes in order to move to standard integrated systems and processes. Yet for such a significant change in direction, Defense first did not conduct assessments that would ensure that the strategy would be cost-effective and beneficial. It also did not incorporate into the strategy plans to consolidate and privatize operations and other alternatives being considered to enhance existing systems.

Without these assessments, DOD has no assurance that the best or most cost-effective systems are selected for migration nor can it plan actions designed to avoid or lessen the potential for project delay, overspending, or failure. These evaluations are particularly important at this time because, according to program officials, the estimated MMSS lifecycle costs and expected benefits in the July 1995 economic analysis do not reflect the most recent strategy change. These evaluations would also help DOD in planning to mitigate some of the additional costs associated with maintaining legacy systems that will be incurred as a result of the new strategy.", "The benefits of DOD using these analyses, for example, could have been realized in choosing the systems to deploy first in the new strategy. As table 3 shows, three of the four systems (the Configuration Management Information System (CMIS), the Product Definition Support System (PDSS), and the Deficiency Reporting System (DRS)) scheduled for deployment in fiscal year 1996 have very low projected benefits. The benefits listed in table 3 were taken from the July 1995 economic analysis.", "According to program officials, IRD/RBS, CMIS, PDSS, and DRS were chosen for deployment first in the new strategy because they are further along in development. However, we believe that had Defense analyzed costs, benefits, and risks associated with all selections, it would have had to seriously consider whether the benefits associated with RCS, SCS and MP&E made it imperative to concentrate on their development first.", "Additionally, by not analyzing and anticipating costs and risks associated with the new strategy, JLSC officials told us that they do not know how much it will cost to maintain the legacy systems that will remain under the new strategy and what it will cost to interface the new applications with the legacy systems. Because these systems will not be deployed as an integrated suite at all inventory control points, the services and DLA will have to operate many of their legacy systems for a substantially longer period of time. In turn, the large number (and complexity) of interface designs is likely to increase development and deployment costs significantly and delay implementation schedules. In November 1995, JLSC reported that the identification and development of more than 3,000 interfaces to existing legacy systems in support of multiple deployments is the prime technical risk facing the program.", "Finally, economic and risk analyses would reveal potential conflicts between available funding and planned scheduling of deployments. According to the MMSS program manager, the number of actual deployments for both fiscal years 1996 and 1997 will be contingent on available funding. In April 1996, the manager reported that the revised fiscal year 1997 schedule is too ambitious given the funding projected to be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Potential Changes to Materiel Management Program and Systems Not Assessed", "paragraphs": ["In addition to not assessing economic and technical risks, Defense has not assessed the impact that a number of potential changes under consideration for material management operations and systems could have on the program.

For example, the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces recommended, in May 1995, that Defense outsource materiel management activities relating to cataloging, inventory management, and warehousing. If outsourcing occurs, Defense may end up spending millions of dollars on systems for functions that are later outsourced or on inventory control points that are later consolidated.", "As discussed in the background section of this report, DOD is beginning to move away from its multilayered inventory management philosophy by embarking on initiatives similar to those adopted in the private sector, which involve some combination of long-term contract agreements, direct delivery of items from suppliers to the services, and electronic data interchange for streamlining the ordering process. These initiatives have not been a part of the system migration strategy; however, as they are expanded, they will significantly impact the processes the systems support.", "According to program officials, Defense is considering implementing a \u201cdata-focused approach\u201d to materiel management systems starting in fiscal year 1998, which would enhance interoperability and logistics modernization efforts through the use of \u201cmiddleware\u201d software.", "Middleware permits an application to see the data stored in other applications as if they were in a single, logical data repository. In doing so, it precludes the need to radically redesign the legacy systems and implement data standardization.

However, the decision to make such a drastic change for the materiel management strategy in the first place was never presented to MAISRC. As a result, key Defense decisionmakers did not have a chance to evaluate the program in order to decide whether to continue the current program, make minor changes, redirect, or terminate the program before it began.", "When JLSC entered the review process in April 1996 (before a working-level team versus the high-level Council), it requested approval to continue incrementally fielding individual applications, but did not have strategic plans and other required documentation that the Council could use to reach a decision. Based on the working-level team\u2019s review, the Council withheld authorization to proceed until certain documents were submitted and approved.", "In its May 13, 1996, decision memorandum, the Council directed the MMSS program manager to prepare the basic documents required for MAISRC review over the next 180 days. These include a mission need statement, which sets the goals of the program and defines projected capabilities and needs in broad operational terms; an acquisition strategy to guide the entire acquisition process throughout the system development life cycle and serve as the framework for planning, directing, and managing the program; an operational requirements document to document user objectives and minimum acceptable requirements for systems and to become the basis for operational performance criteria and testing; and a plan for preparing an economic analysis.", "Primarily to enable DOD to meet contractual obligations, the Council plans to hold another working-level session to evaluate and approve the acquisition and test and evaluation strategies before the end of fiscal year 1996. According to the Council, if these strategies are approved, JLSC will be authorized to proceed with deployment. However, when this decision is made, the other critical documents, such as the plan for preparing an economic analysis and the operational requirements document, will not be available for the Council\u2019s review. Therefore, JLSC may be authorized to proceed with deployment before key decisionmakers at Defense have reviewed a cost-benefit analysis, funding profile, and other important information that would shed light on the risks and costs associated with the new strategy.

However, it did not agree with our recommendations to stop materiel management system development and deployment until it takes necessary steps to define its approach, plan for risks, and ensure adequate oversight. Instead, Defense believes it is addressing the concerns expressed in our report under the logistics business systems strategy it is currently developing. The latest strategy focuses on creating a common operating environment for logistics. According to Defense, under the common operating environment, guidelines and standards specifying how to reuse existing software and build new software will facilitate system interoperability and allow for continually evolving computer capabilities.", "We agree with the Department\u2019s contention that its materiel management strategy has failed and commend it for pursuing alternative strategies, such as privatization and developing a common operating environment based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems. Such alternatives may well solve some of the past problems associated with materiel management systems. However, we disagree that the common operating environment strategy being developed will address our recommendations. Without first conducting required economic analyses, Defense has no assurance that the systems it is currently deploying, which were selected under the failed strategy, will fully support the new strategy or by themselves still be good investments. In addition, by not conducting these analyses, decisionmakers will lack necessary information to make sound, informed decisions for selecting the best among competing alternatives and understanding how upcoming major changes to materiel operations will impact their strategy and alternatives. These shortcomings led to the failure of the first strategy, and we believe that, unless they are addressed, Defense risks failing a second time.", "Further, conducting economic and risk analyses and providing for adequate oversight over system development, is not only required by Defense\u2019s own regulations but also by the recently enacted Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), which took effect August 8, 1996. The intent of this legislation is to prevent failures similar to the material management standard system strategy. Under ITMRA, DOD is required to design and implement a process for selecting information technology investments using criteria such as risk-adjusted return-on-investment and specific criteria for comparing and prioritizing alternative information system projects. If implemented properly as part of the new strategy, Defense can have a means for senior management to obtain timely information regarding progress in terms of costs, capability of the system to meet performance requirements, timeliness, and quality. Without implementing an effective investment process for the new strategy, Defense will continue to risk encountering unmanaged development risks, low-value or redundant information technology projects, and too much emphasis on maintaining old systems at the expense of using technology to redesign outmoded work processes.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force; the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties.

The original objectives of our review were to determine (1) the mission and the economic and technical basis for selecting MMSS as the migrating system and (2) the extent to which this strategy has or will improve DOD\u2019s materiel management operations. To accomplish our objectives, we (1) interviewed program officials and contractors responsible for developing, implementing, and managing MMSS projects, (2) reviewed pertinent program and contractor documentation such as cost performance reports, metrics, quarterly reports on major automated information systems, economic analyses, implementation and migration plans, and the test and evaluation plan, (3) examined system design documents, program assessments, and acquisition methodologies and strategies to support the MMSS, and (4) interviewed senior Defense officials responsible for approving and directing the MMSS development and acquisition regarding their efforts to minimize MMSS development risks and improve materiel management operations.", "However, shortly after we began the review, Defense stopped its strategy to develop a standard materiel management system and started making plans to separately deploy individual applications. Consequently, we refocused our review to include evaluating the risks associated with this new migration strategy and the extent to which it will facilitate improvements in materiel management operations. We interviewed DOD and program officials to determine the rationale behind the strategy change and the potential economic and technical risks threatening the successful implementation of the new strategy. We obtained and examined budgetary and cost data, reviewed project status reports, and pertinent program documents such as the revised deployment schedule, test procedures, and program decision papers. For applications scheduled to be deployed in fiscal year 1996, we compared the test procedures with deployment schedules to evaluate potential program risks of deploying software applications before successfully completing required testing. We were hampered in our attempt to assess the potential improvements to DOD\u2019s materiel management operations because critical strategic documents such as the revised economic analysis, acquisition strategy, and mission need statement had not been completed. To determine if field locations had experienced problems resulting from insufficient testing, we also interviewed officials at the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia who had participated in the early deployment of some MMSS applications.", "Our work was performed from January 1996 through May 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We performed our work primarily at the offices of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics, Washington D.C.; the Joint Logistics Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; and the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The wording in the paragraph cited has been modified but addresses the same issue. 2. Defense states that it is documenting a revised logistics business systems strategy at the same time that the first aspects of the strategy are being executed. The revised strategy is to be based on the new common operating environment (COE) approach for building interoperable systems, a collection of reusable software components, a software infrastructure for supporting mission area applications, and a set of guidelines and standards. The standards will specify how to reuse existing software and how to build new software to facilitate system interoperability. We are currently reviewing the COE. While it may address technical infrastructure problems associated with logistics business systems, we believe that Defense must still incorporate into the new strategy the essential ingredients that ensure sound decisionmaking as we recommended in our report: conducting required economic and technical risk analyses and providing adequate oversight for the systems currently being deployed. In doing so, Defense can ensure that the systems being deployed now will be compatible with systems or work processes developed under the common operating environment approach. Further, it can ensure that sound business decisions are being made as it finalizes the new approach.", "Additionally, while the military services and Defense agencies have requested materiel management deployments, because the systems have not been fully tested, they may not be an improvement over existing legacy systems. In addition, in the near-term, these systems will require the services and agencies to continue to maintain their legacy systems. We believe that before these systems are deployed to the services and the agencies, Defense needs to ensure that testing is sufficient. This should help reduce the risks of software problems surfacing in later phases of the system lifecycle. 3. As stated in our report, the economic analysis completed in 1995 was not reflective of the new approach to materiel management systems. An analysis for the new strategy may well have identified the additional risks that have not been addressed, such as those associated with maintaining the legacy systems that will now remain under the new strategy. In addition, developing an economic analysis after deployments have begun will not give Defense decisionmakers an opportunity to ensure that good business decisions are being made before funds are committed. Both ITMRA and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s November 1995 guide for evaluating information technology investments call for such analyses prior to making information technology investments as it allows senior managers to examine trade-offs among competing proposals and to ensure that each project is cost-effective and beneficial. 4. We support Defense\u2019s efforts to communicate its intentions for materiel management systems with management across the services and within logistics operations. Obtaining support of decisionmakers is critical to the success of the new strategy. However, because Defense has not complied with its own regulations for ensuring sound decisionmaking, these managers still do not have the information necessary for making informed decisions. Further, the Logistics Information Board, which Defense has established to review execution of the new strategy is no substitute for a full MAISRC review. For example, while the Logistics Information Board consists of members who participate in logistics business operations, MAISRC comprises high-ranking officials separate from logistics business who have a more independent perspective in reviewing the strategy. Further, while the Logistics Information Board can play an effective role in development and implementation of the strategy, MAISRC plays a vital role in developing and rigorously verifying the cost-benefit and alternative analyses that are fundamental to making investment decisions. 5. Defense contends that the systems it is developing will be flexible enough to support private contractors assuming responsibility for materiel management operations if privatization is pursued. This contention, however, presumes that contractors will want to use these systems rather than acquire their own systems and that these systems will support new work processes adopted by contractors. Further, because most of the migratory systems being deployed are based on an out-of-date system architectures, there is no assurance they will facilitate interoperability between the legacy and COTS environments, as Defense contends. 6. The testing strategy DOD describes is a common practice in the commercial world. However, it should be noted that this practice is intended to mitigate risk and reduce costs prior to full production of the system. In DOD\u2019s case, the strategy is being employed during full production of the system. Additionally, under DOD\u2019s approach, the services will be required in many cases to continue spending operational funds on their legacy systems to make up for the lack of full functionality in the fielded new systems. Further, Defense historically has encountered significant cost increases to software-intensive systems as a result of fielding them before they are adequately tested. As our report discusses, these problems were especially evident with the Stock Control System. In its comments, Defense did not dispute that the Marine Corps has had to make extensive and costly changes to the system chiefly because the application was delivered basically untested and with very limited functionality. Finally, we do not believe it is appropriate to deploy these systems until the testing strategy is approved by the full MAISRC. 7. We disagree with Defense\u2019s contention that the costs to maintain legacy systems will remain the same. Since a bare bones approach to legacy maintenance has been sustained for the past several years, we believe that these systems will require more maintenance as they get older. Additionally, we believe the maintenance costs for legacy systems will increase since fewer systems will be terminated under the new strategy than anticipated under the original strategy. As discussed in our report, these remaining systems will also require costly interfaces with new systems. Further, we are not recommending that Defense delay moving forward with a new logistics business systems strategy. Rather, we are recommending that Defense delay continuing to implement pieces of an admittedly failed migration system strategy until it can be assured that the systems it wants to deploy are good investments. 8. We agree that the old strategy is not viable. However, we disagree that there are no alternatives other than the current strategy. Our report, in fact, discusses alternatives to the new strategy currently being considered by Defense, such as privatizing materiel management functions. Also, by conducting required economic analyses, Defense would be able to fully identify the available alternatives and consider their associated costs, benefits and risks. 9. Until Defense completes the documentation associated with its own oversight process\u2014which includes a complete definition of the new strategy; an analysis of costs, benefits, and alternatives; and a test plan\u2014its decisionmakers will not have assurance that they are choosing the best system solutions. Further, the contention that the full MAISRC review of major information system investments merely adds \u201canother level of review\u201d goes against Defense\u2019s original intention in implementing this process: ensuring that the essential ingredients to making sound business decisions are incorporated into all major technology investment decisions, and that senior managers are making the final decisions and held accountable for them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Description of Materiel Management Standard System Applications", "paragraphs": ["Central Secondary Item Stratification (CSIS): Stratifies the requirements computed in the other systems across financial programs and is the basis for budgeting and funding allocations.", "Configuration Management Information System (CMIS): Provides configuration identification, configuration status accounting, electronic change control, and configuration audits.", "Deficiency Reporting System (DRS): Collects, processes, and stores quality deficiency and discrepancy data on weapon systems and equipment.", "Initial Requirements Determination/Readiness Based Sparing (IRD/RBS): Computes initial spare requirements for new systems and computes requirements based on readiness scenarios.", "Maintenance Planning & Execution (MP&E): Manages repair requirements and monitors the performance of maintenance facilities.", "Product Definition Support System (PDSS): Creates and moves a complete requirements package from the requirements determination system to the contracting system.", "Provisioning Cataloging Technical Support System (PCTSS): Supports the selection of items for new end items/weapon systems, obtains and maintains national stock numbers and associated data.", "Requirements Computation System (RCS): Provides demand-based requirements computations for recoverable and consumable items.", "Stock Control System (SCS): Provides asset visibility through requisition processing, receipt processing, and inventory processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Strategy Deployments", "paragraphs": ["Tables IV.1 and IV.2 below show the deployment schedule for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.

The legacy system employed batch processing, making users wait until the day after they input information to receive the results.", "Needing a success story, JLSC set unrealistic milestone dates and pushed the system through testing and onto the users. One official told JLSC that its scheduling of testing actually extended time frames and resulted in a loss of confidence from the users. This official and a lessons-learned report emphasized that the manner in which the system tests were conducted has exacerbated the problems with SCS. They cited that some problems were not identified in testing; the tests only addressed one area of the system at a time, as if in a vacuum; the tests were conducted on a different operating environment from the Marine Corps\u2019; some areas of SCS were not tested; and insufficient testing at contractor facility led to additional on-site testing to correct problems.", "Albany has devoted many resources to implement interim solutions to resolve interface and operating environment problems. Analysts have resorted to these measures because SCS has on-line processing capabilities, while the legacy systems use batch processing. Additionally, SCS uses a different operating environment from the legacy systems. Even with these interim solutions, MCLB-Albany cannot ensure that data is carried from one operating environment to the next. Additionally, because MCLB-Albany has SCS and legacy systems operating in tandem, it spends more time and money maintaining and reconciling the systems and to purify and convert data. Although MCLB-Albany officials acknowledge that a cost exists for all of these interim solutions, they were unable to determine the cost of addressing interface problems.", "According to Program Managers, JLSC ceased to provide feedback to MCLB-Albany on SCS monthly activity reports. At the beginning of the effort, JLSC required status reports from MCLB-Albany, but they later directed Albany to discontinue these reports. Considering that SCS still has unresolved problems, JLSC\u2019s instructions to cease the flow of progress reports is puzzling. MCLB-Albany officials later informed us that informal communication with JLSC has subsequently improved with the new direction of MMSS; however, they still receive no feedback on their progress reports.

The new language is expected to alleviate incompatibility problems in the operating systems. The Marines consider this update a top priority.
