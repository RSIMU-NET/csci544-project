The Coast Guard set program baselines before conducting a preliminary design review, which puts the program at risk of having an unstable design, thereby increasing the program's cost and schedule risks. While setting baselines without a preliminary design review is consistent with DHS's current acquisition policy, it is inconsistent with acquisition best practices. Based on a prior GAO recommendation, DHS is currently evaluating its policy to better align technical reviews and acquisition decisions.", "Technology. The Coast Guard intends to use proven technologies for the program, but did not conduct a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies prior to setting baselines. Coast Guard officials indicated such an assessment was not necessary because the technologies the program plans to employ have been proven on other icebreaker ships. However, according to best practices, such technologies can still pose risks when applied to a different program or operational environment, as in this case. Without such an assessment, the program's technical risk is underrepresented.", "Cost. The lifecycle cost estimate that informed the program's $9.8 billion cost baseline was not fully reliable because it only partially met GAO's best practices for being credible. It did not quantify the range of possible costs over the entire life of the program. As a result, the cost estimate may underestimate the total funding needed for the program. However, the estimate substantially met GAO's best practices for being comprehensive, well-documented, and accurate.", "Schedule. The Coast Guard's planned delivery dates were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities, but rather driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard's only operating heavy polar icebreaker\u2014the Polar Star \u2014reaches the end of its service life (see figure).", "GAO's analysis of selected lead ships for other shipbuilding programs found the icebreaker program's estimated construction time of 3 years is optimistic.

The Coast  Guard, a component within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  is developing the first heavy polar icebreakers it has bought in over 40  years. The Coast Guard, in collaboration with the Navy, plans to invest up  to $9.827 billion for the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of three  heavy polar icebreakers over their entire 30-year lifecycle. In March 2018,  the Navy released a solicitation that included options for the detail design  and construction of three polar icebreakers. The Navy anticipates  awarding the contract to a single shipbuilder in the third quarter of fiscal  year 2019. As the Polar Star\u2014the Coast Guard\u2019s only operating heavy  polar icebreaker\u2014nears the end of its service life, the new icebreakers  will play a critical role in the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to ensure year-round  access to the Arctic and Antarctic, which affects U.S. economic, maritime,  and national security interests in these regions.", "My statement today will address (1) key acquisition risks facing the polar  icebreaker program and (2) funding uncertainties for the program. This  statement is based primarily on our April and September 2018 reports  examining the Coast Guard\u2019s polar icebreaker acquisition, as well as  drawing from our extensive body of work examining the Coast Guard\u2019s  and the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding efforts. For the reports cited in this  statement, among other methodologies, we analyzed Coast Guard and  Navy guidance, data, and documentation, and interviewed Coast Guard  and Navy officials. Detailed information on our scope and methodology  can be found in the reports cited in this statement.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Our prior work has found that  successful acquisition programs start with solid, executable business  cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. A  sound business case requires balance between the concept selected to  satisfy operator requirements and the resources\u2014design knowledge,  technologies, funding, and time\u2014needed to transform the concept into a  product, which in this case is a ship with polar icebreaking capabilities.  Without a sound business case, acquisition programs are at risk of  breaching the cost, schedule, and performance baselines set when the  program was initiated\u2014in other words, experiencing cost growth,  schedule delays, and reduced capabilities.", "At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach. We have  found that successful shipbuilding programs build on attaining critical  levels of knowledge at key points in the shipbuilding process before  significant investments are made (see figure 1).", "We provide additional information below on each of the four main risks  that affect the soundness of the polar icebreaker program\u2019s business  case."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Coast Guard Plans to Have a Stable Design before Starting Construction but Did Not Assess Design Maturity Prior to Setting Program Baselines", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard expressed a commitment to having a stable design for  the polar icebreaker program prior to the start of lead ship construction,  but it set the program\u2019s baselines before conducting a preliminary design  review\u2014a systems engineering event that is intended to verify that the  contractor\u2019s design meets the requirement of the ship specifications and  is producible.", "Shipbuilding best practices we identified in 2009 found that design  stability on a ship is achieved upon completion of the basic and functional  designs. The basic design includes fixing the ship steel structure; routing  all major distributive systems, including electricity, water, and other  utilities; and ensuring the ship will meet the performance specifications.  The functional design includes further iteration of the basic design, such  as providing information on the exact position of piping and other outfitting  in each block, and completing a 3D product model. At this point of design  stability, the shipbuilder has a clear understanding of the ship structure as  well as how every system is set up and routed throughout the ship.  Consistent with our best practices, prior to the start of construction on the  lead ship, the Coast Guard plans to require the shipbuilder to complete  basic and functional designs, develop a 3D model output, and provide at  least 6 months of production information to support the start of  construction.", "Although the Coast Guard plans to have a stable design prior to ship  construction, it set the program\u2019s acquisition program baselines prior to  gaining knowledge on the feasibility of the selected shipbuilder\u2019s design.  Program baselines inform DHS\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s decisions to  commit resources. Our best practices for knowledge-based acquisitions  state that before program baselines are set, programs should hold key  systems engineering events, such as a preliminary design review, to help  ensure that requirements are defined and feasible and that the proposed  design can be met within cost, schedule, and other system constraints.", "The Coast Guard has yet to conduct a preliminary design review for the  program because DHS\u2019s current acquisition policy does not require  programs to do so until after setting program baselines. However, in April  2017, we found that DHS\u2019s sequencing of the preliminary design review is  not consistent with our acquisition best practices, which state that  programs should pursue a knowledge-based acquisition approach that  ensures program needs are matched with available resources\u2014such as  technical and engineering knowledge, time, and funding\u2014prior to setting  baselines. As a result, we recommended that DHS update its acquisition  policy to require key technical reviews, including the preliminary design  review, to be conducted prior to approving programs\u2019 baselines. DHS  concurred with this recommendation and stated that it planned to initiate a  study to assess how to better align its processes for technical reviews  and acquisition decisions. Upon completion of the study, DHS plans to  update its acquisition policies, as appropriate. As of June 2018, DHS  indicated that it had completed its study and was in the process of  updating its acquisition policies. GAO will review the policies once  complete to determine if the updates meet the intent of this  recommendation.", "By setting the polar icebreaker program\u2019s baselines prior to gaining  knowledge on the shipbuilder\u2019s design, the Coast Guard has established  cost, schedule, and performance baselines without a stable or mature  design. Although completing the preliminary design review after setting  program baselines is consistent with DHS policy, this puts the Coast  Guard at risk of breaching its established baselines and having to revise  them later in the acquisition process, after a contract has been signed  and significant resources have been committed to the program. At that  point, the program will be well underway and it will be too late for decision  makers to make appropriate tradeoff decisions between requirements and  resources without causing disruptions to the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Intends to Use Proven Technologies for the Polar Icebreaker Program but Has Not Assessed Their Maturity", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard intends to use what it refers to as \u201cstate-of-the-market\u201d  or \u201cproven\u201d technologies for the polar icebreaker program, but it has not  yet conducted a technology readiness assessment to determine the  maturity of key technologies prior to setting program baselines. This  approach is inconsistent with our best practices for technology  readiness. A technology readiness assessment is a systematic,  evidence-based process that evaluates the maturity of critical  technologies\u2014hardware and software technologies critical to the  fulfillment of the key objectives of an acquisition program. According to  our best practices, a technology readiness assessment should be  conducted prior to program initiation.", "At the time of our earlier review, Coast Guard officials told us the polar  icebreaker program does not have any critical technologies and thus,  does not need to conduct a technology readiness assessment. From  design studies and industry engagement, Coast Guard officials  determined that the key technologies required for the polar icebreakers,  such as the integrated power plant and azimuthing propulsors, are  available commercially and do not need to be developed. Figure 2  provides additional information on the risks for these key technologies, as  well as design risks for an icebreaker\u2019s hull form.", "Coast Guard officials stated that the integrated power plant is the  standard power plant used on domestic and foreign icebreakers. Coast  Guard officials told us that similarly, market survey data on azimuthing  propulsors show that ice-qualified azimuthing propulsors in the power  range required have been used on foreign icebreakers.", "However, according to our best practices, critical technologies are not just  technologies that are new or novel. Technologies used on prior systems  can also become critical if they are being used in a different form, fit, or  function. Based on our analysis of available Coast Guard information, we  believe the polar icebreaker program\u2019s planned integrated power plant  and azimuthing propulsors should be considered critical technologies  given their criticality in meeting key performance parameters, how the  technologies are being reapplied to a different operational environment  from prior uses of the technologies, and the extent to which they pose  major cost risks. By not conducting a technology readiness assessment  and identifying, assessing, and maturing its critical technologies prior to  setting the program\u2019s program baselines, the Coast Guard is potentially  underrepresenting technical risk and understating its cost, schedule, and  performance risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Polar Icebreaker Program\u2019s Cost Estimate Substantially Met Best Practices but Is Not Fully Reliable", "paragraphs": ["We found that the Navy\u2019s lifecycle cost estimate used to inform the polar  icebreaker program\u2019s $9.827 billion cost baseline substantially adheres to  most of our cost estimating best practices; however, the estimate is not  fully reliable.

Highlights from our  assessment of the polar icebreaker program\u2019s lifecycle cost estimate are  detailed below:", "Comprehensive: substantially met. The estimate includes  government and contractor costs over the full lifecycle of all three  ships and documents detailed ground rules and assumptions, such as  the learning curve used to capture expected labor efficiencies for  follow-on ships. However, the costs for disposal of the three ships  were not at a level of detail to ensure that all costs were considered  and not all assumptions, particularly regarding operating and support  costs, were varied to reflect the impact on cost should these  assumptions change.", "Well-documented: substantially met. The estimate\u2019s documentation  mostly captured the source data used as well as the primary methods,  calculations, results, rationales, and assumptions used to generate  each cost element. However, the documentation alone did not provide  enough information for someone unfamiliar with the cost estimate to  replicate what was done and arrive at the same results.", "Accurate: substantially met. The estimate was properly adjusted for  inflation, and we did not find any mathematical errors in the estimate  calculations we inspected. Officials stated that labor and material cost  data from recent, analogous programs were used in the estimate.  While the documentation does not discuss the reliability, age, or  relevance of the cost data, Navy officials provided us with additional  information regarding those data characteristics.", "Credible: partially met. The Navy only modeled cost variation in the  detail design and construction portion of the program and excluded  from its analyses any risk impacts related to the remainder of the  acquisition, operating and support, and disposal phases, which  altogether comprise about 75 percent of the lifecycle cost. Without  performing a sensitivity analysis on the entire life cycle cost of the  three ships, it is not possible for the Navy to identify key elements  affecting the overall cost estimate. Further, without performing a risk  and uncertainty analysis on the entire life cycle cost of the three ships,  it is not possible for the Navy to determine a level of confidence  associated with the overall cost estimate.", "By not quantifying important risks, the Navy may have underestimated the  range of possible costs for about three-quarters of the entire program.  The estimate provides an overly optimistic assessment of the program\u2019s  vulnerability to cost growth should risks be realized or current  assumptions change.

This creates a potential heavy polar icebreaker capability gap  of about 3 years, if the Polar Star\u2019s service life were to end in 2020 and  the lead polar icebreaker were to be delivered by the end of fiscal year  2023 as planned. If the lead ship is delivered later than planned in this  scenario, the potential gap could be more than 3 years. The Coast Guard  is planning to recapitalize the Polar Star\u2019s key systems starting in 2020 to  extend the service life of the ship until the planned delivery of the second  polar icebreaker (see figure 4).", "Further, we compared the program\u2019s planned construction schedule to  the construction schedules of delivered lead ships for major Coast Guard  and Navy shipbuilding programs active in the last 10 years as well as the  Healy, the Coast Guard\u2019s only medium polar icebreaker. We found that  the polar icebreaker\u2019s lead ship construction cycle time of 2.5 to 3 years is  optimistic, as only 3 of the 10 ships in our analysis were constructed in 3  years or less. Further, as another point of comparison, the Healy was  constructed in just under 4.5 years.", "An unrealistic schedule puts the Coast Guard at risk of not delivering the  icebreakers when promised and the potential gap in icebreaking  capabilities could widen. Just as importantly, our prior work on  shipbuilding programs has shown that establishing optimistic program  schedules based on insufficient knowledge can create pressure for  programs to make sacrifices elsewhere, which can lead to work being  performed concurrently, costly rework, and further delays.", "To address the risks we identified and establish a sound business case,  we made a number of recommendations in our September 2018 report to  DHS, Coast Guard, and the Navy, including:", "Conducting a technology readiness assessment in accordance with  best practices, identifying critical technologies, and developing a plan  to mature any technologies not designated to be mature before detail  design of the lead ship begins;", "Updating the program\u2019s cost estimate in accordance with best  practices before the contract option for construction of the lead ship is  awarded;", "Developing a program schedule in accordance with best practices to  set realistic schedule goals for all three ships before the contract  option for construction of the lead ship is awarded; and", "Updating the program\u2019s acquisition program baselines prior to  authorizing lead ship construction, after completion of the preliminary  design review, and after it has gained the requisite knowledge on its  technologies, cost, and schedule.", "DHS concurred with all of our recommendations and identified actions it  planned to take to address them.

Subsequently, after discretionary budget caps were relaxed by Congress,  the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget addendum requested an  additional $720 million in fiscal year 2019 Coast Guard appropriations for  the program.
