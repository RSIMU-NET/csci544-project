Shortages of spare parts are a key indicator of whether the billions of dollars annually spent on these parts are being used in an effective, efficient, and economical manner. In recent years the Navy has testified and reported to the Congress that its aviation systems have significant readiness and supply problems. Since 1990 we have designated the Department of Defense\u2019s management of its inventory, including spare parts, as high risk because its inventory management systems and procedures were ineffective.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 requires us to evaluate various aspects of the military services\u2019 logistics support capability, including the provision of spare parts. Also, the Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, and the Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, House Committee on Appropriations, requested that we review issues related to the quality and availability of spare parts for aircraft, ships, vehicles, and weapon systems. In response to these requests, we reviewed known aviation spare parts shortages within the services. For this report, we focused on the Navy and our objectives were to determine the (1) impact of shortages of spare parts for two selected aircraft and (2) reasons for the shortages. Additionally, we identified the overall initiatives that the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency have in place or planned to address overall spare part shortage issues. We will be discussing in separate reports our reviews on the availability of spare parts in the Army and the Air Force, the quality of Navy spare parts, funding for spare parts, and Army war reserve requirements for spare parts.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed readiness indicators for the EA-6B Prowler and F-14 Tomcat aircraft. Also, we determined the reasons for the shortages for 50 parts that affected the capability of these aircraft to perform their missions. We selected these aircraft because they are key to fulfilling Navy missions and were experiencing parts shortages, as reflected by various supply and readiness indicators. The Navy sets goals to have a certain percentage of aircraft capable of performing their missions. It measures the impact of parts shortages on aircraft by determining the percentage of aircraft that cannot meet mission requirements because repair parts are unavailable. The Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency are responsible for managing and providing these parts for Navy aircraft."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In January 2001, we reported on Department of Defense management challenges and noted that the Department has had serious weaknesses in its management of logistics functions and in particular inventory management. We have identified inventory management as a high-risk area since 1990. In 1996 and again in 1998, we reported that despite billions of dollars invested in inventory, the Navy\u2019s logistics system often could not provide spare parts when and where needed. For example, in fiscal year 1995 about 12 percent of the aircraft were not mission capable due to supply problems, and mechanics frequently had to remove parts from one aircraft to make repairs on another. (See app. I for examples from our prior reports on management weaknesses related to the Navy.) Table 1 shows that during the last 11 years, the Navy has never achieved its overall goal to have 73 percent of its aircraft capable of performing at least one of its assigned missions. Further, the rate at which the aircraft could not perform their missions due to supply shortages has increased from 11.9 percent in fiscal year 1995 to 12.9 percent in fiscal year 2000.", "Navy officials have testified that the increased pace of operations and the resulting accelerated aging of its systems and infrastructure are outpacing its efforts to improve spare parts supplies and are continuing to affect readiness. As such, the Navy has efforts under way to better define its aviation spare parts requirements. The Navy stated in fiscal year 2000  to the Congress that budget increases for fiscal year 2000 had begun to address some of the Navy\u2019s most pressing needs but that it would take time for the positive effects to be reflected throughout the force.", "Between fiscal year 1999 and 2000, the Navy increased expenditures for aircraft parts by $631 million. In 1999 the Defense Department announced plans to provide $500 million to the Defense Logistics Agency to purchase spare parts for all the services over fiscal years 2001-2004. The Navy\u2019s and the Marine Corps\u2019 share of that amount is about $190.7 million, of which about $62.1 million had been obligated by February 2001. Further, the Navy and the other services received additional funds in fiscal year 1999 that, unlike the funds cited above, were included in operation and maintenance accounts, including $116 million to eliminate backlogs of aviation spare parts. In a report issued earlier this year, we indicated that current financial information does not show the extent to which these funds were used for spare parts. The Department plans to annually develop detailed financial management information on spare parts funding usage but had not planned to provide it to the Congress. When we recommended that the Secretary of Defense routinely provide this information to the Congress as an integral part of the Department\u2019s annual budget justification, the Department agreed to do so.", "The aviation systems that we reviewed are vital to the Navy\u2019s achievement of its missions but have had significant parts shortages problems. The EA-6B, shown in figure 1, is an all-weather electronic attack aircraft that operates from aircraft carriers and land bases and is the only Department of Defense aircraft that can electronically jam enemy antiaircraft radar. These aircraft were first delivered in 1971 and have had several major upgrades. These aircraft are heavily deployed for operations and were severely stressed during the 1999 operation in Kosovo. The F-14 Tomcat, shown in figure 2, is an all-weather fighter that operates from aircraft carriers and is designed to attack and destroy enemy aircraft, in both day and night, and is also in high demand for deployed operations. The F-14A was first delivered in 1972. The F-14B and F-14D models consisted of new production aircraft and remanufactured F-14A aircraft and were first delivered in 1987 and 1990, respectively. The F-14 has a critical role in providing air superiority and an ability to launch precision-guided munitions.", "The Navy uses both consumable and reparable spare parts for its weapon systems. Consumable parts, such as nuts, bearings, and fuses, are discarded when they fail because they cannot be repaired cost-effectively. The Defense Logistics Agency manages most consumable parts, and the Defense Supply Center in Richmond, Virginia, is the lead center for managing aviation consumable parts. Reparable parts are expensive items, such as hydraulic pumps, navigational computers, and landing gear, that can be cost-effectively fixed and used again. The Naval Supply Systems Command, through its Naval Inventory Control Point, manages and provides central control over reparable parts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parts Shortages Adversely Affect Navy Operations, Maintenance, and Military Personnel", "paragraphs": ["The shortages of spare parts for the two aircraft systems reviewed not only have affected readiness but also have created inefficiencies in maintenance processes and procedures and have adversely affected the retention of military personnel. Specifically, the rates at which the EA-6B and F-14 were not mission capable due to spare parts shortages ranged from 4.3 percent to 16.8 percent. Also, the maintenance practice used to mitigate part shortages masks the true impact of shortages and results in increased work for maintenance personnel, causing morale problems and dissatisfaction with military life."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Parts Shortages Contributed to Two Aircraft Systems\u2019 Failure to Achieve Mission-Capable Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Navy EA-6B and F-14 varied in their achievement of mission-capable goals during fiscal years 1993-2000, in part, due to spare parts shortages. The EA-6B met its overall goal of 73 percent only three times during the 8- year period (see table 2). During the same period, the F-14A met its 65- percent goal only twice, in the most recent 2 years; the F-14B met its 65- percent goal in 6 of the 8 years; and the F-14D met its 71-percent goal only once, in fiscal year 2000 (see tables 3-5). Although some models of the F-14 aircraft have improved their mission-capable rates in recent years, the Secretary of the Navy reported that the readiness of deployed forces was being maintained to some degree at the expense of nondeployed forces, which have often deferred ordering spare parts and delayed or reduced the scope of maintenance.", "The Navy reporting system also identifies whether aircraft are not mission capable due to supply shortages or for maintenance requirements. However, the Navy has not established specific goals related to the categories of not mission capable due to supply or maintenance. As shown in table 6, spare parts shortages have affected the capability of EA-6B and F-14 aircraft to perform their missions. Sometimes unit personnel must wait a long time to receive the parts they have ordered. For example, as of June 2000, the average wait time to fill 229 requisitions for mission-related parts for the F-14 was 185 days; for the EA-6B, the average wait time to fill 20 requisitions for parts was 77 days."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parts Shortages Cause Inefficient Maintenance and Hamper Retention of Maintenance Personnel", "paragraphs": ["To compensate for a lack of spare parts, maintenance personnel sometimes remove usable parts from one aircraft to replace broken parts on others, a practice called cannibalization (see table 7). According to Navy testimony and reports, the Navy is \u201ccannibalizing\u201d nonmission- capable aircraft to keep other aircraft flying and to maintain readiness. While the mission-capable rates of the aircraft that are kept in the air appear to be higher, the practice masks the impact of the shortages and causes morale problems with maintenance personnel because of the extra work involved, wastes consumable parts, and risks damage to the aircraft and its components. Also, a part removed from one aircraft will not last as long as a part from the supply system and will require maintenance sooner. We recently testified that the shortage of parts is the main reason for cannibalizations and that local commanders are willing to do whatever is necessary to keep readiness ratings high, even if this requires cannibalizing aircraft constantly and having personnel routinely work overtime.", "Cannibalization requires at least twice the maintenance time of normal repairs because it involves removing and installing components from two aircraft instead of one (see fig. 3).", "As shown in table 7, the aggregate cannibalization rate (the number of times maintenance personnel used the practice per 100 flying hours) for Navy aircraft did not change significantly during fiscal years 1993-2000. The aggregate rates are misleading, however, because cannibalizations are frequently not reported. In 1998 a Navy study group noted that as much as 50 percent of all cannibalizations were not reported. Nevertheless, the reported cannibalization rates for the EA-6B and F-14 were much higher than the aggregate, and the rate for the EA-6B rose significantly in fiscal year 1999, reportedly because of its extensive use during the Kosovo operation. Aside from the reported rates, Navy personnel\u2019s perception is that cannibalization has increased. Of 3,711 personnel surveyed by the Naval Inspector General, 2,932, or 79 percent, reported that cannibalizations had increased and that they did not have enough parts to maintain mission-capable rates needed to meet training and operational requirements.", "The practice of cannibalizing aircraft burdens maintenance personnel and seriously affects their morale. Cannibalization causes double work, as the maintenance personnel must remove a part from a donor aircraft and install it on another aircraft and later install a replacement part on the donor aircraft. According to maintenance and supply personnel at the units we visited, supply shortages were a significant problem that caused inefficient cannibalizations and expedited repairs. During fiscal year 2000, the Navy reported spending about 441,000 maintenance hours on cannibalizations. The EA-6B and F-14 accounted for about 34,000 and 27,000 of these cannibalization hours, respectively.", "The effects of inefficient logistics system practices on morale and retention have been noted in several personnel surveys. According to the Naval Inspector General survey, 74 percent of the 3,711 personnel surveyed said that the conditions they work under negatively affected their decision to stay in the Navy. Similarly, as we testified in March 2000, a Department of Defense 1999 survey of active duty members showed that retention problems were concentrated in career fields such as equipment repair. Also, in August 1999, we reported the results of our survey of about 1,000 of the Department\u2019s active duty personnel in job occupations that the Department of Defense believed were experiencing retention problems.  We reported that the majority of factors (62 percent) associated with dissatisfaction and reasons to leave the military were work circumstances, including the lack of parts and equipment to perform daily job requirements. Both officers and enlisted personnel ranked the availability of needed equipment, parts, and materials among the top 2 of 44 quality-of-life factors that caused their dissatisfaction. Finally, according to a fall 1998 survey of 114 Navy servicemembers and civilian personnel in the aviation, surface, and submarine communities, over 70 percent of the air community rated spares and repair parts as the area most in need of improvement. In our recent testimony, we discussed examples of how cannibalizations may become the source of waste or frustration. In one case, a major component needed for an EA-6B aircraft to perform its mission was removed from or reinstalled on four different aircraft, for a total of 16 times in 6 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Reasons for Parts Shortages", "paragraphs": ["The primary reasons for shortages of the 50 spare parts for the EA-6B and F-14 aircraft that we reviewed were (1) greater demands than anticipated for the parts, (2) delays in awarding contracts for the purchase and repair of parts, (3) contractors\u2019 delivery delays, (4) delays in repairs at military facilities, and (5) other problems.

Accurately forecasting the demand for parts is difficult because of the large number of variables that affect demand, including flying hour frequency and environment. The Navy forecasts the demand for parts using an average of historical demands. Although this average is periodically adjusted, it is subject to some degree of error. Forecasting the demand for a new part is often more challenging because the part has not been in the Navy supply system long enough to develop a pattern of demands. Also, according to a Navy supply official, forecasting for parts with infrequent demands is particularly difficult. Examples of parts for which there was unanticipated demand follow:   Although the average demand for the EA-6B landing gear (see fig. 4) was about one per quarter (3 months), there were eight demands for the gear during the two most recent quarters. The demand exceeded the stock on hand and contributed to a shortage of the part. The main reason for the increased demand was a new requirement for inspection of the gear. The purpose of these inspections was to reduce part failures and improve reliability during operations. The findings of these new inspections resulted in the replacement of more parts. As of June 2000, one unfilled requisition was affecting the capability of an EA-6B to perform its mission.", "A new version of an F-14D television sensor (see fig. 5) that was expected to operate 32,000 hours worked much less than anticipated. The increased failure rate and the associated increase in demand were partially attributed to improper installation of the sensor by Navy maintenance personnel. As of July 2000, the Navy was unable to fill 13 requisitions that affected the mission capability of the F-14.", "An unexpected surge in demand for the F-14 telescoping shaft (see fig. 6), which affects wing control during maneuvers, occurred about March 2000 because of a problem in the shaft that was found during a major engineering change to strengthen the wing. The shaft had severe corrosion from normal use and had to be replaced.

The Navy had planned to replace this computer with a newer model as part of an aircraft improvement program that was canceled in late 1994 due to funding constraints. The Navy considered several alternatives and decided that the most economical solution was to contract for a modification of an even older version of the computer to substitute for the current version. The first deliveries of the modified computers are expected in July 2001. As of May 2000, the Navy could not fill two requisitions that affected the capability of EA-6B aircraft to perform their missions.", "Similarly, the Navy had problems finding a company that would manufacture F-14 transmitters (see fig. 8), creating shortages of the part. These transmitters are designed to transfer signals regarding the aircraft\u2019s movements and position to the appropriate instruments. The Navy had not procured the transmitter for at least 10 years, and potential contractors were reluctant to manufacture the aging part. The only willing manufacture required a minimum purchase of 100 transmitters. Although the contractor had an expected delivery date of July 1999, its transmitter had problems passing a quality test.

The contractor\u2019s test equipment indicated that repaired actuators were faulty when they had actually been properly repaired. Also, the contractor maintained that repairs were delayed because a subcontractor had not made timely repairs to a subcomponent. However, a Navy supply manager told us that during a visit to the contractor\u2019s facility he identified a large number of subcomponents that should have been sent to the subcontractor. This situation contributed to the contractor\u2019s delays in repairing the actuators.

The study states this may happen for several reasons. The parts may not have been returned from the units to the repair facility, the repair facility may have lacked capacity in certain key areas such as repair equipment, the consumable parts required to fix the repairable item may not have been available, and item managers may not have requested the repair facility to repair the part because of a lack of funding.

We also discussed supply and maintenance issues with weapon system program managers at the Naval Air Systems Command. We did not independently verify the readiness and other data. We also visited maintenance and supply officials at the Naval Air Station, Oceana, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and the Second Marine Air Wing, Cherry Point, North Carolina.", "To determine the reasons for shortages of mission-related spare parts for the EA-6B and the F-14, we reviewed requisition data at the Naval Inventory Control Point-Philadelphia and judgmentally selected 50 parts that affected the capability of the two aircraft to perform their missions. These parts had the largest number of unfilled requisitions at the time of our visit: the end of May and June 2000 for the EA-6B and the end of July 2000 for the F-14. We interviewed the managers responsible for each selected part. To obtain customer views of critical parts problems, we also attended F-14 and EA-6B supply conferences. To help validate the reasons inventory managers provided for the parts shortages, we reviewed inventory management documents such as the March 2000 stratification reports, the 5-year demand history, and other relevant supply management documentation, including repair facility production schedules and completion data for the fourth quarter of fiscal year1998 through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 from the Naval Inventory Control Point- Philadelphia Industrial Support Division.", "To identify initiatives that the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency have under way or planned to address spare parts shortages for all aircraft, we interviewed Navy and Marine Corps headquarters officials and examined relevant documentation. Specifically, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s Logistics Transformation Plan for fiscal year 2000 and the Navy and Marine Corps reports on the best commercial inventory practices. We also discussed various initiatives with Naval Supply Systems Command and Naval Inventory Control Point officials.

In January 2001, we reported on Department of Defense management challenges and noted that it has serious weaknesses in its management of logistics functions and, in particular, inventory management. Although not specifically identified with the systems we reviewed, these management weaknesses directly or indirectly contribute to the shortages of spare parts the Navy is facing. For example:   We reported in January 2001 that nearly half of the Department\u2019s inventory exceeded war reserve or current operating requirements and that the Department had inventory on order that would not have been ordered based on current requirements.Thus, the Department was purchasing items that exceeded requirements with funds that could be used to purchase needed parts.", "We have issued several reports on the Navy\u2019s problems in maintaining adequate oversight of material being shipped to and from military activities. For example, in March 1999, we reported that during fiscal years 1996-98, the Navy reported losing accountability of in-transit inventory, including some classified and sensitive items, worth over $3 billion. In August 2000, we reported that the Navy had reported on actions that we believed would improve in-transit inventory management once fully implemented. Some of the corrective actions had an estimated completion date of December 2000, while a long-term solution would be to reengineer the entire in-transit process. In November 2000, we reported that the Navy\u2019s processes for setting prices that customers pay for aviation spare parts had led to the Navy\u2019s seeking supplemental appropriations and delaying the procurement of needed parts that could affect readiness.", "In addition, the Department of Defense\u2019s long-standing financial management problems may also contribute to the Navy\u2019s spare parts shortages. As we recently reported, existing weaknesses in inventory accountability information can affect supply responsiveness.Lacking reliable information, the Department of Defense has little assurance that all items purchased are received and properly recorded. The weaknesses increase the risk that responsible item managers may request funds to obtain additional unnecessary items that may be on hand but not reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Description of EA-6B and F-14 Spare Parts Discussed in Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Reasons for EA-6B and F-14 Spare Parts Shortages", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Major Management Challenges and Program Risks: Departments of Defense, State, and Veterans Affairs (GAO-01-492T, Mar. 7, 2001).", "Tactical Aircraft: Modernization Plans Will Not Reduce Average Age of Aircraft (GAO-01-163, Feb. 9, 2001).", "Major Management Challenges and Program Risks: A Governmentwide Perspective (GAO-01-241, Jan. 2001).", "High-Risk Series: An Update (GAO-01-263, Jan. 2001).", "Defense Acquisitions: Prices of Navy Aviation Spare Parts Have Increased (GAO-01-23, Nov. 6, 2000).", "Defense Acquisitions: Price Trends for Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s Weapon System Parts (GAO-01-22, Nov. 3, 2000).", "Defense Inventory: Status of Navy Initiatives to Improve Its In-Transit Inventory Process (GAO/OSI/NSIAD-00-243R, Aug. 24, 2000).", "Contingency Operations: Providing Critical Capabilities Poses Challenges (GAO/NSIAD-00-164, July 6, 2000).", "Defense Inventory: Process for Canceling Inventory Orders Needs Improvement (GAO/NSIAD-00-160, June 30, 2000).", "Defense Logistics: Actions Needed to Enhance Success of Reengineering Initiatives (GAO/NSIAD-00-89, June 23, 2000).", "Defense Inventory: Plan to Improve Management of Shipped Inventory Should Be Strengthened (GAO/NSIAD-00-39, Feb. 22, 2000).", "Department of the Navy: Breakdown of In-Transit Inventory Process Leaves It Vulnerable to Fraud (GAO/OSI/NSIAD-00-61, Feb. 2, 2000).", "Defense Inventory: Opportunities Exist to Expand the Use of Defense Logistics Agency Best Practices (GAO/NSIAD-00-30, Jan. 26, 2000).", "Defense Inventory: Management of Repair Parts Common to More Than One Military Service Can Be Improved (GAO/NSIAD-00-21, Oct. 20, 1999).", "Military Operations: Some Funds for Fiscal Year 1999 Contingency Operations Will Be Available for Future Needs (GAO/NSIAD-99-244BR, Sept. 21, 1999).", "Department of Defense: Status of Financial Management Weaknesses and Actions Needed to Correct Continuing Challenges (GAO/T-AIMD/NSIAD-99-171, May 4, 1999).", "Defense Inventory: DOD Could Improve Total Asset Visibility Initiative With Results Act Framework (GAO/NSIAD-99-40, Apr. 12, 1999).", "Defense Reform Initiative: Organization, Status, and Challenges (GAO/NSIAD-99-87, Apr. 21, 1999).", "Defense Inventory: Status of Inventory and Purchases and Their Relationship to Current Needs (GAO/NSIAD-99-60, Apr. 16, 1999).", "Defense Inventory: Continuing Challenges in Managing Inventories and Avoiding Adverse Operational Effects (GAO/T-NSIAD-99-83, Feb. 25, 1999).", "High-Risk Series: An Update (GAO/HR-99-1, Jan. 1999).", "Major Management Challenges and Program Risks: Department of Defense (GAO/OCG-99-4, Jan. 1999).", "Navy Inventory Management: Improvements Needed to Prevent Excess Purchases (GAO/NSIAD-98-86, Apr. 30, 1998).", "Defense Depot Maintenance: DOD Shifting More Workload for New Weapon Systems to the Private Sector (GAO/NSIAD-98-8, Mar. 31, 1998).", "Defense Inventory: Management of Surplus Usable Aircraft Parts Can Be Improved (GAO/NSIAD-98-7, Oct. 2, 1997)."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
