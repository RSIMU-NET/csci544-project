However, some chemicals are highly toxic and need to be regulated. In 1976, the Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, but some have questioned whether TSCA provides EPA with enough tools to protect against chemical risks. Like the United States, the European Union (EU) has laws governing the production and use of chemicals. The EU has recently revised its chemical control policy through legislation known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) in order to better identify and mitigate risks from chemicals. GAO was asked to review the approaches used under TSCA and REACH for (1) requiring chemical companies to develop information on chemicals' effects, (2) controlling risks from chemicals, and (3) making information on chemicals available to the public. To review these issues, GAO analyzed applicable U.S. and EU laws and regulations and interviewed U.S. and EU officials, industry representatives, and environmental advocacy organizations. GAO is making no recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["REACH requires companies to develop information on chemicals' effects on human health and the environment, while TSCA does not require companies to develop such information absent EPA rule-making requiring them to do so. While TSCA does not require companies to develop information on chemicals before they enter commerce (new chemicals), companies are required to provide EPA any information that may already exist on a chemical's impact on human health or the environment. Companies do not have to develop information on the health or environmental impacts of chemicals already in commerce (existing chemicals) unless EPA formally promulgates a rule requiring them to do so. Partly because of the resources and difficulties the agency faces in order to require testing to develop information on existing chemicals, EPA has moved toward using voluntary programs as an alternative means of gathering information from chemical companies in order to assess and control the chemicals under TSCA. While these programs are noteworthy, data collection has been slow in some cases, and it is unclear if the programs will provide EPA enough information to identify and control chemical risks. TSCA places the burden of proof on EPA to demonstrate that a chemical poses a risk to human health or the environment before EPA can regulate its production or use, while REACH generally places a burden on chemical companies to ensure that chemicals do not pose such risks or that measures are identified for handling chemicals safely. In addition, TSCA provides EPA with differing authorities for controlling risks, depending on whether the risks are posed by new or existing chemicals. For new chemicals, EPA can restrict a chemical's production or use if the agency determines that insufficient information exists to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the chemical and that, in the absence of such information, the chemical may present an unreasonable risk. For existing chemicals, EPA may regulate a chemical for which it finds a reasonable basis exists to conclude that it presents or will present an unreasonable risk. Further, TSCA requires EPA to choose the regulatory action that is least burdensome in mitigating the unreasonable risk. However, EPA has found it difficult to promulgate rules under this standard. Under REACH, chemical companies must obtain authorization to use chemicals that are listed as chemicals of very high concern. Generally, to obtain such authorization, chemical companies need to demonstrate that they can adequately control risks posed by the chemical or otherwise ensure that the chemical is used safely. TSCA and REACH both have provisions to protect information claimed by chemical companies as confidential or sensitive business information but REACH requires greater public disclosure of certain information, such as basic chemical properties, including melting and boiling points. In addition, REACH places greater restrictions on the kinds of information chemical companies may claim as confidential."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year thousands of chemicals are used by U.S. industries to produce  Each year thousands of chemicals are used by U.S. industries to produce  items widely used throughout society, including consumer products such  items widely used throughout society, including consumer products such  as cleansers, paints, plastics, and fuels as well as industrial solvents and  as cleansers, paints, plastics, and fuels as well as industrial solvents and  additives.

Some of these laws, such as the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; and the Federal Insecticide,  Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act authorize the control of hazardous  chemicals in, among other things, the air, water, and soil and in food,  drugs, and pesticides.  Other laws, such as the Occupational Safety and  Health Act and the Consumer Product Safety Act, can be used to protect  workers and consumers from unsafe exposures to chemicals in the  workplace and the home.  Nonetheless, the Congress found that human  beings and the environment were being exposed to a large number of  chemicals and that some could pose an unreasonable risk of injury to  health or the environment.  In 1976, the Congress passed TSCA to provide  EPA with the authority to obtain information on chemicals and regulate  those substances that pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the  environment.  While other environmental and occupational health laws  generally control only the release of chemicals in the environment,  exposures in the workplace, or the disposal of chemicals, TSCA allows  EPA to control the entire life cycle of chemicals from their production and  distribution to their use and disposal.", "In October 2003, the European Commission presented a proposal for a  new EU regulatory system for chemicals.  REACH was proposed because  the Commission believed that the current legislative framework for  chemicals in the EU did not produce sufficient information about the  effects of chemicals on human health and the environment. In addition,  the risk assessment process was slow and resource-intensive and did not  allow the regulatory system to work efficiently and effectively.  Under  REACH, authority exists to establish restrictions for any chemical that  poses unacceptable risks and to require authorization for the use of  chemicals identified as being of very high concern.  These restrictions  could include banning uses in certain products, banning uses by  consumers, or even completely banning the chemical.  Authorization will  be granted if a given manufacturer can demonstrate that the risks from a  given use of the chemical can be adequately controlled if a threshold can  be determined for the chemical.  Or, if no threshold can be determined, the  manufacturer has to demonstrate that the socioeconomic benefits  outweigh the risks associated with continued use and that there are no  suitable alternatives or technologies available.  In addition, a key aspect of  REACH is that it places the burden on manufacturers, importers, and  downstream users to ensure that they manufacture, place on the market,  or use such substances that do not adversely affect human health or the  environment.  Its provisions are underpinned by the precautionary  principle.  REACH was approved in December 2006 and went into effect  in June 2007.  To avoid overloading regulators and companies with the  work arising from the registration process, full implementation of all the  provisions of REACH will be phased in over an 11-year period (or by  2018)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "REACH Requires Chemical Companies to Develop More Information than TSCA on the Effects of Chemicals on Human Health and the Environment", "paragraphs": ["TSCA does not require companies to develop information for either new or  existing chemicals, whereas REACH generally requires companies to  submit and, in some circumstances, requires companies to develop such  information for both kinds of chemicals.

This notice provides, among other things, certain  information on the chemical\u2019s intended uses and potential exposure.   TSCA also requires chemical companies to submit data and other  information on the physical/chemical properties, fate, or health and  environmental effects of a chemical, which we refer to in this report as  \"hazard information,\" that the companies possesses or is reasonably  ascertainable by them when they submit a PMN to EPA.  In part because  TSCA does not require chemical companies to develop hazard information  before submitting a PMN, EPA employs several other approaches for  assessing hazards, including using models that compare new chemicals  with existing chemicals with similar molecular structures for which test  data on health and environmental effects are available.  In June 2005, we  recommended that EPA develop a strategy for improving and validating  the models that EPA uses to assess and predict the hazards of chemicals.   EPA is currently devising such a strategy, according to agency officials.", "EPA receives approximately 1,500 new chemical notices each year, half of  which are exemption requests, and has reviewed more than 45,000 from  1979 through 2005.  PMNs include information such as specific chemical  identity estimated maximum production volume for 12 months of  production a description of how the chemical will be processed and used  and estimates of how many workers may be exposed to the chemical.   Additionally, EPA requires that the following information be submitted  with a PMN: all existing health and environmental data in the possession  of the submitter, parent company, or affiliates, and a description of any  existing data known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter.  EPA  estimates that most PMNs do not include test data of any type, and only  about 15 percent include health and safety data\u2014such as acute toxicity or  skin and eye irritation data.", "In some cases, EPA may determine during the review process that more  data are needed for an analysis of a chemical\u2019s potential risks and often  will negotiate an agreement with the chemical company to conduct health  hazard or environmental effects testing.  According to EPA, more than 300  testing agreements have been issued since EPA began reviewing new  chemicals in 1979.  In some cases, however, the chemical company may  voluntarily withdraw the PMN rather than incur the costs of hazard testing  requested by EPA, or for other reasons.  EPA does not maintain records as  to how many PMNs chemical companies have withdrawn because of  potential EPA action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSCA Does Not Require Chemical Companies to Develop Hazard Information for Existing Chemicals, and EPA Uses Regulatory and Voluntary Programs to Gather Such Information for Certain Chemicals", "paragraphs": ["While TSCA does not require chemical companies to develop information  on the harmful effects of existing chemicals on human health or the  environment, TSCA provides that EPA, by issuing a test rule, can require  such information on a case-by-case basis.  Before promulgating such a rule  EPA must find, among other things, that current data are insufficient,  testing is necessary, and that either (1) the chemical may present an  unreasonable risk or (2) the chemical is or will be produced in substantial  quantities and that there is or may be substantial human or environmental  exposure to the chemical.  EPA officials responsible for administering the  act said that TSCA\u2019s test rule provision and data-gathering authorities can  be burdensome and too time consuming for EPA to administer.  Because  EPA has limited information on existing chemicals and the difficulty in  promulgating test rules, EPA uses voluntary programs to help gather more  data to assess risks on certain chemicals.", "While TSCA authorizes EPA to require testing of existing chemicals, the  act does not authorize the agency to do so unless EPA first determines on  the basis of risk or exposure information that the chemicals warrant such  testing.  TSCA provides EPA the authority to obtain hazard information  needed to assess chemicals by issuing rules under Section 4 of TSCA  requiring chemical companies to test to determine the health and  environmental effects of chemicals and submit the test data to EPA.   However, in order for EPA to issue a test rule, the agency must determine  that a chemical (1) may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or  the environment or (2) is or will be produced in substantial quantities and  (a) there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the  chemical or (b) it enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the  environment in substantial quantities.  EPA must also determine that there  are insufficient data to reasonably determine or predict the effects of the  chemical on health or the environment and that testing is necessary to  develop such data.  Once EPA has made the required determination, the  agency can issue a proposed rule for public comment, consider the  comments it receives, and promulgate a final rule ordering chemical  testing.  OPPT officials responsible for implementing TSCA told us that  finalizing rules under Section 4 of TSCA can take from 2 to 10 years and  require the expenditure of substantial resources.  EPA has used its  authority to require testing for about 200 existing chemicals since the  agency began reviewing chemicals under TSCA in 1979.  EPA does not  maintain estimates of the cost of implementing these rules.  However, in  our September 1994 report on TSCA, we noted that EPA officials told us  that issuing a rule under Section 4 can cost up to a $234,000.  Given the  difficulties and cost of requiring testing, EPA could review substantially  more chemicals in less time if it had authority to require chemical  companies to conduct testing and provide test data on chemicals once  they reach a substantial production volume.  In June, 2005, we stated that  Congress may wish to consider amending TSCA to provide EPA such  authority.", "As an alternative to formal rule making, EPA asserts that Section 4 of  TSCA provides EPA implied authority to enter into \"enforceable consent  agreements\" with chemical companies that would require them to conduct  testing when there is insufficient data available to assess a chemical\u2019s risk.   EPA uses enforceable consent agreements to accomplish testing where a  consensus exists among EPA, affected manufacturers and/or processors,  and interested members of the public concerning the need for and scope  of testing.  According to EPA, these agreements allow greater flexibility in  the design of the testing program and negotiating these agreements is  generally less costly and time consuming than promulgating test rules.   EPA has entered into consent agreements with chemical companies to  develop tests for about 60 chemicals where the agency determined  additional data were needed to assess the chemical\u2019s risk.", "Under Section 8 of TSCA, EPA promulgates rules directing chemical  companies to maintain records and submit such information as the EPA  Administrator reasonably requires. This information can include, among  other things, chemical identity, categories of use, production levels, by- products, existing data on adverse health and environmental effects, and  the number of workers exposed to the chemical.  Section 8(d) authorizes  EPA to promulgate rules under which chemical companies are required to  submit lists or copies of any health and safety studies to EPA.  Finally,  Section 8 requires chemical companies to report any information to EPA  that reasonably supports a conclusion that a chemical presents a  substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.", "According to EPA, the agency has issued about 50 Section 8(d) rules  covering approximately 1,000 chemicals.  As a result of these rules, EPA  has received nearly 50,000 studies covering environmental fate, human  health effects, and environmental effects.  However, TSCA Section 8(d)  only applies to existing studies and does not require companies to develop  new studies.", "The TSCA Inventory Update Rule (IUR), currently requires chemical  companies to report every 5 years to EPA the site and manufacturing  information for chemicals in the TSCA inventory that they manufacture or  import in amounts of 25,000 pounds or greater at a single site.  For the  most current reporting cycle and for subsequent reporting cycles,  chemical companies must report additional information\u2014such as uses, the  types of consumer products the chemical will be used in\u2014including those  intended for use by children, and the number of workers who could  potentially be exposed\u2014for chemicals manufactured or imported in  amounts of 300,000 pounds or more at a single site.", "In response to the lack of information on existing chemicals and the  relative difficulty the agency faces in requiring companies to conduct  additional testing under TSCA, EPA has taken efforts to increase the  amount of the information it can access on chemicals by implementing a  voluntary program called the High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge  Program.  The HPV Challenge Program focuses on obtaining chemical  company sponsors to voluntarily provide data on approximately 2,800  chemicals that chemical companies reported in 1990 were domestically  produced or imported at a high volume\u2014over 1 million pounds.  Through  this program, sponsors develop a basic set of screening level information  on the chemicals either by gathering available data, using models to  predict the chemicals\u2019 properties, or conducting testing of the chemicals.", "The six data endpoints collected under the HPV Challenge Program are  acute toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, developmental and reproductive  toxicity, mutagenicity, ecotoxicity, and environmental fate.  EPA believes  that these basic data are needed to make an informed, preliminary  judgment about the hazards of HPV chemicals.  In June 2005, we  recommended that EPA develop a methodology for using information  collected through the HPV Challenge Program to prioritize chemicals for  further review.  EPA\u2019s Director of OPPT told us the agency developed  such a methodology as data from chemical companies became available  and are currently applying the methodology to assess HPV chemicals.  The  methodology was developed based on input received from an advisory  committee, the National Pollution Prevention and Toxics Advisory  Committee (NPPTAC).", "Despite these promising voluntary efforts regarding high-production- volume chemicals, several difficulties remain, as we have noted in our  prior work.  For example, (1) chemical companies have not agreed to test  approximately 300 chemicals identified by EPA as high-production-volume  chemicals; (2) additional chemicals will become high-production  chemicals in the constantly changing commercial chemical marketplace;  and (3) chemicals without a particularly high-production volume may also  warrant testing, based on their toxicity and the nature of exposure to  them.  In addition, this program may not provide enough information for  EPA to use in making risk-assessment decisions.  While the data in the  HPV Challenge Program and the new exposure and use reporting under  the IUR may help EPA prioritize chemicals of concern, the data may not  provide sufficient evidence for EPA to determine whether a reasonable  basis exists to conclude that the chemical presents an unreasonable risk of  injury to health or the environment and that regulatory action is necessary.   Although the chemical industry may be willing to take action, even before  EPA has the evidence required for rule making under TSCA, the industry is  nonetheless large and diverse, and it is uncertain that all companies will  always take action voluntarily.", "To ensure that adequate data are made publicly available to assess the  special impact that industrial chemicals may have on children, EPA  launched the Voluntary Children\u2019s Chemical Evaluation Program  (VCCEP).  In December 2000, EPA implemented VCCEP first as a pilot  program.  EPA\u2019s goal is to learn from this pilot program before a final  VCCEP process is determined and before additional chemicals are  selected.  For the VCCEP pilot, EPA identified 23 commercial chemicals to  which children have a high likelihood of exposure and the information  needed to assess the risks to children from these chemicals.  Recently,  EPA requested comments on the implementation of the pilot program  from stakeholders and other interested parties but has not yet responded  to the comments or evaluated the program for its effectiveness.", "EPA is running a pilot of the VCCEP so it can gain insight into how best to  design and implement the VCCEP in order to effectively provide the  agency and the public with the means to understand the potential health  risks to children associated with exposure to these and ultimately other  chemicals to which children may be exposed.  EPA intends the pilot to be  the means of identifying efficiencies that can be applied to any subsequent  implementation of the VCCEP.  Another purpose for running the pilot is  the opportunity it will offer to test the performance of the peer  consultation process.  For the VCCEP pilot, the purpose of the peer  consultation process is to provide a forum for scientists and relevant  experts from various stakeholder groups to exchange scientific views on  the chemical sponsor's data submissions and in particular on the  recommended data needs.", "Under the VCCEP pilot, EPA is pursuing a three-tiered approach for  gathering information, with tier 3 involving more detailed toxicology and  exposure studies than tier 2, and tier 2 involving more detailed toxicology  and exposure studies than tier 1.  EPA asked companies that produce  and/or import 23 specific chemicals to volunteer to sponsor their chemical  in the first tier of the VCCEP pilot.  EPA selected these 23 chemicals  because the agency believed them to be especially relevant to children\u2019s  chemical exposures, such as the presence of the chemical in human tissue  or blood, in food and water children eat and drink, and in air children  breathe.  In addition, many of these chemicals were known to be relatively  \u201cdata rich\u201d in that chemical data were already available.  Chemical  companies have volunteered to sponsor 20 of the 23 chemicals in the  VCCEP.  EPA believes that these 20 chemicals provide an adequate basis  for evaluating the VCCEP pilot.", "Chemical companies volunteering to sponsor a chemical under the  program have agreed to make chemical-specific public commitments to  make certain hazard, exposure, and risk assessment data and analyses  publicly available.  For toxicity data, specific types of studies have been  assigned to each of the three tiers.  For exposure data, the depth of  exposure information increases with each tier.  If data needs are identified  through the peer consultation process, the sponsor will choose whether to  volunteer for any additional data generation or testing and whether to  provide additional assessments in subsequent tiers.  However, company  sponsors are under no obligation to volunteer for tiers 2 and 3, even if EPA  determines additional information is needed.  After the submission of tier  1 information and its review by the peer consultation group\u2014consisting of  scientific experts with extensive and broad experience in toxicity testing  and exposure evaluations\u2014EPA reviews the sponsor\u2019s assessment and  develops a response, focusing primarily on whether any additional  information is needed to adequately evaluate the potential risks to  children.  If additional information is needed, EPA will indicate what  information should be provided in tier 2.  Companies will then be given an  opportunity to sponsor chemicals at tier 2. EPA plans to repeat this  process to determine whether tier 3 information is needed. Information  from all three tiers may not always be necessary to adequately evaluate the  risk to children.", "According to EPA officials, since the program\u2019s inception, sponsors have  submitted 15 of the 20 assessments on chemicals to EPA and the peer  consultation group. The peer consultation group has issued reports on 13  of the 15 chemical submissions.  EPA has issued Data Needs Decisions on  11 of these 13 chemicals for which EPA determined that 5 chemicals  needed additional data.  One of the sponsors agreed to commit to tier 2  and to provide the additional data to EPA.  The sponsor of two other  chemicals declined to commit to tier 2 since it had ceased manufacturing  the chemicals in 2004.  The sponsor of the other 2 chemicals told EPA it  will decide whether to commit to the additional testing by the end of July  2007.", "In November 2006, EPA requested comments on the implementation of the  pilot program from stakeholders and interested parties.  As part of its  request for comments, EPA included a list of questions that the agency  believed would be helpful in its evaluation of the pilot program.  The  questions ranged from asking about the sufficiency of the hazard,  exposure, and risk assessments provided by the chemical sponsors; to the  effectiveness and efficiency of the peer review panel; to the timeliness of  the VCCEP pilot in providing data.  EPA received comments from 11  interested parties, including from industry representatives, environmental  organizations, children\u2019s health advocacy groups, and other interested  parties.  Generally, the industry groups provided positive comments about  the pilot while the children\u2019s health advocacy and environmental groups  provided negative comments about VCCEP.  For example, the American  Chemistry Council commented that the pilot is proceeding well, the  current tiered approach is sound, and that only minimal improvements are  needed.  One of the improvements the chemistry council suggested is that  EPA should make the data generated under the pilot more accessible to  the public, other EPA program offices, and to other federal and state  agencies.  Conversely, the American Academy of Pediatrics commented  that the VCCEP pilot is failing in its goal to provide timely or useful  information on chemical exposures and their implications to the public or  to health care providers.  EPA plans to prepare a comments document  summarizing the comments received from the stakeholders and publish it  on the VCCEP Web site.  In addition, EPA plans to have a final evaluation  of the effectiveness of the VCCEP pilot in late 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "REACH Requires Chemical Companies to Submit Hazard Information for New and Existing Chemicals That Meet Specified Production and Toxicity Levels", "paragraphs": ["REACH created a single system for the regulation of new and existing  chemicals and, once implemented, will generally require chemical  companies to register chemicals produced or imported at 1 ton or more  per producer or importer per year with a newly created European  Chemicals Agency.

For example, at the one or more tonnage band,  REACH requires information on environmental effects that include short- term toxicity on invertebrates, toxicity to algae, and ready  biodegradability.  At the 10 or more tonnage band, REACH requires such  information in addition to a chemical safety assessment, which includes an  assessment of the chemical\u2019s human health and environmental hazards; a  physiochemical hazard assessment; an environmental hazard assessment;  and an assessment of the chemical\u2019s potential to be a persistent,  bioaccumulative, and toxic pollutant, which are chemicals that create  pollutants that persist in the environment, bioaccumulate in food chains,  and are toxic.", "Table 1 shows the total number of chemical endpoints\u2014the chemical or  biological effect that is assessed by a test method\u2014required for chemicals  produced at various production volumes, where applicable, for TSCA, the  HPV Challenge Program, and REACH.

The five chemicals or chemical classes are polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCB), fully halogenated chlorofluoroalkanes, dioxin, asbestos,  and hexavalent chromium.  In addition, under Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA, for  160 existing chemicals, EPA issued significant new use rules that require  chemical companies to submit notices to EPA prior to commencing the  manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for a significant new  use.", "In order to regulate an existing chemical under Section 6(a) of TSCA, EPA  must find that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the chemical  presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the  environment.  Before regulating a chemical under Section 6(a), the EPA  Administrator must consider and publish a statement regarding  the effects of the chemical on human health and the magnitude of human  exposure to the chemical; the effects of the chemical on the environment and the magnitude of the  environment\u2019s exposure to the chemical; the benefits of the chemical for various uses and the availability of  substitutes for those uses; and the reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule, after  consideration of the effect on the national economy, small business,  technological innovation, the environment, and public health.", "Further, the regulation must apply the least burdensome requirement that  will adequately protect against such risk.  For example, if EPA finds that it  can adequately manage the unreasonable risk of a chemical through  requiring chemical companies to place warning labels on the chemical,  EPA could not ban or otherwise restrict the use of that chemical.", "Additionally, if the EPA Administrator determines that a risk of injury to  health or the environment could be eliminated or sufficiently reduced by  actions under another federal law, then TSCA prohibits EPA from  promulgating a rule under Section 6(a) of TSCA, unless EPA finds that it is  in the public interest considering all aspects of the risk, the estimated  costs of compliance, and the relative efficiency of such action to protect  against risk of injury.", "Finally, EPA must also develop substantial evidence in the rule-making  record in order to withstand judicial review.

Specifically, these  officials say that EPA must take into account the benefits provided by the  various uses of the chemical, the availability of substitutes, and the  reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of regulating the  chemical after considering the effects of such regulation on the national  economy, small business, technological innovation, the environment, and  public health.", "EPA\u2019s 1989 asbestos rule illustrates the evidentiary requirements that  TSCA places on EPA to control chemicals under TSCA Section 6(a).  The  rule prohibited the future manufacture, importation, processing, and  distribution of asbestos in almost all products.  Some of the manufacturers  of these asbestos products filed suit against EPA, arguing that the rule was  not promulgated on the basis of substantial evidence regarding  unreasonable risk.  In October 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth  Circuit agreed with the manufacturers, concluding that EPA had failed to  muster substantial evidence to justify its asbestos ban and returning parts  of the rule to EPA for reconsideration.", "In reaching this conclusion, the court found that EPA did not consider all  necessary evidence and failed to show that the control action it chose was  the least burdensome reasonable regulation required to adequately protect  human health or the environment.  As articulated by the court, the proper  course of action for EPA, after an initial showing of product danger, would  have been to consider the costs and benefits of each regulatory option  available under Section 6, starting with the less restrictive options, such as  product labeling, and working up through a partial ban to a complete ban.   The court further criticized EPA's ban of asbestos in products for which  no substitutes were currently available stating that, in such cases, EPA  \u201cbears a tough burden\u201d to demonstrate, as TSCA requires, that a ban is the  least burdensome alternative.", "The court\u2019s decision on the asbestos rule is especially revealing about  Section 6 because EPA spent 10 years preparing the rule.  In addition,  asbestos is generally regarded as one of the substances for which EPA has  the most scientific evidence or documentation of substantial adverse  health effects.  Since the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling  in October 1991, EPA has not used TSCA Section 6 to restrict any  chemicals.  However, EPA has used Section 6 to issue a proposed ban on  certain grouts, which was later withdrawn when industry agreed to use  personal protection equipment to address worker exposure issues, and  issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making for methyl-t-butyl  ether because of widespread drinking water contamination.  Although  TSCA\u2019s Section 6 has been used infrequently, the Director of OPPT and  other EPA officials responsible for implementing TSCA told us that they  believe that taking action under this section remains a practicable option  for the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSCA\u2019s Section 5 Provides Limited Authority to Restrict New Chemicals", "paragraphs": ["Section 5(a)(2) requires chemical companies to notify EPA at least 90 days  before beginning to manufacture or process a chemical for a use that EPA  has determined by rule is a significant new use.  EPA has these 90 days to  review the chemical information in the premanufacture notice and identify  the chemical\u2019s potential risks.  Under Section 5(e), if EPA determines that  there is insufficient information available to permit a reasoned evaluation  of the health and environmental effects of a chemical and that (1), in  absence of such information, the chemical may present an unreasonable  risk of injury to health or the environment or (2) it is or will be produced  in substantial quantities and (a) it either enters or may reasonably be  anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or (b) there  is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance,  then EPA can issue a proposed order or seek a court injunction to prohibit  or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or  disposal of the chemical.  Under Section 5(f), if EPA finds that the  chemical will present an unreasonable risk, EPA must act to protect  against the risk.  If EPA finds that there is a reasonable basis to conclude  that a new chemical may pose an unreasonable risk before it can protect  against such risk by regulating it under Section 6 of TSCA, EPA can (1)  issue a proposed rule, effective immediately, to require the chemical to be  marked with adequate warnings or instructions, to restrict its use, or to  ban or limit the production of the chemical or (2) seek a court injunction  or issue a proposed order to prohibit the manufacture, processing, or  distribution of the chemical.  According to the Director of OPPT, it is less  difficult for the agency to demonstrate that a chemical \u201cmay present\u201d an  unreasonable risk than it is to show that a chemical \u201cwill present\u201d such a  risk.  Thus, EPA has found it easier to impose controls on new chemicals  when warranted.", "Despite limitations in the information available on new chemicals, EPA\u2019s  reviews have resulted in some action being taken to reduce the risks of  over 3,800 of the 33,000 new chemicals that chemical companies have  submitted for review since 1979.  These actions included, among other  things, chemical companies voluntarily withdrawing their notices of intent  to manufacture new chemicals, and entering into consent orders with EPA  to produce a chemical only under specified conditions.  In addition, EPA  has promulgated significant new use rules requiring chemical companies  to notify EPA of their intent to manufacture or process certain chemicals  for any uses that EPA has determined to be a \"significant new use.\"  For over 1,700 chemicals, companies withdrew their PMNs sometimes  after EPA officials indicated that the agency planned to initiate the process  for placing controls on the chemicals, such as requiring testing or  prohibiting the production or certain uses of the chemical.  The Director of  OPPT told us that after EPA has screened a new chemical or performed a  detailed analysis of it, chemical companies may drop their plans to market  the chemical when the chemical\u2019s niche in the marketplace is uncertain  and EPA requests that the company develop and submit test data or apply  exposure controls.  According to EPA officials, companies may be  uncertain that they will recoup costs associated with the test data and  controls and prefer to withdraw their PMN.  In addition, for over 1,300  chemicals, EPA issued orders requiring chemical companies to implement  workplace controls or practices during manufacturing pending the  development of information on the risks posed by the chemicals and/or to  perform toxicity testing if the chemicals\u2019 production volumes reached  certain levels.", "For over 570 of the 33,000 new chemicals submitted for review, EPA  required chemical companies to submit notices for any significant new  uses of the chemical, providing EPA the opportunity to review the risks of  injury to human health or the environment before new uses begin.

First, the European Chemicals  Agency will publish a list of chemicals\u2014known as the candidate list\u2014that  potentially need authorization before they can be used.  The chemical  agency will determine which chemicals to place on the candidate list after  it has reviewed the information that chemical companies submit to the  agency at the time the chemicals are registered under REACH and after  considering the input provided by individual EU member states and the  European Commission.  In making this determination, the agency is to use  criteria set forth in REACH, covering issues such as bioaccumulation,  carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity.  Secondly, the European  Commission will determine which chemicals on the candidate list will  require authorization and which will be exempted from the authorization  requirements.  According to the Environment Counselor for the Delegation  of the European Commission to the United States, some chemicals may be  exempted from authorization requirements because, so far, sufficient  controls established by other legislation are already in place.  Finally, once  a chemical has been deemed to require authorization, a chemical company  will have to apply to the European Commission for an authorization for  each use of the chemical.", "The application for authorization must include an analysis of the technical  and economic feasibility of using safer substitutes and, if appropriate,  information about any relevant research and development activities by the  applicant.  If such an analysis shows that suitable alternatives are available  for any use of the chemical, then the application must also include a plan  for how the company plans to substitute the safer chemical for the  chemical of concern in that particular use.  The European Commission is  generally required to grant an authorization if the applicant meets the  burden of demonstrating that the risks from the manufacture, use, or  disposal of the chemical can be adequately controlled, except for (1)  PBTs; (2) very persistent, very bioaccumulative chemicals (vPvBs); and (3)  certain other chemicals including those that are carcinogenic or  reproductive toxins.  However, even these chemicals may receive  authorization if a chemical company can demonstrate that social and  economic benefits outweigh the risks.  In addition, 6 years after REACH  goes into effect (or in 2013), the European Commission will review  whether endocrine disrupters should also be excluded from authorization  unless chemical companies can demonstrate that the social and economic  benefits outweigh their risks.", "Eventually, all chemicals granted authorizations under REACH will be  reviewed to ensure that they can be safely manufactured, used, and  disposed.  The time frame for such reviews will be determined on a case- by-case basis that takes into account information such as the risks posed  by the chemical, the availability of safer alternatives, and the social and  economic benefits of the use of the chemical.  For example, if suitable  substitutes become available, the authorization may be amended or  withdrawn, even if the chemical company granted the authorization has  demonstrated that the chemical can be safely controlled.", "In addition to such authorization procedures, REACH provides procedures  for placing restrictions on chemicals that pose an unacceptable risk to  health or the environment.  The restriction may completely ban a chemical  or limit its use by consumers or by manufacturers of certain products.   REACH\u2019s restrictions procedures enable the EU to regulate  communitywide conditions for the manufacture, marketing, or use of  certain chemicals where there is an unacceptable risk to health or the  environment.  Proposals for restrictions will be prepared by either a  Member State or by the European Chemicals Agency at the request of the  European Commission.  The proposal must demonstrate that there is a  risk to human health or the environment that needs to be addressed at the  communitywide level and to identify the most appropriate set of risk  reduction measures.  Interested parties will have an opportunity to  comment on the restriction proposal.  However, the final determination on  the restriction proposal will be made by the European Commission.

State environmental agencies and others  are interested in obtaining chemical information, including that claimed as  confidential, for use in various activities, such as developing contingency  plans to alert emergency response personnel of the presence of highly  toxic substances at local manufacturing facilities.  Likewise, the general  public may find information collected under TSCA useful to engage in  dialogues with chemical companies about reducing chemical risks and  limiting chemical exposures at nearby facilities that produce or use toxic  chemicals.", "While EPA believes that some claims of confidential business information  may be unwarranted, challenging the claims is resource-intensive.   According to a 1992 EPA study, the latest performed by the agency,  problems with inappropriate claims were extensive.  This study examined  the extent to which companies made confidential business information  claims, the validity of the claims, and the impact of inappropriate claims  on the usefulness of TSCA data to the public.  The study found that many  of the confidentiality claims submitted under TSCA were not appropriate,  particularly for health and safety data.
