Although IRS made some changes to its correspondence, improved its examiner training, and expanded taxpayer outreach, certain aspects of the recertification process continue to cause problems for taxpayers. Since the inception of the EIC Recertification Program in 1998, IRS has taken steps to improve some of the letters and forms it uses to correspond with taxpayers about the program. However, two standard forms that IRS uses in corresponding with taxpayers as part of the recertification process can lead to unnecessary taxpayer burden.

From January through December 2001, according to IRS, about $31 billion was paid to about 19.0 million EIC claimants. While it is important to ensure that all persons eligible for the EIC receive it, equally important is the need to identify and deny erroneous claims, whether due to fraud, negligence, or confusion. Because of a concern about the extent of erroneous EIC claims, the Congress included provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97) that led to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) establishment of a compliance effort known as the EIC recertification program. Under the program, taxpayers who have been disallowed the EIC through an IRS audit are to substantiate their qualification for the EIC before IRS recertifies them to receive the credit again.", "Because of the need to strike an appropriate balance between compliance and taxpayer burden, you asked us to assess the EIC recertification program. Our objectives were to determine whether (1) IRS\u2019s communications with taxpayers about recertification meet the needs of IRS and taxpayers, (2) information taxpayers are told to provide to prove their entitlement to the EIC is reasonably easy to obtain and consistent with what IRS examiners accept in making recertification decisions, and (3) examiners are consistent in how they assess supporting documentation provided by taxpayers.", "Our assessment of the recertification program included analyses of IRS forms, correspondence, and guidance related to recertification; interviews of IRS examiners who worked on recertification cases; and interviews of representatives from organizations who provide assistance to low-income taxpayers in controversies with IRS.

Taxpayers earning income below a certain level may claim the credit. The amount of the EIC increases with increasing income, plateaus at a certain level of earnings, and then decreases until it reaches zero when earned income exceeds the maximum earning level allowed for the credit. Taxpayers with children can claim the EIC if they (1) have at least one EIC qualifying child, (2) meet income tests, (3) file with any filing status except \u201cmarried filing separately,\u201d and (4) were not a nonresident alien for any part of the year. To claim the EIC without a qualifying child, taxpayers must meet requirements 2, 3, and 4; be at least 25 years old but less than 65 at the end of the year; have lived in the United States for more than half the year; and not be claimed as a dependent on another return.", "Although the EIC has been credited with reducing welfare participation and lifting millions of low-income earners out of poverty, it has also been susceptible to error and abuse. In a February 28, 2002, report on its study of tax year 1999 EIC claims, IRS said that of the estimated $31.3 billion in EIC claims for that tax year, between $9.7 billion and $11.1 billion (30.9 to 35.5 percent) was overclaimed. Of the overclaims, the largest amount (about $2.3 billion) was caused by taxpayers claiming children who did not meet the qualifying child criteria. Most often, according to IRS, these errors were due to taxpayers claiming children who did not meet the residency requirements.", "EIC eligibility, particularly related to qualifying children, is difficult for IRS to verify through its traditional enforcement procedures, such as matching return data to third-party information reports. Correctly determining whether a child claimed by the taxpayer for EIC purposes meets the qualifying tests requires IRS to have detailed knowledge of the taxpayer\u2019s household composition and living arrangements. However, IRS does not have the necessary resources to visit taxpayers\u2019 homes and conduct the kind of interviews that would help it obtain that kind of detailed knowledge, and there is no certainty that the cost of such an effort would be worth the results. Thus, IRS must rely on its ability to clearly communicate to taxpayers what information is needed to certify them for the EIC and on taxpayers\u2019 ability to produce documentation to substantiate their qualification for the EIC.", "IRS began implementing the recertification process in 1998, when, through audits, it disallowed in whole or in part, the EIC claims on about 312,000 tax year 1997 returns and placed recertification indicators on its computerized accounts for those taxpayers. The indicators, which, in effect, tell IRS\u2019s computers not to allow payment of any EIC claim to the taxpayers, are to remain until the taxpayers successfully recertify. To begin the recertification process, taxpayers are to attach a Form 8862 (Information To Claim Earned Income Credit After Disallowance) to the next tax return they file that includes an EIC claim. If a taxpayer claims the EIC without attaching Form 8862, IRS is authorized to disallow the credit, process the return without considering the EIC claim, and inform the taxpayer why it denied the claim.", "Upon receipt of Form 8862, IRS procedures call for freezing the entire refund claimed on the return (not just the portion related to the EIC) and determining whether the return should be selected for audit. IRS examiners are to select the return for audit unless the taxpayer is no longer claiming the EIC child(ren) previously disallowed and is not claiming a new EIC child. Once the return has been selected for audit, the recertification process, with some minor differences, essentially follows IRS\u2019s normal procedures for correspondence audits. These procedures generally involve examiners (1) asking taxpayers to provide support, (2) reviewing any support provided, and (3) advising taxpayers of the audit results.", "Since the EIC recertification program\u2019s implementation, IRS has, among other things, expanded the information on recertification available to taxpayers, revised some of the correspondence it sends to taxpayers, and improved examiner training. Many of these changes were in response to recommendations resulting from prior reviews by us and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). (See app. I for a detailed discussion of the changes in the EIC Recertification Program since 1999, and see app. II for information on prior recommendations by us and TIGTA and IRS\u2019s corrective actions.) There have also been some significant program developments since 1998. Most relevant to this report, (1) the definitions of qualifying child and eligible foster child for EIC purposes have changed and (2) starting with tax returns filed in 2001, IRS, as authorized by TRA97, began imposing a 2-year ban on credits to taxpayers who it determines negligently claimed the EIC through reckless or intentional disregard of the regulations.

The purpose of our survey was to determine how examiners evaluated evidential support from taxpayers and to help identify aspects of the EIC eligibility criteria that taxpayers had the most difficulty documenting. More details on our survey methods, as well as the confidence intervals of the estimates for all examiners that we made from our sample are provided in appendix III.", "We talked with representatives from 10 LITCs about any problems taxpayers have in understanding IRS correspondence related to recertification and in complying with IRS\u2019s documentation requirements. We obtained a list from IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s Office of the 102 LITCs that were operating in 2001. From that list, we randomly selected 20 LITCs. After eliminating those LITCs that either chose not to participate or said that they did no EIC recertification work, we talked with representatives of 10 LITCs. Given our relatively small sample size and the relatively small proportion of the sample from which we were able to get useful information, we have no assurance that the results from this sample can be reliably generalized to all 102 LITCs. However, our sample does provide the views of about one-tenth of the listed 102 LITCs.", "To determine whether IRS\u2019s treatment of similarly situated taxpayers is consistent, we analyzed IRS guidance and criteria related to the EIC and recertification; developed five scenarios involving various kinds of documentation that taxpayers might provide IRS in an attempt to prove their eligibility for the EIC; and held structured interviews with 21 examiners to determine, among other things, how they interpreted IRS\u2019s recertification guidance and how they assessed the documentation in our five scenarios. We obtained the documents for our scenarios from EIC recertification cases that we had reviewed, and we deleted taxpayer- identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, from the documents before giving them to the examiners. We subjectively selected the 21 examiners, on the basis of their availability to meet with us, from the 187 EIC recertification examiners at 4 of IRS\u2019s 10 processing centers (Atlanta, Brookhaven, Kansas City, and Memphis). As such, the results of this analysis cannot be generalized beyond the 21 examiners.

In a 1999 report, we raised concerns about the usefulness of Form 8862 and its potential for misleading or confusing taxpayers. We recommended that IRS stop using the form if it is not needed for recertification purposes. IRS did not eliminate the form because it said it relies on the form to \u201cidentify the type of action to be taken for taxpayers required to recertify.\u201d In that regard, IRS does use Form 8862 to decide whether or not to initiate the recertification process. If a taxpayer files a return claiming the EIC and does not attach a Form 8862, IRS is authorized to disallow the credit without going through the recertification process and inform the taxpayer that the disallowance is due to the failure to attach Form 8862. If a taxpayer submits Form 8862, according to IRS\u2019s recertification guidelines, the taxpayer\u2019s return is to be forwarded for audit if the taxpayer is still claiming the previously disallowed EIC child or is claiming a new EIC child. However, Form 8862 does not assist in this determination, because the names and Social Security numbers of the taxpayer\u2019s children that IRS needs to match against the prior year\u2019s tax return do not appear on the form.", "On the basis of our telephone survey of IRS examiners, we estimate that 86 percent of all examiners working in the recertification program do not find Form 8862 useful. A few examiners pointed out that Form 8862 is generally not part of the case file they receive when they begin recertification. Even when Form 8862 is in the case file, some examiners said that they do not use it because there are no supporting documents submitted with the form. Although the great majority of examiners do not find Form 8862 useful, IRS estimates that taxpayers need an average of 2 hours and 44 minutes to complete and file the form. In that regard, of the 10 LITC representatives we talked with, 7 said that Form 8862 is not easy for most of their clients to understand.", "Thirteen of the examiners we surveyed did say that Form 8862 had some value. Some pointed out that the form gave them some initial information about the taxpayer before seeking additional information. Others said that the form would alert taxpayers to the kind of documentation they should expect to provide during the recertification process. However, taxpayers would have to deduce the type of information needed because neither Form 8862 nor its instructions specifically tell taxpayers what, if any, documentation they may be asked to send IRS.", "On the basis of our telephone survey, we determined that an estimated 16 percent of examiners believe that Form 8862 misleads taxpayers into thinking that IRS\u2019s final decision on their eligibility will be based on information in the form. Such a misconception seems understandable given the amount of information taxpayers are asked to provide on the Form 8862. Form 8862 is a 2-page form that requires taxpayers who are claiming the EIC with qualifying children to answer numerous questions and report information on such things as (1) the name of the school the child attended or the day care provider, (2) addresses where the child lived during the year, (3) the name and social security number of any other person the child may have lived with for more than half a year, and (4) the child\u2019s health care provider or social worker if the child was disabled and older than 18."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Form 886-R Provides Confusing and Incomplete Information", "paragraphs": ["Form 886-R is the vehicle IRS examiners use to tell taxpayers what information they need to provide to prove their eligibility for the EIC as well as to gather information on two other tax issues\u2014whether the taxpayer can also claim dependents and whether the taxpayer qualifies as a head of household.

For example, in addition to listing documents and information needed to prove eligibility for the EIC, the form lists documents and information needed to prove eligibility for dependent exemptions and the head of household filing status. Requesting documentary evidence to support a dependency claim and head of household filing status could confuse or mislead taxpayers about the requirements they need to meet for EIC recertification. To claim a person as a dependent, for example, a taxpayer must generally prove, among other things, that he or she provided more than one-half of the person\u2019s total support during the calendar year. Therefore, the evidence IRS asks taxpayers to submit to prove that a child is their dependent includes documentation relating to financial support. However, the law does not require that taxpayers meet a financial support test to claim the EIC, and, thus, taxpayers can qualify for the EIC even if they cannot meet the financial support requirement for the dependency exemption. Form 886-R does not make clear that persons can still qualify for the EIC even if they cannot prove that their child qualified as a dependent, and there are no instructions sent to taxpayers along with the Form 886-R that provide that clarification. Thus, persons might incorrectly assume that because they cannot substantiate a child as a dependent, they do not qualify for the EIC.", "Taxpayers might also be confused by the references in Form 886-R to school records. The form tells taxpayers that one acceptable form of proof that a child lived with them is a school record or transcript containing, among other things, \u201cdates of attendance for the entire tax year.\u201d Since a tax year generally runs from January to December of the same year and a school year typically runs from September of one year to May or June of the next, some taxpayers may not easily discern that they need to obtain school records for 2 school years in order to provide adequate documentation for 1 tax year. In that regard, an IRS taxpayer advocate and an IRS lead examiner in one field office both told us that school year versus tax year is a difficult concept for taxpayers to understand, and examiners we interviewed said that school records submitted by taxpayers often relate to a school year rather than a tax year. The lack of more specific guidance on Form 886-R about the need for 2 years of school data increases the risk that a taxpayer will submit incorrect information, which, at a minimum, could (1) cause extra work for the examiner, (2) cause the taxpayer to contact the school again, and (3) delay a final decision on the taxpayer\u2019s eligibility for the EIC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Information", "paragraphs": ["With a trend toward more nontraditional family units and recent changes in the definitions of qualifying child and foster child for EIC purposes, taxpayers must clearly understand what evidence IRS requires to substantiate the EIC relationship requirement.

None of these documents is mentioned on the Form 886-R. Although an examiner may eventually obtain the necessary documentation through follow-up correspondence with the taxpayer, the need for additional correspondence leads to extra work for examiners and taxpayers and can lengthen the time needed to close the audit and pay the EIC, if the taxpayer is found eligible.", "Census Bureau statistics provide an indication of the prevalence of nontraditional family units. According to 1997 Census Bureau statistics, there were 3.9 million children living in homes maintained by their grandparents. Of this number, 1.27 million lived with their grandparents without the presence of either parent, 1.77 million had only a mother present, 0.57 million had both parents present, and 0.28 million had only a father present. According to Census Bureau statistics, the greatest growth between 1992 and 1997 occurred among grandchildren living with grandparents with no parent present. The Census Bureau attributed the increase in grandchildren in these \u201cskipped generation\u201d living arrangements to the growth in drug use among parents, teen pregnancy, divorce, the rapid rise of single-parent households, mental and physical illness, AIDS, crime, child abuse and neglect, and the incarceration of parents.", "In addition to children living with grandparents without the presence of either parent, the Census Bureau found, as of Fall 1996, that 688,000 children without parents were living with other relatives and 622,000 children without parents were living with nonrelatives.", "Recent changes in the definitions of qualifying child and foster child for EIC purposes further highlight the need for IRS to make clear what evidence it requires to substantiate the EIC relationship requirement. To qualify as a taxpayer\u2019s qualifying child in tax year 1999, a person had to be the taxpayer\u2019s son, daughter, adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, or foster child, with a foster child defined as any child that (1) the taxpayer cared for as if it were the taxpayer\u2019s own child and (2) lived with the taxpayer for the whole year, except for temporary absences. Those definitions were revised first by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-170) and then by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-16).", "As a net result of those two laws, the current definition of a qualifying child is (1) a son, daughter, stepson, or stepdaughter, or a descendant of any such individual; (2) a brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister, or a descendant of any such individual, who the taxpayer cares for as the taxpayer\u2019s own child; or (3) an eligible foster child of the taxpayer. An eligible foster child is now defined as an individual who is placed with the taxpayer by an authorized placement agency and cared for as the taxpayer\u2019s own child. Also, a child who is legally adopted or is placed with the taxpayer by an authorized placement agency for adoption is considered the taxpayer\u2019s child by blood for purposes of the EIC relationship test.", "With these definitional changes, for example, a taxpayer claiming a nephew as an EIC-qualifying child would have to provide documentation to prove that the child is a descendant of the taxpayer\u2019s sibling.

The problem is compounded by the clear implication on Form 886-R that a \u201cnotarized statement from a child care provider\u201d containing certain information, such as the child\u2019s name, address, and dates of care for the entire tax year, is acceptable documentation to verify that a child lived with the taxpayer.

In a March 1996 report entitled, Who\u2019s Minding Our Preschoolers?, and an update issued in November 1997, the Census Bureau found that, in 1993 and 1994, relatives provided care for 62 percent of preschoolers in poor families while their mothers were working.

Of the 19 examiners who accepted the Case B documentation, 7 said that they did so because the taxpayer was married and filed jointly and because the child lived with both parents and 1 said that he was swayed by the school verification (the other 11 did not explain their reasoning). Case C was almost unanimously rejected because examiners would not accept a notarized letter from the taxpayer\u2019s grandmother who claimed to be the child-care provider. Although the grandmother\u2019s letter had met all the specifications listed on Form 886-R, examiners still did not accept it as adequate proof of living arrangement. This is consistent with the results of our examiner interviews, which, as discussed earlier, showed that 79 percent of examiners would not accept such a letter. In Case E, we included a nonrelative babysitter\u2019s letter as evidence of residence. Although the babysitter\u2019s letter was not notarized and did not have the babysitter\u2019s Social Security number or address, more examiners were willing to accept this letter than the notarized letter in Case C from a grandmother who gave her Social Security number as required by IRS.", "Examiners\u2019 decisions varied significantly in Cases A and D. For Case A, three examiners pointed out that they would not accept the school record submitted because it pertained to a school year and not the tax year.

According to the Director of Reporting Compliance in IRS\u2019s Wage and Investment Division, IRS is in the process of developing a decision support tool to be used by examiners working EIC cases. Because all EIC audits involve the same basic issue\u2014proving that the EIC claim satisfies all eligibility tests\u2014the decision tool is to be used for all EIC cases, including those involving recertification. The goals of this project are to (1) automate the decision process examiners go through when performing audits, (2) reduce inconsistency in how EIC audits are conducted nationwide and subsequently improve the quality of examinations, and (3) decrease the time spent on EIC audits since the logic will be built into the tool to determine the appropriate questions for the individual case. IRS is planning to implement the first phase of this project and deliver training to examiners by May 2002.", "As described to us by the Director of Reporting Compliance, the first phase basically involves automating the current process. As such, it does not include a reconsideration of the documentation requirements discussed in this report.

IRS has to balance its efforts to help ensure that all qualified persons claim the credit with its efforts to protect the integrity of the tax system by guarding against fraud and other forms of noncompliance associated with the EIC. Furthermore, as with other provisions of the tax code, IRS must minimize the burden imposed on taxpayers yet ensure that it has a reasonable basis for judging whether taxpayers have properly claimed the credit. Although the recertification program provides a vehicle for combating EIC noncompliance, we believe that the program unnecessarily burdens taxpayers and provides inadequate assurance that IRS has a reasonable evidentiary basis for determining whether recertification applicants should be granted the EIC. As a consequence, taxpayers may be discouraged from claiming credits to which they are entitled or IRS may make poorly supported decisions in allowing or disallowing the credit.", "We identified several opportunities to make the recertification program less confusing to taxpayers and the decisions reached more accurate and consistent, without adversely affecting IRS\u2019s ability to protect against EIC noncompliance.", "Two important forms used in the recertification process are problematic. Form 8862 is required of all taxpayers seeking recertification, yet 86 percent of IRS examiners who audit recertification cases say they do not use it. Since IRS is basically using Form 8862 only as a trigger for initiating the recertification process, we believe that a simpler version of Form 8862 could serve that same purpose. Form 886-R, which tells taxpayers what documentation they need to submit to prove their eligibility for the EIC, says nothing about documentation that taxpayers in nontraditional childrearing arrangements\u2014which are likely common among the EIC recipient population\u2014need to provide to demonstrate that they meet the EIC relationship test. At the same time, Form 886-R lists documentation that substantial majorities of examiners said they would not accept. The form states that a notarized statement from a child-care provider is acceptable evidence that a child lived with the claimant. However, 62 percent of examiners said that they would not accept such statements generally and 79 percent said that they would not accept such statements from relatives who provide child care.", "Other documentation listed on Form 886-R, while useful in gauging a taxpayer\u2019s eligibility for the EIC, can lead to unnecessary taxpayer burden. IRS could minimize that burden and increase the probability of obtaining useful information by clarifying Form 886-R itself or providing simple supplemental forms that serve the same purpose. For instance, taxpayers would be less likely to submit school year attendance information rather than tax year attendance information if IRS were to develop a simple form that specified the period (e.g., January through December 2000) for which taxpayers must provide information. A taxpayer could then take the form to the school(s) for completion.", "When IRS has gathered information to judge whether a taxpayer should be recertified, examiners reviewing the information are likely to reach differing conclusions. The 21 examiners who reviewed five case scenarios we developed based on actual case files did not all agree on any scenario and, in some cases, reached widely varying judgments about whether the evidence was sufficient to support an EIC claim. Furthermore, 53 percent of the examiners we interviewed said that they have sometimes denied recertification because taxpayers did not provide documentation of financial support for the EIC-qualifying child\u2014reflecting a fundamental misunderstanding of the law since financial support is not a criterion for the EIC.", "The results of our review suggest that IRS needs to reassess the evidentiary requirements for recertification and take steps to better ensure that examiners understand and more consistently apply the criteria for recertification. The inability to prove that qualifying children have lived with taxpayers for the requisite period of time\u2014the residency requirement\u2014has historically been a major reason why taxpayers are judged not eligible for the EIC. IRS examiners will continue to exercise discretion in determining whether documentation is sufficient even when using IRS\u2019s proposed new decision support tool. Furthermore, each of the three types of acceptable documentation cited on Form 886-R for establishing residency can prove problematic for an EIC claimant. Therefore, the chances of a claimant being able to prove to an examiner\u2019s satisfaction that a child\u2019s living arrangement meets EIC requirements might be enhanced if taxpayers were encouraged to send IRS various types of documentation. Form 886-R, as currently worded, encourages taxpayers to send in just one type of documentation\u2014be it school records, medical records, or statements from a child care provider\u2014which can leave an examiner with less than conclusive evidence. If taxpayers provided more than one document, an examiner could disregard a document that seemed questionable but possibly find one or more of the other documents persuasive. Also, a pattern of evidence across several corroborating documents may provide a more meaningful basis for examiners to judge residency.", "Although our review was directed at the EIC Recertification Program, many of our findings would also apply to other IRS audits of EIC claims because IRS\u2019s requirements for proving eligibility for the EIC apply to all EIC claimants, not just those who have to recertify. In that regard, while we understand that it is not possible, and probably not desirable, to eliminate all subjectivity from examiners\u2019 decisions about EIC eligibility, there is room to bring more consistency to that process\u2014not only consistency among examiners but also consistency between the requirements of the tax law (e.g., no financial support test to claim the EIC) and examiners\u2019 practices. IRS recognizes the need for more consistency and is working to develop a decision support tool for EIC audits. More broadly, an IRS/Treasury task force has been charged with developing recommendations for making the overall EIC program less confusing to taxpayers and easier for IRS to administer.
