To determine whether the Air Force could provide  adequate supporting documentation for active duty pay transactions, we  selected random statistical samples from the 10-month universe of active  duty military payroll transactions provided by the Air Force and reviewed  the supporting documentation.

We reviewed the Air Force\u2019s reconciliation for 1 month to gain  an understanding of how the Air Force matches data elements. For  data mismatches between the individual payroll records and  personnel records that cannot be immediately resolved, the Air Force  creates a tracking record to help reasonably assure that they are  researched and resolved within 45 days, in accordance with Air Force  guidelines.

Because the payroll system does not interface  directly with the accounting system, DFAS developed the Military Pay  Reconciliation Tool (Reconciliation Tool), a Microsoft Access  application, to facilitate this reconciliation process.

For all sampled items, we looked for sufficient and  appropriate evidence of the servicemember\u2019s eligibility for the pay and the  amount of the pay. For basic pay sample items and for change actions  based on a change in grade, we tested support for rank and years of  service. For other pay types that depend in part on these factors, we  tested only the support for the other factors involved, such as duty  location, number of dependents, or specialty code.", "Our scope of work did not include observation of Air Force personnel\u2019s  document-handling procedures, identification or testing of internal  controls, or examination of the Air Force\u2019s document management  systems. Rather, we tested whether a specific control objective\u2014 maintaining and readily providing supporting documentation\u2014was being  met. We relied on the Air Force to retrieve the supporting documents and  to determine, as far as possible, the causes of missing or incomplete  documents.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to December 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Air Force", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, key contributors to this report were Paul  Kinney (Assistant Director), Russell Brown, Jason Kelly, Sharon Kittrell,  James Ungvarsky, and Matthew Ward."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
