Although a number of key national-level strategies, such as the National Drug Control Strategy, have been updated since 2011 to address changing drug threats, GAO found that DOD's 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats Strategy has not been updated to reflect these changes. In addition, the National Guard lacks detailed procedures and processes for the states to implement the National Guard counterdrug program, such as how to conduct cross-state aerial reconnaissance. Without current strategy or guidance, it will be difficult for the National Guard to operate its counterdrug program effectively.", "DOD's processes to approve state counterdrug plans and distribute funding to the state-level counterdrug programs could be improved. Since at least 2009, DOD has provided funding to the states without first approving state plans for counterdrug activities, as required by statute. GAO found that the delay in approval of state counterdrug plans has worsened since fiscal year 2009; in fiscal year 2018, approval took over 9 months (283 days); see figure below. In 2018, DOD took some steps to address the timely review of state plans, but GAO found that those steps did not rectify the problem.", "GAO also found that the process used by the National Guard to distribute funding to the states within the program does not incorporate DOD's strategic counternarcotics priorities, such as the U.S. southwest and northern border areas. GAO's work on results-oriented management states that strategy should inform program activities and resourcing. Until National Guard's process to distribute funding to state counterdrug programs is improved, it risks directing funding toward lower priority counterdrug activities at the expense of higher priority activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making a total of five recommendations, including, among others, that DOD issue a strategic framework that addresses current drug threats, the National Guard issue guidance with detailed procedures on how states should administer the program, DOD assess the revised process for approving state plans, and the National Guard incorporate DOD's strategic counternarcotics priorities into its funding distribution process. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1989, Congress has provided billions of dollars to the Department  of Defense (DOD) to fund the National Guard\u2019s participation in domestic  drug interdiction and counterdrug activities.

To  select these case studies for our sample, we relied on five criteria. First,  we selected states from each of the four counterdrug program regions:  Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest. Second, we selected  both low and high drug threat level states from each region, as  determined by the National Guard Bureau\u2019s funding distribution model  known as the threat-based resource model in 2018. Third, we selected  states that experienced large fluctuations in their threat level between  fiscal years 2016 and 2018 as a consequence of changes to the National  Guard Bureau\u2019s threat-based resource model for fiscal year 2018, such  as the expansion in the number of drug threat variables in the model and  the institution of seizure thresholds to better distinguish which drug  seizures would be considered within the model. Fourth, we selected  states that received what National Guard Bureau officials referred to as a  \u201cfunctional\u201d level of funding for fiscal year 2018, meaning that funding was  provided at a level necessary to support two counterdrug missions in that  state or territory, regardless of its threat level.

However, since at least 2009 DOD has not met the  statutory requirement to examine the adequacy of state plans prior to  distributing funding to state counterdrug programs.", "To develop the state plans, counterdrug coordinators in each state  counterdrug program use guidance in annual memorandums issued by  DOD. According to the guidance, the plans should identify the state\u2019s  counterdrug priorities and how each state counterdrug program intends to  obligate its available funds. Counterdrug coordinators then work with their  state\u2019s Adjutant General, Attorney General, and Governor, who each  review and sign them, before the plans are sent to the National Guard  Bureau for further review. Once the National Guard Bureau reviews the  plans, they are forwarded to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats. Officials from that  office review the plans and make recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense to approve or disapprove the plans. Based on these  recommendations, the Secretary of Defense reviews the plans for  adequacy, and when satisfied, signs a memorandum of agreement  approving the plans. Figure 5 provides an outline of the process to  approve state plans for their counterdrug activities.", "However, since at least 2009, DOD has provided funding to the state  counterdrug programs prior to the Secretary of Defense approving states\u2019  plans for their counterdrug activities, according to National Guard Bureau  officials. This is inconsistent with section 112 of title 32 of the United  States Code, which requires that before funds are provided to the  Governor of a state for counterdrug activities and before members of the  National Guard of that State are ordered to full-time National Guard duty,  the Secretary of Defense must examine the adequacy of the plan  submitted by the Governor. We found that that the delay in approval of  states\u2019 plans for their counterdrug activities has worsened since 2009,  and in fiscal year 2018, approval took over 9 months (283 days) after  funding was provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. Figure 6  provides information on the number of days between the beginning of the  fiscal year, when states received funding, and when all plans were  approved in fiscal years 2009 through 2018.", "Officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Counternarcotics and Global Threats and the National Guard Bureau  stated that several factors have contributed to delays in the state plan  approval process. First, officials stated that, prior to fiscal year 2016, the  National Guard Bureau submitted state plans to the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats  signed by the Division Chief of the National Guard counterdrug program,  a colonel in the Army or the Air Force. However, in fiscal year 2016,  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense found the  Counterdrug Program Division Chief\u2019s review and approval of the state  plans to be insufficient because the approving official did not have the  appropriate rank to approve state plans on behalf of the National Guard  Bureau. As a result, officials from the National Guard Bureau elevated the  level of approval within the National Guard Bureau to the National Guard  Bureau Joint Staff Director of Domestic Operations and Force  Development, a Major General in the Army National Guard or Air National  Guard. Officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats stated that this resulted  in an increase in the number of days that it took the National Guard  Bureau to provide reviewed state plans. Officials stated that they are  working to develop an updated timeline to address delays created by the  approval process. Specifically, officials stated that they are working to  submit the plans for review earlier in order to allow enough time to ensure  that state plans are approved before funds are provided to state  counterdrug programs.", "Second, officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats stated that their office  required state plans to include information, such as narratives detailing  states\u2019 planned activities that were not critical to determining plans\u2019  alignment with DOD priorities. In addition, officials stated that, over time,  states had expanded the narratives in their plans, which increased the  length of each submission. As a result of this required information,  officials stated that the department\u2019s review of state plans took longer  than had the extra information not been included. Officials from the Office  of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and  Global Threats stated they have reviewed the statutory requirements for  the plans to identify which components are necessary and streamlined  the format of the plans for use in fiscal year 2019.", "Third, officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats stated that in the past  the Office of the Secretary of Defense would not accept state plans from  the National Guard Bureau in batches, but instead insisted on receiving  and reviewing them altogether, delaying the review process. These  officials noted that they have since begun accepting state plans from  National Guard Bureau in batches in order to speed up the approval  process.", "On June 7, 2018, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Counternarcotics and Global Threats issued a memorandum to the  Chief of the National Guard Bureau that required all states and territories  to submit their plans, through National Guard Bureau and the Joint Staff,  to his office no later than August 31, 2018. According to officials from the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics  and Global Threats, the state plans were to detail fiscal year 2019  National Guard counterdrug program activities and provide the Office of  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and  Global Threats additional time to review state plans prior to the beginning  of the fiscal year.", "However, in October 2018, officials from the National Guard Bureau and  the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Counternarcotics and Global Threats told us that none of the fiscal year  2019 plans had been approved prior to the beginning of the fiscal year,  and that DOD had provided state counterdrug programs with funding for  fiscal year 2019. As of mid-November, officials from the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global  Threats told us that 39 of the 54 state plans had been approved. DOD  has not assessed why the steps it took to improve the state plan review  process did not result in timely approval of the state plans. GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government note that  management should monitor activities and evaluate the results of  programmatic changes. Assessing the revised process for reviewing  states\u2019 plans would enable DOD to determine what additional actions are  needed to ensure the plans are approved by the Secretary of Defense  before funding is provided to state counterdrug programs, as statutorily  required by section 112 of title 32."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Guard Bureau\u2019s Funding Distribution Process Does Not Incorporate DOD Strategic Counternarcotics Priorities", "paragraphs": ["We found that the National Guard Bureau\u2019s funding distribution process  does not consider DOD\u2019s strategic counternarcotics priorities. For  example, while DOD\u2019s 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats  Strategy prioritizes efforts on the southwest and northern borders, the  National Guard Bureau\u2019s funding distribution process does not specifically  account for this. Rather than taking into account established DOD  counternarcotics priorities to inform funding distribution, the National  Guard Bureau uses survey results and statistics on drugs from a number  of national-level databases to develop a distribution percentage for each  state within its threat-based resource model that reflects its relative drug  threat. Each state\u2019s threat-based resource model percentage is then  applied to the funding transferred to the National Guard Bureau from the  Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, Defense account and  disbursed to the 54 state programs. For example, Arizona\u2019s threat  percentage was determined to be 6.25 percent based on existing drug  threats; as a result, Arizona received about $11.8 million in funding for  state plans in fiscal year 2018.", "National Guard Bureau officials stated that while the threat-based  resource model\u2019s variables and the data that feed the model relate to  DOD strategic counternarcotics priorities, they do not adjust the process  to reflect these priorities when distributing funding. When we asked  National Guard Bureau officials why its funding distribution process does  not consider DOD\u2019s strategic counternarcotics priorities, National Guard  Bureau officials stated that they were focused on identifying variables and  data sources within the threat-based resource model to reflect relative  drug threats and did not consider incorporating DOD\u2019s strategic  counternarcotics priorities as part of the funding distribution process.", "Our work on results-oriented management states that strategy should  inform program activities and resourcing. In addition, the National Guard  Bureau reported that the goal of the threat- based resource model is to  prioritize the most pressing threats from a national perspective, informed  by current national and DOD counternarcotics strategies. Both the Office  of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and  Global Threats and National Guard Bureau officials stated that  incorporating DOD\u2019s strategic counternarcotics priorities into the National  Guard Bureau\u2019s funding distribution process would help ensure that DOD  priorities are resourced. National Guard Bureau officials stated that they  are considering how to align the funding distribution process with DOD\u2019s  strategic counternarcotics priorities. They added that the next time they  could make changes to their funding distribution process would be for use  in fiscal year 2020.

The drug threats facing the nation are complex  and continue to evolve over time, and efforts to combat those threats will  require continued support from DOD, to include the National Guard  counterdrug program.", "DOD lacks current strategy and guidance for the National Guard  counterdrug program. Although DOD has a counternarcotics and global  threats strategy from 2011, it is outdated and does not reflect current drug  threats or changes in national-level strategies, which are critical for  informing DOD\u2019s strategic counternarcotics priorities. Issuing a strategic  framework will ensure that DOD\u2019s counterdrug priorities are aligned with  the priorities of other agencies involved in counternarcotics efforts,  provide direction for DOD\u2019s counternarcotics activities, and ensure that  the National Guard counterdrug program addresses current drug threats.  Further, the National Guard Bureau guidance to operate and administer  the program was rescinded and has not been replaced, leaving state  counterdrug programs officials without clear instructions on how to  operate and administer program activities. Issuing interim guidance would  provide detailed processes and procedures that states could use to  operate their counterdrug programs. Without current strategy or guidance  for the National Guard counterdrug program, it will be difficult for the  program to operate effectively.", "In addition, it is important to ensure that funding is distributed to the state- level programs in support of DOD\u2019s strategic counternarcotics priorities.  Although the Secretary of Defense is statutorily responsible for reviewing  the adequacy of states\u2019 plans prior to providing funds to the states, these  reviews have not occurred before state counterdrug programs received  funding. Also, the National Guard Bureau has not incorporated DOD\u2019s  strategic counternarcotics priorities into its funding distribution process,  which is instead wholly reliant on survey responses and drug data. While  these are important factors to consider when distributing funding,  incorporating DOD strategic counternarcotics priorities into the National  Guard Bureau\u2019s funding distribution process would better inform such  decisions. Until DOD\u2019s process to approve state plans and the National  Guard Bureau\u2019s process to distribute funding are improved, DOD may not  be able to ensure that resources are applied to its strategic  counternarcotics priorities.", "Taken together these actions should improve the Department\u2019s oversight  of the National Guard counterdrug program and help ensure that the  program uses resources effectively and achieves positive results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making five recommendations to DOD.", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats  issues its counternarcotics and global threats strategic framework that  incorporates relevant national-level strategies and reflects current drug  threats, and update it, as appropriate, upon issuance of the new National  Drug Control Strategy.
