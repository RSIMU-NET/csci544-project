The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates nuclear power plants to protect public health and the environment from radiation hazards. GAO was asked to (1) determine experts' opinions on the impacts, if any, of underground piping system leaks on public health and the environment; (2) assess NRC requirements of licensees for inspecting these systems and monitoring and reporting on leaks; (3) identify actions the nuclear power industry, licensees, and NRC have taken in response to leaks; and (4) identify additional NRC requirements, if any, that key stakeholders think could help prevent, detect, and disclose leaks. GAO convened expert discussion groups through the National Academy of Sciences and asked experts to review three case studies, analyzed documents, visited seven plant sites and two NRC regional offices, and interviewed stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While experts in our public health discussion group generally agreed that radioactive leaks at the three nuclear power plants in our case studies of actual events had no discernible impact on the public's health, these experts noted that additional information could enhance the identification of the leaks and the characterization of their impacts. The experts in our environmental impact discussion group concluded that environmental resources beyond the plant site have not been impacted discernibly, but that on-site contamination could affect plant decommissioning; for example, the licensee may have to conduct costly remediation to meet NRC regulations for unrestricted release of the site. Experts also identified the need for licensees to transparently report monitoring data and for licensees' groundwater monitoring programs to be independently reviewed. NRC inspection requirements focus on ensuring the functionality of underground piping systems that are essential for both the safe operation and the shutdown of plants rather than providing information about the condition of the underground piping systems. In addition, NRC's groundwater monitoring requirements generally focus on monitoring off-site locations, where a member of the public could be exposed to radiation, but not on onsite groundwater monitoring, which can improve the likelihood that leaks will be detected before they migrate off-site. In response to leaks, the nuclear power industry has implemented two voluntary initiatives to increase public confidence in plant safety. The first initiative was intended to improve on-site groundwater monitoring to promptly detect leaks. The second was intended to provide reasonable assurance of underground piping systems' structural and leaktight integrity. Licensees' responses to detected leaks have varied, ranging from repairing the leak source and documenting the leak's extent, to performing extensive mitigation. In addition, NRC has assessed its regulatory framework for, and oversight of, inspection of underground piping systems and groundwater monitoring. Based on the low risk posed by spills to date, NRC determined that no further regulations are needed at this time but has committed to such actions as gathering information on underground piping leak trends and reviewing codes and standards for underground piping. Key stakeholders identified additional NRC requirements that they thought could help prevent, detect, and disclose leaks. Some saw a need for NRC to require licensees to inspect the structural integrity of underground piping using techniques used in the oil and gas industry, while noting the challenges to applying such techniques at nuclear power plants. Industry is undertaking research to overcome these challenges. Stakeholders also noted that NRC should enhance its on-site groundwater monitoring requirements to promptly detect leaks and minimize their impacts. Finally, stakeholders said that NRC should require licensees to provide leak information in a more timely fashion and should make that information more accessible to the public."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NRC periodically assess the effectiveness of the groundwater initiative and determine whether structural integrity tests should be included in licensee inspection requirements, when they become feasible, based on industry research.

Many of these underground pipe leaks resulted in  contamination of groundwater by tritium\u2014a radioactive form of hydrogen.  In some instances, the contamination has migrated, or is expected to  migrate, beyond the plant\u2019s boundaries, raising concerns about potential  impacts on public health and the environment. The Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC), an independent federal agency headed by five  commissioners, licenses commercial nuclear power plants and regulates  and oversees their safe operation and security. NRC\u2019s mission includes  protecting public health and the environment from radiation hazards.", "Most nuclear power plants have extensive underground piping systems,  some of which transport water containing radioactive isotopes, such as  tritium. While the amount and type of underground piping systems vary  significantly among nuclear power plants, according to NRC officials, most  of these underground systems are not safety-related\u2014that is, they are not  necessary to ensure reactor integrity, shut down and safely maintain the  reactor, or prevent or mitigate the public\u2019s exposure to radiation during an  accident. As nuclear power plants age, their underground piping systems  tend to corrode, but since these systems are largely inaccessible and  difficult to inspect, the condition of many underground piping systems at  plants across the country is unknown. Further, as pipes continue to age  and further corrosion occurs, the likelihood and severity of leaks could  increase without mitigating actions.", "In the past decade, increased reports of buried pipe leaks at nuclear power  plants have attracted significant attention and generated public concern  about NRC\u2019s oversight of underground piping systems, particularly since  NRC has issued few violations in association with these leaks.  Specifically, stakeholders\u2014such as environmental and antinuclear groups,  as well as some scientists and engineers\u2014have questioned the adequacy of  NRC requirements pertaining to the safety of underground piping systems  and are also seeking to understand the factors responsible for  underground piping system leaks. Some stakeholders also have concerns  about NRC\u2019s license renewal process. As most aging power plants have  been applying for\u2014and receiving\u201420-year extensions of their operating  licenses, some stakeholders have filed contentions, including contentions  to prevent the relicensing of some plants with underground piping systems  that may be subject to leaks.", "In this context, you asked us to review underground piping systems and  NRC\u2019s requirements for them. Our objectives were to (1) determine  experts\u2019 opinions on the impacts, if any, that underground piping system  leaks have had on public health and the environment; (2) assess NRC  requirements of licensees for inspecting underground piping systems and  monitoring and reporting on leaks from these systems; (3) identify actions  the nuclear power industry, licensees, and NRC have taken in response to  underground piping system leaks; and (4) identify, according to key  stakeholders, what additional NRC requirements, if any, could help  prevent, detect, and disclose leaks from underground piping systems.", "To address these objectives, we consulted with experts, analyzed  documents, conducted visits to selected plant sites and NRC regional  offices, and interviewed stakeholders. Specifically, we worked with the  National Academy of Sciences to convene two groups of six experts each,  in January 2011. The first group addressed the public health impacts of  underground piping system leaks, and the second one addressed their  environmental impacts. We asked both groups of experts to discuss the  impacts of leaks in the context of three case studies of nuclear power  plants that have experienced leaks in their underground piping systems:  Braidwood Generating Station in Illinois, Oyster Creek Generating Station  in New Jersey, and Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station in Vermont.  We selected these case studies because they included plants with  underground piping system leaks that generated significant publicity and  resulted in high concentrations of tritium detected in on-site groundwater.  Additionally, the case studies included a plant at which contamination  from a leak was detected off-site (Braidwood). We also analyzed relevant  NRC regulations and requirements and interviewed NRC officials from the  Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Office of General Counsel, Region I,  and Region III. In addition, we selected a nonprobability sample of seven  nuclear power plants, most of which had recently experienced an  underground piping system leak, and one of which had not experienced a  publicized pipe leak, and made site visits to these locations to interview  licensee representatives and NRC resident inspectors. During the site  visits, we also observed ongoing activities related to mitigation of leaks.  Finally, using a standard set of questions, we interviewed a nonprobability  sample of over 30 stakeholders including representatives from NRC, other  federal and state agencies who have worked on issues related to  underground piping system leaks and associated groundwater  contamination, representatives from industry and industry groups,  standards-setting organizations, and advocacy and other interested groups,  as well as independent consultants and experts. A more detailed  description of our objectives, scope, and methodology is presented in  appendix I. We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to June  2011, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

These reactors are located at 65 sites across the country (see  fig. 1) and are operated by 26 different companies. Many reactors built in  the late 1960s and early 1970s are reaching or have reached the end of  their initial 40-year license. As of March 2011, NRC had renewed 63 reactor  licenses for an additional 20 years and was currently reviewing 19 license  renewal applications.", "Since 2008, NRC has been collecting data from licensees on groundwater  contamination incidents at nuclear power plants that have resulted from  unplanned or uncontrolled releases of radioactive material, including leaks  from underground piping systems. Based on these data, NRC has  concluded that all 65 reactor sites in the United States have experienced a  leak or spill of radioactive material into groundwater. NRC estimates that  between 10 and 20 percent of groundwater contamination events at  nuclear power plants can be attributed to leaks from underground piping  systems.  Figure 2 provides a diagram of a hypothetical underground  piping system leak at a nuclear power plant. In addition, NRC data suggest  that groundwater contamination events have been more prevalent during  the last several years; however, the agency attributes this apparent  increase to the nuclear industry\u2019s enhanced monitoring efforts and  increased reporting of leaks during the same time period.", "NRC strives to accomplish its mission of protecting public health and  safety and the environment by establishing regulations and standards  governing licensed activities and inspecting facilities to ensure compliance  with requirements. NRC prioritizes its oversight and inspections of  structures, systems, and components that are critical to safely operating  the plant during normal conditions and safely cooling the reactor core in  the case of an emergency shutdown. Therefore, these structures, systems,  and components are classified by NRC as \u201csafety-related.\u201d", "NRC maintains staff at commercial nuclear power plants to inspect,  measure, and assess their safety performance\u2014and respond to any  deficiency in performance\u2014through its Reactor Oversight Process.  Furthermore, according to NRC inspection protocols, performance  deficiencies by the company licensed to operate a nuclear power plant, or  licensee, can result in more intensive NRC oversight and/or issuance of a  violation. However, to assure licensees that requirements placed on them  will change only when they are justified from a public health and safety  standpoint, the \u201cbackfit rule\u201d requires that NRC make the determination  that new requirements will result in a substantial increase in the overall  protection of public health and safety and that this increased protection  justifies the cost of implementing the new requirement.", "NRC\u2019s regulations allow certain levels of radioactive materials to be  discharged into the environment. As a part of its license application, a  licensee performs calculations of its expected releases, and NRC reviews  these calculations to verify their validity and conformance to NRC  requirements. NRC\u2019s review and verification are documented in reports,  and the licensees are required to monitor their discharges. Most of the  systems used to discharge these radioactive materials are not classified as  \u201csafety-related.\u201d According to NRC officials, the amount of radioactive  materials released from underground piping system leaks has been small  relative to these permitted discharges. Furthermore, the officials noted  that a leak of tritium in and of itself is not a violation of NRC requirements.", "NRC has established several layers of radiation standards to protect the  public against potential health risks from exposure to radioactive releases  from nuclear power plant operations (see table 1). In addition to these  standards, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed  drinking water standards for radioactive isotopes using its authority under  the Safe Drinking Water Act. These limits apply to public drinking water  systems but are also used by many state authorities as groundwater  protection standards. For tritium, EPA set a maximum contaminant level  of 20,000 picocuries per liter (pCi/l). None of the reported underground  piping system leaks to date have exceeded NRC limits on the public\u2019s  exposure to radiation, nor have reported concentrations of radioactive  materials in off-site groundwater exceeded EPA standards for drinking  water.", "When unplanned releases do not exceed NRC dose limits, NRC  requirements allow for licensees to remediate the residual radioactivity at  the time the site is decommissioned. For a decommissioned nuclear power  plant site to be released for unrestricted use, NRC requires that it be  cleaned up to an established minimum radiation annual dose limit. In  addition to this requirement, NRC has entered into a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) with EPA on cleanup of radioactively contaminated  sites. The MOU includes provisions for NRC to consult with EPA if a site  meets NRC cleanup standards but exceeds EPA-permitted levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "According to Experts, Underground Piping Leaks at Three Nuclear Power Plants Had No Discernible Impact on Public Health or the Environment, but More Information Could Enhance Identification of Leaks and Characterization of Their Impacts", "paragraphs": ["According to the experts in our public health discussion group, no impacts  on public health have been discernible from leaks at the three case study  nuclear power plants we asked the expects to consider.

More specifically, although the experts observed that  the risk of impacts to the public\u2019s health is not zero, it is immeasurably  small. While tritium was detected in the on-site groundwater at each of  these plants from one or more leaks, it was detected in an off-site drinking  water well only in the case of the Illinois plant. The experts noted that,  based on the information reported by the licensees and NRC on off-site  contamination levels, the radiation doses to the public from leaks at these  plants have been very low\u2014well below NRC regulations for radiation  exposure, and orders of magnitude below any exposure that could cause  an observable health effect.", "While the experts concluded that leaks at these plants have not discernibly  impacted the public\u2019s health, some of them noted that the leaks may affect  people in the surrounding communities in a less tangible manner. For  example, according to two of the experts, even if community members  have not been exposed to radiation from the leaks, the perception that  contamination could exist in their community or that they cannot trust the  operators of a nearby nuclear power plant can degrade individuals\u2019 quality  of life. In addition, another expert noted that reported leaks at nuclear  power plants could have an impact on the property values in the  surrounding community based on the perception that the leaks could  impact public health. Some of the experts observed that such perceptions  are not taken into account in NRC\u2019s regulatory framework, which is based  on protecting public health and safety. However, they noted that, for NRC  or licensees to build trust and gain credibility, they should consider these  perceived impacts when determining their actions to address a leak. A few  experts said that better communication and complete transparency with  the public about the risks associated with very low doses of radiation  would be required to change the public\u2019s perception of the impacts  associated with the leaks. However, one expert acknowledged the  difficulty in effectively communicating the complex issue of risks to the  public posed by low doses of radiation.

Consequently, subtle  effects on other organisms that have not been identified could exist.", "A few experts pointed out that even though off-site environmental impacts  are not discernible, the on-site groundwater contamination from the leaks  may have degraded the on-site environment, potentially limiting the site\u2019s  future use. The on-site groundwater tritium contamination resulting from  two of the case study leaks was detected in concentrations over 100 times  the EPA drinking water standard. Consequently, some of the experts noted  that when a licensee decommissions a plant with this level of groundwater  contamination, the licensee may have to conduct costly remediation to be  able to meet NRC regulations for unrestricted release of the site, or the  site could have deed restrictions placed on its future use. Some of the  experts debated whether the time frames for decommissioning current  nuclear power plant sites would be sufficient for existing tritium  contamination to naturally decay to levels required for unrestricted release  of the site.

However, one expert pointed out that any  construction on-site can significantly modify how groundwater flows  through the subsurface, so it is very important to have current knowledge  of a site\u2019s hydrogeology. In addition, experts also said that it was very  important for licensees to have knowledge of their underground  infrastructure and to identify critical systems, structures, and components  where a leak might occur. This knowledge would enable licensees to  strategically place their monitoring wells in order to have confidence that  they will promptly detect leaks.", "Additional information could help characterize the impacts of leaks,  according to the experts. More specifically, the experts noted that industry  currently lacks standardized data across nuclear power plants to  characterize the impacts of leaks and that data used to inform assessments  of risk are limited to the locations where samples are collected. Experts  said that, to obtain a complete picture of a leak\u2019s consequences,  monitoring wells need to be placed in the proper locations, which must be  informed by a thorough understanding of a site\u2019s hydrogeologic  characteristics. Finally, the experts noted that licensees need to have  conservative models that can predict how contamination would move if a  leak were to occur, how long it would take for contamination to migrate  off-site or contaminate a drinking water well, and what impacts there  might be to public health and the environment.", "Finally, experts identified the need for licensees\u2019 monitoring data and  assessments of impacts to be more transparent and to be independently  reviewed to provide greater public confidence in them. One expert noted  that groundwater data collected voluntarily by the licensees should be part  of their annual environmental reports. Another expert observed that the  groundwater reports prepared voluntarily by industry typically  oversimplify presented data. In addition, experts expressed concern that  there is no process for an agency or third party to review licensees\u2019  groundwater monitoring programs. For example, one expert observed that  licensees, with their consultants, independently develop their voluntary  groundwater monitoring programs, collect the data, and report the results  without a formal opportunity for NRC or others to comment on the  specifics of the programs such as the number, location, and depth of  monitoring wells. Another expert noted that the results of licensees\u2019  modeling of radiation doses to the public from a leak should also undergo  an independent review. Such a review could assess whether a different  conclusion might have been reached if, for example, monitoring wells  were placed in a different location. This is important, according to one  expert, because NRC relies on licensees to initially determine whether a  leak presents a health risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NRC Requires Licensees to Inspect the Function of Their Safety-Related Underground Piping Systems, Monitor the Plant Environs for Radiation, and Report Releases in a Timely Manner", "paragraphs": ["NRC inspection requirements related to underground piping systems at all  104 U.S. nuclear power plants focus on ensuring the functionality of  safety-related piping systems, monitoring the plant environs for radiation,  and reporting planned and unplanned releases. Specifically, NRC requires  licensees to periodically test a sample of safety-related piping. Pipes are  designated as safety related if they are essential to safely operate the plant  or safely shut it down in case of an emergency. NRC inspection  regulations, through the adoption of applicable American Society of  Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code provisions, require licensees to  perform only pressure tests or flow tests on their safety-related  underground piping systems. The pressure test is used to determine if and  to what extent pressure is being lost within a section of piping, while the  flow test is designed to identify any reduction in flow volume. To pass  these tests, the pipes must be able to transport fluids at or above a  specified minimum pressure or flow rate, which can be accomplished even  when pipes are leaking. According to NRC, the agency\u2019s primary concern  is whether a system is providing enough water to maintain its functionality  at one point in time, which is what the results of the pressure and flow  tests indicate.", "NRC regulations also require that licensees monitor the \u201cplant environs\u201d  for radioactivity that may be released from normal plant operations, as  well as from unplanned leakage such as leaks and spills, to ensure the  protection of the public\u2019s health and safety. NRC requires that licensees  establish and implement a site-specific Radiological Environmental  Monitoring Program to obtain data on measurable levels of radiation and  radioactive materials in the environment. Consistent with NRC guidance  for this required monitoring program, licensees conduct radiation  monitoring at locations where a member of the public could be exposed to  radiation to identify whether levels of off-site radiation exceed federal  dose limits. For example, agency guidance recommends quarterly  monitoring of off-site groundwater only if it is used as a direct source of  drinking water or irrigation and is likely to be contaminated. The agency  does not generally require that licensees monitor groundwater on-site if it  is not used for drinking water. However, if a licensee\u2019s monitoring  program found radioactive materials off-site, additional on-site monitoring  could be required. With on-site monitoring, future leaks and spills have a  higher likelihood of being detected before contamination reaches the site  boundaries. Even though NRC has not generally required licensees to have  on-site groundwater monitoring wells, most plants have installed some on- site wells that could help detect and monitor leaks. Although some  contamination has been found to migrate off-site, thus far, according to  NRC, reported off-site contamination has not exceeded EPA drinking  water standards or NRC radiation exposure limits.", "In addition, NRC regulations require that planned and unplanned releases  be reported to NRC by licensees in a timely manner. For example, each  licensee must submit a written report to NRC within 30 days after learning  of an inadvertent release above specified limits of radioactive materials,  such as tritium. The licensee\u2019s report must include a description of the  extent of exposure of individuals to radiation and radioactive material.  These NRC reporting requirements are in addition to their immediate  notification of incidents requirements. Immediate notification, via an  Emergency Notification System or telephone, is required for certain events  or situations that may have caused or threatens to cause an individual to  receive a high dose of radiation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Nuclear Power Industry, Licensees, and NRC Have Taken a Variety of Actions in Response to Underground Piping Leaks", "paragraphs": ["In response to underground piping leaks at nuclear power plants, the  nuclear power industry adopted two voluntary initiatives largely intended,  according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), to enhance public  confidence in the operation and maintenance of their plants. The actions  specified in these initiatives, according to NRC officials, are above and  beyond NRC requirements. Groundwater incidents that occurred around  the 2005 time frame led to the industry\u2019s Groundwater Protection Initiative  in 2007, which was intended to boost public confidence in the safe  operation of the plants and to improve groundwater monitoring at nuclear  power plant sites to promptly detect leaks. All licensees of operating  commercial nuclear power plants in the United States have committed to  the groundwater initiative and, in so doing, have agreed to perform a site  hydrogeologic characterization and risk assessment, establish an on-site  groundwater monitoring program, and establish a remediation protocol.", "After 2007, additional underground piping leaks were reported,  heightening public concern about the degradation of buried pipes at  nuclear power plants. As a result, NEI announced another voluntary  industry initiative in 2009. This second initiative\u2014called the Buried  Piping Integrity Initiative\u2014was designed to provide reasonable assurance  of structural and leaktight integrity of all buried pipes. All licensees of  operating commercial nuclear power plants in the United States have  committed to this initiative as well. The initiative defined a series of  milestones for, among other things, assessing the condition of buried pipes  and establishing a plan for managing them. Specifically, under this  initiative, licensees agreed to rank their buried piping based on the  likelihood and consequences of its failure and to develop an inspection  plan using the results of the risk ranking, along with other factors, to  prioritize the selection of locations at which they will inspect pipes. The  initiative placed special emphasis on buried piping that is safety-related  and/or contains radioactive material. In 2010, the Buried Piping Integrity  Initiative was expanded to the Buried Piping/Underground Piping and  Tanks Integrity Initiative to address additional structures. All of the  licensees have also committed to implement the expanded initiative.", "Licensees\u2019 actions in response to identified leaks at their power plants  have varied, ranging from simply repairing the leak source and  documenting the extent of the leak for future cleanup, to performing  extensive mitigation. Specifically, at six of the seven sites we visited that  had experienced underground piping system leaks, most of the licensees  had identified and repaired the leak source and conducted remediation  and/or monitoring of the groundwater contamination. For example, when  we visited the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, the soil near the  identified leak source had been excavated and removed by a radiological  waste company hired by the licensee. In addition, at the Oyster Creek  Generating Station in New Jersey, the licensee had undertaken a  mitigation project to excavate some of its buried piping, either moving the  pipes aboveground or placing them in vaults that can be monitored for  leakage.", "NRC\u2019s response to underground piping leaks has taken various forms.  First, NRC\u2019s response to individual leaks has generally been an increase in  oversight at the particular plant, and not issuance of a violation, because  most of the leaks have not posed a safety risk. For example, after an April  2009 leak at Oyster Creek Generating Station, NRC sent out regional  inspectors to review and evaluate the circumstances associated with the  leak. At other power plants, NRC\u2019s enhanced review has included  overseeing some of the groundwater sampling activities that were  performed to characterize leaks. In many of these instances, NRC relied  upon split sampling\u2014sending portions of some of the groundwater  monitoring samples to a laboratory and comparing its analytical results  with those obtained by the licensees\u2019 laboratories for the same samples\u2014 to verify the licensees\u2019 results.", "Furthermore, NRC reviewed its oversight of buried piping and took  actions on the basis of its review. In particular, in the fall of 2009, after  several reported leaks from buried piping resulted in groundwater  contamination and increased media coverage, NRC\u2019s Chairman tasked the  agency staff with reviewing activities NRC had taken related to buried pipe  leaks. The resulting December 2009 report concluded that the agency\u2019s  regulations for the design, inspection, and maintenance of safety-related  buried piping are adequate to ensure buried piping can perform its safety  function. The report also identified a number of ongoing activities, such  as conducting direct visual inspections of piping when a licensee  excavates underground piping for the purpose of repair and replacements.  In 2010, NRC developed a Buried Piping Action Plan under which it would  collect a variety of information, including data on buried pipe system  leaks; assess the implementation of the industry\u2019s Buried  Piping/Underground Piping and Tanks Integrity Initiative; participate in  reviewing professional codes and standards for buried pipes; and, if  warranted, develop responding regulatory actions.", "In 2010, NRC actions also included revising its Aging Management  Program guidance for licensees to manage the effects of aging on  structures or components for license renewal. The revisions include more  detailed and comprehensive guidance for preventing and mitigating  corrosion of underground piping systems and inspecting them. In addition,  NRC proposed requirements for additional groundwater surveys for  decommissioning.", "Moreover, in 2010 and 2011, NRC reviewed the extent to which the  industry has implemented the Groundwater Protection Initiative but did  not evaluate its effectiveness. During this review, NRC found that most  plants have implemented most but not necessarily all steps outlined in the  voluntary initiative. To insure full implementation of the initiative, NRC  plans to continue observing the long-term implementation of this initiative  through its Reactor Oversight Process. However, NRC has no plans to  evaluate the extent to which this initiative, as implemented, will promptly  detect leaks and, as a result, has no assurance that the Groundwater  Protection Initiative will consistently help to promptly detect leaks as  nuclear power plants age. In addition, NRC officials have said they will  continue to review the status of the initiative\u2019s implementation, but said  that the agency is not going to incorporate the initiative into its  requirements because of the low level of risk associated with the reported  leaks to date. Therefore, the public cannot be assured the initiative will  remain in place in the future.", "In addition, in 2010 NRC convened a Groundwater Task Force composed  of NRC staff to evaluate NRC\u2019s actions to address incidents of  groundwater contamination at nuclear power plants and identify actions  for a senior management review group to consider. Later that year, the  task force issued a report that concluded that NRC is accomplishing its  stated mission of protecting the public health and safety and the  environment through its response to leaks and spills that contaminated  groundwater. However, the report also concluded that NRC\u2019s response to  leaks and spills has varied widely and that NRC should further consider  ways to communicate more timely and complete information to the public  about these incidents. In early 2011, NRC reported the results of its senior  management\u2019s review of the Groundwater Task Force report findings. This  report included four areas in which the agency committed to action: (1)  identifying and addressing policy issues related to groundwater  contamination; (2) enhancing the agency\u2019s Reactor Oversight Process; (3)  developing specific actions in response to key themes and conclusions of  the Groundwater Task Force report; and (4) conducting a focused  dialogue with other regulators, such as EPA and states, to develop a  collaborative approach for enhanced groundwater protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Stakeholders Recommended That NRC Enhance Its Inspection, Groundwater Monitoring, and Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Several stakeholders noted that NRC should enhance its inspection  requirements for underground piping systems to help prevent leaks.

Many stakeholders who recommended more  frequent and regular inspections pointed out that NRC requires direct  visual inspection of underground pipes only when a pipe has been  excavated for another purpose. While some stakeholders wanted NRC to  require visual inspections even if that meant licensees would have to  excavate underground piping to do so, one stakeholder pointed out that  pipes can be damaged during excavation and that some pipes may not be  accessible through excavation if, for example, they lie under a road or  building.", "In addition, some stakeholders we interviewed recommended that NRC  require inspections of structural integrity of safety-related underground  piping systems, which can be susceptible to corrosion as plants age. NRC  officials and other stakeholders noted that the pressure and flow tests  NRC currently requires do not provide information about the structural  integrity of an underground pipe, such as whether the pipe has degraded  to the point that the thickness of its wall could hinder the pipe\u2019s future  performance. One stakeholder voiced concern that not having structural  integrity information about safety-related underground piping systems  could create a very significant risk to public health and safety if such pipes  were to unexpectedly fail due to corrosion. Moreover, some of the  stakeholders we interviewed noted that some of the inspection techniques  used in the oil and gas industry to provide additional information about  the structural integrity of underground pipes could be used in the nuclear  power industry. However, these stakeholders recognized that applying  such techniques at nuclear power plants may be difficult, largely because  the technology for such tests has not been sufficiently developed for, or  adapted to, the nuclear industry site conditions. For example, guided wave  technology\u2014a method that transmits ultrasonic energy through a pipe\u2019s  walls and monitors how the energy is reflected back to identify areas  where a pipe may have corrosion\u2014is used in the oil and gas industry,  which tends to have miles of relatively straight piping through which  waves can travel with little interference. However, the underground piping  at nuclear power plants tends to include many bends and turns, which can  distort the wave energy and interfere with the inspection test results. In  addition, the oil and gas industry uses robotic devices sent through a pipe  to capture images of its condition and identify areas of corrosion, but the  bends and turns in pipes at nuclear power plants limit the use of robotic  devices by the nuclear power industry. Although obtaining information  about the structural integrity of pipes is currently challenging, based on  stakeholders\u2019 observations, NRC and licensees cannot be assured that  underground safety-related pipes remain structurally sound without  having information about degradation that has occurred. Without such  assurance, the likelihood of future pipe failures cannot be as accurately  assessed, and this increases the uncertainty surrounding the safety of the  plants.", "Industry and standards-setting organizations have undertaken activities to  address the challenges of inspecting the structural integrity of  underground piping systems at nuclear power plants. For example,  industry, through the Electric Power Research Institute, has undertaken  research to develop new, and improve upon existing, techniques to  provide reliable and usable results, and some licensees are trying these  techniques at their plants. The licensee at the Seabrook Station, for  instance, has plans to pilot test a mechanical robot that was developed by  the Electric Power Research Institute to detect cracks in underground  piping. In addition, stakeholders representing standards-setting  organizations, such as NACE International and ASME, noted that they  have undertaken efforts to evaluate and enhance current technologies and  codes for inspecting underground piping systems. For example,  according to a member of NACE International, the organization formed a  buried piping task group to, among other things, evaluate the current state  of inspection techniques and technologies for underground piping systems  and determine how they could be applied at nuclear power plants.", "Moreover, various stakeholders mentioned the need for NRC to require  inspections and testing of nonsafety-related piping that contains  radioactive material. Although NRC currently does not generally require  such inspections, nonsafety-related piping has been the source of many  reported leaks that resulted in groundwater contamination. For example,  nonsafety-related piping was the source of leaks at the Oyster Creek and  Braidwood plants. Some stakeholders said that any system whose failure  could result in contamination of the environment should be prioritized for  inspection and testing, even if it is not classified as being safety-related.", "According to NRC stakeholders, NRC has limited ability to enhance the  licensees\u2019 inspection requirements of nonsafety-related underground  piping systems, given the low level of risk associated with reported leaks  to date, and the requirement that NRC justify the cost of new requirements  relative to this risk. However, according to industry stakeholders, the  voluntary Buried Piping/Underground Piping and Tanks Integrity Initiative  may address stakeholder concerns related to inspection of nonsafety- related underground piping that carries radioactive material. This initiative  includes a component under which licensees assign a risk rank to  segments of their underground piping based on the potential for and  consequences of failure. As a result, systems that are safety-related and  systems that contain radioactive materials receive a higher rank.  According to the initiative, systems with a higher rank will be prioritized  for inspection and testing, so industry stakeholders noted that piping  containing radioactive materials would receive more attention under the  initiative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Stakeholders Suggested More Stringent On-site Groundwater Monitoring Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Several of the stakeholders we interviewed noted that NRC should have  more stringent requirements for licensees to monitor on-site groundwater  to quickly detect leaks.

Some stakeholders noted, however, that NRC should  allow flexibility for licensees to determine the best approach to detect  leaks at their own sites and to adapt their approach on the basis of  evolving industry experience.", "However, according to stakeholders at NRC, as is the case with inspection  requirements, the agency is unlikely to be able to justify changing its  groundwater monitoring requirements given the low level of risk  associated with reported leaks. Nevertheless, industry and NRC  stakeholders noted that components of the industry\u2019s voluntary  Groundwater Protection Initiative may address some stakeholders\u2019  concerns with respect to groundwater monitoring. For example, one of the  objectives of the initiative is to establish an on-site groundwater  monitoring program by considering placing wells closer to systems with  the highest potential for inadvertent releases that could contaminate  groundwater. Moreover, many NRC stakeholders noted that the industry  initiative goes well beyond what the agency can do in terms of regulations  and has already been implemented, whereas establishing new regulations  could take years. In fact, a review performed by senior managers at NRC  concluded that, in view of the progress being made by industry through  the initiative, efforts to amend NRC\u2019s regulations to include the initiative  are not necessary at this time. Moreover, industry stakeholders told us  they do not consider the initiative to be voluntary since all of the power  plants\u2019 chief nuclear officers committed to its implementation.

NRC\u2019s groundwater monitoring requirements are intended to identify  when the public could be or has been exposed through drinking water to  radiation doses above certain limits rather than to promptly detect  underground piping system leaks. NRC has concluded that, in general,  licensees\u2019 groundwater monitoring programs implemented under the  voluntary groundwater initiative go beyond what the agency requires for  groundwater monitoring and could enhance licensees\u2019 prevention of and  response to potential leaks by detecting them early. However, without  regularly evaluating the extent to which the initiative will result in prompt  detection of leaks, NRC cannot be assured that groundwater monitoring  programs under the initiative will detect leaks before they pose a risk to  public health and safety.", "In addition, although NRC has acknowledged that the corrosion of  underground piping systems, particularly those that are safety-related, is a  concern, limitations in the industry\u2019s ability to measure the wall thickness  of an underground pipe without excavation prevent licensees from  determining the structural integrity of underground piping systems.  Without being able to identify that an underground piping system\u2019s  structural integrity has not been compromised by corrosion, the risk to  public health and safety is increased.
