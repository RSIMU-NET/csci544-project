Consequently, Congress passed the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (the act), which established the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as an independent financial safety and soundness regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises). For reasons relating to the federal charters and structures of the enterprises\u2014which had combined financial obligations of $1.5 trillion at year-end 1996\u2014investors and rating agencies perceive the enterprises\u2019 securities as implicitly guaranteed by the federal government, despite there being no such statutory obligation. We have been mandated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)/HUD Appropriations Act of 1997 to assess OFHEO\u2019s fulfillment of its safety and soundness mission. Based on discussions with congressional staff, our major objectives were to (1) identify why OFHEO has not finalized risk-based capital standards for the enterprises even though there was a December 1, 1994, deadline for doing so and (2) assess OFHEO\u2019s implementation of its enterprises\u2019 safety and soundness examination responsibility. We are also providing information on OFHEO\u2019s implementation of key mission support functions and participation in a U.S. government initiative to assist Mexico in developing a secondary mortgage loan market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The enterprises help ensure that mortgage funds are available to home buyers by buying mortgages from mortgage originators, such as commercial banks, thrifts, and mortgage bankers. In turn, the originators use the funds supplied by the enterprises to make additional mortgage loans thereby helping ensure a continuous supply of mortgage credit nationwide during both good and bad economic periods.", "The enterprises hold some of the mortgages they purchase in portfolio as direct investments on their books and issue debt and equity securities to finance these holdings. However, a majority of mortgages that the enterprises buy from mortgage originators are \u201csecuritized\u201d\u2014that is, the enterprises package them into mortgage pools to support mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These mortgage pools receive interest and principal payments from the mortgages in the pools and pass them on to the investors who purchased MBS. The enterprises guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on MBS held by investors, administer the payments, and charge \u201cguarantee fees\u201d for providing these services. The enterprises may also repurchase MBS and hold the securities in their mortgage portfolios.", "The enterprises are government-sponsored in that they operate under federal charters that convey certain benefits, impose certain restrictions, and permit the enterprises to earn a profit while serving public policy purposes, such as providing liquidity to mortgage markets. In 1992, Congress expanded the enterprises\u2019 public purpose by requiring annual goals for the purchase of mortgages on housing serving very-low, low-, and moderate-income and other households that are underserved by the residential mortgage market. These goals are to be set, monitored, and enforced by HUD. The charters restrict the enterprises to buying mortgages that do not exceed a set dollar amount, known as the conforming loan limit.", "A major factor that enhances the enterprises\u2019 profitability is the financial markets\u2019 perception that there exists an implied federal guarantee of their debt and MBS obligations. Investors perceive that this implied guarantee decreases the risk of default on the enterprises\u2019 financial obligations. Consequently, this perception reduces the enterprises\u2019 borrowing costs because investors are willing to accept lower expected returns on enterprise debt than they would for similar private firms without government ties. Likewise, interest rates on MBS are lowered by this perception. Their lower funding costs allow the enterprises to increase their purchases and give them a cost advantage over their potential competitors. This perception of a federal guarantee remains, even though laws chartering the enterprises contain explicit language stating that there is no such guarantee.", "The market perception of the implied federal guarantee is based on, among other things, federal ties to the enterprises, including government-sponsored status, each enterprise\u2019s $2.25 billion conditional line of credit with the Department of the Treasury, and their exemptions from state and local income taxes and securities registration fees imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 1996, we estimated that the financial benefits that accrue to the enterprises from their federal sponsorship ranged from about $2.2 billion to $8.3 billion on a pretax basis and from about $1.6 billion to $5.9 billion on an aftertax basis in 1995. We also reported that approximately 80 percent to 95 percent of these estimated benefits were derived from the lower funding costs that the enterprises accrue as a result of the perception of a federal guarantee."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enterprise Activities Benefit Homeowners but Pose Potential Financial Risks to Taxpayers", "paragraphs": ["It is widely accepted that the enterprises\u2019 activities have generated benefits to mortgage borrowers, such as lower mortgage interest rates. For example, in our 1996 report, we estimated that the activities of the enterprises resulted in a savings on single-family fixed-rate home mortgages below the conforming loan limit of about 15 to 35 basis points.Thus, a borrower with a $100,000 thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage saves about $10 to $25 a month on mortgage payments as a result of the enterprises\u2019 activities. For the approximately $2 trillion in outstanding conventional conforming fixed-rate mortgages in 1995, we estimated that the aggregate annual savings in mortgage payments were in the range of $3 billion to $7 billion. Other benefits of the enterprises are that they have reduced regional disparities in interest rates and mortgage availability, and spurred the development of new technologies that facilitate the home financing process.", "However, the potential also exists that, in the event of a financial emergency, the federal government would choose to intervene and assist either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or both in meeting their debt and MBS obligations, which stood at a combined $1.5 trillion at year-end 1996 (see table 1.1), potentially exposing the taxpayers to losses. In fact, during the early 1980s when short-term interest rates rose dramatically, Fannie Mae experienced substantial financial difficulties because the enterprise had funded its mortgage portfolio with short-term debt. As rates increased, Fannie Mae had to issue new short-term debt at higher rates to replace existing short-term debt that came due. Because interest earned on the old mortgages in portfolio was less than interest expenses on new debt, Fannie Mae experienced total losses of about $277 million between 1981 and 1984. (The type of risk Fannie Mae faced in the early 1980s is referred to as interest rate risk.) In response, the federal government provided limited tax relief and regulatory forbearance in the form of relaxed capital requirements. Similarly, in 1987, Congress authorized $4 billion to support the Farm Credit System\u2014another government-sponsored enterprise\u2014when it experienced financial difficulties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congress Established OFHEO to Help Ensure the Safety and Soundness of the Enterprises", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the potentially large financial costs that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac posed to taxpayers, in 1992, Congress passed the act, which established OFHEO as an independent regulator within HUD whose mission is to help ensure the enterprises\u2019 safety and soundness. One of OFHEO\u2019s most important means of helping to ensure the enterprises\u2019 financial soundness is to establish capital requirements that are related to potential risks that the enterprises face. Further, the act gave OFHEO broad authority to examine the activities of the enterprises, such as the requirement that OFHEO conduct annual on-site examinations of the enterprises to assess their financial condition. During fiscal year 1997, OFHEO had a budget of about $15.5 million and a total staff\u2014full-time staff, temporary staff, contract employees, and detailees from bank regulatory agencies\u2014of 85 individuals as of March 31, 1997, to carry out its safety and soundness responsibilities and to perform administrative support functions.", "The act established OFHEO as an independent office within HUD with respect to safety and soundness matters, and reserved for the Secretary of HUD the responsibility to oversee the enterprises\u2019 efforts to meet the housing goals as well as general regulatory power over the enterprises. However, the act also clarified that the duty to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are adequately capitalized and operate in a safe and sound manner belongs to OFHEO exclusively. OFHEO was intended to operate separately from HUD as a safety and soundness regulator and to be staffed with experts in financial analysis or financial institution oversight.", "OFHEO is under the management of a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed director. The act provided the director with numerous exclusive authorities (i.e., without the review and approval of the Secretary of HUD), such as powers to examine the operations of the enterprises, determine capital adequacy, and take enforcement actions. The act also gave the director exclusive authority to manage OFHEO, which includes preparing annual budgets and hiring personnel. Thus, the director leads and directs OFHEO\u2019s activities by setting internal and external policies, managing overall operations, and serving as the chief spokesperson for the organization. OFHEO\u2019s first director was appointed on June 1, 1993, and resigned on February 13, 1997, to become the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. As of June 1997, OFHEO was headed by the acting director, while the President and Congress considered potential candidates for the organization\u2019s new director.", "OFHEO is organized into six offices, which report to the director and deputy director.

This office is to provide human resources management, budget formulation and execution, financial and strategic planning, contracting and purchasing, office automation, travel, records and document security, and related administrative support services. OFA is also responsible for developing annual budgets and serving as the liaison with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "The Office of Examination and Oversight (OEO) is responsible for designing and conducting annual on-site examinations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as required by law, and performing additional examinations as determined by the director.", "The Office of Policy Analysis (OPA) is responsible for providing and coordinating economic and policy advice to the director on all issues related to regulation and supervision of the enterprises. This office is also to direct and conduct research and assess the impact of issues and trends in the housing and mortgage markets on OFHEO\u2019s regulatory responsibilities.", "The Office of Research, Analysis and Capital Standards (ORACS) is responsible for developing and implementing a financial \u201cstress test,\u201d which uses interest rate and credit risk scenarios prescribed in the act to determine the enterprises\u2019 risk-based capital requirements. The office is also responsible for conducting research and financial analysis on issues related to the enterprises\u2019 activities, such as simulating Treasury yields and associated interest rate movements.", "Compared to other federal financial regulators, such as the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which have thousands of employees, OFHEO is a small organization. Table 1.2 shows the distribution of OFHEO\u2019s authorized and onboard permanent employees as of March 31, 1997, among the six offices discussed above. As table 1.2 indicates, OFHEO had an authorized staffing level of 72 full-time permanent positions but had only 58 full-time permanent staff on board as of March 31, 1997. OFHEO supplements its permanent full-time staff with full-time and part-time temporary employees, contractors, and detailees from other financial regulatory agencies that perform key functions on a reimbursable basis. For example, OFHEO has used contract staff and bank regulatory detailees to assist in developing capital standards and in performing on-site safety and soundness examinations. As of March 31, 1997, OFHEO had 6 full-time temporary staff, 1 part-time temporary staff, 19 contractor staff, and 1 bank regulatory detailee on board. Thus, OFHEO had a total onboard staff of 85 individuals (58 full-time permanent, 7 temporary, 19 contract, and 1 detailee).", "Table 1.3 shows actual, estimated, and requested OFHEO obligations for fiscal years 1996 through 1998. Most OFHEO expenses cover personnel and contractor services. For fiscal year 1997, OFHEO estimated in its fiscal year 1998 budget request to Congress that it will spend about $9.1 million (about 59 percent of its $15.5 million total) on personnel services (i.e., expenses related to personnel compensation and benefits, but exclusive of contractors). According to OFHEO, it sets its salaries and benefits, as required by the act, by maintaining comparability with federal banking regulatory agencies. The second largest category of expenses (\u201cother services\u201d) generally covers OFHEO\u2019s contractor services. In fiscal year 1997, OFHEO expects to spend nearly $3.8 million (about 25 percent of total obligations) on specialized technical services associated with developing and maintaining its research capability and computer models, examination services, and specialized legal services. All other expenses constitute a smaller percentage of OFHEO\u2019s total obligations. These expenses cover such fundamental items as computer acquisition, travel, and rent, some of which fluctuate with changing numbers of staff and contractors on location.", "Although OFHEO\u2019s financial plans and forecasts are to be included in the budget of the United States and are subject to the appropriations process,the organization is not funded with tax dollars. Rather, the act requires the enterprises to pay annual assessments to cover OFHEO\u2019s costs. Each enterprise is required to pay an amount in proportion to the ratio of its individual assets to the total combined assets of both enterprises. The assessment is to be paid semiannually into a Department of Treasury fund, known as the Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight Fund."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OFHEO Carries Out Its Oversight Mission by Developing Capital Standards and Conducting Examinations", "paragraphs": ["Under the act, OFHEO is to establish two sets of capital standards to help ensure the safety and soundness of the enterprises and minimize taxpayer risks. The first standard, which is called the \u201cminimum capital\u201d standard, requires a minimum amount of capital that an enterprise must hold. Minimum capital is computed on the basis of capital ratios specified in the act that are applied to certain on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet obligations of the enterprises. The ratios are (1) 2.50 percent of aggregate on-balance-sheet assets; (2) 0.45 percent of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding MBS and substantially equivalent instruments; and (3) 0.45 percent of other off-balance-sheet obligations (with some exclusions), except as the OFHEO Director adjusts the ratio to reflect differences between the credit risk of such obligations and MBS. OFHEO has classified Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the minimum standard in each quarter beginning in the quarter that ended on June 30, 1993.", "The act also requires OFHEO to establish a stress test to serve as the basis for the development of risk-based capital standards. The stress test is intended to lower taxpayer risks by simulating in a computer model situations where the enterprises are exposed to adverse credit and interest rate shocks, and requiring the enterprises to hold sufficient capital to withstand these shocks. The capital amount must be adequate to last during a 10-year period (the stress period), within specific parameters relating to credit risk, interest rate risk, new business, and other activities. The act defines an enterprise\u2019s required risk-based capital level as equal to the amount calculated by applying the stress test, along with an additional 30 percent of that amount to allow for management and operations risk. Further, the act required the director to issue final regulations establishing the stress test within 18 months of the Director\u2019s appointment (i.e., by December 1, 1994). However, as we discussed in our May 1995 report on OFHEO\u2019s operations, OFHEO did not meet this deadline. As of April 1997, OFHEO\u2019s acting director said that OFHEO expects to issue a proposed rule implementing the stress test and risk-based capital standards by September 1998, with a final rule to be issued in 1999. We discuss OFHEO\u2019s development of the stress test and risk-based capital standards in chapter 2 of this report.", "In the absence of risk-based capital standards, OFHEO\u2019s primary means of monitoring the safety and soundness of the enterprises is its examination program. The act gave OFHEO broad authority to examine the enterprises and requires annual on-site examinations. At such examinations, OFHEO full-time staff, with the assistance of temporary contractors and detailees from bank regulatory agencies, are to assess the financial condition of the enterprises and recommend improvements as necessary. OFHEO also has the authority to take enforcement actions against the enterprises, such as cease and desist orders, to stop unsafe and unsound practices. Further, OFHEO has the authority to place an enterprise into a conservatorship when certain circumstances exist and the enterprise is unable to meet its financial obligations or is critically undercapitalized.

In 1997, the enterprises received relatively high ratings for financial performance and management from the Standard & Poor\u2019s credit rating company. Nevertheless, the enterprises have adopted business strategies in recent years that OFHEO officials believe could potentially weaken their future financial performance. For example, since OFHEO\u2019s creation in 1992, the enterprises have substantially increased their holdings of mortgage assets in lieu of issuing MBS to investors. According to OFHEO\u2019s former director, increased holdings of mortgage assets potentially expose the enterprises to greater interest rate risks. OFHEO has also reported that there is some evidence that the enterprises have taken on increased credit risk since 1992.

In 1996, Fannie Mae had a net income of $2.7 billion, while Freddie Mac had a net income of about $1.2 billion. The financial data also indicate that since 1990 the enterprises have consistently achieved a return on average common equity, a common measure of profitability, exceeding 20 percent. By contrast, the return on average common equity for the commercial banking industry between 1990 and 1996 was about 12.5 percent.", "On February 3, 1997, the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating firm gave both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a relatively high \u201cpoint-in-time\u201drisk-to-the-government credit rating of \u201cAA-.\u201d OFHEO commissioned Standard & Poor\u2019s to evaluate the enterprises\u2019 financial condition and issue the ratings pursuant to its authority under the act. In the Standard & Poor\u2019s report accompanying the rating, the firm generally cited the enterprises for their consistent profitability, demonstrated ability to withstand regional downturns in mortgage markets during the early 1990s, historically conservative credit and interest rate risk strategies, and the quality of their management. In addition, Standard & Poor\u2019s stated that the enterprises\u2019 domination of the secondary conforming mortgage market and the benefits of their ties to the federal government, such as relatively low borrowing costs, also justified the \u201cAA-\u201d rating. However, Standard & Poor\u2019s did find that both enterprises could face capital adequacy shortages if a severe, nationwide downturn occurred in the mortgage markets or interest rates rose precipitously."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enterprise Growth Has Been Rapid, Which Has Implications for Interest and Credit Risks", "paragraphs": ["Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been consistently profitable, the enterprises have adopted strategies that could potentially increase their interest rate and credit risks. Since 1992, when Congress passed the act that established OFHEO, the enterprises\u2019 combined assets have more than doubled in size, although Freddie Mac\u2019s growth has been relatively faster (see table 1.6 ). During 1996, Fannie Mae\u2019s total assets grew at about an 11 percent annual rate, and Freddie Mac\u2019s assets grew at about a 27 percent annual rate. In 1995, Fannie Mae\u2019s total assets grew at about a 16 percent annual rate, and Freddie Mac\u2019s assets grew at about a 29 percent annual rate. Table 1.7 indicates that the enterprises\u2019 retained mortgage portfolios, which include whole mortgages and MBS that the enterprises have repurchased, have been growing as a percentage of their total mortgage portfolios (retained mortgages plus outstanding MBS held by investors), although this growth has also been relatively faster at Freddie Mac. For example, Freddie Mac\u2019s retained mortgage assets as a percentage of its total mortgage portfolio increased from about 8 percent at year-end 1992 to about 23 percent at year-end 1996. Fannie Mae\u2019s retained mortgage assets increased from about 27 percent of its total mortgage portfolio at year-end 1992 to about 34 percent at year-end 1996. In previous reports on bank and thrift failures, we found that rapid asset growth in the double digit range, unless carefully managed, can result in a deterioration in management controls and ultimately poor financial performance.", "According to OFHEO\u2019s 1996 annual report, the enterprises\u2019 increasing reliance on retained mortgage assets, which are financed by debt and equity, potentially exposes them to greater interest rate risk. The enterprises have incentives to finance mortgages (or repurchase previously issued MBS) with debt because the difference between mortgage yields and borrowing costs generally exceeds MBS guarantee fees. However, the increased proportion of retained mortgage assets could expose Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to greater interest rate risks because they assume the risks for changes in the market value of the retained mortgage assets due to fluctuations in interest rates. By contrast, when the enterprises issue MBS to investors, the investors who purchase the securities assume responsibility for losses due to interest rate fluctuations. In testimony before the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises on April 17, 1996, OFHEO\u2019s former director expressed concern that the combined retained mortgage assets of the enterprises exceeded $360 billion at year-end 1995, which, at that time, was more than twice the combined portfolio that the enterprises had when OFHEO was created in 1992. Nevertheless, at year-end 1996, the enterprises\u2019 combined retained mortgage assets had grown another $63 billion to $424 billion, or about 17 percent, since year-end 1995.", "OFHEO\u2019s 1996 annual report also suggested that the enterprises may be facing somewhat increased credit risks in the future. The report attributed the potentially increasing credit risks to the fact that fewer homeowners chose to refinance their existing mortgages in 1994 and 1995 because mortgage interest rates were higher than they had been in 1992 and 1993. According to the annual report, refinanced mortgages tend to be less risky than mortgages that have not been refinanced because they have lower loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and those who choose to refinance generally have equity in their homes. The enterprises have also embarked on business strategies that have resulted in a larger share of mortgage purchases with higher LTV ratios. Between year-end 1992 and year-end 1995, the percentage of Fannie Mae mortgage purchases with LTV ratios exceeding 90 percent rose from 6 percent of all purchases to 19 percent of all purchases. Freddie Mac\u2019s percentage of mortgage purchases with LTV ratios exceeding 90 percent increased from 3 percent of all purchases to 14 percent of all purchases. At Fannie Mae, credit losses, provision for loss expenses plus foreclosed property expenses, increased from $335 million in 1995 to $409 million in 1996 (about a 22-percent increase) while Freddie Mac\u2019s credit losses increased from $541 million in 1995 to $608 million in 1996 (a 12-percent increase)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enterprises Have Implemented Strategies to Mitigate Risks", "paragraphs": ["The enterprises have developed strategies to lower the interest rate risks that they face from increased mortgage asset holdings. For example, both enterprises issue callable bonds that can be paid off early if interest rates fall. By calling the bonds and issuing new debt as interest rates fall, the enterprises curtail interest expenses. Conversely, if rates increase, the enterprises continue to pay below-market rates on their existing bonds. The enterprises have also developed other methods, including using certain derivative products, to control the volatility of their interest expenses as the economy varies.", "The enterprises also use strategies to minimize potential credit risks. For example, for mortgage purchases with LTV ratios exceeding 80 percent, the enterprises usually require mortgage insurance from highly rated providers or other kinds of credit protection. The enterprises also have nationwide, geographically diversified mortgage portfolios that afford protection against regional downturns in housing markets, as has been demonstrated in the past. In addition, according to OFHEO\u2019s 1996 annual report, the enterprises have further protected themselves against credit risk by shifting an increasing percentage of the primary risk of default to mortgage originators, such as commercial banks. Lenders bear primary default risk if they pledge collateral or agree to repurchase mortgages that default.

The former officials said that the HUD stress test assigned enterprise balance sheet items into broad asset and liability categories, or \u201cbuckets,\u201dand would still have required the disaggregation of enterprise assets and liabilities based on risk characteristics. The former officials added that in 1992, HUD lacked the staff and computer resources necessary to make such detailed assessments. They also said that the HUD stress test did not meet the act\u2019s requirement that OFHEO specify credit risk relationships for the enterprises based on historic mortgage default rates in specific areas of the country (the credit stress benchmark). The former HUD officials said that developing such a geographic credit stress benchmark would have required substantial additional work. Nevertheless, the former officials said that they believed the adaptations necessary to bring the HUD stress test into compliance with the act could have been completed faster than the time it is taking OFHEO to develop its stress test.", "Alternatively, Fannie Mae officials told us that OFHEO could have adopted an approach to developing the stress test similar to the approaches that Fannie Mae follows to assess the impacts of various credit and interest rate scenarios.

Thus, OFHEO\u2019s plan to implement, even after it fills existing OEO vacancies, an annual examination strategy by early 1998 represents a substantial additional challenge to an examination staff that already has a significant workload.", "Therefore, we believe that including in OFHEO\u2019s assessment an analysis of the staff resources necessary to adequately carry out alternative examination cycles, such as 1 or 2 years, could help ensure a fuller consideration of the trade-offs associated with examination coverage provided versus costs involved and thereby result in a more informed decisionmaking process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that OFHEO\u2019s and OEO\u2019s director promptly (1) conduct an analysis to determine the examination office staff positions and financial resources that would be needed to cover all core and targeted risk areas within 1- or 2-year examination cycles; (2) identify the most appropriate examination cycle after considering the trade-offs between examination coverage and resource requirements that would be involved; and (3) develop a strategy for obtaining the necessary examination office resources, which may involve reallocating OFHEO\u2019s existing full-time and contracting positions over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments, the acting director of OFHEO agreed with our findings and recommendations regarding the examination program.

He also stated that upon completion of the first round of examinations at year-end 1997, OFHEO will have completed the \u201cdiscovery\u201d process that is essential to understanding the quantity and quality of risk at the enterprises. The acting director further stated that OFHEO will transition to a \u201ccontinuous examination process\u201d at year-end 1997 that will allow for an annual examination cycle. Moreover, the acting director said that OFHEO\u2019s previous examination work would allow it to prioritize future examination activities while dramatically increasing the efficiency of the examination process.", "The acting director agreed with the report\u2019s finding that adequate resources must be committed to the examination program. He also said that OFHEO should be able to attract and retain qualified examiners in the future as a result of its increasing visibility in the regulatory community and efforts to ensure pay comparability.

Under HAAS, OFHEO staff reviewed invoices and sent approved invoices to HUD for payment processing.  However, we reported in 1995 that HAAS did not meet OFHEO\u2019s needs because, among other reasons, OFHEO staff had limited access to the system and experienced substantial delays in how HUD recorded OFHEO obligations and expenses. Also, HUD staff confused OFHEO with another HUD agency, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO), which resulted in errors in OFHEO\u2019s financial reports.

For example, OFHEO officials said that HUD staff continued to inaccurately record transactions and did not provide OFHEO with the support necessary to correct errors. In addition, OFHEO officials said that there were prolonged periods when HUDCAPS was unavailable, and OFHEO staff were unable to record transactions.
