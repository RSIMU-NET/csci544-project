GAO was asked to evaluate DOD's efforts to integrate UAS into ongoing operations while optimizing the use of all DOD ISR assets. Specifically, this report addresses the extent that (1) DOD has taken steps to facilitate the integration of UAS into combat operations, and (2) DOD's approach to allocating and tasking its ISR assets considers all available ISR capabilities, including those provided by UAS.

To perform this work, GAO analyzed data and guidance on the use of ISR assets, and interviewed DOD officials, including those supporting ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD components have developed guidance to facilitate the integration of UAS into combat operations; however, further steps are needed to coordinate the deployment of these assets. For example, DOD developed guidance for the tactical employment of UAS and a Joint UAS Concept of Operations. This guidance is an important first step but does not address coordinating UAS and other ISR assets prior to deploying them to ongoing operations, which U.S. Central Command recognized is a critical factor in integrating UAS into combat operations. Until DOD addresses the need for DOD-wide advance coordination, it may continue to face challenges in successfully integrating UAS and other ISR assets into combat operations and may exacerbate integration challenges such as limited bandwidth. DOD's approach to allocating and tasking its ISR assets, including UAS, hinders its ability to optimize the use of these assets because it does not consider the capabilities of all available ISR assets. The command charged with recommending how theater-level DOD ISR assets should be allocated to support operational requirements does not have awareness of all available ISR assets because DOD does not have a mechanism for obtaining this information. Similarly, the commander responsible for coordinating ongoing joint air operations does not have information on how assets controlled by tactical units are being used or what missions they've been tasked to support. Nor do tactical units have information on how theater-level assets and ISR assets embedded in other units are being tasked, which results in problems such as duplicative taskings. This lack of visibility occurs because DOD does not have a mechanism for tracking the missions both theater- and tactical-level ISR assets are supporting or how they are being used. Without an approach to allocation and tasking that includes a mechanism for considering all ISR capabilities, DOD may be unable to fully leverage all available ISR assets and optimize their use. DOD is unable to fully evaluate the performance of its ISR assets because it lacks a complete set of metrics and does not consistently receive feedback to ensure the warfighter's needs were met. Although the Joint Functional Component Command for ISR has been tasked with developing ISR metrics, DOD currently assesses its ISR missions with limited quantitative metrics such as the number of targets planned versus captured. While these metrics are a good start, DOD officials acknowledge that the current metrics do not capture all of the qualitative considerations associated with measuring ISR asset effectiveness such as the cumulative knowledge provided by numerous ISR missions. There is an ongoing effort within DOD to develop additional quantitative as well as qualitative ISR metrics, but no DOD-wide milestones have been established. Furthermore, DOD guidance calls for an evaluation of the results of joint operations; however, DOD officials acknowledge that this feedback is not consistently occurring due to the fast pace of operations in theater. Without metrics and feedback, DOD may not be able to validate how well the warfighters' needs are being met, whether it is optimizing the use of existing assets, or which new systems would best support warfighting needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are being transformed  Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are being transformed  by new intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and strike  by new intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and strike  capabilities, some of which have been achieved through the use of  capabilities, some of which have been achieved through the use of  unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).

Unmanned aircraft are deployed and  controlled at different levels of command and can be categorized into  three main classes: man-portable, tactical, and theater. Table 1 illustrates  examples of UAS in each category. Man-portable UAS are small, self- contained, and portable and are generally used to support the small  ground combat teams in the field. Tactical UAS are larger systems that are  generally used to support operational units at tactical levels of command  such as the battalion or brigade. Tactical UAS are locally operated and  controlled by the units. Theater UAS are operated and controlled by the  Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) and are generally used  to support combatant commander ISR priorities, although in certain  circumstances they can be assigned to support tactical operations, such as  when troops are being fired on. Theater UAS traditionally have been more  capable than tactical or man-portable systems. For example, theater UAS  typically contain characteristics that make them more capable than other  categories of UAS, such as their more robust communications architecture  and more capable payloads that allow for production of more diverse  intelligence data products. However, some tactical systems, such as the  Army\u2019s Warrior UAS, are being developed that are capable of performing  theater-level requirements and, as currently envisioned, will be embedded  in and controlled at the tactical level by units.", "DOD uses an annual process for allocating or distributing available DOD  theater-level airborne ISR assets, including UAS, to the combatant  commanders. The allocation process is managed by U.S. Strategic  Command\u2019s Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence,  Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JFCC-ISR). In 2003, DOD altered its  unified command plan to give U.S. Strategic Command responsibility for  planning, integrating, and coordinating ISR in support of strategic and  global operations. To execute this responsibility, U.S. Strategic Command  established the JFCC-ISR in March 2005. The JFCC-ISR is charged with  recommending to the Secretary of Defense how DOD\u2019s theater-level ISR  assets should be allocated, or distributed, among combatant commanders  and for the integration and synchronization of DOD, national, and allied  ISR capabilities and collection efforts.", "Once DOD\u2019s ISR assets are allocated to the combatant commanders, they  are available to be assigned or tasked based on combatant commander  priorities against specific missions in support of ongoing operations.  Authority for tasking ISR assets, including UAS, is generally determined by  the level of the objective the asset is deployed to support and the  command level of the unit that controls the asset. Therefore, most theater- level UAS assets that are controlled and tasked by the JFACC are generally  used to support theater-level objectives and priorities, as established by  the combatant commander. Most tactical UAS assets controlled by the  services or the U.S. Special Operations Command are used to support  tactical objectives and priorities, which may differ from theater-level  priorities.

It also states that the controlling unit will  provide a system and platform concept of operations to CENTCOM no  later than 15 days prior to the asset\u2019s arrival.

However, they were unaware if the procedures were  distributed further to the services, and service officials we interviewed,  including those at the service Headquarters as well as those stationed  within units returning from ongoing operations, indicated they were not  aware of the requirement. CENTCOM officials indicate that the procedures  have not always been followed.", "The Warrior Alpha, which was fielded by the Joint Improvised Explosive  Device Defeat Organization and operated by the Army to aid in the  identification and elimination of improvised explosive devices, illustrates  why this advance coordination is so critical. As a result of coordinating  with CENTCOM, the Army was made aware of limitations such as  bandwidth and limited ramp space and decided to deploy the Warrior  Alpha to an alternate location. While CENTCOM and Army officials  disagree on whether the coordination was completed in a timely manner,  all agree it was ultimately completed.

To address this need,  CENTCOM developed in November 2006 an ISR Systems Concept of  Operations Standardization Memo. CENTCOM officials stated that the ISR  memo is intended to provide CENTCOM with awareness of what assets  are coming into theater and to allow CENTCOM to ensure the asset is able  to be incorporated into the existing infrastructure, given operational  challenges such as limited communications bandwidth.

Once DOD ISR assets have been allocated,  those assets are available to the combatant commanders to be assigned, or  tasked, against specific requests for ISR support in ongoing operations.  The JFACC is responsible for planning, coordinating, and monitoring joint  air operations to focus the effect of air capabilities and for assuring their  effective and efficient use in achieving the combatant commanders\u2019  objectives. However, while the JFACC has visibility into how all theater- level ISR assets, like the Air Force\u2019s Predator, are being used, he or she  does not have visibility into how tactical ISR assets, such as the Army\u2019s  Hunter, are being used on a daily basis or what missions they are  supporting. The JFACC generally tasks assets that support theater-level  objectives, while assets that support tactical-level objectives are tasked  and controlled by the services or by the U.S. Special Operations  Command. Tactical units utilize their embedded, or tactical, assets first to  satisfy unit intelligence needs. However, when tactical assets are not  available or capable of satisfying a unit\u2019s need for ISR support, the unit  requests theater-level ISR support. Requests for most theater-level assets  are entered into a central DOD database, but there is no similar database  that captures requests for tactical-level assets.

For example, the Air Tasking Order would track the  time, date, and location where a UAS was operating, but there is no  mechanism that would track what intelligence the UAS was supposed to  gather on a mission or why the UAS was being used on a mission. Without  a database or similar mechanism providing visibility into how tactical-level  assets are being tasked, the JFACC is limited in his or her awareness of  how those assets are being used on a daily basis, which hinders the  JFACC\u2019s ability to optimize the use of those assets.", "This lack of visibility limits the JFACC\u2019s ability to leverage those assets  using techniques such as cross-cueing, which is the collaborative effort of  using capabilities offered by multiple ISR platforms to fulfill a mission. By  using techniques such as cross-cueing, the JFACC has been able to use the  different types of capabilities brought by different theater-level manned  and unmanned ISR assets to maximize the intelligence collected. For  example, a manned Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System was  tasked to monitor an area. When this system sensed movement in the area,  a Predator was then tasked to collect imagery to confirm suspected  activity. Without visibility into how tactical assets are being utilized, the  JFACC is limited in his or her ability to optimize the use of all available  DOD ISR assets and to focus the effect of these assets to ensure their  efficient and effective use. Such visibility will become even more  important given that services such as the Army are acquiring, and planning  to embed in units, ISR assets capable of satisfying theater-level  requirements, such as the Extended Range/Multi-Purpose or Warrior UAS,  which could otherwise be leveraged to support JFACC requirements.", "Duplicative taskings that occur are often driven by a lack of visibility into  where ISR assets at all levels are operating and what they are tasked to do.  For example, a DOD official shared with us an example of unnecessary  duplication where an Army unit requested a full-motion video-capable  asset to support a high-priority requirement. When the asset, a Predator  UAS, arrived to support the requirement, its operator realized the Army  unit had also tasked one of its tactical assets, a Hunter UAS, against the  requirement. As a result of the lack of visibility over all assets, the  potential exists for multiple ISR aircraft to be tasked to operate in the  same area and against the same requirement. However, some level of  duplication may be necessary when driven by mission requirements and  system capabilities. Certain missions, such as special operations, often  need a certain amount of duplication in order to achieve the desired result.  For example, a mission intended to track activity of suspected terrorists  may require multiple systems to follow identified individuals who flee the  scene in different directions. Furthermore, assets such as the Predator  UAS experience system limitations when equipped with a full-motion- video sensor in that they are only able to provide surveillance of a narrow  or \u201csoda straw\u201d view. A certain level of duplication of UAS may be  necessary to support a mission to obtain a complete view of the area  under surveillance.", "Greater visibility at the tactical level could provide units with a greater  awareness of where other ISR assets, including both theater-level and  those assets embedded in other units, are operating and what they are  being used to do.

While these metrics are a good start, DOD  officials acknowledge that the current metrics do not take into account all  of the qualitative considerations associated with measuring ISR asset  effectiveness such as the cumulative knowledge provided by numerous  ISR missions, whether the ISR asset did what it was intended to do,  whether it had the intended effect, and whether the intelligence captured  contributed towards accomplishment of the mission.", "The JFCC-ISR is working with the combatant commands to develop  additional quantitative ISR metrics as well as qualitative metrics to assess  the effectiveness of ISR assets, although DOD officials acknowledge the  progress in developing metrics has been limited. In developing these  metrics, the JFCC-ISR is leveraging national intelligence attributes, which  include characteristics such as whether the intelligence is comprehensive  to perform all missions anywhere and at anytime in any weather; credible  to allow users to make sound decisions and take appropriate action;  persistent to collect often and long enough to get the job done; and timely  to meet user needs. Furthermore, the JFCC-ISR has not made any progress  in establishing DOD-wide milestones for the development of these metrics.  Milestones are the required steps and planned dates for completion of  those steps leading up to metrics development.", "DOD officials indicate that determining the success of ISR missions is  difficult given the nature of intelligence collection. Specifically, hundreds  of hours of ISR missions and target tracking could culminate in the  capture of a high value target; however, it may be difficult to measure the  effectiveness of each individual ISR mission that led to the ultimate  capture and mission success. This cumulative knowledge provided by ISR  assets is difficult to quantify. An official from the Office of the  Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics also  acknowledged that it may be more difficult to evaluate the success of  ongoing operations due to the dynamic and subjective nature of  requirements. The official noted, however, that DOD is better equipped to  measure the success of its more mature and traditional ISR missions, such  as sensitive reconnaissance operations, because the objectives are better  defined allowing more direct determination of success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Consistent Feedback on Whether ISR Assets Meet Warfighters\u2019 Needs", "paragraphs": ["In addition to metrics, DOD also relies on feedback for evaluating how  successful its ISR assets are in meeting the warfighter\u2019s needs. However,  DOD lacks consistent feedback on whether ISR assets meet the needs of  the warfighters. Joint Publication 2-01 calls for intelligence personnel and  consumers to evaluate and provide immediate feedback on how well  intelligence operations perform to meet commander\u2019s intelligence  requirements. This information could be used to inform DOD\u2019s acquisition,  allocation, and tasking of ISR assets. While DOD officials indicate they  occasionally receive feedback on ISR asset performance, they  acknowledge that feedback specific to how ISR assets performed in  individual ISR missions is not consistently occurring. While there is real- time communication among unmanned aircraft system operators,  requesters, and intelligence personnel during an operation, and agency  officials indicate this communication is beneficial to providing real-time  feedback, there is little to no feedback after the operation to determine  whether the warfighters\u2019 needs were met. Officials indicate that the fast  pace of operations in theater affects the ability of end users to provide  feedback on every ISR mission. For example, according to Marine Corps  officials, there is a mechanism for Marine Corps units to provide feedback,  but the feedback is not consistently provided because there is no  systematic process in place to ensure that this feedback is captured.  Without developing metrics and systematically gathering feedback that  enables it to assess the extent to which ISR assets are successful in  supporting warfighter needs, DOD is not in a position to validate the true  demand for ISR assets, determine whether it is allocating and tasking its  ISR assets in the most effective manner, or acquire new systems that best  support warfighting needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has achieved operational success with UAS in ongoing operations,  but it continues to face operational challenges that limit its ability to fully  optimize the use of these assets. These operational challenges have been  exacerbated by the lack of advance coordination when new assets are  being deployed in theater. While operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have  been ongoing for some time, the potential exists for DOD to need to  establish operations in other areas of the world very quickly. A DOD-wide  procedure for advance coordination is critical to enable DOD to quickly  support ISR assets once deployed to ongoing operations. Until DOD takes  steps to address the need for DOD-wide advance coordination, it may be  limited in its ability to efficiently deploy and utilize UAS assets and may  not allow the combatant commander time to plan to support incoming  assets.", "With the operational successes that have been realized with UAS,  commanders are requesting them in greater numbers. In spite of a  dramatic increase in UAS funding, DOD officials indicate that annual  allocation levels are constrained by the number of ISR assets in the  inventory and JFCC-ISR is, therefore, not able to allocate to the combatant  commanders DOD ISR assets in sufficient numbers to meet all requests for  ISR support. However, our work indicates that DOD\u2019s approach to UAS  may not leverage all of the DOD ISR assets currently available and DOD  may not be in the best position to determine if perceived demand is well- founded. Given the substantial investment DOD is making in UAS and the  increasing demand for them, it is critical that DOD\u2019s approach to managing  its ISR assets, including UAS, allow it to optimize the use of these assets.  Without an approach to its allocation and tasking processes that considers  all ISR capabilities, DOD may not be in a position to leverage all available  ISR assets and to optimize the use of those assets. Moreover, DOD lacks  visibility over the true demand for and use of ISR assets, which could  hinder its ability to make informed decisions about the need to purchase  additional UAS assets and what quantities should be purchased.  Furthermore, without developing metrics and systematically gathering  feedback that enables DOD to assess the extent to which ISR missions are  successful in supporting warfighter needs, decision makers may not be in  a position to determine which UAS systems would best support the  warfighters\u2019 needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To mitigate challenges in integrating UAS, and other ISR assets, into  combat operations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in  conjunction with the service secretaries and combatant commanders, take  the following three actions:    establish DOD-wide requirements for coordinating with the combatant  commanders in advance of bringing UAS into the theater of operations;    develop a plan for communicating those requirements throughout DOD;    establish a mechanism to ensure the services comply with these  requirements.", "To ensure DOD has the information needed to consider all ISR assets   when allocating and tasking these assets, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense develop a mechanism for    obtaining information on all ISR assets, including all DOD, national, and  allied assets, operating in each of the combatant commanders\u2019 area of  operations; and   allowing users at all levels within DOD to gain real-time situational  awareness on where DOD ISR assets are operating and, where not  prohibited by the mission, what they are being used to do.", "To improve DOD\u2019s ability to evaluate the performance of its ISR missions,  we recommend the Secretary of Defense    establish DOD-wide milestones for development of qualitative and    develop a process for systematically capturing feedback from intelligence  and operations communities to assess how effective ISR assets are in  meeting warfighters\u2019 requirements; and   create a mechanism to ensure this information is used to inform DOD\u2019s  acquisition, allocation, and tasking of its ISR assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD generally concurred  with all of our recommendations.  DOD generally agreed with our  recommendation that the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the  service secretaries and combatant commanders, establish DOD-wide  requirements for coordinating with the combatant commanders in  advance of bringing UAS into the theater of operations; develop a plan for  communicating those requirements throughout DOD; and establish a  mechanism to ensure the services comply with these requirements. DOD  noted that it currently has a well-defined process to coordinate with the  combatant commanders on the introduction of UAS into theater and cited  several examples including the annual process for allocating theater-level  UAS, and actions between stateside units and units in theater to plan for  deployment of ISR capabilities. DOD, however, acknowledged that a more  standardized method could improve efficiency of the coordination process  and stated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be tasked to look at  standardizing the coordination process and evaluate and provide direction  for an improved coordination process. Further, DOD noted that, based on  this evaluation, if direction is required, it will be issued via a Chairman\u2019s  directive which is mandatory and therefore establishes the mechanism  that ensures compliance. We recognize that DOD has various processes  related to UAS but note that none, including the examples cited by DOD,  represent a standardized, DOD-wide approach that the services and  combatant commanders can follow in coordinating the specific details of  deploying UAS assets, regardless of geographic area.  Furthermore, we  believe that a directive requiring coordination, by itself, does not ensure  compliance, and would encourage DOD to include provisions detailing  how implementation of the directive will be monitored.", "DOD also generally concurred with our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense develop a mechanism for obtaining information on  all ISR assets\u2014including all DOD, national, and allied assets\u2014operating in  each of the combatant commanders\u2019 area of operations; and allowing  users at all levels within DOD to gain real-time situational awareness on  where DOD ISR assets are operating and, where not prohibited by the  mission, what they are being used to do.  Specifically, DOD agrees that a  mechanism for obtaining information on all ISR assets is needed and  commented that work is underway within the JFCC-ISR to develop such a  mechanism.  DOD commented that it is not currently practical to provide  situational awareness on some UAS such as the small, hand-launched UAS  at the lowest operational level because these systems do not have the  capacity or capability to communicate their position to a common point.  DOD noted that it will determine the UAS operational levels that will  provide widespread situational awareness, including operational details  and timelines of data reporting. We recognize that situational awareness  may not currently be practical for some UAS but would encourage the  department to seek to maximize coverage in exploring options for  improved situational awareness.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  establish DOD-wide milestones for development of qualitative and  quantitative metrics and stated that JFCC-ISR is standing up an  Assessments Division that will be responsible for the development of  metrics.  We recognize the Assessment Division has been tasked with  development of ISR metrics and reemphasize the need to develop  milestones for metrics development. DOD partially concurred with our  recommendations that it develop a process for systematically capturing  feedback from intelligence and operations communities to assess how  effective ISR assets are in meeting warfighters\u2019 requirements and create a  mechanism to ensure this information is used to inform DOD\u2019s acquisition,  allocation, and tasking of its ISR assets.  DOD agreed that an improved and  standardized process for collection and reporting of feedback would  enhance visibility and provide more effective warfighter support, but  pointed out that organizations within the department collect feedback or  conduct lessons learned studies.  We acknowledge that DOD has  organizations such as the Army\u2019s Center for Lessons Learned that are  responsible for capturing feedback and developing lessons learned based  on that feedback. However, these organizations are charged with  capturing lessons learned on a number of issues and are not focused on  ISR effectiveness.  Furthermore, our recommendation pertains to DOD\u2019s  guidance which states it is imperative that intelligence personnel and  consumers to evaluate and provide immediate feedback on how well  individual intelligence operations perform to meet commanders\u2019  intelligence requirements. While the feedback that may be captured by  those lessons learned organizations is noteworthy, it is often not  immediate and specific to individual missions. As we noted in our report,  DOD officials acknowledged that feedback specific to how ISR assets  performed in individual ISR missions is not consistently occurring. DOD  further commented that it has mechanisms in place to inform its decision  making processes on the acquisition, allocation, and tasking of its ISR  assets such as the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System  which assesses, among other things, capability gaps and solutions. We  agree that the mechanisms mentioned in DOD\u2019s response exist; however,  DOD currently does not have sufficient qualitative and quantitative metrics  needed to collect data on UAS performance nor does it have a means for  incorporating such data into the processes currently used to make  decisions on ISR assets.", "The full text of DOD\u2019s written comments is reprinted in appendix II.
