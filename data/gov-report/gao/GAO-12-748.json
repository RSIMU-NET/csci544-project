In 2009, 20 agencies reported completing such plans.", "All 24 agencies reported that, to reduce employees\u0092 risk of exposure to influenza, they developed policies or procedures such as telework and avoiding all unnecessary travel. In the 2009 survey, 22 agencies reported developing the former policy and 18 the latter.", "All of the agencies reported that they planned for the distribution of hygiene supplies to protect employees whose duties require them to work onsite during an influenza pandemic. In 2009, 18 agencies reported taking this planning step.", "However, the agencies reported uneven status in some key areas suggesting some additional oversight is needed. For example, only nine agencies reported they have classified all or most jobs for onsite mission essential functions by exposure risk level. Additional oversight could help in ensuring that, by classifying jobs by exposure risk level, agencies have appropriate measures in place to protect those employees who must carry out mission essential functions that cannot be performed remotely during an influenza pandemic.", "There is limited oversight of agencies\u0092 progress to protect their employees during a pandemic. In 2008, the Homeland Security Council required agencies to certify their pandemic planning status, but according to agencies\u0092 officials, has not done so since then. As in 2009, GAO interviewed four agencies\u0097Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Labor, and Office of Personnel Management. Each of these agencies is responsible for providing influenza pandemic continuity of operations guidance, which includes elements such as planning, personnel protection, or workplace options to federal departments and agencies. DHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported they conduct biennial assessments of department and agency continuity capabilities and report the results to the President through the National Continuity Coordinator. However, this assessment does not include planning elements specific to influenza pandemic planning, such as whether federal workers\u0092 influenza pandemic risk assessments are regularly updated and whether agencies have planned to provide protective measures to mitigate exposure risks. Including such information in the biennial assessment process could provide monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of progress and help focus attention on those areas in which reported progress is uneven."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS provide additional oversight of agencies\u0092 pandemic preparedness and help focus attention on areas of uneven progress reported in GAO\u0092s survey by directing FEMA to include in its biennial assessments of agencies\u0092 continuity capabilities consideration of agencies\u0092 progress in assessing exposure risk levels of occupational exposure, identifying appropriate protective measures, and establishing operational plans to provide such protections for federal workers during an influenza pandemic.

The HSC noted that it would give serious  consideration to our report findings and recommendations, and DHS said  the report findings and recommendations would contribute to its efforts to  ensure that government entities are well prepared for what may come  next. Given the importance of agencies\u2019 ability to continue operations  while protecting their employees in the event of an influenza pandemic,  you asked us to (1) determine what progress federal agencies report they  have made since our 2009 report and identify challenges federal  agencies report they face in protecting their workforce during an influenza  pandemic; and (2) determine the extent to which oversight of agencies\u2019  progress was being conducted and how the oversight information is being  used.", "To address these objectives, we surveyed the 24 agencies covered by  the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) to determine whether  they made progress in their preparedness to protect their workforce since  our 2009 survey and to identify challenges they faced in planning for  protection of their workers. All 24 CFO Act agencies completed the  survey for a response rate of 100 percent. In addition, to better  understand the extent to which influenza pandemic planning had filtered  down to the component and facility levels, we also gathered data from  these levels in our 2012 survey. In our 2009 survey, 15 of 24 agencies  provided examples of key component-level mission essential functions  that could not be performed remotely during an influenza pandemic.  Using those examples, we selected a component from each of these 15  agencies for our 2012 survey and surveyed the agencies to determine  whether they had made plans at lower organizational levels to protect  their employees whose onsite presence was necessary in order to carry  out mission essential functions. In addition to these surveys, we  conducted follow-up work to assess FAA\u2019s progress in addressing the  unique challenges we highlighted in our 2009 report regarding protection  for air traffic controllers who must perform onsite mission essential  functions during an influenza pandemic.

Unlike incidents that are discretely  bounded in space or time (e.g., most natural or man-made disasters), an  influenza pandemic is not a singular event, but is likely to come in waves,  each lasting weeks or months, and pass through communities of all sizes  across the nation and the world simultaneously, as we have witnessed  with the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. While a pandemic will not  directly damage physical infrastructure such as power lines or computer  systems, it threatens the operation of critical systems by potentially  removing the essential personnel needed to operate them from the  workplace for weeks or months because of illness, the need to care for  family members who are sick, or fear of becoming infected.", "In response to concerns that the emergence of H5N1 avian influenza (or  bird flu) in Asia in 2003 would mutate and result in a human influenza  pandemic, the President and his HSC issued two planning documents.  Issued in November 2005, the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenzaprovides a high-level overview of the approach that the federal  government will take to prepare for and respond to an influenza  pandemic.

Seventeen agencies reported in 2012 that they updated their influenza  pandemic plan to include lessons learned from the pandemic. The  Department of Energy (DOE), for example, reported that it had revised its  plan to recommend that precautions and safeguards be based on the  local prevalence of influenza at a specific DOE site rather than applying  assumptions used for its headquarters location.

Specifically, some of these  challenges included the lack of guidance related to policies and  procedures for allocating and distributing vaccines and antivirals for their  employees and how they should plan for nonfederal employees. For  example, State reported that it had faced challenges because vaccines  were not readily available during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic for  the approximately 50,000 employees and accompanying family members  who work in embassies and consulates overseas. During the 2009 H1N1  influenza pandemic, State received a rationed shipment of vaccines for 2  percent of its workforce, which encompassed both domestic-based and  international-based employees. The initial shipments were sent to State  offices in Baghdad and Kabul; other diplomatic posts had to wait for later  shipments. As we had reported in June 2011 on lessons learned from the  2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the H1N1 vaccine was not widely  available when expected or when demand was highest in October 2009.  By the time the H1N1 vaccine was widely available in late December  2009, the peak of H1N1 influenza activity had passed and many  individuals were no longer as interested in getting vaccinated.DOT reported that there is a need for governmentwide guidance or   Further,  authority clarifying what federal agencies can legally do to protect onsite  contractors who work closely with federal employees.", "Unlike the allocation and distribution of seasonal influenza vaccines, the  allocation and distribution of influenza pandemic vaccines are managed  by the federal government. For example, during the 2009 H1N1  pandemic, the federal government determined that HHS would manage  the allotment of the H1N1 vaccine. However, the federal agencies each  make a decision whether or not to procure antivirals for their employees.  Nevertheless, agencies still reported challenges. HHS reported that it  issues nationwide guidance on the use of antivirals which informs the  plans of employers who have chosen to stockpile these drugs, including  federal agencies. However, HHS noted that it is an agency decision  whether to purchase and distribute antivirals. HHS officials also  acknowledged the lack of an approved process for internal HHS  distribution of antivirals for its employees as a challenge, but noted they  are evaluating lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic  regarding this issue and will incorporate them into future influenza  pandemic planning. Further, DOT reported that it had not planned for  procuring antiviral medications for prophylaxis because there is no  requirement or reimbursement for federal agencies to do so; and SBA  reported that stockpiling antivirals and prioritizing distribution of antivirals  for its workforce, including who and when, were challenges.", "Tied with medical countermeasures, 11 agencies cited challenges related  to information sharing among federal agencies and also with their  employees. For example, DOT and USDA reported they had not obtained  post-H1N1 information regarding governmentwide lessons learned or  best practices related to workforce protection issues that could be  incorporated into their pandemic plans to help plan for future influenza  pandemics. According to DHS\u2019s NRF, federal agencies should  incorporate lessons learned from real-life incidents, such as an influenza  pandemic, to make improvements in further strengthening their capability  to respond to future emergencies. The NRF specifies that evaluation and continual process improvement are cornerstones of effective  preparedness. We had previously recommended in June 2011 that the  HSC should work with HHS, DHS, and other federal agencies to  incorporate lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in addition to  the lessons we identified, which included sharing relevant findings of  agencies\u2019 after-action reports with key stakeholders, in planning for future  pandemics.", "As noted earlier, agencies reported that there were challenges with  communicating pandemic-related information to their employees. USDA,  for example, reported that it was challenging to provide recurring  pandemic-related information to ensure new employees were cognizant  of its pandemic plans and guidance. In addition, HUD reported that  providing real-time information to its employees could be a challenge,  based on its experience with the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Further,  HHS reported that it recognized that during the 2009 H1N1 influenza  pandemic, its internal communication plans for workplace protection and  human capital planning were delayed or inadequate. To address this  shortfall, HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and  OPM published a communications toolkit during the 2009 H1N1 influenza  pandemic in October 2009 for the federal workforce that included  communications resources and guidance for federal employees and  supervisors to use. government establish the need for relevant, reliable, and timely  communications. According to these standards, effective communications  should occur with information flowing down, across, and up the  organization as well as with external stakeholders that may have a  significant impact in meeting agency objectives. Information sharing  prior to and during an emergency, such as an influenza pandemic, is  important to ensure the continuity of agencies\u2019 operations and mission  essential functions.", "HHS, CDC, and OPM, Preparing for the Flu: A Communications Toolkit for the Federal  Workforce (Oct. 1, 2009). was a challenge. Although we pointed out earlier that all 24 agencies  reported that they planned to use telework as a means to protect their  employees in the event of an influenza pandemic, several agencies  reported that it may be a challenge to implement the measure. NASA, for  instance, reported that because of the high level of commitment of its  employees to assure mission success, educating and encouraging its  workforce to use various social distancing recommendations, such as  teleworking from home, canceling meetings, and not reporting to work  when sick, was a challenge. In addition, NSF reported that it did not know  whether all of its employees had internet capabilities in their homes to  carry out work tasks remotely, while SBA reported that it was challenging  to encourage all staff to become telework-enabled\u2014such as having the  appropriate capabilities at home to be able to work remotely. With respect  to workspace configuration, DHS reported the difficulty of reconfiguring  workspace to protect employees who must perform classified work in a  sensitive compartmented information facility. Such facilities present  similar social distancing challenges for air traffic controllers who work in  close capacity in air route traffic control centers, which we will discuss  next."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pandemic Plans to Protect Air Traffic Controllers Have Progressed, but Social Distancing Remains an Intractable Challenge", "paragraphs": ["We reported in 2009 that FAA pandemic plans to protect air traffic  controllers were not ready for implementation and also highlighted various  challenges in protecting air traffic controllers who had to perform onsite  mission essential functions during an influenza pandemic. We followed up  with FAA officials on the extent of their progress on four specific issues.", "First, since our 2009 report, FAA has ensured that its facilities developed  plans to protect air traffic controllers during an influenza pandemic. In  2009, we reported that the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), FAA\u2019s line of  business responsible for air traffic controllers\u2019 services, had not directed  facilities, such as its air route traffic control centers, to develop pandemic- specific plans. ATO directed its facilities 3 months after our report was  issued to develop contingency staffing plans to mitigate the probable  impact of an influenza pandemic and also instructed its facilities on  immediate preparedness steps at the facility level. For example, ATO  facility managers were instructed to identify employees who were eligible  and willing to telework, ensure that the appropriate employees complete  the FAA telework program, and identify the minimum cadre of employees,  by position, who would need to telework during an influenza pandemic  outbreak to sustain mission essential services.", "Second, FAA augmented its agencywide pandemic plan with a workplace  protection policy. In 2010, FAA updated ATO\u2019s draft pandemic plan with  detailed protective measures for its workforce, including air traffic  controllers. For example, FAA added information to the plan about  sanitizers that are safe to use on air traffic control equipment. At the time  of our report in 2009, FAA had not yet certified a sanitizer to be used to  sanitize the equipment. It was important for FAA to certify a sanitizer  because many sanitizers are caustic and could corrode sensitive  equipment necessary for flight safety. ATO\u2019s plan now states employees  should regularly cleanse shared equipment using certified disinfectant or  cleaning agents. Additional measures call for employees to take a  pandemic awareness course, cover coughs, and wash their hands  frequently, which are consistent with CDC\u2019s guidance. FAA reported the  plan has been distributed as guidance to managers and supervisors and  remains in draft status as it is a \u201cliving document.\u201d", "Third, FAA has addressed issues related to medication. At the time of our  report in 2009, the Office of Aerospace Medicine had not finalized its  policy on the preventative use of the flu medication Tamiflu by on-duty  controllers. FAA regulations on medication for air traffic controllers are  strict because certain medications may impair air traffic controllers\u2019  performance. The Office of Aerospace Medicine revised and finalized its  policy in 2009 regarding the use of Tamiflu for preventative use by on- duty controllers. they have been prescribed antiviral medications by either a public health  authority or their personal physicians, if no side effects from the  medications are evident, and if they are operating normally on the job.", "FAA, Use of Anti-Influenza Medication by FAA Employees Performing Safety-Related  Duties (Oct. 8, 2009).", "Finally, FAA was not able to resolve social distancing challenges. CDC  recommends maintaining 6 feet of separation during an influenza  pandemic, but this is not possible for air traffic controllers because they  work in close quarters. According to FAA officials, they considered having  air traffic controllers use personal protective equipment, but concluded  that N-95 respirators or surgical masks impede the clear verbal  communications necessary to maintain aviation safety. At the time of our  report in 2009, FAA had just received the results of a feasibility study for  the use of a powered air purifying respirator. The study findings  suggested that if FAA used the technology, it would need to address  many potential problems including noise, visibility, and comfort. At this  time, FAA officials state they have not identified a technical solution to  equip controllers with a practical protective piece of equipment that will  mitigate the risk of working in close quarters while supporting adequate  communications necessary for safety. The FAA official responsible for  ATO\u2019s pandemic planning stated social distancing challenges appear  intractable with the current technology, although FAA will continue to seek  opportunities to mitigate potential exposure to influenza. For the present,  this includes being vigilant in implementing hygiene measures in their  workspaces and exploring other mitigation controls such as technological  advances that reduce transmissibility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Plans and Progress to Protect Federal Workers during an Influenza Pandemic Receive Limited Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Federal Continuity Directive 1 requires federal executive agency heads to  evaluate program readiness to ensure the adequacy and capability of  continuity plans and programs.

However, DHS officials said  the HSC informed them in late 2006 or early 2007 that they were not  required to report on these responsibilities. Rather, the HSC requested  that agencies certify to the council that their plans addressed the  applicable elements of a pandemic checklist in 2006 and again in 2008.  However, according to two agencies\u2019 officials, the HSC has not asked  agencies to certify their plans since then. As we reported in 2011, the  National Security Staff (NSS), who supports the HSC, is coordinating a  larger effort to transition national preparedness from a dependence on  fixed plans for specific threats to an approach based on a variety of  hazards, or an all-hazards approach in accordance with Presidential  Policy Directive 8.We submitted a request for information and  asked to meet with the relevant NSS subject matter experts regarding  oversight of agencies\u2019 preparedness to protect workers during a  pandemic.

In the  absence of any information from the HSC, it is not possible to determine  what, if anything, it is doing to oversee federal agency pandemic  planning. Regarding the 2009 recommendation we made to the HSC,  DHS officials told us that the HSC has not requested the Secretary of  Homeland Security to monitor and report to the President on the  readiness of agencies to continue their operations while protecting their  employees in the event of a pandemic.", "As we did in 2009, we interviewed four agencies to which the  Implementation Plan assigns responsibilities related to pandemic  preparedness. The four agencies we selected are responsible for  providing guidance, policy, or influenza pandemic-related expertise to  other agencies. Each of these agencies is responsible for providing  influenza pandemic continuity of operations (COOP) guidance, which  includes elements such as COOP planning, personnel protection, or  workplace options for federal departments and agencies.", "Labor\u2019s OSHA is responsible for promoting the safety and health of  workers, including communication of information related to an  influenza pandemic to workers and employers.", "HHS is responsible for the overall coordination of the public health  and medical emergency response during an influenza pandemic.

But these officials told us that  DHS is the federal lead agency for coordinating overall continuity  operations. In this capacity, DHS coordinates the assessment of  agencies\u2019 continuity activities and programs. The DHS Secretary provides  biennial assessments of department and agency continuity capabilities  and reports the results to the President, through the NCC, and to agency  heads as required by Federal Continuity Directive 1.", "FEMA officials responsible for the national continuity program noted that  while agencies are responsible for their preparedness, and FEMA does  not assess the efficacy of overall agency pandemic preparedness,  FEMA\u2019s biennial assessment process does assess whether agencies\u2019  continuity plans address some of the unique considerations of an  influenza pandemic. FEMA collects agency information for the  assessment through continuity exercises and the Continuity Evaluation  Tool (evaluation tool), a comprehensive survey covering 14 elements of  continuity programs, plans, and procedures for all-hazards, including a  pandemic threat. In addition to reporting to the NCC, FEMA also  compares the results of multiple biennial continuity assessments to  identify government trends in overall continuity preparedness. The  evaluation tool asks whether agencies\u2019 communications capabilities will  allow them to continue operations for all types of emergencies, including  influenza pandemics. The evaluation tool also asks if agencies have  given full consideration to social distancing strategies, such as telework.  Because the evaluation tool which FEMA uses to evaluate agencies\u2019  continuity plans is based on an all-hazards approach, it does not include  the planning elements identified in the Key Elements checklist that  agencies specifically use for pandemic planning. Consequently, the  evaluation tool, for example, does not include pandemic preparedness- related questions such as whether federal workers\u2019 influenza pandemic  risk assessments are regularly updated and whether agencies have  planned to provide protective measures to mitigate exposure risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our follow-up survey of the 24 CFO Act agencies showed that significant  progress has been made in many areas since we last reported on this  issue in 2009. In particular, almost all or most of the agencies, selected  components, and their facilities have completed pandemic plans that  address how they would protect employees that were associated with  mission essential functions that could not be performed remotely. In  addition, almost half of the agencies reported to have determined the  number of employees that would have to perform mission essential  functions and also notified the employees that they were expected to  continue these operations during an influenza pandemic. However, the  agencies also reported uneven status in some key areas suggesting  some oversight targeted to bring attention to these areas is needed. For  example, only nine agencies reported that they have classified all or most  jobs for onsite mission essential functions by exposure risk level. Given  the continued threat of an influenza pandemic, it is important that  agencies have operational pandemic plans that identify appropriate  workforce strategies to protect employees while ensuring mission  essential functions continue. Adequate oversight could help in ensuring  that, by classifying jobs by exposure risk level, agencies have appropriate  measures in place to protect those employees who must carry out  mission essential functions that cannot be performed remotely during an  influenza pandemic.", "Agencies reported several challenges in planning for federal worker  protection in the event of an influenza pandemic. Sharing of information  among agencies is related to some of these challenges.

Further, FAA has not yet identified  personal protective equipment alternatives for use by air traffic controllers  who must report to work during an influenza pandemic. These issues will  continue to be challenges for which FAA may not be able to find viable  solutions.", "FEMA\u2019s biennial assessment of agencies\u2019 continuity capabilities does not  consider agency responses to significant influenza pandemic-related  questions regarding protection of federal workers.
