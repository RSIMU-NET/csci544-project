The basic goals of election systems in the United States are to  enable every eligible citizen who wishes to vote to cast a single ballot in  private and have the votes on that ballot counted accurately.  Administering  an election is a year-round activity that generally consists of the following:  Voter registration--This includes local election officials registering  eligible voters and maintaining voter registration lists to include updates  to registrants\u2019 information and deletions of the names of registrants who  are no longer eligible to vote.", "Absentee and early voting--This type of voting allows eligible persons to  vote in-person or by mail before election day.", "The conduct of an election--This aspect of election administration  includes preparation before election day, such as local election officials  arranging for polling places, recruiting and training poll workers,  designing ballots, and preparing voting equipment for use in casting and  tabulating votes; and election day activities, such as opening and closing  polling places and assisting voters to cast votes.", "Vote counting--This includes election officials tabulating the cast ballots;  determining whether and how to count ballots that cannot be read by  the vote counting equipment; certifying the final vote counts; and  performing recounts, if required.

NVRA also  establishes requirements to ensure that state programs to identify and  remove from voter registration rolls the names of individuals who are no  longer eligible to vote are uniform, nondiscriminatory, and do not exclude a  voter from the rolls solely because of his or her failure to vote.

Paper ballots, which are generally uniform in size, thickness, and  color, list the names of the candidates and the issues to be voted on.  Voters  generally complete their ballots in the privacy of a voting booth, recording  their choices by placing marks in boxes corresponding to the candidates\u2019  names and the issues.  After making their choices, voters drop the ballots  into sealed ballot boxes.  Election officials gather the sealed boxes and  transfer them to a central location, where the ballots are manually counted  and tabulated.  Figure 4 shows an example of a paper ballot.", "In 1892, the lever voting machine, known then as the Myer Automatic  Booth, was first used in the United States.  By 1930, lever machines were  used in almost all major cities, and by the 1960s, over half the nation\u2019s votes  were cast and counted on lever machines.  During this time, lever machines  helped alleviate concerns about vote fraud and manipulation that were  common with paper ballots.  Unlike paper ballots, however, lever machines  do not provide individual records of each vote.", "Lever machines are mechanical, with a \u201cballot\u201d composed of a rectangular  array of levers, which can be physically arranged either horizontally or  vertically.  Adjacent levers in each row are placed about one inch apart, and  the rows of levers are spaced 2 to 3 inches apart.  Printed strips listing the  candidates and issues are placed next to each lever.  Because the ballot is  limited to the size of the front of the lever machine, it is difficult to  accommodate multiple languages.", "When using a lever machine, voters first close a privacy curtain, using a  long handle attached to the machine.  They vote by pulling down those  levers next to the candidates or issues of their choice.  Making a particular  selection prevents any other selection in that contest (unless it is a vote-for- no-more-than-N contest, in which case no more than N levers would be  selectable).  Overvoting is prevented by the interlocking of the appropriate  mechanical levers in the machine before the election.", "Write-in votes are recorded on a paper roll within the lever machine.  The  voter opens the write-in slot by moving the lever to the appropriate position  and then writes in his or her choice on the exposed paper above the office  name.  Once this occurs, the machine locks and will no longer allow the  voter to vote for another candidate listed on the ballot for that particular  contest.", "After voting, the voter once again moves the handle, which simultaneously  opens the privacy curtain, records the vote, and resets the levers.  Figure 5  shows a lever machine.", "Votes are tallied by mechanical counters, which are attached to each lever.   These counters rotate after the voter moves the handle to open the privacy  curtain.  The counters are composed of three gears\u2014units, tens, and  hundreds.  Each vote causes a gear to make one tenth of a turn.  After 10  turns, the units gear turns to 0, and the tens gear turns to 1, equaling 10  votes.  Similarly, after 100 turns, the tens gear turns to 0, and the hundreds  gear turns to 1, equaling 100 votes.  At the close of the election, election  officials tally the votes by reading the counting mechanism totals on each  lever voting machine. Some machines can also print a paper copy of the  totals.", "The design of the lever machine does not allow for a recount of individual  voter records.  Therefore, if the machine malfunctions and a gear fails to  turn, no record exists from which a proper tally can be determined.   Mechanical lever machines are no longer manufactured.

There are two basic types of punch card devices: Votomatic and  Datavote.", "The Votomatic relies on machine-readable cards that contain 228, 312, or  456 prescored numbered boxes representing ballot choices.  The  corresponding ballot choices are indicated to the voter in a booklet  attached to the vote recording device, with the appropriate places to punch  indicated for each candidate and ballot choice.  To vote, the voter inserts  the ballot into the vote-recording device and uses a stylus to punch out the  appropriate prescored boxes.", "Votomatic punch card voting offers certain challenges because the ballot  must be properly aligned in the vote-recording device for the holes in the  ballot card to be punched all the way through.  Incomplete punches are not  uncommon, so that the rectangular scrap (the \u201cchad\u201d) punched by the  stylus may cling to the hole in the card and create what is referred to as a  \u201changing chad.\u201d  Hanging chads can cause tabulation machines to read  votes incorrectly and can make it difficult to determine voter intent in a  recount or contested election.  Voters cannot easily review a completed  ballot, because the ballot lacks candidate or issue information, having only  hole numbers. In addition, voters must use a separate piece of paper and  attach it to the ballot with the names of write-in candidates.  Figure 6  shows a Votomatic vote recording device and a Votomatic ballot.", "The Datavote also relies on a machine-readable card, but unlike the  Votomatic, the names of the candidates and issues are printed on the card  itself, eliminating the need for a ballot booklet.  The ballots are not  prescored, except for those used for absentee voting.  The voter uses a  stapler-like punching device to punch a hole corresponding to each  candidate and issue.  Spaces for write-in candidates are generally placed on  the ballot.  Because the candidates' names are printed on Datavote punch  card ballots, each voter may require multiple ballot cards in elections that  have a large number of candidates and issues.  (Figure 7 shows a Datavote  ballot.)", "For both the Votomatic and Datavote, software is used to program each  vote tabulation machine to correctly assign each vote read into the  computer to the proper contest and candidate or issue.  Generally, the  software is used to identify the particular contests in each precinct, assign  punch card positions to each candidate, and configure any special options,  such as straight party voting and vote-for-no-more-than-N contests.  In  addition, vote-tally software is often used to tally the vote totals from one  or more vote tabulation machines.", "For both types of punch cards, jurisdictions can count the ballots either at  the polling place or at a central location. In a polling place count, either the  voters or election officials put their ballot cards into the vote tabulators. In  a central count, voters drop ballots into sealed boxes, and the sealed boxes  are transferred to a central location after the polls close.  At the central  location, ballots are run through the vote tabulators.  In either case, the  tabulator counts the ballots by reading the holes in the ballots.  Generally,  central-count tabulators are higher speed machines, allowing more ballots  to be counted in less time than do precinct-based machines.  Both precinct- count and central-count tabulators store votes on electronic storage media.   These media can be removed manually or transferred via cable  communication.  Figure 8 shows punch card tabulation machines.", "Optical scan technology has been used for decades for such tasks as  scoring standardized tests, but it was not applied to voting until the 1980s.   An optical scan voting system is comprised of computer-readable ballots,  appropriate marking devices, privacy booths, and a computerized  tabulation machine.  The ballot can vary in size and lists the names of the  candidates and the issues.  Voters record their choices using an appropriate  writing instrument to fill in boxes or ovals, or to complete an arrow next to  the candidate\u2019s name or the issue.  The ballot includes a space for write-ins  to be placed directly on the ballot. Figure 9 shows an optical scan ballot.", "Like punch card software, the software for optical scan equipment is used  to program the tabulation equipment to correctly assign each vote read into  the computer to the proper contest and candidate or issue (i.e., to assign  the location of valid marks on the ballot to the proper candidate or issue).   In addition to identifying the particular contests and the candidates in each  contest, the software is also used to configure any special options, such as  straight party voting and vote-for-no-more-than-N contests.  Precinct-based  optical scanners can also be programmed to detect and/or reject overvotes  and undervotes (where the voter does not vote for all contests and/or  issues on the ballot).  In addition, similar to punch cards, optical scan  systems often use vote-tally software to tally the vote totals from one or  more vote tabulation machines.", "Like punch cards, optical scan ballots are counted by being run through  computerized tabulation equipment, in this case, optical-mark-recognition  equipment.  This equipment counts the ballots by sensing or reading the  marks on the ballot.  Ballots can be counted in the polling place or in a  central location.  If ballots are counted at the polling place, voters or  election officials put the ballots into the tabulation equipment.  In this case,  either vote tallies can be captured in removable storage media that can be  taken from the voting equipment and transported to a central tally location,  or they can be electronically transmitted from the polling place to the  central tally location.  If ballots are centrally counted, voters drop ballots  into sealed boxes, and election officials transfer the sealed boxes to the  central location after the polls close, at which time election officials run the  ballots through the tabulation equipment.", "Election officials can program precinct-based optical scan equipment to  detect and reject overvotes and undervotes, which allows voters to fix their  mistakes before leaving the polling place.  However, if voters are unwilling  or unable to correct their ballots, a poll worker can manually override the  program and accept the ballot, even though it has been overvoted or  undervoted.  If ballots are tabulated centrally, voters do not have the  opportunity to correct mistakes that may have been made.", "Precinct-count optical scan equipment sits on a ballot box with two  compartments for scanned ballots\u2014one for accepted ballots (i.e., those  that are properly filled out) and one for rejected ballots (i.e., blank ballots,  ballots with write-ins, or those accepted because of a forced override).  In  addition, an auxiliary compartment in the ballot box is used for storing  ballots if an emergency arises (e.g., loss of power or machine failure) that  prevents the ballots from being scanned.  Figure 10 shows precinct- and  central-count optical scan tabulators.", "First introduced in the 1970s, DRE equipment is an electronic  implementation of the old lever machines.  DREs come in two basic types,  pushbutton or touchscreen, the pushbutton being the older and more  widely used of the two.  The two types of DREs vary considerably in  appearance.  Pushbutton DREs are larger and heavier than touchscreens.   Figure 11 shows DRE pushbutton and touchscreen voting machines.", "Pushbutton and touchscreen DREs also differ significantly in the way they  present ballots to the voter.  With the DRE pushbutton, all ballot  information is presented on a single \u201cfull-face\u201d ballot.  For example, a ballot  may have 50 buttons on a 3 by 3 foot ballot, with a candidate or issue next  to each button.  In contrast, touchscreen DREs display the ballot  information on an electronic display screen.  For both pushbutton and  touchscreen DREs, the ballot information is programmed onto an  electronic storage medium, which is then uploaded to the machine.  For  touchscreens, ballot information can be displayed in color and can  incorporate pictures of the candidates.  Because the ballot space is much  smaller than the pushbuttons, voters who use touchscreens must page  through the ballot information.  Both touchscreen and pushbutton DREs  can accommodate multilingual ballots; however, because the ballot is  limited to the size of the screen, pushbutton machines can generally display  no more than two languages.", "Despite the differences, the two types of DREs have some similarities, such  as how the voter interacts with the voting equipment.  For pushbuttons,  voters press a button next to the candidate or issue, which then lights up to  indicate the selection.  Similarly, voters using touchscreen DREs make  their selections by touching the screen next to the candidate or issue,  which is then highlighted.  When voters are finished making their selections  on a touchscreen or a pushbutton DRE, they cast their votes by pressing a  final \u201cvote\u201d button or screen.  Both types of DREs allow voters to write in  candidates.  While most DREs allow voters to type write-ins on a keyboard,  some pushbutton DREs require voters to write the name on paper tape that  is part of the voting equipment.", "Unlike punch card and optical scan voting equipment, DREs do not use  paper ballots.  However, they do retain permanent electronic images of all  the ballots, which can be stored on various media, including internal hard- disk drives, flash cards, or memory cartridges.  These ballot images, which  can be printed, can be used for auditing and recounts.", "Like punch card and optical scan devices, DREs require the use of software  to program the various ballot styles and tally the votes, which is generally  done through the use of memory cartridges or other media.  The software is  used to generate ballots for each precinct within the voting jurisdiction,  which includes defining the ballot layout, identifying the contests in each  precinct, and assigning candidates to contests.  The software is also used to  configure any special options, such as straight party voting and vote-for-no- more-than-N contests.  In addition, for pushbutton DREs, the software  assigns the buttons to particular candidates and, for touchscreens, the  software defines the size and location on the screen where the voter makes  the selection.  Vote-tally software is often used to tally the vote totals from  one or more DREs.", "DREs also offer various configurations for tallying the votes.  Some contain  removable storage media that can be taken from the voting equipment and  transported to a central location to be tallied.  Others can be configured to  electronically transmit the vote totals from the polling place to a central  tally location.", "Because all DREs are programmable, they offer various options that are  not as easily supplied by other voting methods.  For example, they do not  allow overvotes.  In addition, voters can change their selections before  hitting the final button to cast their votes.", "DRE touchscreens offer the most flexibility because they can present  numerous screens of data; for example, they allow unlimited multilingual  ballots, unlike pushbutton DREs.

To get this information about the November 2000  election, we used a mail survey that is generalizable to 90 percent of the  U.S. population, and a telephone survey that is generalizable nationwide.   We also interviewed local election officials.  To describe selected statutory  requirements in the 50 states and the District of Columbia for voter  registration, absentee and provisional balloting, and recounts, we reviewed  state and D.C. statutes.

Two of these  jurisdictions had recently used new voting equipment in the November  2000 election, and one had purchased new equipment for delivery in 2001.   To identify new voting equipment, we surveyed vendors and reviewed  vendor publications, attended vendor marketing events and conferences,  and researched periodicals and vendor Web sites.  To estimate the potential  cost of replacing existing voting equipment in the United States, we  developed data on the distribution of voting equipment in the United  States\u2014among the states, counties within the states, and precincts within  each county.

For example, a  statewide voter registration system would not be able to remove from the  lists the names of registrants who have died if timely death records were  not available.  Further, adequate quality assurance processes for the data  would also need to be developed as data entry errors can and will occur.

In particular,  officials faced challenges coordinating the events necessary to process  registration applications submitted at motor vehicle authorities.

Registered voters may  obtain their ballots prior to election day in one of two ways\u2014through the  mail or in person. States do not routinely collect and report data on the  prevalence of voting before election day.  Using Census data, we estimate  that, in the November 2000 general election, about 14 percent of voters  nationwide cast their ballots before election day.  Of these voters, about 73  percent used mail-in ballots and about 27 percent voted in person (as seen  in figure 20).

For example, being able to vote before election day  provides greater accessibility to voting for certain voters, such as those  who are disabled, living internationally, traveling extensively, or residing in  distant rural communities with long commutes to work.  In addition,  allowing voters to vote before election day can make voting more  convenient, particularly in states that allow no-excuse absentee or early  voting.  Election officials in some jurisdictions we visited stated that no- excuse absentee and/or early voting had increased overall voting before  election day, particularly when these programs first became available.  Election officials were less certain about any positive effects these efforts  have had on overall voter participation.

All jurisdictions we visited  had a standard state or jurisdiction application form available from local  election officials for registered voters to obtain a mail-in absentee ballot.   Figure 24 shows an example of the application forms used.  In addition,  several states we visited allowed voters to apply for an absentee ballot by  using a variety of other means, such as a letter or telegram sent to local  election officials.

These included registrants who were 60 or older, disabled, or  poll workers who would not be working in their precinct on election day.   As another example, all California jurisdictions sent every registered voter  an absentee ballot application as part of their sample ballot package. Since  California does not require an excuse to vote absentee, registered voters  who wished to vote in this manner simply needed to complete the  application and return it to their local elections office.", "State requirements varied regarding how frequently a voter had to apply for  a mail-in absentee ballot.

In the states we visited, the  deadline for returning completed mail-in absentee ballot applications  ranged from 1 day to 7 days before the election.

Further, a few jurisdiction officials  commented that U.S. Armed Forces personnel and overseas citizens do not  have to pay postage to return their voted absentee ballots in some  jurisdictions and questioned whether this service should be extended to all  voters.

Based  on our telephone survey of jurisdictions, we estimate that less than 1 to 5  percent of jurisdictions nationwide experienced special problems with  absentee voting fraud during recent elections.  In general, absentee voting  fraud concerns tend to fall into three categories, including (1) someone  other than the appropriate voter casting the mail-in absentee ballot, (2)  absentee voters voting more than once, and (3) voters being intimidated or  unduly influenced while voting the mail-in absentee ballot.", "Local election jurisdictions use a number of procedures to ensure the  appropriate voter completes a mail-in absentee ballot.  For example, from  GAO\u2019s telephone survey of jurisdictions, we estimate that nationwide   55 percent of the voting jurisdictions check a voter\u2019s signature on the  absentee ballot materials with the signature originally provided on the  voter\u2019s registration documents (as illustrated in figure 30);  55 percent of jurisdictions check a voter\u2019s signature on the absentee  ballot materials with the signature originally provided on the application  for a mail-in absentee ballot; and/or  36 percent of jurisdictions require a voter\u2019s signature on the absentee  ballot materials to be witnessed or notarized.", "All of the jurisdictions we visited used either one of these or other  procedures, and most jurisdiction officials did not identify this type of  fraud as a major concern.  In particular, Oregon officials expressed  confidence in their procedures designed to reduce the potential for  someone other than the registered voter voting the mailed ballot.  Oregon  officials compared signatures on mailed ballot materials to voter  registration materials.  The officials said that this signature comparison  provides even greater security against this type of fraud than many  jurisdictions\u2019 election day procedures in which voters may not have to  show identification or have their signatures checked before casting a  ballot.  However, even with the described procedures in place, a few  jurisdiction officials said that they ultimately have no way of knowing with  absolute certainty that only the appropriate person requests and casts an  absentee mail ballot.", "Likewise, local election jurisdictions in November 2000 employed several  procedures to prevent voters from voting more than once. From GAO\u2019s  telephone survey of jurisdictions, we estimate that, before election day, 64  percent of jurisdictions nationwide checked the absentee ballot  applications against their voter records to determine whether a voter had  previously applied for a mail-in ballot for that election before providing a  voter an absentee ballot.  On election day, we estimate that 78 percent of  the jurisdictions nationwide checked election day poll books, lists, or logs  to determine whether a voter had requested, been sent, or already voted an  absentee ballot. For example, as seen in figure 31, one jurisdiction used bar  coding on mail-in absentee applications to identify voters who have been  sent absentee mail ballot packages.  This information is to be scanned into  the system used to generate election day poll books, so that voters who  have been sent a mail-in absentee ballot can be identified if they attempt to  vote on election day.  We also estimate that 46 percent of jurisdictions  nationwide checked absentee ballots received against election day poll  books, lists, or logs to determine if an absentee voter voted on election day  before counting the absentee ballot. In addition, we estimate that 10  percent of jurisdictions nationwide employ other methods to ensure an  absentee voter only votes once during an election.  For example, poll  workers on election day can check on-line database containing absentee  voting information to verify that voters had not voted before election day.   All of the jurisdictions we visited used either one of these or other  procedures, and most jurisdiction officials did not identify this type of  fraud as a major concern.", "Officials from some jurisdictions stated that a potential for abuse continues  to exist with mail-in voting through voters possibly being intimidated or  unduly influenced in their homes when casting their mail-in ballot.  This  more general fraud concern is, to some extent, inherent in the process and,  thus, more difficult to address and causes more concern among some  officials.  For example, an election official from one very large jurisdiction  stated he experienced a situation with absentee ballot fraud allegations  during a recent local election. He was informed that people were going  door-to-door in low-income neighborhoods to obtain and complete  absentee ballot applications and ballots. Because of these types of  allegations, he stated that absentee voting by mail is the area that concerns  him the most about the elections process. Generally, he said these  problems are more likely to occur in smaller elections, such as primaries or  local elections, where such efforts have the greatest potential to have an  effect on the actual outcome of the election.  However, smaller elections,  such as primaries, can still have significant impacts on the outcome of  general elections in certain circumstances for certain races.  This official  stated that, at a minimum, he would like to see state law designate people\u2019s  homes as polling places while they are completing their absentee ballot.  This type of law would make electioneering illegal while a person is casting  his or her mail absentee ballot.  In addition, one jurisdiction officials stated  that political parties attempt to increase turn out for their party by sending  ballot applications to voters directly.  These efforts result in the election  officials not knowing for certain who filled out the application and,  subsequently, the ballot, or if it was even completed per the voter\u2019s wishes.", "Besides the general procedures for preventing mail-in absentee fraud, a  number of jurisdictions have taken specific measures to prevent such  abuses in high-risk places, like nursing homes.  For example, several  jurisdictions send a team of election workers, at times consisting of  members from both major parties, to nursing homes to give out ballots,  assist voters, and deliver the voted ballots back to the elections office.   Another location placed restrictions on the number of absentee ballots that  a single person could sign as a witness.  One election official in a small  jurisdiction stated that she personally knows and has provided specific  training to the nursing home employees who witness and assist nursing  home patients in voting.", "In addition, in almost all of jurisdictions we visited, the mail-in absentee  ballot package provided to voters included statements and/or reminders,  such as within the oath or other materials, regarding the possible legal  consequences of providing inaccurate or fraudulent information on the  balloting materials.

In other jurisdictions, absentee ballots are sent to the precincts in which  the voters would have voted on election day and reviewed by poll workers.

For example, in one very large jurisdiction  about one-third of the ballots disqualified were because the voter\u2019s  signature was missing or the envelope was improperly completed.  In  addition, election officials in one jurisdiction estimated that about 80  percent of the ballots disqualified were due to being returned after the  deadline. The other major challenge the officials mentioned was receiving  the ballot after the required deadline.", "Some jurisdictions have attempted to address problems with voters  returning ballots unsigned or otherwise incomplete.  In California, a  number of counties have begun to put brightly colored stickers with arrows  pointing to the signature line or fluorescent colored inserts reminding the  voter to sign the envelope. In addition, in several jurisdictions election  officials pre-print labels on the absentee ballot envelopes to minimize the  amount of information the voter has to provide. Officials from the counties  taking these steps reported a reduced number of voters submitting  unsigned or incomplete absentee ballots.  In a further effort to address  these challenges, one large jurisdiction implemented a project for the  November 2000 general election in which trained volunteers physically  took unsigned absentee ballot envelopes, with the ballots still enclosed, to  the voters to obtain their signatures.  This reduced the number of unsigned  ballots from 500 in previous general elections to 50 in November 2000.

For example, in one jurisdiction in Virginia, in- person absentee voting is conducted at the local election jurisdiction\u2019s  office during normal business hours during the 45 days before the election.  To cast an in-person absentee ballot, registered voters were to go to the  office and complete an in-person absentee application on which they  provide one of several reasons or excuses defined in state statute.

In fact, the lines and waits for certain  elections and locations have been longer for voters on the last day of early  voting than on election day.", "Officials from a number of jurisdictions cited ensuring that early voting  locations had enough ballots and supplies as a challenge. For example, one  medium-sized jurisdiction in Texas that used a punch card voting method  needed to have enough copies of every ballot style voted in their  jurisdiction, at every satellite location, to support all the voters who could  come in to vote, because voters are not assigned to a particular location  like they are on election day.  For the November 2000 general election, this  included 26 different ballot styles.  By contrast, two very large jurisdictions,  which use a DRE touch screen voting method, had all the ballot types  electronically stored within each unit, but still needed to have enough other  election-related supplies to support their operations through the entire  early voting period.", "Officials from a few jurisdictions had concerns with getting enough  adequate polling locations, such as locations that were sufficiently large,  had digital lines for electronically connecting to the registration system,  and were conveniently located. For example, officials in one large  jurisdiction stated that they had problems establishing early voting  locations that were convenient to all voters, and that some early voting  locations were too small for the crowds that came at peak times.", "Another challenge faced by jurisdictions that conduct early voting is the  limited amount of time between finalizing and printing the ballots and  accompanying materials.

Long lines at the polls, voters\u2019 names missing from the registration lists, a  complicated ballot, voting machine malfunctions preventing vote casting,  or, as was the case in the 2000 presidential election in Florida, hotly  contested election results, may focus public attention on the otherwise  unnoticed details of election administration.", "This chapter describes those activities that election administration officials  identified to us as important to planning and conducting an election.

First, states have different laws and regulations that govern elections; some  states exercise a relatively high degree of control over local elections while  others allow local jurisdictions to operate with more autonomy.  For  example, some states have statewide election systems so that every voting  jurisdiction uses the same procedures for administering elections,  including registering voters, processing absentee ballots, using common  voting equipment, and tallying votes. Oklahoma, for example, standardizes  most aspects of local and statewide elections. In other states, local  jurisdictions run elections with less direction from the state, which means  local officials may exercise a larger degree of autonomy in conducting  elections.  For instance, in Pennsylvania, local election officials told us  there are 67 counties and consequently 67 different ways of handling  elections.  Figure 36 illustrates these differences.", "Other states are somewhere in between Oklahoma and Pennsylvania on the  continuum of greater to lesser state direction of local elections.  Virginia,  for example, requires local jurisdictions to follow many standardized  election procedures, but leaves their implementation largely to local  jurisdictions.", "Second, the type of voting technology used by a jurisdiction influences how  election officials plan and conduct an election.  Usually it is local election  officials who choose the voting technology to be used in their precincts,  often from a list of state certified options, but in some states, state law  prescribes the use of common voting technology throughout the state.  The  types and uses of voting technology are extensively described in chapter 1.   Depending on their jurisdiction\u2019s type of voting equipment, election  officials face different challenges in ballot preparation, voter education,  poll worker training, and setting up the polls. \u201cthe logistics of preparing and delivering voting supplies and equipment to the county\u2019s  4,963 voting precincts, recruiting and training 25,000 election day poll workers, preparing  and mailing tens of thousands of absentee ballot packets daily and later signature verifying,  opening and sorting 521,180 absentee ballots, and finally, counting 2.7 million ballots is  extremely challenging.\u201d", "In contrast, one small jurisdiction we visited had only 2,843 registered  voters, 5 voting precincts, and 28 poll workers.  As illustrated in figure 37,  the magnitude of key tasks for election officials in the large jurisdiction is a  thousand times larger than for the small jurisdiction.", "Fourth, jurisdictions face different burdens in preparing for election day  because where some have relatively homogeneous populations, others  service highly heterogeneous publics, with diverse histories, cultures, and  languages.  In some jurisdictions, large segments of the population speak  languages other than English. In these jurisdictions, ballots must be  prepared in those languages.  In November 2000, Los Angeles County, for  instance, provided ballots in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese,  Japanese, and Tagalog, as well as English. On the basis of a consent decree  with the Justice Department, Bernalillo County, New Mexico, will provide  certain types of voting assistance in the Navajo language, including  translation of the ballot.  Election officials said, in the future, they  anticipate having to provide ballots in other Native American languages,  some of which have no written form.", "And finally, the voting jurisdictions themselves may develop their own  election day traditions and cultures.  For example, jurisdictions generally  seek to ensure that only eligible voters can cast their ballots on election  day.  However, the procedures adopted to determine whether a citizen who  appears at the polls is eligible to vote differ.  Jurisdictions may place  different emphasis on preventing ineligible people from voting than they do  on facilitating voting for eligible voters. States have different legal  requirements for verifying voters\u2019 identities, and localities develop different  procedures for handling questions about eligibility that arise on election  day. In some jurisdictions, voters identified themselves by stating their  names and addresses to the poll workers, who also matched the signature  on the voter application with the voter registration records.  Other  jurisdictions require voters to present a valid photo identification card and  require the signature on their application to vote to match the signature on  their voter registration card.  In other jurisdictions presenting some form of  identification, such as a hunting or fishing license, is sufficient to verify  one\u2019s identity.

Prior to election day, officials must recruit and train a sufficient  number of poll workers with appropriate skills to open, operate, and close  polling places.  Suitable polling places located in the voting precincts must  be reserved.  Election officials are responsible for designing and producing  multiple versions of ballots, which may vary not only by voting precinct but  by address within a voting precinct.

These challenges include   labor shortages among the ranks of qualified poll workers, exacerbated   limited access to a shrinking number of appropriate polling places;   complicated ballots or new voting technology unfamiliar to voters; and   limited resources for voter education."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recruiting and Training Poll Workers Was Major Problem for Many Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that 51 percent of the jurisdictions nationwide reported that it  was somewhat or very difficult to find a sufficient number of poll workers.", "Elections in all states could not take place without an army of poll workers  who run the polls on election day. Poll workers are the frontline of  democracy. They are the public face of elections for most citizens, whose  voting experience is largely informed by their interaction at the polls with  poll workers. Although these workers are usually employed for only one  day, the success of election administration partly hinges upon their ability  to perform their jobs well.  Therefore, recruiting and training qualified poll  workers becomes one of the most crucial tasks that election officials face  in most locations. On the basis of our mail survey, we estimate that 51  percent of jurisdictions nationwide had a somewhat or very difficult time  getting enough poll workers. Of these jurisdictions, 27 percent had  difficulty obtaining enough poll workers, and 23 percent had difficulty  obtaining enough required Democrat or Republican poll workers.  These  problems were the most frequently identified by the jurisdictions in  preparing for elections. Factors that can work in concert to complicate an  already difficult task for election officials include an aging work force, low  pay, little or no training, and limited authority to hold poll workers  accountable for their job performance.  To meet these challenges, some  election officials said that they have developed specific recruiting and  training strategies.", "Some poll workers are elected; some are appointed; and some are  volunteers.  For example, Pennsylvania law specifies that poll workers be  elected to the position.  One official in a small jurisdiction told us that \u201cWe  beg people to do it.\u201d  Political parties often play a key role in identifying  poll workers.  For example, Illinois statutes require leading political parties  to nominate all election judges needed at the polls on election day.  Many  jurisdictions require that poll workers from each of the two major parties  staff each precinct.  For example, New York law requires that each polling  place must be staffed with four election inspectors equally divided between  the major political parties.", "Poll workers have different titles, levels of pay, training requirements, and  responsibilities, depending on state law and the organization and traditions  of the local jurisdiction.  Jurisdictions assign their poll workers different  responsibilities in the polling place and call them by different titles,  including clerks, wardens, election judges, inspectors, captains, and  precinct officers. Often jurisdictions have a chief poll worker. Virtually all  the jurisdictions we visited provide some compensation to poll workers for  their service on election day, ranging from $55 a day for clerks to $150 a day  for a coordinator. These amounts differ by jurisdiction and level of  responsibility within the polling place.  Jurisdictions also differ in the  training that they provide and require for poll workers prior to the election.   Most of the election officials we talked to said that they offer some training  for poll workers, and some said that the training is mandatory.  One  jurisdiction requires that each poll worker be certified as an inspector by  the county board after attending an official training class and passing a  written test.  Some jurisdictions only require training for individuals who  have not previously served as poll workers. Other jurisdictions require only  that the lead poll workers be trained before each election.", "In addition to the number, pay, and training of poll workers, jurisdictions  differ in the levels of authority and responsibility they grant to poll  workers.  Poll workers may have significant autonomy over the operation  of the polling place and decisions, being the final authority on interpreting  guidance in areas such as deciding who can vote and determining voter  intent.  In other jurisdictions, poll workers have limited discretion and  function primarily as clerks and facilitators, referring decisions back to  elections headquarters. \u201c inspectors serve 17 or 18 hours, a very long day.  Because many of our inspectors are  senior citizens, between the age of 70 and 80-plus years, such conditions are difficult on  them physically, as well as creating the potential for errors at the end of election day.

For example, in a jurisdiction that requires  election of poll workers, election officials told us that they rarely have  enough poll workers running for the positions.  Several election officials  noted that often the political parties do not provide enough poll worker  nominations to cover the needs of the jurisdiction, despite a legal  requirement that they provide all the poll workers.

Canceling  locations after they have been publicized presents difficulties for election  officials who must find substitute locations and then try to notify the voters  of the last minute change.  For example, in one very large jurisdiction, five  locations canceled after the sample ballot, which lists the precinct the  voter is assigned to, was mailed.

One small jurisdiction crafted a super  precinct with all six precincts in one polling place.  This solution offers  the advantages of providing a known, central location easy for voters to  find and alleviating the pressure to provide poll workers for each polling  place.  By using this super precinct, the jurisdiction is able to provide  handicapped access and parking to all its voters.  Additionally, the  county clerk, who is the chief election official, is on site to resolve any  issues over voters\u2019 eligibility to vote.  Rather than creating a super  precinct, some jurisdictions are consolidating voting precincts. One  large and one medium jurisdiction consolidated several precincts  resulting in fewer polling places.  One of these jurisdictions has 45  polling places with as many as 4 precincts per polling place; the other  has 270 polling locations for 576 precincts.", "Revised State Limits on Number of Voters Per Precinct: In some cases  the election officials\u2019 proposed strategies for dealing with these  problems involve changing state laws that prescribe the number of  registered voters per precinct.  By increasing the number of registered  voters per precinct, officials hope to decrease the number of required  polling locations. California introduced legislation to increase the  number of voters in each precinct from 1,000 to 1,250, which would  reduce the number of polling places needed.  This solution would also  reduce the number of poll workers needed on election day.  However, as  one election official observed, an unintended consequence of  condensing precincts may be longer lines at polling places, which makes  voting a more time-consuming and difficult activity.", "School Holidays on Election Day: Traditionally, schools have served as  polling places.  However, several election officials mentioned that they  are increasingly difficult to obtain because of security concerns and  competition for space when students are present.  In one large  jurisdiction, election officials, in cooperation with school boards, have  made election day a student holiday.  The schools, which account for  two-thirds of the polling places, are then available as polling locations  with teachers present, alleviating some of the security concerns.

Election officials told us that one of the  positive effects of their move to all-mail voting is that election  jurisdictions no longer have to contend with the logistical problem of  securing polling places or hiring poll workers.  Other jurisdictions use  all-mail voting on a more limited scale.  For example, one medium-sized  jurisdiction has mail-only precincts for sparsely populated areas.

Election officials are responsible for designing ballots that  meet both statutory requirements and the requirements of the particular  voting equipment and that are easy for voters to understand. Officials we  met with did identify a number of challenges they faced in ballot design.

The specific statutory requirements and the level of detail  specified differ by state.  Many states prescribe specific features of ballot  design.  For example, some states require that ballots provide for rotation  of candidates so that the no candidate of a particular party consistently has  the advantage of appearing first on the ballot.  State law in other states  dictates that voters be offered a ballot that allows them to vote a straight- party ticket.  Some states identify the order of races and ballot issues.  For  example, Washington law specifies that state ballot issues appear before all  offices on the ballot.  In New York, state law even includes specifications  relating to the size of the print and the size of the checkboxes for the ballot.   States also differ in the degree of state oversight of ballot design.  In some  statewide systems, such as those in Oklahoma, ballot design is done  primarily at the state level for state and federal offices.  In Massachusetts,  the state designs and prints all ballots for state elections.  In other states,  such as Virginia, local officials develop ballots, but the State Board of  Elections must approve them. Other states have no statutes that provide  instruction on ballot design, leaving ballot design in the hands of local  officials without state oversight.", "The voting technology that a jurisdiction uses is the major factor that  influences ballot design and defines the tasks that election officials face as  they prepare the ballot.  As we discussed in chapter 1, different voting  machines require different types of ballots and each different type has its  own constraints.   For example, the size of ballot, type of paper, and other  features of the ballot must follow physical characteristics of the voting  machine.

Additionally, officials must  determine how many variations of the ballot they need to produce.  A  voting jurisdiction, which is generally a county, is comprised of precincts.   Voters in the same precinct may vote a different ballot because boundaries  of certain election districts, such as congressional districts and special  districts, may vary within the precinct.  Therefore, voters in the same  precinct may vote different ballot styles, depending on where the voter  lives.", "Jurisdictions design their ballots to meet the special needs of their  constituents in various ways.  Certain jurisdictions may require that ballots  be prepared in multiple languages.  Others prepare audio versions of their  ballot for sight-impaired voters.

Provisional balloting  measures go by differing names among the states including, provisional  ballot, challenged ballot, ballot to be verified, special ballot, emergency  paper ballot, and escrow ballot.  Five states use a form of affidavit ballot  whereby upon completion of an affidavit the vote is cast and counted  without the confirmation of such registration prior to the counting of the  ballot.  Table 22 in appendix VI details the provisions in the laws of  different states for provisional voting and other procedures to address  voters whose names do not appear on the registration list.", "Our mail survey showed that over three-quarters of the jurisdictions  nationwide had at least one procedure in place to help resolve eligibility  questions for voters who did not appear on the registration list at the  polling place. Poll workers will often first try to reconcile this type of  problem by contacting election headquarters and verifying their  registration list against the more current master registration list. If election  headquarters cannot provide a definitive answer about a voter\u2019s eligibility,  many jurisdictions allow the individual to vote some type of provisional  ballot.  Several election officials told us that provisional ballots are a great  help in conducting elections.  One director of elections said that in order to  keep the polling places operating smoothly, no person who asks to vote is  denied a ballot.  In this jurisdiction, poll workers are instructed to give a  provisional ballot to persons whose names do not appear in the poll book.   The provisional ballot will not be counted if the person is not a registered  voter.  In the 2000 general election, this jurisdiction distributed 18,000  provisional ballots to voters, and about half of these ballots were rejected,  primarily because the person casting the ballot was not registered.  This  jurisdiction, unlike most, posted the names of those persons whose ballots  were rejected and, therefore, not counted in the election.  Voters whose  ballots were rejected could appeal the decision.", "The procedures and specific instructions that jurisdictions develop to  permit provisional voting differ across jurisdictions.  For example, in some  jurisdictions, the voter must sign a sworn statement to cast a provisional  ballot, but not in others.

According to the election  officials we spoke with, resolving a high number of voter eligibility  questions contributed to two other election day problems: communications  between polling places and election headquarters and long lines at polling  places.  To help resolve these problems, election officials have proposed or  taken the following steps:  Adding Telephone Lines: Some jurisdictions have added telephone lines  both in the election headquarters office and at polling places to alleviate  some of the communication problems.  Other jurisdictions are providing  poll workers cell phones to ensure that they have access to telephones  to call headquarters.

In one  medium-sized jurisdiction, the different ballot styles were color-coded so  that the poll workers could quickly identify the appropriate ballot for the  voter.", "Once a voter completes the ballot, how he or she casts the ballot depends  on the type of voting system.  In precincts that count paper, punch card,  and optical scan ballots centrally, typically the voter will carry the ballot to  an election official, who deposits the ballot in the ballot box.  Where there  are precinct-level counters for punch cards or optical scan ballots, voters  place their ballots in the automatic feed slot of the counting machine.  The  precinct-level counting machine tells the voter if there is an error on the  ballot, such as an undervote, an overvote, or a damaged ballot, giving the  voter an opportunity to correct the ballot.  To cast a ballot using electronic  voting systems or lever machines, the voter pushes a \u201ccast vote\u201d button or  pulls a lever to register the vote.  Figure 45 illustrates how a voter would  cast an electronic vote on a touch screen DRE machine that resembles an  ATM.", "Voters can change their votes on the DRE machine until they push the  \u201cvote\u201d button.

For  example, jurisdictions using DRE machines require the voter to push a  button to record his or her vote, but if the voter exits before properly  recording the vote, various jurisdictions follow different procedures.   Election officials in a large jurisdiction using DRE machines told us that if  the voter leaves the voting machine without pushing the green \u201cvote\u201d  button, the poll worker at the machine is to void the vote.

However, because the standards  were not published until 1990 and the qualification testing program was not  established until 1994, many jurisdictions may be using voting equipment  that did not undergo qualification testing. This may be particularly true for  those jurisdictions that use punch card equipment; only one punch card  machine is on NASED\u2019s list of qualified voting equipment. However, in our  survey of states and the voting equipment they used in the November 2000  election, we identified 19 different types of punch card equipment being  used by jurisdictions.

For example, jurisdictions that used DREs performed readiness testing by  running diagnostic tests that the equipment is designed to perform, using  vote simulation cartridges, and by conducting mock elections; jurisdictions  that used optical scan and punch cards generally relied on the use of test  decks. In a large jurisdiction that used DREs, the election officials stated  that the county\u2019s readiness tests included checking the battery, paper tapes,  machine labels, curtain rods, and the memory cartridge against the ballot  and the equipment; performing voting tests, such as voting for each  candidate; and testing the write-in capabilities. At the conclusion of the  tests, election officials checked the counters and the memory tapes to  ensure that the results matched the testers\u2019 entries. In a very large  jurisdiction that used punch cards, election officials stated that they  conducted a public test on the Monday before election day with a test deck  of 55 cards that included numerous configurations for valid ballots,  overvoted ballots, and undervoted ballots. One of the most comprehensive  tests was conducted in a very large jurisdiction. This jurisdiction tested the  integration of all its voting equipment. Officials conducted a mock election  that included testing the precinct-based optical scanner, the central-count  optical scanner used for absentee ballots, DREs used for early voting, and  the election management system. For this test, they prepared each type of  equipment and had each type of equipment transmit vote totals created  using test decks to the election management system to ensure that it  prepared the results correctly.", "Effectively testing voting equipment depends not only on the voting  equipment itself, but also on the procedures developed by the jurisdiction  and the people that implement them. For example, in one large county, an  election official misprogrammed software on the optical scan equipment  used to tally early and absentee votes, which affected all ballots with a  straight party vote in the November 2000 election. About a third, or 66,000,  of the ballots cast in the county were cast early or absentee. Of these, over  20,000 voters had cast a ballot with a straight party vote. According to  county officials, although the equipment detected the straight party vote, it  did not properly distribute the vote to each of the party candidates. That is,  if a voter checked a straight party vote for Democrat, the optical scan  equipment detected the vote but did not properly add a vote for the  Democratic candidates on the ballot. Although county officials agreed that  this problem should have been detected during readiness testing, they  stated that the confirmation of the results of the test deck had been  incomplete. According to county officials, test personnel verified only that  the system accurately detected the straight party vote and did not verify  whether the tallies resulting from the test deck were correct. Further, the  county had no written procedures to ensure that the software was properly  tested. Fortunately, county officials detected the software problem during  the vote tallying process. However, if the problem had gone undetected,  over 20,000 properly cast votes would not have appeared in the official vote  totals.", "We estimate that 94 percent of jurisdictions nationwide conducted readiness testing before the November 2000 election, and 95 percent of jurisdictions nationwide conducted verification testing before the election."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Verification Testing", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of verification testing is to verify that the voting equipment is  operating properly before the election.

In addition to running the zero tapes, jurisdiction  officials indicated that they also check the security seals on the machines  to ensure that they have not been tampered with, compare the ballot on the  machine with the sample ballot for the polling place, and check the  protective counter number on the voting machine before voting begins.

For example, DRE touchscreen unit costs ranged  from $575 to $4,500. Similarly, unit costs for precinct-count optical scan  equipment ranged from $4,500 to $7,500. Among other things, these  differences can be attributed to differences in what is included in the unit  cost as well as differences in the characteristics of the equipment. Table 11  shows equipment costs by unit, software, and peripheral components.", "In addition to the equipment unit cost, an additional cost for jurisdictions is  the software that operates the equipment, prepares the ballots, and tallies  the votes (and in some cases, prepares the election results reports). Our  vendor survey showed that although some vendors include the software  cost in the unit cost of the voting equipment, most price the software  separately. Software costs for DRE, optical scan, and punch card  equipment can run as high as $300,000 per jurisdication. The higher costs  are generally for the more sophisticated software associated with election  management systems. Because the software generally supports numerous  equipment units, the software unit cost varies depending on the number of  units purchased or the size of the jurisdiction. Other factors affecting the  acquisition cost of voting equipment are the number and types of  peripherals required. In general, DREs require more peripherals than do  optical scan and punch cards. For example, some DREs require smart  cards, smart card readers, memory cartridges and cartridge readers,  administrative workstations, and plug-in devices (for increasing  accessibility for voters with disabilities). Touchscreen DREs may also offer  options that affect the cost of the equipment, such as color versus black  and white screens. In addition, most DREs and all optical scan and punch  cards require voting booths, and most DREs and some precinct-based  optical scan and punch card tabulators offer options for modems. Precinct- based optical scan and punch card tabulators also require ballot boxes to  capture the ballots after they are scanned.", "Once jurisdictions acquire the voting equipment, they must also incur the  cost to operate and maintain it. Our visits to 27 local election jurisdictions  indicated that annual operation and maintenance costs, like acquisition  costs, vary by the type and configuration of the voting equipment and by  the size of the jurisdiction.

However, in considering new voting equipment, most jurisdictions have  focused on two types of equipment\u2014optical scan and DRE. Optical scan  equipment can be used for counting ballots at a central location or a  counter can be located at each precinct where voters cast their votes. A  central-count configuration is generally less expensive, particularly in  larger jurisdictions, because fewer pieces of equipment are needed.  However, with a central-count configuration, voters cannot be notified of  any mistakes they made in filling out their ballots and offered an  opportunity to correct them. Optical scan counters located at voting  precincts can be programmed to notify voters if they have voted for more  candidates for an office than permitted (overvotes) or have not voted for a  specific office (undervotes). Such voters can then be offered an  opportunity to correct their ballot, if they wish. For example, the voter may  wish to correct any overvotes but deliberately chose not to vote for any  candidates for a specific office. Properly programmed, DRE voting  equipment does not permit the voter to overvote and can also notify the  voter of any undervotes.", "Jurisdictions may have different requirements for evaluating the purchase  of new voting equipment. For example, large jurisdictions with long ballots  with multiple offices and initiatives that must be printed in multiple  languages will have requirements different from the requirements in small  jurisdictions with short ballots printed only in English. Some equipment  has more features to accommodate those with disabilities than others. For  example, with most types of voting equipment, ballots with larger print or  magnifying glasses can be offered to voters with impaired sight.

Similarly, the capacity of the 2  central-count units used in the estimate for large election jurisdictions  would probably exceed the needs of jurisdictions with 100,000 registered  voters. However, for the largest jurisdictions, these same two central-count  units would probably have insufficient capacity to count votes in 1 or 2  days.

However, it may be difficult to  design an easily readable ballot for a full-face DRE machine that includes  many candidates and issues or that must be printed in multiple languages.  The second type of DRE machine is the touchscreen, analogous to a bank  ATM machine. DRE machines range in price from $2,000 to $6,000  depending upon the features offered. These prices did not include costs  that can substantially increase per unit cost, such as for software and in  some cases such essential equipment as card readers and smart cards for  each machine. Our estimate used a touchscreen machine that cost $3,995  for each unit equipped for the disabled and $3,795 for each unit not so  equipped. The equipped unit for the disabled can accommodate all disabled  voters except those who are quadriplegic. The unit cost includes the vote  count cartridge but does not include software, which ranges from $15,000  to $300,000 per jurisdiction, depending upon the number of registered  voters in the jurisdiction.", "One reason that touchscreen DRE equipment is generally more costly than  precinct optical scan equipment is that more units are required.

However, as with lever equipment, voters actually  cast their ballots on DRE units. Thus, the cost of purchasing DRE  equipment is affected by the number of voters who use each DRE unit  during the course of an election day. Some states have statutory standards  for the maximum number of voters per voting machine. We used two  assumptions\u20141 unit for each 250 registered voters per precinct and 1 unit  for each 500 registered voters per precinct. We also assumed that there  would be at least 1 unit equipped for the disabled at every precinct\u2014or a  minimum of 185,622 units. Because there were no data available on the  number of registered voters in each precinct in Alaska, North Dakota, and  Wisconsin, our estimate provides a single disabled equipped unit for each  precinct in those states. Consequently, our estimates may understate the  total number of touchscreen units needed.", "Using 250 voters per DRE unit, we estimated that 763,196 DRE units would  be required to replace all voting equipment in the United States (see table  14). This includes more than 24,000 reserve units, assuming reserves were  3 percent of the estimated average number of units needed in each election  jurisdiction. The estimated total cost of purchasing these units is $3 billion,  including one $20,000 central-count optical scan unit for each of the 2,072  election jurisdictions that had 25,000 or fewer registered voters and one  $24,000 central-count optical scan unit for each of the 1,054 election  jurisdictions that had more than 25,000 registered voters (excluding  Oregon). The central-count units were for counting absentee ballots in  each election jurisdiction. As shown in table 15, purchasing 1 unit for each  500 registered voters per precinct reduces the estimated number of  touchscreen units needed, including reserves, to 388,198 and the cost to  around $1.6 billion, including the central optical scan counters for each  jurisdiction. Again, software is a substantial additional cost, approximately  $46 million ($15,000 per jurisdiction) to $927 million ($300,000 per  jurisdiction).
