The substantial technical challenges, the Army's acquisition strategy, and the cost of the program are among the reasons why the program is recognized as needing special oversight and review. Section 211 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires GAO to report annually on the FCS program. This report includes an examination of (1) how the definition, development, and demonstration of FCS capabilities are proceeding, particularly in light of the go/no-go decision scheduled for 2009; (2) the Army's plans for making production commitments for FCS and any risks related to the completion of development; and (3) the estimated costs for developing and producing FCS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The progress made during the year by the FCS program, in terms of knowledge gained, is commensurate with a program in early development. Yet, the knowledge demonstrated thus far is well short of a program halfway through its development schedule and its budget. This portends additional cost increases and delays as FCS begins what is traditionally the most expensive and problematic phase of development. Thus, FCS's demonstrated performance, as well as the reasonableness of its remaining resources, will be paramount at the 2009 milestone review for the FCS program. In the key areas of defining and developing FCS capabilities, requirements definition and preliminary designs are proceeding but not yet complete; critical technologies are immature; complementary programs are not yet synchronized; and the remaining acquisition strategy is very ambitious. Beginning in 2008, the Army plans to make a series of commitments to produce FCS-related systems in advance of the low-rate production decision for the FCS core program in 2013. In general, production commitments are planned before key information is available. In 2008 and 2009, the Army plans to begin funding production of the first of three planned spin outs of FCS technologies to current forces. However, its commitment to the first spin out may be made before testing is complete. Also starting in 2008, the Army intends to commit to production of early versions of the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon. This commitment is being made to respond to congressional direction to field the cannon. FCS technologies, network, and designs are not yet mature enough for production, and thus the cannons produced will not be deployable without significant modifications. Advance procurement funding for the first full suite of FCS systems will begin in fiscal year 2011, the budget for which will be presented to Congress in February 2010--less than a year after the milestone review and before the stability of the FCS design is assessed at the critical design review. In addition, the Army plans to commit to using Boeing, its lead system integrator, for the early production of FCS systems through the initial production phase of the FCS system of systems. By the time of the production decision in 2013, $39 billion will have already been invested in FCS, with another $8 billion requested. Thus, while demonstration of the FCS's capability falls late in the schedule, commitments to production are likely to come early--an untenable situation for decision makers. The Army's $160.9 billion cost estimate for the FCS program is largely the same as last year's but yields less content as the number of FCS systems has since been reduced from 18 to 14. There is not a firm foundation of knowledge for a confident cost estimate. Also, two independent cost assessments are significantly higher than the Army's estimate. However, the Army maintains that it will further reduce FCS content to stay within its development cost ceiling. Should the higher cost estimates prove correct, it seems unlikely that the Army could reduce FCS content enough to stay within the current funding constraints while still delivering a capability that meets requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Future Combat System (FCS) program\u2014which comprises 14  integrated weapon systems and an advanced information network needed  for a brigade combat team\u2014is the centerpiece of the Army\u2019s efforts to  transition to a lighter, more agile, and more capable combat force and,  according to the Army, the greatest technology and integration challenge it  has ever undertaken. The Army seeks to develop and then integrate  dozens of new technologies in the FCS program and ultimately create a  force in which people, platforms, weapons, and sensors are linked  seamlessly together in a system of systems.", "The Army started the FCS program in May 2003 before defining what the  systems were going to be required to do and how they would interact. The  Army moved ahead without determining whether the concept could be  successfully developed with existing resources\u2014without proven  technologies, a stable design, and available funding and time. The Army  projects the FCS program will cost $160.9 billion, which does not include  all the costs to the Army, such as complementary programs. The Army is  using a unique partner-like arrangement with a lead system integrator  (LSI), Boeing, to manage and produce the FCS. For these and other  reasons, the program is recognized as being high risk and needing special  oversight. Accordingly, in 2006, Congress mandated that the Department  of Defense (DOD) hold an FCS milestone review following the FCS  preliminary design review, which is now scheduled for February 2009.  Congress directed that the review include an assessment of whether (1)  the needs are valid and can be best met with the FCS concept, (2) the FCS  program can be developed and produced within existing resources, and  (3) the program should continue as currently structured, be restructured,  or be terminated. Congress required the Secretary of Defense to review  and report on specific aspects of the program, including the maturity of  critical technologies, program risks, demonstrations of the FCS concept  and software, and a cost estimate and affordability assessment.", "Given its cost, scope, and technical challenges, section 211 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires GAO to report  annually on the FCS program.

We are issuing a second report to address FCS network and  software development.", "In conducting our work, we have contacted numerous DOD and Army  offices. We reviewed documents pertaining to the FCS program, including  the Operational Requirements Document, the Acquisition Strategy  Report, technology assessments, and modeling and simulation results;  attended meetings at which DOD and Army officials reviewed program  progress; and held discussions with key DOD and Army officials on  various aspects of the program. Officials from DOD and the Army have  provided us access to sufficient information to make informed judgments  on the matters in this report. In addition, we drew from our body of past  work on weapon systems acquisition practices. We performed our work  from March 2007 to March 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Army is reorganizing its current forces into  modular brigade combat teams, each of which is expected to be highly  survivable and the most lethal brigade-sized unit the Army has ever  fielded. The Army expects FCS-equipped brigade combat teams to provide  significant warfighting capabilities to DOD\u2019s overall joint military  operations. The Army is implementing its transformation plans at a time  when current U.S. ground forces continue to play a critical role in ongoing  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army has instituted plans to spin out  selected FCS technologies and systems to current Army forces throughout  the program\u2019s system development and demonstration phase.", "The Army recently made a number of adjustments to its plans for the FCS  program. The revised program will no longer include all 18 systems as  originally planned. The FCS family of weapons is now expected to include  14 manned and unmanned ground vehicles, air vehicles, sensors, and  munitions that will be linked by an advanced information network. The  systems include    eight new types of manned ground vehicles to replace current tanks,  infantry carriers, and self-propelled howitzers;  two classes of unmanned aerial vehicles;    several unmanned ground vehicles; and   an attack missile.", "Fundamentally, the FCS concept is to replace mass with superior  information\u2014allowing the soldier to see and hit the enemy first rather to  rely on heavy armor to withstand a hit. This proposed solution attempts to  address a mismatch that has posed a dilemma to the Army for decades: the  Army\u2019s heavy forces had the necessary firepower needed to win but  required extensive support and too much time to deploy while its light  forces could deploy rapidly but lacked firepower. If the Future Force were  to become a reality, then the Army would be better organized, staffed,  equipped, and trained for prompt and sustained land combat, qualities  intended to ensure that the Army would dominate over evolving,  sophisticated threats. The Future Force is to be offensively oriented and  will employ revolutionary concepts of operations, enabled by new  technology. The Army envisions a new way of fighting that depends on  networking the force, which involves linking people, platforms, weapons,  and sensors seamlessly together in a system of systems.", "If successful, the FCS system-of-systems concept would integrate  individual capabilities of weapons and platforms, thus facilitating  interoperability and open system designs. This concept would represent  significant improvement over the traditional approach of building superior  individual weapons that must be retrofitted and netted together after the  fact. This transformation, in terms of both operations and equipment, is  under way with the full cooperation of the Army warfighter community. In  fact, the development and acquisition of FCS is being accomplished using  a uniquely collaborative relationship among the Army\u2019s developers, the  participating contractors, and the warfighter community.", "The Army is using a management approach for FCS that centers on an LSI  to provide significant management services to help the Army define and  develop FCS and reach across traditional Army mission areas. Because of  its partner-like relationship with the Army, the LSI\u2019s responsibilities  include requirements development, design, and selection of major system  and subsystem contractors. The team of Boeing and its subcontractor,  Science Applications International Corporation, is the LSI for the FCS  system development and demonstration phase of acquisition, which is  expected to extend until 2017. The FCS LSI is expected to act on behalf of  the Army to optimize the FCS capability, maximize competition, ensure  interoperability, and maintain commonality in order to reduce life-cycle  costs, and for overall integration of the information network. Boeing also  acts as an FCS supplier in that it is responsible for developing two  important software subsystems. Army representatives stated they did not  believe the Army had the resources or flexibility to use its traditional  acquisition process to field a program as complex as FCS under the  aggressive timeline established by the then-Army Chief of Staff. The Army  will maintain oversight and final approval of the LSI\u2019s subcontracting and  competition plans.", "In 2007, we reported on, among other things, why the Army decided to use  an LSI for the FCS program and the nature of the LSI\u2019s working  relationship with the Army. We found that the use of an LSI for FCS  provides an oversight challenge for the Army and that the Office of the  Secretary of Defense has an important role in providing oversight on the  FCS program. Congress has expressed concern over the use of LSI\u2019s, and  has prohibited DOD from awarding new contracts for LSI functions after  October 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Knowledge-Based Processes Necessary for Successful Development", "paragraphs": ["Since the mid-1990s, we have studied the best practices of leading  commercial companies. Taking into account the differences between  commercial product development and weapons acquisitions, we have  articulated a best practices product development model that relies on  increasing knowledge when developing a new product. This knowledge- based approach requires developers to make investment decisions on the  basis of three specific, measurable levels of knowledge at critical  junctures over the course of a program:    Knowledge Point 1: At program start, the customer\u2019s needs should  match the developer\u2019s available resources in terms of mature  technologies, time, and funding. Indications of this match include  having firm requirements in place as well as demonstrated maturity of  technologies needed to meet customer needs. A preliminary design  review at or near the start of product development is typically the  vehicle used to help stabilize performance, schedule, and cost  expectations.", "Knowledge Point 2: About midway through development, the product\u2019s  design should be stable and demonstrate that it is capable of meeting  performance requirements. A critical design review at this mid-point is  the vehicle for making the determination and generally signifies the  point at which the program is ready to start building production- representative prototypes.", "Knowledge Point 3: By the time of the production decision, the product  must be shown to be producible within cost, schedule, and quality  targets and have demonstrated its reliability. It is also the point at  which the design should demonstrate through realistic testing that it  performs as expected.", "The most important part of a knowledge-based approach occurs at  program start, when product development begins. At that point, a timely  match of requirements and resources is critical to successful product  development. A key difference between successful products\u2014those that  perform as expected and are developed within estimated resources\u2014and  problematic products is when the match is achieved. When a customer\u2019s  needs and a developer\u2019s resources are matched before a product\u2019s  development starts, it is more likely the development will result in a  successful product that is able to meet cost, schedule, and performance  objectives. When this match takes place later, after the product  development is underway, problems occur that can significantly increase  the expected time and money as well as result in performance shortfalls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Knowledge Has Been Gained on FCS Definition, Development, and Demonstration but Falls Well Short for a Program at Midpoint", "paragraphs": ["Because the Army went forward with FCS development before attaining  key knowledge such as firm requirements and mature technologies, its  knowledge levels have consistently lagged behind its calendar schedule.  It  will be a challenge for the Army to mature technologies and hold a  preliminary design review by 2009. Ideally, these processes should have  been completed by the program\u2019s start in 2003.  Moreover, the Army has  just recently formed an understanding of what the FCS network needs to  be and what may be technically feasible. The Army is still struggling to  synchronize the set of needed complementary programs with FCS\u2019s  content and schedules because many of these programs have technical or  funding issues of their own. As it has gained knowledge in these areas, the  Army has had to restructure the program, reducing scope, increasing cost,  and delaying schedule.  In 2009, the Army will have spent 6 years and $18  billion on these initial definition and development efforts. That leaves  about 4 years and $9 billion in development funding to complete what are  usually the more costly aspects of a development program\u2014system  integration and demonstration activities as well as preparation for  production. The Army\u2019s user community believes, based on modeling and  simulation analyses, that FCS will provide needed capabilities. However, it  will be several years before demonstrations validate those results.

Instead, the Army expects to continue the process of setting  and defining requirements and establishing system designs at least until  the program reaches its system-of-systems level preliminary design review  in 2009. This is particularly problematic because 2009 actually marks a  date that is about one year past the mid-point of the FCS development  phase, when a program following best practices and DOD policy would  normally conduct a critical design review to show it has a stable,  producible design that is capable of meeting performance requirements.", "The Army faces a daunting task in completing requirements definition by  2009. As figure 2 illustrates, the FCS program encompasses thousands of  requirements at the operational, system-of-systems, and individual system  levels.", "The Army anticipates that it will gain a better understanding of FCS  system and subsystem requirements--and resolve many of the remaining  \u201cto be determined\u201d and open issues--during a series of system-level  preliminary design reviews to be completed by February 2009. Army  officials acknowledge that system-level requirements are almost certain to  be modified in the process as subsystem hardware and software are more  fully defined.", "The Army is working through the detailed requirements changes needed to  implement the program adjustments announced in early 2007 because the  restructure of FCS from 18 to 14 systems resulted in requirements  modifications, deferral, and redistribution. Army officials told us they are  currently assessing the requirements balance among the 14 systems and do  not yet have all the modifications to system requirements in place.", "However, some consequences are already apparent. For example, a  requirement for the deferred Class II unmanned aerial vehicle to carry a  laser designator is to be assigned to the Class I aerial vehicle. According to  Army officials, the Class I aerial vehicle will consequently need to use a  more powerful engine. In addition, because of the deferral of the Class III  aerial vehicle, its mission requirements--including performing the mine  detection mission--will need to be assigned to other platforms.", "All the individual FCS systems are being designed to meet the system-level  requirements and restrictive space, weight, and power constraints. The  Army is still coming to terms with these and other design issues. It has not  finished making trade-offs between requirements and design and have not  yet finalized decisions about how to implement requirements within  several areas of concern, including weight, power, space, reliability, and  unit costs. For example, most of the manned ground vehicles are at risk of  not meeting their weight, maintainability, and other requirements. To that  end, the program is still working on designing a hull for manned ground  vehicles that not only meets weight constraints but also requirements for  protecting vehicle crews against mine blasts. Similarly, the program is  trying to confirm a design that will balance competing requirements for  the Class I unmanned aerial vehicle to perform as needed yet be small and  light enough to be carried in a soldier\u2019s backpack. It is not clear that the  Army will be able to complete all system designs by 2009.", "The Army is also working to reduce recognized technical risks in the  system designs in order to meet system-of-systems as well as system-level  FCS requirements. For example, the Army is considering the possibility of  modifying requirements for the Class IV unmanned aerial vehicle because  the vehicle may not fully meet FCS electromagnetic requirements.  Likewise, the Army has focused on modifying transport requirements for  manned ground vehicles because they are too heavy to be moved via the  Air Force\u2019s C-130 airlift aircraft as originally planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Requirements and Designs for FCS Information Network Hamper Software Development", "paragraphs": ["Despite significant efforts to date, the Army and LSI have not completed  defining the detailed network requirements, maturing the preliminary  design of the network, and developing and integrating network hardware  and software. Nearly 5 years after the start of system development, the  Army and LSI only recently reached an understanding of what the network  needs to be, what may be technically feasible, how to begin building the  network, and how to eventually demonstrate it. An engineering approach  has been identified but network design and maturity is still a work in  progress. For example, the Army and LSI are still determining what  network management means in terms of    what is needed to support each specific mission (radios, routers,  satellites, computers, information assurance devices, policies);    how to allocate network resources to the mission spectrum (storage,  throughput, bandwidth); and    how to fuse, process, and present extensive FCS sensor data to  appropriate users.", "The Army and LSI are also working to establish how to maintain the  network, such as    how to monitor status and performance of the network (hardware  faults, network quality of service, overall performance);    how to implement spectrum management to ensure connectivity and    how to reconfigure the network in real time based on network  conditions and mission critical traffic.", "As they move ahead, the Army and LSI are faced with significant  management and technological challenges that place development of  FCS\u2019s network and software at risk. The magnitude, size, and complexity  of the network and software development are unprecedented in DOD  history. The Army and LSI have identified and need to address numerous  areas of high risk such as enterprise network performance and scalability,  immature network architecture, quality of service on a mobile ad-hoc  network, end-to-end interoperability with strategic networks of the global  information grid, and synchronization of FCS with WIN-T and JTRS  programs, which still do not have mature technologies and are at risk of  having delayed or incomplete delivery of capabilities to FCS. Finally, a  recent study by IDA found that the FCS program would likely experience  additional cost growth because of unplanned software effort, unplanned  rework during operational testing, and additional work to address system- of-systems integration, validation, and performance issues identified  during testing after the critical design review. Each of these areas would  affect network and software development, but the Army believes that IDA  did not consider the impact of the Army\u2019s mitigation efforts.", "Although the requirements process for the FCS information network is not  yet complete, the LSI and many of its subcontractors are developing and  testing FCS software. In total, five major software builds are planned.  Software Build 0 is complete and Build 1 is being tested. The most  significant issue identified to date is the growth in the estimates of the  total amount of software to be developed for FCS. Early in the program,  the Army and LSI projected that about 32 million lines of code would be  needed. Later, that estimate was increased to about 63 million lines of  code. As the Army continues to define FCS hardware and software  subsystem requirements, a new estimate puts the total volume of software  at about 95 million lines of code. The Army and LSI attribute this latest  increase to factoring the operating system software, something that had  not been included previously, into their estimate. In terms of actual  experience, the lines of code in Build 0 were about 6 percent greater than  projected and Build 1 were about 17 percent greater than projected.", "Although the Army and LSI have implemented disciplined software  practices for developing the network and software, the aggressive pace of  the program and Army decisions on what it can afford to do during  development have caused requirements issues at the software developer  level. While the Army and LSI have implemented practices that have  proved successful at leading software companies, such as the use of  repeatable and managed development processes and use of a structured  management review process to ensure quality development, we found that  the immature definition of system-level requirements was causing  problems. For example, the software developers for the 5 of the 52 major  software packages we reviewed report that high-level requirements  provided to them for decomposition and refinement were poorly defined,  omitted, or delivered late to the software development process. Also, we  found that poor or late requirements development have had a cascading  effect as late delivery or poorly defined requirements on one software  development effort, in turn, caused other software development efforts to  be delayed. For example, four of the five software developers report that  problems with late requirements have caused them to do rework or to  defer requirements out to future builds because of insufficient time. These  software developers report that schedule compression caused much of  this strain which could have been averted if they had been allowed  sufficient time to adequately understand and analyze the requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s User Representative Believes FCS Will Still Provide Needed Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Although the Army has not yet demonstrated the technical feasibility of  FCS\u2019s expected capabilities, the Army\u2019s user representative expects that  FCS will provide capabilities that will be as good as or better than current  forces. The user representative\u2019s position is based on the results of a  series of modeling and simulation activities. However, it will be several  years before field demonstrations validate those results. The user  representative has a key role in assessing whether FCS can deliver  capabilities that meet operational requirements. According to an Army  Training and Doctrine Command official, the user representative\u2019s current  position is that FCS, in either an 18- or 14-system configuration, is  expected to provide needed capabilities and will be as good as or better  than current forces.", "The official stated that the user representative\u2019s position is based on the  results of modeling and simulation analyses conducted to date. The Army  relies heavily on these modeling and simulation analyses in the early  phases of FCS in cases where actual or live test assets are not available.  To that end, these analyses began in 2003 and will continue throughout the  development program. Together, the analyses collectively postulate that  an FCS-equipped force will outperform current forces on many levels,  including the ability to affect a larger area of operations, accomplish  assigned missions faster, survive as well or better, kill earlier at longer  ranges, and better leverage and enable more effective joint operations. In  referencing the analyses and conclusions to date, the Army official noted  that the Army\u2019s decision to decrease the number of FCS systems from 18  to 14 did not affect the FCS brigade combat team\u2019s likely capability to  prevail in the simulated conflicts. However, while the Army has performed  modeling and simulation analyses with both 18 and 14 systems, it did not  make a direct comparison of the projected capabilities of FCS with 18  systems and FCS with 14 systems because changes in data and other  modeling aspects precluded such a comparison.", "The official added two caveats to the user community\u2019s current position.  He pointed out that true FCS capability at all levels will not be known until  demonstration and testing of actual physical assets is conducted.  Additionally, he noted that the user community will not accept FCS if it  does not meet minimum operational requirements. However, he did  indicate that the user community might accept some parts of FCS if it did  not meet minimum requirements but yielded systems that were badly  needed and/or performed better than other weapon systems available at  that time.", "The user community\u2019s optimism about FCS capabilities may be premature.  The Army already has stated that the program adjustment from 18 to 14  systems saved money but put at risk FCS\u2019s ability to reach its full tactical  and operational potential. Furthermore, it has indicated that the  adjustment reduced the individual capability of each of the 15 projected  FCS brigade combat teams. At this point, it is unclear exactly what FCS  capability can be realistically expected because modeling and simulation  results will not be fully validated by actual demonstrations and testing  until well in the future. For example, most of the manned ground vehicle  prototypes are not expected to be available until 2011 for developmental  and qualification testing. As noted by IDA in its 2007 report, what is known  is that the Army has little experience in developing system-of-systems and  in designing for a whole system to be more capable than the sum of its  parts.

Rather, the state of FCS technologies accurately reflects the unpredictable  nature of the discovery process that attends technology development,  which is why it is best done before development of a system is formally  begun.

Each of those revised estimates assumed that almost all of  FCS\u2019s critical technologies would be mature to TRL 6 by 2009, in time for  the program\u2019s preliminary design review. (Currently, the threat warning  sensor for the active protection system is not expected to be mature to  TRL 6 until sometime in 2010.) The Army\u2019s September 2006 assessment  projected that 80 percent of FCS critical technologies would mature to  TRL 6 by 2007, while the most recent assessment revealed that only 73  percent of those technologies have actually satisfied the conditions of   TRL 6.", "While the September 2006 critical technology assessment suggested  progress, the most recent assessment revealed that the Army misjudged  the maturity of a few critical technologies and that the projected dates for  other technologies achieving TRL 6 have slipped. According to the Army\u2019s  latest technology assessment, two technologies have reached full maturity  (TRL 7)\u2014Health Monitoring and Casualty Care Intervention and Excalibur  Precision Munitions. According to Army analyses, the maturity assessment  for Health Monitoring and Casualty Care Intervention is based on existing  technology being fielded to Stryker brigades. Nevertheless, FCS vehicles  have not been produced yet, and integration of this technology onto those  vehicles will ultimately determine their true maturity for FCS. The first  increment of Excalibur is being used by existing howitzers, but recent  Army reports identified a risk that the round may not be entirely  compatible with the proposed NLOS-C design. Even for these mature  systems, the Army must be aware of the potential integration issues, which  may not reveal themselves until the Army more fully develops the FCS  platform designs. Despite these examples, other technologies are now  rated less mature, projected maturity dates have slipped, and others have  shown little advancement over the years.", "Since the start of the program, the Army has reduced the ratings of seven  FCS critical technologies. Five of these critical technologies are still rated  as less mature than they were in previous assessments, and three of those  adjustments happened within the past year. Last year, the active  protection system was rated as a TRL 6, but the Army had based this  assessment on a concept that was not ultimately selected for further  development in FCS. Instead, the Army selected an active protection  concept that was less mature, but which the Army believed was a better  design for satisfying all FCS active protection requirements. Consequently,  the Army\u2019s most recent assessment rated the active protection system as a  TRL 5. Two WIN-T technology ratings were also adjusted to better reflect  their maturity. The WIN-T program has a turbulent history, including  technical challenges, and is being restructured in an effort to improve  program execution. As a result, the assessed maturity of WIN-T  technologies was reduced.", "While the Army did manage to advance the maturity of six FCS critical  technologies, this progress must be put into context. Because some critical  technologies that were approaching full maturity were removed and the  TRLs of other technologies were reduced, it effectively counteracted the  progress achieved over the past year. This condition resulted in FCS  technologies advancing at a slower pace than anticipated. In addition,  some technologies have matured only one level over nearly 5 years of  development. Distributed Fusion Management is the technology that  correlates the large amounts of sensor data from numerous sensor sources  and ultimately contributes to the maintenance of the common operational  picture created with data from the distributed network nodes. Fusing  sensor data is important for creating situational awareness and enabling  FCS forces to see first and understand first. This technology had been  assessed as TRL 4 when the FCS program began development 5 years ago  and advanced to TRL 5 in the Army\u2019s most recent assessment.", "Based on the Army\u2019s current assessment, eight FCS critical technologies  were assessed as being no more mature, and in some cases even less  mature, than they were when the program began. For example, Rapid  Battlespace Deconfliction, which is designed to help manage airspace and  airborne assets and potentially reduce the risk of collisions, was rated TRL  6 at the time of the first independent assessment and has since been  reduced to a TRL 5. In almost 5 years of FCS development, the Army has  not yet advanced the maturity for quality of service algorithms. These  algorithms are vitally important for ensuring successful operation of the  FCS network, particularly in regard to the Army\u2019s desire for FCS forces to  see first, understand first, act first, and finish decisively. Failure to provide  a high quality of service network will significantly degrade force  effectiveness, and could have devastating consequences in a force that  trades armor for information. Further, aided target recognition, which aids  FCS in seeing and acting first and contributes to survivability, has been  rated a TRL 5 since the FCS program began.", "The uneven nature of the technology assessments, coupled with the lack  of progress for some technologies, does not inspire confidence that the  Army can successfully mature all FCS critical technologies to TRL 6 in  time for the preliminary design review in 2009. While the most recent  assessments were conducted by the Army without independent review, the  Army expects to have an independently reviewed assessment available for  the 2009 preliminary design review. This assessment should provide an  objective technical opinion regarding the status of FCS critical  technologies, enabling more knowledgeable decisions at the 2009  milestone review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Immature Technologies Have Cumulative Effects: Survivability as an Example", "paragraphs": ["While the performance of individual technologies is important, the  potential collective or cumulative effect they can have on the performance  of FCS is also important.  The multiple technologies that are critical to  FCS survivability are illustrative. The FCS concept for survivability breaks  from tradition because it involves more than just heavy armor to protect  against impacts from enemy munitions. Instead, FCS survivability involves  a layered approach that consists of detecting the enemy first to avoid  being fired upon; if fired upon, using an active protection system to  neutralize the incoming munition before it hits the FCS vehicle; and finally,  having sufficient armor to deflect those munitions that make it through the  preceding layers. Each of these layers depends on currently immature  technologies to provide the aggregate survivability needed for FCS  vehicles. Many of the technologies intended for survivability have  experienced problems in development or have otherwise made little  progress in maturity over the 5 years of the FCS program. To the extent  these technologies do not mature or under-perform, the effect on overall  survivability must be assessed. This also holds true for other key  performance parameters, such as lethality, sustainability, and networked  battle command.", "The first several layers of defense best illustrate the fundamental FCS  concept of replacing mass with superior information in order to see and  hit the enemy first rather than relying on heavy armor to withstand a hit.  These layers rely on critical technologies that are largely unproven and  that have not yet demonstrated that they can provide adequate information  superiority as a substitute for heavy armor to protect Army soldiers. One  such critical technology is the JTRS. According to the Army\u2019s most recent  critical technology assessment, JTRS radios have achieved a TRL 6.  However, according to the JTRS program office, there are three JTRS  subtechnologies that have not yet matured to the point where the entire  radio can be rated a TRL 6. Another critical technology that contributes to  FCS\u2019s first layer of survivability is wideband networking waveforms,  which work in conjunction with the JTRS radios. A host of technology,  cost, and schedule problems have slowed waveform and radio  development, and in 2006, DOD approved a JTRS program restructure to  address these problems. However, the restructure is incomplete, and  waveform development is behind schedule.", "The active protection system is part of the comprehensive FCS hit  avoidance system architecture and will protect the vehicles from incoming  rounds, like rocket-propelled grenades and antitank missiles. The Army  has rated this technology as TRL 5. According to the most recent critical  technology assessment, the Army expects to mature most of the active  protection system suite to TRL 6 by fiscal year 2008. The Army does not  expect the active protection system sensor to mature to TRL 6 until  sometime after the 2009 preliminary design review. Based on current test  schedules, the Army could demonstrate TRL 6 for the short-range solution  by that time. However, a number of test events for the short-range  solution, some of which inform future events, have slipped. In addition,  demonstration of the long-range solution to TRL 6 is not scheduled to  happen until fiscal year 2010. The Army must also address the potential  repercussions from blast fragmentation and the corresponding risk of  collateral damage and fratricide.", "The Army has been developing lightweight hull and vehicle armor as a  substitute for traditional, heavy armor. The Army is developing lightweight  armor for FCS vehicles in three iterations. The Army believes the first  version will satisfy FCS threshold protection and weight requirements and  is planned to be used in the manned ground vehicle prototypes. The Army  has begun development of a second armor iteration with the goal of  formulating materials that will meet FCS objective survivability  requirements, but Army engineers do not expect those designs to be  lighter than the first iteration\u2019s designs. The third armor iteration will  focus on weight reduction initiatives with the goal of satisfying objective  requirements for both protection and weight. The Army hopes that the  third iteration will be ready to use in the initial production of the manned  ground vehicles.", "During the first iteration, Army engineers formulated a number of different  armor recipes in an attempt to satisfy threshold vehicle protection  requirements. They have tested a number of these recipes using smaller  sample sizes called coupons, but only more robust testing of larger  representative armor samples will determine whether the proposed  solutions will provide the necessary protection. The Army plans to  conduct such testing later this year on larger-scale samples of the different  armor recipes. The Army believes this testing will prove the armor  technology to TRL 6. However, should this approach fail, the Army plans  to use heavier hull and vehicle armor that will require trade-offs for space  and weight.", "The overall survivability of FCS-equipped units will depend not only on the  contribution of technologies to each layer of survivability, but also on the  cumulative contribution from layer to layer.  For example, if the  information network, active protection, and armor each under-perform by  10 percent, the Army will first have to know this and second be able to  assess the cumulative impact on overall survivability. As system-level  requirements are defined and allocated, and technologies demonstrate  their actual capabilities, additional design trades may be necessary and  concessions made that could impact key performance parameters like  lethality, survivability, sustainability, and networked battle command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Synchronizing FCS with Complementary Programs Is a Continuing Challenge", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the 14 systems and the network that compose the FCS  program, its full capabilities depend on at least 50 complementary  programs managed outside of FCS, some of which are also critical  technologies. The Army has been unable to fully synchronize the schedule  and content of the FCS program with that of complementary programs.  The Army has identified problems that raise concerns about the likelihood  that many complementary systems will deliver the required capabilities  when needed. In some cases, complementary programs have faced funding  issues due to evolving FCS requirements, and there are examples where  lack of coordination between FCS and complementary program officials  have stalled efforts aimed at synchronizing programs and resolving cost,  schedule, and technical issues.", "When the FCS program began, the Army concluded that it would need to  interoperate or integrate with as many as 170 other programs to help FCS  meet its operational requirements. The Army has stated previously that as  many as 52 of these programs are essential for meeting FCS key  performance parameters. As a result, the Army closely monitors these  programs to determine if they are synchronized with the cost, schedule,  and performance expectations of the FCS program. While the Army has  produced a list of complementary programs that need management  attention, that list has fluctuated, and although many complementary  programs have been mainstays on the list, the Army has had difficulties  synchronizing the schedules and capabilities of those systems with FCS.", "A number of challenges have contributed to the Army\u2019s inability to  synchronize complementary programs with FCS. A few of these challenges  are presented below.", "Both the JTRS family of programs and the WIN-T program are facing  technology maturation problems of their own, and they are at risk of  delayed or reduced delivery of capabilities to the FCS program.", "Some complementary programs are not adequately funded to conduct  the additional development activities needed to satisfy FCS  requirements. For example, the Army wants to integrate an upgraded  variant of the Javelin missile onto the Armed Robotic Vehicle-Light to  defeat tanks at close range, but the Javelin program has not secured  funding for this effort. In another case, the Army planned to use the  MK-44 precision air burst munition to satisfy a requirement that  infantry vehicles have the ability to defeat light armor vehicles and  groups of soldiers at short ranges. Based on Army analyses, the MK-44  will not satisfy the antipersonnel portion of the requirement, and no  funding is available to improve the round\u2019s performance.", "As the Army continues examining complementary programs, it is  discovering unanticipated technical and integration issues that were  not evident earlier. For example, the Army plans to use Excalibur  rounds with the NLOS-C, but engineers have discovered some  compatibility issues that are being addressed. In a similar assessment  of the Airborne Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Mine Detection  System, the Army discovered a number of issues that included  performance requirement gaps, software integration gaps, and a risk  that onboard processing may not be sufficient to execute the required  missions.", "In some cases, ineffective coordination has created situations where  either FCS requirements were not adequately defined for key  complementary programs or significant technical issues were not  promptly addressed. FCS engineers discovered problems with JTRS  radios related to storage temperatures and shock and vibration on the  FCS ground vehicles. Efforts to resolve this problem have stalled  because not all the affected parties have been included in the joint  engineering team dialogue. In another example, JTRS requirements are  not aligned with current force vehicles. The FCS program has not  received a unified set of requirements from the user representative for  spin out 1 current-force vehicles.", "Complementary programs have their own acquisition and development  challenges, much like the FCS program, and they have their own approved  requirements documents and acquisition program baselines that cannot  easily be changed\u2014hence the difficulties in synchronizing the schedule  and content of the FCS with that of the complementary programs.", "FCS officials have been revising the list of essential complementary  programs, in part because of the risks revealed during the synchronization  process, but also in response to the Army\u2019s competing budget priorities.

Although the  manned ground vehicle designs depend on the performance of the  information network, demonstration of the network will take place after  the vehicles are designed and prototyped. Most tests to demonstrate  whether the FCS system-of-systems performs as required will take place  after the low-rate production decision, precluding opportunities to change  course if warranted by test results and increasing the likelihood of costly  discoveries in late development or during production.

If the match had occurred in 2003, the FCS  program would have held its preliminary design review some 3 to 5 years ago,  have nearly completed design integration by now, and be approaching a  critical design review in the next year. However, the Army moved ahead with  the program\u2019s start without having this match in place, and consequently, the  technology development and system development and demonstration phases  will overlap by several years. Now, the Army is moving towards another set of  major decision points, the preliminary design review in 2009 and subsequent  milestone review, and it may not have sufficient knowledge for these reviews  either.", "As illustrated in figure 5 below, the program has numerous knowledge  gaps that must be closed before the performance of the FCS, as well as its  cost and schedule, can be stated with confidence.", "The first gap between technology maturity and firm requirements has  persisted since 2003, as discussed earlier.  The second gap occurs at the  program\u2019s critical design review, scheduled for 2011. Ideally, this review,  which confirms that a design performs as expected, occurs about halfway  through a program\u2019s development schedule. In the case of FCS, the  program will be 80 percent of the way through its development schedule  and cost before the review is held. Furthermore, the schedule leaves little  time to gain knowledge between the critical design review (knowledge  point 2) and the low-rate initial production decision (knowledge point 3)  because the Army has scheduled only 2 years between these events.   Moreover, the critical design review is typically the point at which a  program begins building the fully integrated, production-representative  prototypes whose testing will prove the design\u2019s maturity and form the  basis for a low-rate initial production decision.  Instead, the FCS will rely  on earlier, less mature prototypes.  Therefore, a decision to proceed into  low-rate production will be made without a mature design, and will likely  lead to costly rework or further delays.", "The FCS network illustrates knowledge gaps that the Army faces in  developing the FCS system\u2014a substantial amount of development work  remains before the Army and LSI can demonstrate the full expected  capability of the FCS network. To date, only basic network concepts, such  as connecting and exchanging information among limited network nodes,  has been demonstrated (Experiment 1.1). The Army plans to demonstrate  introduction and use of sensor information during this year\u2019s spin out  demonstration; other incremental demonstrations will follow. The first  major demonstration of FCS network is limited user test number 3,  scheduled for fiscal year 2012, which will be at least a year after critical  design review and about a year before the start of core FCS production.  Recently, Congress legislated that a network demonstration be held prior  to obligation of FCS production funding at Milestone C. Even with this  test, by then, other FCS system developments\u2014such as manned ground  vehicles\u2014will have had their critical design reviews; their developmental  prototypes will be in testing; and they will be getting ready to start initial  production in fiscal 2013. Well in excess of 80 percent of planned  development funds will have been expended by this point in time. In short,  the manned ground vehicles may be proceeding well in advance of  network development and demonstration, given that their designs\u2014and in  fact, the entire FCS\u2014depend on the network\u2019s performance. At this point,  it is not certain what level of network demonstration will be needed before  decision makers can confidently approve manned ground vehicles and  other FCS systems for initial production.", "FCS testing is particularly risky in terms of its relation to demonstration of  design and production process maturity (knowledge point 3) because  testing of actual capabilities occurs late in the program\u2014shortly before  and after major decision points, including the low-rate production decision  in 2013. Moreover, the period for testing, analyzing, fixing, and retesting is  both too late and too short to support major decisions. The majority of  testing through 2012 is limited in scope and more aimed at confidence- building than demonstrating key capabilities. Early test efforts focus on  experiments and development testing of individual systems. Most  development prototypes will not be available until 2010 and later for  testing and demonstrations. Table 2 below shows the schedule for FCS  key test events.", "As shown in table 2, a key system-of-systems level test scheduled before  the low-rate production decision is the Limited User Test 3 in 2012 to  assess brigade combat team capabilities.

The IDA pointed out that this  means test results from one phase cannot easily be available for use in the  next phase. It noted that the program\u2019s later phases are particularly at risk  of failing to capture rework requirements identified by earlier  experimentation and testing. It predicts that the compressed schedule of  development and test events, together with dense schedule dependencies  among program activities, will mean that any rework required will lead to  a program-wide schedule slip. In anticipation of these and other related  consequences, the IDA predicts that there needs to be at least one cycle of  additional FCS test and evaluation beyond the current planned test  sequence in order to resolve outstanding issues from previous,  overlapping phases and complete development.", "As mentioned earlier, a systems engineering assessment will be conducted  on the FCS program for the 2009 milestone review.

Second, as noted by the IDA,  the Army may have to redesign if the fully developed and certified JTRS  radios have different form, fit, function, and interoperability  characteristics than expected.

Advance  procurement funding for the first full suite of FCS systems will begin in  fiscal year 2011, the budget for which will be presented to Congress in  February 2010\u2014less than a year after the milestone review and before the  stability of the FCS design is assessed at the critical design review. By  2013, the Army will have already invested a total of $11.9 billion in  procurement, with another $6.9 requested. Moreover, to the extent that  beginning NLOS-C production in 2008 starts up the manned ground vehicle  industrial base, it could create a future need to sustain the base.  If FCS  goes according to plan, FCS core production would begin as early NLOS-C  production ends, with FCS core long lead items providing a transition. If  decision makers were to consider delaying FCS core production because it  was not ready, a gap could develop when early NLOS-C production ends.   Sustaining the industrial base could then become an argument against an  otherwise justified delay.", "In December 2007, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics took steps to keep the decisions on the NLOS-C  early production separate from FCS core production. In approving  procurement of long-lead items for the NLOS-C vehicles in 2008, the Under  Secretary designated the 18 early prototypes as a separate, special interest  program for which he will retain authority for making milestone decisions.  The Under Secretary plans another decision in 2009 to approve the start of  NLOS-C production and has put a cost limit of $505.2 million (fiscal year  2003 dollars) on production. He also specified that specific requirements  be met at that time, such as a capability production document, technology  readiness assessment, test plan, independent estimate of costs, and an  approved acquisition program baseline.

As LSI, Boeing\u2019s role is  multifaceted: it is a partner with the Army in developing requirements and  defining the FCS solution; it is overseeing the development efforts of all of  the individual system subcontractors, a role that will extend well beyond  the 2013 production decision; it is responsible for developing two key  software products\u2014the system-of-systems common operating  environment, the core of the FCS network, and the Warfighter Machine  Interface; it is the prime contractor for the production of spin outs and the  NLOS-C; and now it is to be responsible for the low-rate production of the  first three combat brigades of FCS core systems.", "The specific role the LSI will play in production of spin outs, NLOS-C, and  FCS core production are unclear at this point. The contracts for long lead  items for spin out 1 and NLOS-C have not been definitized yet and  statements of work for the production contracts will be negotiated later.  According to the program officials, Boeing will contract with the first tier  subcontractors who will in turn contract with their own subcontractors.  For example, the firms that are designing and developing and will  physically manufacture NLOS-C are General Dynamics and British  Aerospace. Similarly, the work that the LSI does on actual production of  the FCS is likely to be small compared to the other hardware suppliers and  assemblers. Thus, the production role of the LSI is likely to be largely in  oversight of the first tier subcontractors.", "From the outset of the program, the LSI was to focus its attention on  development activities, which the Army judged to be beyond what it could  directly handle. The Army believed that traditionally, contractors made  much of their profit in production, not in research and development. Thus,  the Army reasoned, the contractors are not as motivated by research and  development as they are by production. Army leadership believed that by  using an LSI that would not necessarily have to be retained for production,  the Army could get the best effort from the contractor during the  development phase while at the same time making the effort profitable for  the contractor. The Army had always reserved the right to contract  directly with the developers of the individual FCS systems for production.  In 2005, the Army took steps to further bound the integrator role when it  strengthened the organizational conflicts of interest clause in the contract  to preclude the LSI from competing for any further subcontracts.", "Nonetheless, the LSI\u2019s involvement in the production phase has been  growing over time. The current LSI development contract for the core FCS  systems extends almost 2 years beyond the 2013 production decision. The  Army does not expect that the initial brigades outfitted by FCS will meet  the upper range of its requirements, and has made the LSI responsible for  planning future FCS enhancements during the production phase. The LSI  is also responsible for defining and maintaining a growth strategy for  integrating new technologies into the FCS brigade combat teams.  Combined with a likely role in sustainment, which has not yet been fully  defined, the LSI will remain indefinitely involved in the FCS program. It is  also likely that the LSI will be used over the long term for data and  configuration management, among other things.", "The recent decision to commit to the LSI for the early production of FCS  spin out items and NLOS-C vehicles as well as the initial low rate  production of FCS core systems is perhaps the final departure from the  Army\u2019s effort to keep the contractor\u2019s focus solely on development. It is  particularly significant given that it is 6 years in advance of the low-rate  production decision and effectively cedes a key point of leverage\u2014source  selection\u2014that the Army held. The Army justified its decision on the  grounds that it is the most cost effective means of proceeding. The Army  believes that Boeing\u2019s previous experience with FCS provides the  company the unique management framework and expertise necessary to  proceed. The Army also cites Boeing\u2019s common configuration  management process and the ability to integrate systems-of-systems trade- offs and requirements changes holistically. While these may be legitimate  advantages, they would not necessarily represent new discoveries on the  part of the Army but rather natural advantages that would likely accrue to  an incumbent system integrator. In addition, the Army\u2019s analysis that led  up to the decision did not assess its originally stated option of the Army\u2019s  contracting directly with the individual system developers for production,  but rather focused on the much narrower question of whether it was  feasible for any other contractor to perform the role of the LSI for the  entire FCS program.", "We have previously reported that the complex relationship between the  Army and Boeing increases the burden of oversight and poses risks for the  Army\u2019s ability to provide independent oversight over the long term. The  relationship between the Army and Boeing broke new ground in its close,  partner-like arrangement. It has advantages over an arms-length  relationship but makes oversight more challenging.

The Army attributes the  adjustment to (1) funding constraints in the fiscal year 2008 to 2013  program objective memorandum that made the previous configuration of  the program unaffordable, (2) consecutive budget cuts by the Congress,  and (3) the changing needs of the Army that incorporate lessons learned  from ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As of January 2008, the  Army and LSI were in negotiations to implement these changes into the  development contract, and the dollar values of the specific changes were  not yet available.

The study further identified significant additional  cost risk, which it described as unquantifiable, because of incomplete  technology maturation, critical dependency on complementary programs,  necessary experimentation during FCS development, and the overall  complexity and required synchronization of the FCS development  activities. The IDA study did not assess likely procurement costs. The  Army has stated that the IDA assessment does not give the Army credit for  the risk mitigation offered by the integration phase approach and spin  outs.

The  difference in estimates is also attributable to the CAIG\u2019s assessment that  the FCS software development would require more time and effort to  complete than the Army had estimated. In fact, the Army recently  indicated an increase in estimated software lines of code from 63 million  to 95 million. The independent estimate also provided for additional risks  regarding the availability of key systems to support the FCS network, such  as the JTRS radios.

When the program began, the estimates  were based on an FCS system-of-systems including 14 platforms with an  additional four platforms deferred. The 2004 restructure brought back the  deferred systems for a total of 18. But, the recent program adjustment  once again deferred essentially the same set of platforms. The current  configuration is 14 systems, and the Army\u2019s cost estimate of $112.6 billion  in base year 2003 dollars is comparable to the CAIG\u2019s original estimate for  the same number of FCS systems. The Army\u2019s estimate has thus increased  about 46 percent over the course of 4 years for essentially the same set of  platforms, while some capabilities, such as the transport requirements for  manned ground vehicles, have been modified over that time frame.", "The Army has not accepted either of the independent estimates on the  grounds that the CAIG and IDA estimates include additional work scope,  particularly in the later years of the development phase. Program officials  told us that the Army cannot fund additional work that is not currently in  its scope. The CAIG and IDA both use historical growth factors in their  estimates, based on the results of previous programs. It is reasonable to  use such growth factors, based on our own analysis of weapon systems  and the low level of knowledge attained on the FCS program at this time.

Army officials have said they will not increase program  cost estimates to fall in line with independent estimates, but will instead  consider trading away requirements or changing their concept of  operations to keep FCS development costs within available funding levels.  The Army and LSI are currently conducting analyses to determine which  requirements and capabilities can be discarded with the least impact to the  program. The FCS contract also contains a clause on program generated  adjustments. This allows the LSI to identify a prioritized list of capabilities  in advance that can be partially or completely deleted should the need  arise.

If significant problems have to be  corrected during production, the costs could be prohibitive, thus putting  the Army\u2019s modernization plan in jeopardy.  It is therefore essential at the  2009 decision that the FCS business case be demonstrated against clear  criteria\u2014both as to what performance it can deliver and the soundness of  its remaining schedule\u2014versus being assessed on potentialities. With such  large sums already invested, early production having begun in 2008, and  the late development and demonstration of the FCS capability, decision  makers in 2013 will be in a very difficult position under the current  strategy.", "The deficiencies we cite in this report in areas such as requirements and  technology are not criticisms of progress in the sense that things should  have gone smoother or faster.

The decisions in 2009 will provide an  opportunity to realign the progress of knowledge in FCS with events such  as the critical design review and tests of prototypes before the production  decision.  The 2009 decision point may also be the government\u2019s last  realistic opportunity to safeguard its ability to change course on FCS,  should that be warranted. The first decision, as we see it, will have to  involve whether FCS\u2019s capabilities have been demonstrated to be both  technically feasible and militarily worthwhile. If they have not, then DOD  and the Army will need to have viable alternatives to fielding the FCS  capability as currently envisioned. Depending on the results of the first  decision, the second decision is to determine how to structure the  remainder of the FCS program so that it attains high levels of knowledge  before key commitments.", "Other aspects of the FCS program warrant attention that should not wait  until the 2009 decision. Primary among these is the Army\u2019s decision to  extend the role of the LSI into FCS production. This is a decision that will  necessarily heighten the role the Office of the Secretary of Defense will  have to play in overseeing the program and departs from the Army\u2019s  philosophy of having the LSI focus on development without the competing  demands and interests that production poses. A second aspect of the  program warranting attention is the Army\u2019s approach to spin outs. It will  be important for the Army to clearly demonstrate the military utility of the  spin outs to current Army forces based on testing high-fidelity, production- representative prototypes, before a commitment is made to low-rate  production. This is not the current plan, as the Army plans to use some  surrogate equipment in the testing that will support the production  decision for spin out 1. Finally, it is important that the production  investments in the spin outs and NLOS-C do not create undue momentum  for production of FCS core systems. As noted above, commitment to  production of the FCS\u2019s core systems must be predicated on attaining high  levels of knowledge, consistent with DOD policy.

It is essential that the  Office of the Secretary of Defense perform its own analyses and  assessments, so that it may arrive at its own conclusions. In particular, the  Office must evaluate the advantages and risks of the LSI\u2019s expanded  production role with regard to the potentially greater burden of oversight  it will likely bear as a consequence.", "Finally, the department maintains that GAO\u2019s definition of testing  requirements to support the low-rate initial production decision is more in  line with the requirements for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation,  which occurs with low-rate production assets and informs the full-rate  production decision. The testing standards we apply reflect the best  practice of having production-representative prototypes tested prior to a  low-rate production decision. This approach demonstrates the prototypes\u2019  performance and reliability as well as manufacturing processes\u2014in short,  that the product is ready to be manufactured within cost, schedule, and  quality goals.", "We received other technical comments from DOD, which have been  addressed in the report, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretary of the Army; and the Director, Office of Management and  Budget.

The maturity level of a technology can range  from paper studies (level 1), to prototypes that can be tested in a realistic  environment (TRL 7), to an actual system that has proven itself in mission  operations (level 9). According to DOD acquisition policy, a technology  should have been demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL 6) or,  preferably, in an operational environment (TRL 7) to be considered mature  enough to use for product development.
