The majority of DOE\u2019s plutonium inventory (excluding reactor fuel, spent nuclear fuel, and special isotopes) is stored at five sites that formerly developed or produced nuclear weapons components or materials and a sixth facility where those weapons are now dismantled.", "Prior to 1989, DOE usually stored plutonium only temporarily because the Department continually recycled it for use in nuclear weapons. In 1994, both DOE and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board identified problems with how the Department stored its plutonium. In an effort to remediate these problems, DOE developed and began implementing a plan to stabilize and package its plutonium that was not in nuclear weapons components. Plutonium in nuclear weapons components was excluded because it was considered to be relatively safe and stable compared to other forms of plutonium. Although it recently decided to dispose of the United States\u2019 excess plutonium inventory, DOE is many years away from implementing this decision and must safely store these materials in the interim."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequately Packaged Plutonium Poses Hazards", "paragraphs": ["Plutonium, a radioactive element, exists in several forms, including metals, oxides, residues, and solutions. Plutonium metals are stable if packaged correctly. The remainder of DOE\u2019s plutonium\u2014oxides, residues, and solutions\u2014is in forms that are less stable. Plutonium oxides are fine powders produced when plutonium metals react with oxygen\u2014during processing of plutonium for weapons or other uses, or during storage. Plutonium residues are the by-products of plutonium processing and generally contain plutonium in concentrations of less than 10 percent. These residues include plutonium mixed with other materials, such as impure plutonium metals and oxides, ash, contaminated glass and metals, and other items. Plutonium solutions are acidic and corrosive, making their containers vulnerable to leakage. Most of DOE\u2019s plutonium is stored as metals because during the production era, plutonium in other forms was recycled and purified into metals to be used in pits for nuclear warheads. A plutonium pit is a nuclear weapons component, made up of a plutonium metal sphere encased in a nonradioactive metal shell, which can be compressed by detonating high explosives inside a weapon to create a nuclear explosion.", "If not safely contained and managed, plutonium can be dangerous to human health, even in small (microgram) quantities. Inhaling a large dose of plutonium particles can cause lung injuries and death, while exposure to a small dose creates a long-term risk of lung, liver, and bone cancer. When the container or packaging (and the metal shell for pits) fails to fully contain the plutonium, the potential for exposure exists. Leakage from corroded containers or inadvertent accumulations of plutonium dust in piping or duct work pose health and safety hazards, especially in aging, poorly maintained, or obsolete facilities. When DOE stopped producing nuclear weapons in 1989, much of its plutonium was either not in a suitable form, such as plutonium in solutions, or was not packaged for long-term storage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Majority of DOE\u2019s Plutonium Is Located at Six Sites", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s plutonium inventory is stored primarily at six sites.

These vulnerabilities are important because they could cause inadvertent releases of plutonium, which could expose workers.", "In April 1994, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board issued a report describing problems with plutonium storage safety at four of the Department\u2019s sites with large inventories of plutonium. Subsequently, in May 1994, the Board recommended that the Department take action to safely store its plutonium. In this recommendation, the Board expressed concern that the cessation of nuclear weapons production had left plutonium in an unsafe state that should be remediated. For example, when packaging the plutonium not in pits, some sites used plastic inner liners, which could react with the plutonium to form a buildup of hydrogen gas that could bulge and even rupture the outer containers or cause the plutonium to spontaneously ignite. The Board also identified specific materials, in the form of plutonium residues, that it believed to be higher-risk because of their unstable nature, uncertainty about what the plutonium was mixed with, or the inappropriate packaging of the materials. According to a Board staff member, the Board excluded plutonium in pits from its recommendation because it believed that in the near term, storage problems were not as severe for pits as for the other forms of plutonium."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Implementation Plan Sets Forth Milestones to Stabilize and Package Plutonium That Is Not in Pits", "paragraphs": ["As required by statute, the Secretary of Energy prepared an implementation plan responding to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board\u2019s 1994 recommendation.

Plutonium residues are typically stabilized by either converting them into plutonium oxides through various processes or by blending them with other materials for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant when this facility becomes available. Plutonium solutions are not appropriate for storage and have to be processed into a solid form before the plutonium can be stored. DOE requires that stabilized plutonium metals that are not in pits and oxides be packaged in approved, sealed double containers to isolate the plutonium from the outside environment and to prevent its release. In April 1997, we reported that DOE estimated that its plutonium management activities, including stabilization and storage, at eight sites across the complex would cost approximately $7.9 billion, in constant 1996 dollars, from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2002.

To convert its excess plutonium to other forms, DOE intends to pursue a hybrid strategy: (1) burning the plutonium as fuel in power reactors and (2) immobilizing it in glass or ceramic material. As described in our April 1997 report, DOE\u2019s estimated cost to implement its hybrid strategy would be approximately $2 billion, in constant 1996 dollars.

DOE Standard 3013 establishes safety criteria for packaging plutonium metals and stabilized plutonium oxides for long-term storage. This standard prescribes the form the plutonium must be in and processes for stabilization. For example, Standard 3013 requires that plutonium oxides be stabilized by heating them in air to a very high temperature\u2014approximately 950 degrees celsius or higher\u2014for at least 2 hours. The standard also contains requirements for plutonium packaging and for inspection, surveillance, documentation, and quality assurance and control.

Half of these (49 of 98) mark activities that have been completed at the five sites. These milestones focused on two primary areas: (1) preliminary activities required for subsequent stabilization activities, such as preparing environmental impact statements, and (2) stabilizing higher-risk plutonium, such as plutonium in contact with plastic. Of the remaining 49 milestones, 59 percent have already been delayed or are at risk of delay. These remaining milestones include activities for completing the stabilization and packaging to ready plutonium metals and oxides for long-term storage.

Officials at Rocky Flats, Savannah River, and Lawrence Livermore stated that they plan to have their plutonium metals and oxides stabilized and packaged for long-term storage by May 2002. On the other hand, officials at Hanford and Los Alamos told us that they currently anticipate missing the May 2002 date, although these delays to the Department\u2019s commitment date have not been approved by DOE headquarters. Hanford officials estimate that their completion date will slip by 7 months because of the suspension of the site\u2019s plutonium stabilization activities at one facility there.

Originally, Rocky Flats officials thought that all of the site\u2019s residues would be exempted from meeting a DOE security requirement specifying the level of plutonium content acceptable so that the materials will not have to be guarded at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. In July 1996, DOE headquarters officials informed Rocky Flats that it had to either comply with this requirement or qualify for a variance. Shortly thereafter, Rocky Flats requested but was subsequently denied a variance for some of its plutonium residues. In particular, Rocky Flats had originally planned to have one type of plutonium residue (graphite fines) stabilized by May 1997. However, since the process it had originally chosen would not meet the security requirement, Rocky Flats selected a different process for stabilizing graphite fines\u2014switching from heating them at a high temperature (calcination) to immobilizing them in molten glass (vitrification). To accommodate this change, the site plans to spend an additional $300,000 and will not have its graphite fines stabilized until September 1998\u2014a delay of 16 months from the original milestone.", "In addition, Rocky Flats had originally planned to have the majority of its plutonium salt residues stabilized by May 1997 using an available technology. According to a DOE official, as with the situation with graphite fines, Rocky Flats thought these salts would be exempted from the security requirement specifying the allowable plutonium content. However, for some of these salt residues, the site did not receive a variance, and since the process it had originally chosen would not comply with this requirement, a different technology\u2014a distillation process to separate the salts from the plutonium\u2014was chosen.

The DOE contractor managing this facility failed to comply with operating regulations concerning the safe handling of nuclear materials\u2014leading to the suspension of plutonium stabilization operations at this facility. In order to resume operations, the facility must pass a review by DOE. Hanford officials expect to resume stabilization activities at the plant in March 1998, at the earliest. In addition to the suspension of stabilization activities, because of budget cutbacks Hanford expects delays in installing its new plutonium stabilization and packaging system. To make up for these delays, Hanford officials told us that when this new system becomes operational, they plan to go from a 5-day-per-week, three-shift-per-day work schedule to a 7-day-per-week, three-shift-per-day schedule. This increase would last about 3 years\u2014beginning late in 2000, when the site\u2019s plutonium stabilization and packaging system is planned to become fully operational, and continuing into December 2002, when Hanford officials plan to have all of the site\u2019s plutonium metals and oxides stabilized and packaged for long-term storage. Hanford officials were unable to estimate the likely costs of the approximately 2-year expanded work schedule, and given the site\u2019s budget constraints, they were unsure whether funds for this work schedule would be available.

However, DOE Standard 3013 for long-term storage and the draft criteria for disposition vary in some significant ways, which could result in additional activities or processing steps and increased costs. For example, according to DOE, the draft disposition criteria would require the sites to provide historical information on how the plutonium was processed, what impurities are likely to be included with it, and what the physical condition of the plutonium is. However, under Standard 3013, the sites are not currently required to retain this information with the plutonium. If the necessary information was not available, the draft criteria for disposition would require the sites to sample their plutonium to gather it.

Specifically, the letter noted that there was no organization with crosscutting authority and resources within the Department to integrate stabilization and disposition activities across the DOE complex. To remedy this problem, the Board suggested that DOE designate a lead officer with primary responsibility for the program as a whole.

Since 1989, DOE has stored pits in a type of container known as the AL-R8, which was designed to transport pits.

Moreover, as DOE continues to dismantle weapons, the number of pits stored in these containers continues to grow.

According to the DOE official responsible for overseeing the storage of pits, in 1989 the Department may have assumed that because the AL-R8 containers had been certified to transport pits and met requirements to withstand various accident scenarios, they could also be used to store the pits. The basis for this assumption, however, is unclear, and DOE officials were unable to provide any analysis supporting the 1989 decision.", "An AL-R8 container consists of an outer steel drum with a clamped (but unsealed) lid. Inside this steel drum, the pit is secured on a metal frame and surrounded by a fibrous cushioning liner.

However, DOE has not been successful in developing a cost-effective container that provides safe long-term storage and can also be used to transport pits. According to some DOE officials, to be cost-effective, a transportation container must be reusable. In contrast, a storage container, as illustrated by the problems with the AL-R8, needs to be sealed to keep out moisture and to keep the plutonium contained in the event that the pit would crack. Nonetheless, DOE attempted to design and develop a container that could be used for both purposes. After investing a great deal of time and nearly $50 million to design and develop the replacement container, DOE found that it is not cost-effective for extensive use in either capacity. According to DOE officials, at a cost of about $8,000 per container (largely due to transportation requirements), the AT400A is not cost-effective for use as a storage container (the containers alone for 10,000 pits would cost about $80 million). Furthermore, according to DOE officials, the AT400A is not cost-effective for multiple shipments between sites because it is designed to be welded shut for storage purposes and therefore is not reusable.", "The AT400A container consists of an outer stainless steel container that surrounds an inner, sealed container, within which a pit is secured by a metal fixture.

DOE tasked three of its national laboratories to work on various aspects of the project: Sandia National Laboratory developed the container and the system to weld it shut, while Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories jointly developed the fixture to hold the pit inside the container. However, DOE did not ensure that the work of the laboratories was adequately coordinated and did not adequately involve Pantex safety experts in the design and development process. As a result, according to DOE and Pantex officials, after the design phase was complete, Pantex safety experts had to compensate for design flaws, which included a defective safety system and a weld directly over the pit, which could have allowed the welder to burn through the container into the pit.

However, in a preliminary draft of the plan provided by officials in February 1998, many sections were in only a cursory outline form, so we were unable to determine if the plan will be adequate to ensure the problems in storing pits will be addressed. For example, at that time, the draft did not contain schedules or cost estimates for selecting a design, procuring the containers, or repackaging the pits. Furthermore, this draft included a listing of the numerous entities involved with repackaging and storage\u2014within various organizations of the Department and its contractors\u2014however, it did not define how these entities will interact or how their efforts will be coordinated, nor did it clearly delineate program responsibility and accountability for overseeing the various facets of the pit repackaging and storage program to ensure its success.", "DOE is developing a repackaging alternative that officials believe will be more cost-effective and will allow quicker repackaging than using the AT400A. As they describe it, this alternative will probably involve a retrofit of the original AL-R8 container by removing the pit from it, sealing the pit inside an inner container, and placing that inner container back into the AL-R8 outer container. DOE is currently reviewing alternative designs developed by Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Pantex and plans to have a decision by April 1998. The Department\u2019s preliminary estimates of the costs to repackage 12,000 pits into retrofitted AL-R8 containers range from $35.5 million to $59.4 million. These estimates are based on the cost to purchase the containers (ranging from $20.5 million to $40.4 million), as well as start-up costs (from $1.2 million to $1.6 million) and operating costs (from $13.8 million to $17.4 million) for repackaging the pits. DOE officials estimate that, at the earliest, the repackaging could begin around the end of 1998. Given the number of pits to be repackaged and competing demands on equipment and facilities at Pantex, they estimate that it may take from 4 to 7 years to complete repackaging once the process begins.

Specifically, in August 1995 Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories recommended that if DOE continues to store pits in AL-R8 containers for longer than 10 years, it should implement an aggressive monitoring program to examine 20 percent of the pits each year. With about 10,000 pits in storage now, monitoring 2,000 pits per year is a sizable increase over the current 30 pits per year that DOE now formally monitors.", "According to DOE and Pantex officials, implementing the monitoring program recommended by the laboratories would likely require constructing additional facilities, procuring additional equipment, and hiring and training additional staff.

Los Alamos has become the new site for some of these relocated missions and programs.\u201d The remainder of this comment provides information on the Department\u2019s redefinition of the scope of plutonium remediation efforts at Los Alamos. However, this information generally supports rather than contradicts the information contained in our report that competing priorities, between national defense work and other activities, have caused delays in Los Alamos\u2019 ability to meet its implementation plan milestone to have its plutonium stabilized and packaged for long-term storage. Therefore we made no additional changes to the report. 2. The Department has not defined \u201cshort-term storage\u201d nor provided evidence that the AL-R8 containers are safe for any length of storage. However, to address this comment, we limited our use of the term \u201cunsuitable\u201d to discussions of the use of AL-R8 containers for extended or prolonged storage of pits. We also added footnote 6 in the \u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d which states that, \u201cAccording to DOE and laboratory officials, some pits are more susceptible to corrosion than others, depending on the metal used to encase the pit.\u201d 3. To respond to this comment concerning the Department\u2019s formal pit monitoring efforts and other inspections of its pits, we revised the report to read, 30 pits are \u201cformally\u201d monitored per year. Furthermore, on the basis of this comment and additional information provided by the Department, we added footnotes to the report that provide additional information on visual inspections of pits transferred from Rocky Flats to Pantex. In its comments, DOE states that, in addition to the formal monitoring effort, \u201cseveral more  are handled regularly in other routine activities\u201d and that these activities \u201crequire visual checks and radiation swipes which would detect the concerns referred to in this report.\u201d However, since these statements were not supported by the information provided by the Department, we did not revise the report. The information provided supported only that additional pits have been visually inspected on specific occasions but did not support a systematic program of visual inspection. The additional visual inspections cited were due to extraordinary events (such as the pits\u2019 transfer to Pantex from Rocky Flats); they were not presented as a regular occurrence or as a planned addition to the formal monitoring program. We note that visual inspections are much less extensive than the testing and analysis performed as part of the formal monitoring program, and the officials did not provide information that these inspections would be able to detect the problems cited. Therefore, we do not believe that the visual inspections that have been conducted take the place of formal monitoring or negate our recommendation that the Department carefully analyze the need for enhanced monitoring to resolve safety concerns raised by the laboratories and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. 4. The Department\u2019s development of a repackaging plan for the pits at Pantex is discussed in detail in chapter 3 of our report.

Although we requested documentation or other information to support the comment that \u201clonger than previously expected processing times . . . have also contributed to delays in meeting implementation plan milestones,\u201d the additional information provided by the Department did not do so.

See comment 1 above for information added to the report to address DOE\u2019s comment concerning the relocation of programs from other sites in the DOE weapons complex to Los Alamos. We also revised the report to reflect the Department\u2019s position that remediation efforts will continue at Los Alamos, and that the Department is reviewing proposals for additional personnel and equipment. 8. We did not revise the report to reflect DOE\u2019s comment on the distinction between the 1995 recommendation by the laboratories and the 1997 \u201cPit Storage Specification.\u201d As discussed in our report, the 1995 recommendation by the laboratories concerns the need for increased monitoring of the pits while they remain in the existing AL-R8 containers. The 1997 \u201cPit Storage Specification\u201d will apply to pits as they are repackaged out of the AL-R8 containers. According to DOE and laboratory officials, pits currently packaged in AL-R8 containers cannot comply with this specification. Furthermore, the 1997 specification does not negate the laboratories\u2019 1995 recommendation for increased pit monitoring. Rather, the specification states, \u201cIncreased sampling may be required if . . . aspects of this specification are not met\u201d\u2014which is exactly the case while the pits remain in AL-R8 containers. 9. The development of the AT400A container is discussed in our report. No changes were made to the report because the Department did not provide support for the suggestion that the work on the AT400A was the reason the AL-R8 was not viewed as an extended storage container. 10. On the basis of additional information provided by the Department, we revised the footnote to describe the 1997 recertification of the FL containers for transportation, revised the number of FL containers in service at this time, and included two additional reasons the Department provided for not using these containers for long-term storage: They are very expensive, at approximately $10,000 per container; and they were designed for transporting pits not storing them. 11. We did not revise the footnote concerning the pit that cracked because the Department did not provide additional support for the statement that this occurred \u201cdue to extreme conditions experienced during the disassembly process, which far exceed storage conditions.\u201d 12. These general comments concerning the integration of stabilization activities with other departmental activities and the revision of the implementation plan are addressed under the heading \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d at the end of chapter 2. 13. This comment concerning the stabilization work that may be done by May 2002 is addressed in the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of chapter 2. 14. We added a footnote to the report quoting DOE\u2019s point that \u201cIt must be acknowledged that even after stabilization and packaging, some small level of risk remains associated with handling and storage of plutonium materials.\u201d In addition, we revised the report to clarify that delays result in continuing the existing level of risk to workers\u2019 health and safety by delaying the risk reduction that is achieved by stabilization and packaging activities. 15. We revised the report to clarify that the interim storage criteria do not provide the level of safety afforded by DOE Standard 3013 and explicitly attributed the comments about the continuing risk to workers\u2019 health and safety to DOE site officials and a Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board staff member. 16. We did not revise the report because the Department did not provide support for the statement that the \u201csafety significance\u201d of the delay at Hanford is \u201cmanageable.\u201d 17. To reflect this information about future funding at Hanford, we added the following to the report: \u201cIn commenting on a draft of this report, the Department stated that questions remain about how plutonium stabilization work will be prioritized by the site. The Department believes that if the risk is determined to be high enough, funds will be provided.\u201d 18. We added a footnote to the report that reads, \u201cSome low-risk residues with low plutonium content do not have to be converted through either technology as they can be disposed of in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant when it becomes available.\u201d In addition, we revised a later footnote to reflect this information. 19. We revised the report to read, \u201cDOE is currently assessing the possible environmental impacts of several likely sites where plutonium disposition activities may take place and plans to have a final decision in late 1998 or early 1999.\u201d We further revised the report to indicate that there are technical, institutional, and cost uncertainties and that the uncertainties cited are examples, not an all-inclusive list. 20. The Department comments that a more recent draft of the disposition criteria, dated December 1997, has been issued. However, we were not able to include the details of this draft because it was not available at the time of our review. 21. We revised the report to remove the issue of stabilization temperatures because the Office of Fissile Materials Disposition is planning to address this issue through an additional processing step. However, there are still issues to be resolved regarding differences between the draft disposition criteria and the current standard for plutonium storage. Therefore, on the basis of DOE\u2019s comments, we included examples of the differences between the information that would be required by the draft disposition criteria and the information currently required by DOE Standard 3013 for long-term storage. Finally, we did not revise the report to address the effort by the Office of Environmental Management to develop a new standard, as this initiative is still in its preliminary stages. 22. The statements about delays in meeting implementation plan milestones are not our conclusions, but the comments of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (and are cited as such in the report). Therefore, we did not revise the report. 23. On the basis of further discussions with DOE officials, we revised the report to read, \u201cWorkers at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities must be protected from plutonium because exposure to small quantities is dangerous to human health, and if not safely contained and managed, plutonium can be unstable and can even spontaneously ignite under certain conditions.\u201d 24. In further discussions with DOE officials, they stated that these comments were informational and that the Department did not require any change to the report. 25. We revised the report on the basis of a further discussion with DOE officials concerning the dangers of plutonium. During this discussion, the officials agreed that the Department\u2019s concerns would be addressed if we deleted the word \u201cextremely\u201d from the report. 26. We revised the report as suggested, changing the referenced date to \u201c1997.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division", "paragraphs": ["Lisa P.
