Recently, the United States has used much larger numbers of combat and support forces to respond to events in a number of locations, including Somalia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, and Iraq. (See  table 1.1) For example, while the United States has approximately 1,100 military personnel committed to the Multinational Force and Observers for the 12-year operation on the Sinai Peninsula, starting in December 1992 it deployed approximately 26,000 to Somalia and approximately 20,000 to Haiti beginning in September 1994.", "While U.S. participation in peace operations has increased, the size of the armed forces has declined over the past 8 years.

We did not assess whether the United States should participate in peace operations. We examined (1) the impact that peace operations have on U.S. military forces, (2) force structure limitations that may affect the military\u2019s ability to respond to other national security requirements while engaged in peace operations, and (3) options for increasing force flexibility and response capability.", "To determine the impact of peace operations on U.S. military forces, we held discussions with personnel who participated in recent peace operations. We also reviewed after-action reports and situation reports and conferred with service, unified command, and Office of the Secretary of Defense officials to identify the units involved, their level of participation, the types of capabilities provided, and the problems encountered in providing these capabilities.

However, we focused our efforts primarily on Operation Restore Hope, the largest Army peace operation deployment to date. We also reviewed the plans for employment of Army forces in Bosnia should a peace plan be implemented. The operations in Rwanda and Haiti took place after we completed the bulk of our work, so we were not able to fully address them.", "As a means of determining the effects of peace operations on the Air Force, we selected four of the specialized U.S.-based platforms identified by the Air Force as most affected by participation in peace operations, reviewed data concerning their participation, and interviewed aircrew and maintenance personnel involved in the missions. Similarly, we analyzed data and met with military personnel concerning heavily tasked Air Force units based in Europe. We concentrated our efforts on peace operations involving relatively large numbers of Air Force units, such as Operations Provide Comfort in Northern Iraq, Southern Watch in Southern Iraq, and Provide Promise and Deny Flight in Bosnia.", "For the Navy, we compared pre-Desert Storm Sixth Fleet aircraft carrier deployments in the Mediterranean area with current Sixth Fleet deployments where the U.S. Navy is supporting Operations Deny Flight and Sharp Guard.

Most of these support capabilities are in the reserves and, for the most part, the reserves have not been activated for use in peace operations. The adverse impact on these support forces has been further exacerbated because the Army frequently borrows people from one unit to supplement another that lacks sufficient personnel to deploy and assigns some personnel to the same operation more than once, or to consecutive operations, because of the high demand for their capability.", "In the Air Force, peace operations have placed considerable stress on the relatively limited number of forces providing specialized capabilities and on forward-deployed units in the European theater. The increased flying hours necessary to support these operations have resulted in extended temporary duty in excess of established goals, increased aircraft maintenance, cannibalization of home station aircraft, and missed training.", "Peace operations have not been as disruptive to the Navy and the Marine Corps. However, forward-deployed naval forces have experienced increased operating tempo and, in some cases, reduced time to prepare for deployments, both of which have limited the forces\u2019 availability for training. Naval officials point out, however, that in many cases, peace operations have exposed the naval services to unique experiences in joint and coalition operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Certain Army Support Forces in the Active Component Bear Heavy Burden", "paragraphs": ["Certain kinds of Army combat support and combat service support capabilities, including quartermaster and transportation companies, are critical in peace operations. The need to establish and provide continued infrastructure support for U.S. military forces, coalition forces, and the local population is the key reason support forces are needed in peace operations. The type and amount of support differs with each operation, depending on the mission and the nature of the operating environment. Peace operations often occur in austere locations where there is limited electric power, roads, water, port facilities, and air fields. As such, support forces have played an important role in establishing and sustaining a working infrastructure, not only for U.S. forces but also for coalition forces and the local population. In Somalia, for example, the Army encountered an environment completely devoid of any useful infrastructure and had to refurbish or build even the most basic of facilities. If nation building is part of the military mission, support forces are additionally burdened with tasks such as building schools, hospitals, and local housing and establishing police and other civil administration services.", "Operational and environmental challenges further tax support forces. In Somalia, for example, the area of responsibility for U.S. and coalition forces consisted of approximately 21,000 square miles in the southern half of the country, with U.S. military and coalition forces dispersed over considerable distances throughout the country. As shown in figure 2.1, Mogadishu is more than 200 miles from Kismayo (a key Army location) and about 200 miles from the Marine base in Bardera, which in turn is about 200 miles from Kismayo. Support forces had to frequently move between these locations to deliver food, water, fuel, and other supplies. To the extent possible, decentralized support operations were established at various locations throughout the country to reduce the time spent moving between locations. In some cases, however, this posed even greater stress on support forces because they had to divide already limited support assets. For example, the 10th Mountain Division\u2019s 710th Main Support Battalion divided some of its water teams so that they could provide water purification capabilities at additional locations.", "Combat forces also have played a significant role in peace operations. However, because more of these forces are in the active component, a larger number of them have been available for peace operations.

Yet, most of these support capabilities are in the reserves and, except for volunteers, the Army has been authorized to draw on reserves for peace operations only once\u2014in September 1994 for the operation in Haiti. Without a presidential decision to call up reserve forces, the Army has had to draw upon the smaller number of active forces and reserve volunteers to meet support requirements. In some cases, nearly all the active units for a particular support capability deployed to a peace operation. For example, 75 percent of the petroleum supply companies in the active force structure deployed to Somalia. Similarly, 67 percent of the medium petroleum truck companies and 100 percent of the air terminal movement control teams deployed to Somalia. Table 2.1 provides a list of selected Army capabilities within quartermaster, transportation, engineering, and miscellaneous support units that experienced heavy deployments to Somalia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Cross-Leveling and Multiple Rotation Practices Tax the Already Overextended Support Forces", "paragraphs": ["To prioritize scarce resources, many of the Army\u2019s active support units are assigned fewer people in peacetime than are required to perform their wartime missions. If the Army\u2019s early-deploying support units were needed for war, the Army would supplement the units with people and equipment from other active and reserve units. After the Army restructured its forces in the mid-1980s, we reported that its goal was to authorize combat units, which are the chief means of deterrence, to be staffed at 100 percent of their wartime requirements and support units to be staffed at an average of 90 percent of their wartime requirements. In discussions with XVIIIth Airborne Corps officials, the most ready and resourced of all the Army corps, we were advised that units deploying to Somalia needed 100 percent or more of their authorized people and equipment in order to meet operational requirements. Most units did not have the people, and many did not have the equipment to satisfy this requirement. For example, almost half of the XVIIIth Airborne Corps\u2019 First Corps Support Command units were authorized 90 percent or less of their authorized people, and several support units were authorized 80 percent or less of their authorized people. Other corps support commands, such as the Third Corps\u2019, which provided initial corps support for operations in Somalia, are resourced at an even lower level than the XVIIIth Airborne Corps.", "The Army supplemented the personnel-deficient units deploying to Somalia by borrowing from other units throughout the Army force structure. This practice is known as \u201ccross-leveling.\u201d Cross-leveling has occurred at both the division and corps level. For instance, the 210th Forward Support Battalion, an element of the 10th Mountain Division, took people and equipment from the Division\u2019s 46th Forward Support Battalion and the 710th Main Support Battalion before deploying to Somalia. The 710th Main Support Battalion also supported the  46th Forward Support Battalion\u2019s deployment, thereby creating a domino effect within the 10th Mountain Division. According to the 710th commander, the battalion deployed with fewer than all its people and equipment. Thus, the remaining people were burdened to make do with less.", "People from some units rotated more than once to the same peace operation or deployed to consecutive peace operations and/or participated in domestic relief operations because of the high demand for their particular capability. For example, almost all of the people from the XVIIIth Airborne Corps\u2019 364th Direct Support Supply Company that deployed to Hurricane Andrew also deployed to Somalia within the next year. Other units within the XVIIIth Airborne Corps had similar experiences. According to Army officials, support personnel from other Army units rotated more than once to Somalia. The 10th Mountain Division, which responded to the Hurricane Andrew relief operation and to Operation Provide Hope in Somalia, also deployed to Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in September 1994 to provide the predominant Army force in support of this peace operation. According to Army officials, approximately 40 percent of the participants in the Haiti operation also participated in the Somalia operation less than 1 year ago.", "Cross-leveling and frequent deployments in turn affect the ability of a unit\u2019s non-deployed elements to meet their operational responsibilities. A combat support group headquarters has considerable responsibility, particularly as part of the XVIIIth Airborne Corps. When the approximately 150 of 180 military personnel from the XVIIIth Airborne Corps\u2019s 507th Combat Support Group Headquarters deployed to Somalia for several months, they left approximately 30 headquarters personnel at Fort Bragg, along with the group\u2019s three battalions, without any additional augmentation. The headquarters was still responsible for (1) supporting the group\u2019s three battalions, (2) supporting the Multinational Force and Observers rotation, (3) conducting logistics operations missions on the installation, and (4) preparing quarterly training briefs to XVIIIth Airborne Corps. In addition, several of the remaining personnel had to participate in two emergency deployment and redeployment exercises and conduct testing and a major briefing for the Army Chief of Staff. In order to cope with the absence of so many headquarter personnel, many operational requirements were decentralized to the battalion level. In some cases, remaining headquarter personnel (1) took on responsibilities typically assigned to more senior personnel, and (2) doubled and tripled workloads throughout the deployment period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reserve Forces Contain Key Support Capabilities, but They Have Not Often Been Activated for Peace Operations", "paragraphs": ["Until recently, the President has elected not to activate reserve personnel for use in peace operations.

While Army volunteers have been helpful, the volunteers available are not always the ones with the specific capabilities, equipment, and training required for the peace operation. Furthermore, individual volunteers do not meet the Army\u2019s requirement for units, in which a group of individuals are trained and organized to perform a mission as a cohesive entity. For example, when Army planners needed a postal unit for operations in Somalia, they created a unit from available volunteers. This process proved to be time-consuming, taking 1 month to create a 49-person postal unit.", "The recent initiative for using reserve volunteers for the peacekeeping operations in the Sinai has been time-consuming due to planning and procedural processes associated with activating approximately 420 reserve personnel. The reserve volunteers will be ready to deploy to the Sinai by January 1995 after completing 3 to 6 months of training. More senior personnel will train longer. While there has been no shortage of volunteers for the current deployment, Army officials are concerned that they will not be able to recruit enough volunteers to continue this on an annual basis.

In September 1994, 40 percent of the military police combat support companies stationed in the United States were deployed to Guantanamo Bay supporting the Cuban and Haitian refugee operation. Three other companies were deployed to Suriname, Honduras, and Panama, leaving just 13 companies to patrol nine installations in the United States. According to an Army official, this is a problem because many installations require more than one military police combat support company for patrol duties. Because the increase in military police deployments, mostly due to the refugee crisis, has exceeded the number available in the Army\u2019s force structure, Army infantry units have been used to help meet military police deployment requirements. For example, upon completion of their rotation to Guantanamo Bay, military police companies will return home while rifle companies rotate to Cuba.", "According to an Army official, while rifle companies will undergo 2 weeks of training to perform the military police function, the training will not provide them with the full breadth of skills that military police possess.", "The Army will continue to face challenges in responding to sizable peace operations if reserve forces are not activated. The need for reserve activation depends on a variety of factors, such as the size of a peace operation and the number of such operations ongoing at one time. For example, Army officials stated that if the United States participates in enforcing a peace agreement in Bosnia, with an Army deployment of approximately 22,000 soldiers, access to the reserve component could be required for the second 6-month rotation because the large support requirement exceeds the number of active forces available in certain support capabilities. According to Army officials, reserve forces would also likely be required if a number of smaller size peace operations were ongoing at one time.", "On September 15, 1994, the President authorized the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation to call to active duty about 1,900 Selected Reserve military personnel in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard to support operational missions in Haiti.

According to Air Force officials, although all the squadrons\u2019 aircraft were not involved in the operation at any one time, peace operations affect entire squadrons because they are structured to fight in place or deploy as a whole unit rather than in smaller packages.", "Recent peace operations in the European theater have also placed a heavy demand on USAFE\u2019s C-130 Hercules, which provides intra-theater airlift capabilities. The Air Force has only one active C-130 squadron in the European force structure, and almost the entire squadron\u201417 of 19 aircraft\u2014has been participating in peace operations in the European theater. Operation Provide Promise\u2019s missions into Bosnia have required the heaviest use of C-130 assets. The squadron\u2019s capabilities were supplemented by reserve aircraft from the United States; nevertheless, the squadron had to curtail training in certain skill areas in order to fly scheduled airlift missions between bases to deliver supplies and participate in Operation Provide Promise.", "USAFE, which had primary responsibility for responding to these operations since they have occurred within its area of responsibility, met operational requirements with its own forces as much as possible. This is traditional Air Force practice. Where USAFE did not have the necessary assets (such as the E-3 AWACS) or had shortfalls (such as in C-130s), it sought augmentation from outside Europe. To the extent other USAFE assets could have been augmented with active-duty units from the United States, such as in the case of the F-15E aircraft, some of the adverse impact of participation in these peace operations might have been mitigated. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD noted that the Air Force has recognized these challenges and is addressing them by relying more on active, reserve, and Guard units based in the continental United States, which have deployed to Operations Provide Comfort and Deny Flight to relieve some of the operational burden."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Split Operations Create Logistics and Personnel Challenges for Squadrons Supporting Peace Operations", "paragraphs": ["Deploying to peace operations from bases in Europe or the United States has created planning and logistics challenges for the Air Force because essential unit equipment and personnel have to be shared by the forces at the home base and in the deployed location. These split operations have had a significant impact on home bases, which sometimes have had to make due with a reduced number of maintenance and operational personnel and essential unit equipment to ensure that the deployed forces maintain a high state of readiness. Even if a squadron deploys less than half of its aircraft, the effect on the home base is still significant because key operations and maintenance personnel and equipment must deploy to support the aircraft. According to Air Force officials, split operations challenges exist because Air Force squadrons are still structured to fight in place or deploy as a whole unit rather than in smaller packages as they are doing for peace operations. According to squadron personnel, split operations impede squadron-wide communication processes and long-term squadron planning, and tax senior squadron leaders who often have to perform the jobs of their absent colleagues in addition to their own. According to one squadron commander, it is difficult to plan the future vision for the squadron because the squadron\u2019s senior leaders are geographically separated.", "Split operations create other personnel challenges as well. Operations and maintenance personnel rotate between the home station and the peace operation. For example, according to USAFE officials, aircrews from USAFE\u2019s A-10 squadron deploy to Operation Deny Flight for an average of 6 to 9 weeks and remain at the home station for varying periods of 2, 5, or 7 weeks. Maintenance personnel remain deployed for 90 days. While at home station, personnel must train and attend to squadron administrative responsibilities. According to the squadron commander, this allows personnel minimal time for leave and attending to family responsibilities before rotating again to the peace operation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Squadrons Often Have to Forego Necessary Training Because of Peace Operation Demands", "paragraphs": ["Many USAFE squadrons participating in peace operations on a sustained basis have found it difficult to attend major training exercises at the same time they are participating in a peace operation. According to squadron and wing officials we talked with, the squadrons do not have enough people or equipment to support the peace operation, home station requirements, and the training exercise concurrently. Because of their participation in peace operations, both of USAFE\u2019s F-15E squadrons have had to reduce their level of involvement or cancel their participation altogether in training exercises. For example, the squadrons were not able to participate in major tactical air combat exercises, such as Maple Flag, a Canadian exercise similar to Red Flag, which would have provided them with realistic combat training. This type of training is particularly important for these F-15E squadrons since they were established in 1993 and have not had the opportunity to participate in a major tactical air combat exercise.", "While USAFE squadrons have not deployed all their forces to peace operations, the forces remaining at the home station often find it difficult to maintain enough aircraft to conduct home station training. For example, beginning with its initial deployment in July 1993, USAFE\u2019s only A-10 squadron provided 12 of its 21 aircraft on hand to support Operation Deny Flight. Of the remaining nine, two were undergoing phase maintenance inspections at the home station; one was undergoing depot repair; and one was used for spare parts in support of forward-deployed aircraft. Thus, only five of the remaining aircraft were available for pilot training sorties at the home station. Because of the limited number of available aircraft, the remaining aircrews were only able to fly the minimum number of hours needed to maintain mission-ready status. On the occasions when an additional aircraft had to be dedicated to Operation Deny Flight, the squadron did not have enough aircraft available to meet training needs. According to squadron officials, this was also true for USAFE F-15E, F-15C, F-16, and C-130 aircrews.", "The Commander of USAFE\u2019s A-10 squadron identified four training events that could not be accomplished at Operation Deny Flight because of various restrictions in the operating theater. These events also were difficult to accomplish at home station because of environmental and other restrictions on low-level flight (below 500 feet), target marking, full scale-weapons delivery, and certain types of approaches. Had the squadron not been participating continuously in Operation Deny Flight, it would have had the opportunity to deploy elsewhere for this training.", "As is the case with certain U.S.-based squadrons, aircrews from Europe-based squadrons participating in peace operations have also had to obtain waivers for training requirements they were not able to satisfy during the last training cycle. According to the squadron and wing officials we interviewed at home stations and deployed locations, pilot proficiency in a low-threat environment is at an all-time high due to the nature of the missions over Bosnia and Northern Iraq. However, proficiency in high-threat, low-altitude mission profiles has suffered and will continue to suffer as long as training opportunities and peace operation mission taskings remain at their present levels. As shown in table 2.4, for example, all of the aircrews in USAFE\u2019s two F-15E squadrons obtained waivers for one or more training events they were not able to accomplish during the 6-month training cycle ending June 30, 1994. Aircrews received waivers in areas such as Night Weapons Delivery, Air Combat Maneuvers, Air Combat Tactics, and Basic Fighter Maneuvers.", "As mentioned earlier, USAFE\u2019s only C-130 squadron had to curtail training in order to meet its peace operation and normal operational requirements. However, after March 1994, its operational requirements for Operation Provide Promise declined significantly. As a result, C-130 aircrew did not require training waivers for the training cycle ending June 30, 1994. At the height of Operation Provide Promise, squadron aircrew required training waivers for two consecutive periods ending June 30 and December 31, 1993. For these training cycles, 42 and 52 percent of squadron cockpit crew required 102 and 127 training waivers, respectively. Squadron aircrew received training waivers in critical areas such as night vision profiles and assault approaches.", "In September 1994, the newly appointed USAFE Commander acknowledged that USAFE units were having difficulty accomplishing their training tasks because they are supporting peace operations. He noted that operations such as Deny Flight and Provide Comfort are competing for combat training time and causing combat skills to atrophy. According to the Commander, fighter pilots need to practice intercepts, bomb dropping, and air-to-air combat, yet they do not typically get this experience during the course of a peace operation. He stressed that USAFE can no longer continue to accept degraded levels of training. As noted earlier in this chapter, the Air Force is now relying more on active, reserve, and Guard units based in the continental United States to relieve some of the operational burden."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reserves Provide Operational Relief to Certain Forces in the Active Component", "paragraphs": ["Air Force reserve volunteer participation in peace operations has more than doubled since fiscal year 1991. Reserve forces have participated in such major operations as Restore Hope, Provide Comfort, Provide Hope, and Southern Watch, as well as other smaller international peace operations and domestic disaster relief operations. In some cases, reserves have been needed to meet mission requirements that active forces were unable to fulfill. For example, since there is only one F-4G squadron in the active component and it is participating in Operation Provide Comfort and Southern Watch, reserve F-4Gs have had to provide augmentation to Operation Southern Watch. In particular, the 190th Air National Guard Fighter Squadron deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Southern Watch in December 1993, within a year of returning from another Southern Watch deployment. According to squadron officials, the 190th Fighter Squadron was deployed 12 out of 18 months during this time period.", "In other cases, reserve volunteers have provided operational relief to active forces. For example, from November 15, 1993, to January 15, 1994, and again during the summer of 1994, reserve A-10 personnel and aircraft from the United States relieved USAFE\u2019s A-10 squadron so that its personnel could attend scheduled training at Nellis Air Force Base. Operational relief for other USAFE aircraft was provided by F-16, KC-135, C-141, and C-5 reserve aircraft from the United States. In addition to providing this operational relief, reserve forces still have had to meet most of their individual and unit training; attend exercises; and satisfy other operational responsibilities for local, state, and federal agencies, such as providing assistance in weather reconnaissance, disaster relief, aeromedical evacuations, and counternarcotics.", "The majority of C-130s are in the reserves. Given Operation Provide Promise\u2019s extensive C-130 requirements and USAFE\u2019s relatively small number of C-130s, reserve aircraft and personnel were looked to for meeting mission requirements. Initially, reserve aircraft and personnel augmented USAFE\u2019s only C-130 squadron. However, in January 1994, because an increasing number of U.S.-based aircraft and personnel were needed, the Air Force formed another squadron, known as the Delta squadron. This squadron consisted of reserve and active C-130 aircraft and personnel that operated out of Germany. Aircrew and maintenance personnel rotated every 2 to 3 weeks. The reserve deployments allowed the active component C-130 squadron in Europe to reduce its flying hours and subsequently increase its mission capable rates. As of May 1994, volunteer Air Force reservists flew approximately 62 percent of the airlift sorties in support of Operation Provide Promise. However, while reservists generally are willing to participate in these operations, Air Force Reserve and National Guard officials noted that this level of reserve participation in peace operations is affecting the willingness of reserves to volunteer for exercises.

The peacetime role of forward-deployed carrier battle groups and amphibious task forces covers the spectrum of military involvement\u2014from single-ship port visits, maritime interdiction and blockades, humanitarian relief missions, and emergency evacuation of U.S. nationals, to major amphibious operations.", "According to naval officials, in attempting to meet both the requirements of peace operations and normal peacetime presence commitments, naval forces have exceeded established operating tempo standards for forward-deployed forces in the Central Command, European Command, and Pacific Command areas of operation. The officials indicated that this was due in part to participation in peace operations involving Bosnia, Iraq, and Somalia and in part to the reduction in force structure and forward-deployed forces available to respond to the same or greater number of operational commitments. While the Navy and Marine Corps have tried not to extend deployments beyond 6 months, the operating tempo has increased during deployments. This is reflected, for example, by an increased number of steaming days incurred by Navy aircraft carriers operating in the Mediterranean and adjoining seas in 1993 versus 1989 (the year before Operation Desert Shield)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participation in Peace Operations Affects Training of Naval Forces", "paragraphs": ["Sustained commitments to particular peace operations, such as Operations Sharp Guard and Deny Flight in Europe and Operation Southern Watch in Southwest Asia, require a sustained presence of surface ships and an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea and Arabian Gulf. This often reduces U.S. naval participation in certain exercises and training. For example, in written responses to our questions the Navy stated that several exercises have been canceled in the European and Central Commands\u2019 areas of operation, severely limiting training in anti-submarine warfare, amphibious operations, and command and control. These capabilities would be needed in a major regional conflict. Table 2.5 compares Sixth Fleet aircraft carrier deployments in 1989 and 1993 and shows a decrease in the number of days devoted to training exercises and an increase in the number of days devoted to all other operations.", "Postponed or canceled training has not always had a negative effect on naval forces, however. Naval officials stress that peace operations provide unique opportunities for realistic joint and coalition experience and in many cases may be better than exercises. For example, naval forces may receive better training by participating in a multilateral peace operation involving maritime and air interdiction, such as Operations Sharp Guard and Deny Flight in Europe, than by participating in a scheduled exercise with one or two other nations. Similarly, Marine support forces in Somalia obtained valuable experience building infrastructure and providing other logistical support to U.S. and coalition forces.", "If naval forces are pulled out of training required before a major deployment, they have to compress their training period and then work longer hours to catch up when they return to port. Some of the ships that have participated in the Haiti operation were taken out of single-ship basic training, such as damage control drills. The Navy considers interrupting this training less damaging to overall mission effectiveness than taking ships out of intermediate or advanced training that requires operating with more than one unit. Much of the basic training can be done at sea, even while a ship is participating in an operation. As more ships were dedicated to support Cuban migrant interdiction, however, training opportunities decreased because more of a ship\u2019s crew was involved in migrant sighting, recovery, screening, care, and feeding. When the ships return to port, therefore, they have to perform in-port maintenance, training, and many administrative and operational inspections simultaneously to remain on schedule for their next major 6-month deployment. This has resulted in crewmen working longer hours and has left less time for them to spend with their families prior to a major deployment.", "Naval officials also told us that peace operations are resulting in reduced intermediate training, such as that at instrumented ranges for missile and gun shoots. U.S. European Command officials noted that naval aviators participating in these operations are experiencing many of the same challenges as the Air Force in terms of training and operational tempo.", "Participation in sustained peace operations and a reduction in forward-deployed forces has also contributed to reduced U.S. naval presence in certain geographic areas where U.S. forces had been able to visit on past deployments. Among the results has been a reduced level of participation in bilateral exercises and training with countries that may not be participating in peace operations and fewer port visits and military-to-military exchanges. Quantifying the effects of this reduction in presence is difficult since the political and diplomatic factors at issue are somewhat intangible. Naval officials have noted, however, that some nations dedicate considerable resources preparing for the opportunity to participate in an exercise with the U.S. Navy. When exercises are canceled, countries do not get the experience operating with technologically superior U.S. systems and therefore may not be capable of doing so in the future should the need arise.", "Table 2.5 also shows the decrease in the number of days aircraft carriers spent in port during Sixth Fleet Mediterranean deployments in 1989 and 1993. The reduced number of days in port has affected the Navy\u2019s ability to conduct intermediate maintenance on its ships and equipment. According to U.S. Navy officials in Europe, there has been a 20-percent reduction in the Navy\u2019s ability to conduct intermediate maintenance in this theater, which requires time in port. They are concerned that continued delays in conducting intermediate maintenance may degrade equipment readiness and service life, particularly since peace operations tend to expose equipment to more wear and tear than would be expected during normal peacetime operations.", "According to the Navy, its participation in peace operations has not, thus far, had a harmful impact on its ability to perform other more traditional missions. Thus, naval units have been able to meet a variety of demands by moving within or across command boundaries\u2014such as between the European and Central Commands\u2014in response to emerging crises. The Navy has generally been able to maintain its policy mandating that deployments not exceed 6 months and that the period between deployments be twice as long as the last deployment. The Navy had to break this policy in some cases, however, so that ships could be made available to support Somalia operations. While in 1993 there were 5 of these cases, through September 1994 the Navy had 15 cases in which it had to break this policy. According to the Navy, the 1994 cases were due chiefly to operational requirements regarding Somalia, Haiti, Cuba, and counter-drug missions. The Marine Corps faces similar challenges. For example, a Marine Expeditionary Unit that returned on June 23, 1994, from a 6-month deployment, including 3 months off the coast of Somalia, was sent back to sea in less than 3 weeks to support U.S. operations off the coast of Haiti.", "According to service officials, the Navy and Marine Corps have not found it necessary to rely upon volunteer reserve forces in peace operations to the same degree as the Army and Air Force. Naval forces are structured for daily peacetime forward presence operations that require a complete range of combat forces and capabilities be readily available for immediate response. As a result, the majority of these forces and capabilities are in the active component. The function of the Navy and Marine Corps reserve is to augment the active component forces. Nevertheless, there are certain capabilities that reside exclusively, or nearly so, in the Naval Reserve and are essential to many peace operations. These capabilities include units and individuals involved in cargo handling, Navy air logistics, medical fleet hospitals, and mobil construction battalions. Recent Navy support to peace operations has included the Naval Reserve in search and rescue and maritime patrol support for Operations Deny Flight and Sharp Guard, as well as construction support for operations in Somalia.

Discussions with service officials and review of data concerning the types and number of forces committed to peace operations indicate that disengagement from one or more sizable peace operations and redeployment of forces to a MRC on short notice could be difficult.", "Obtaining sufficient airlift would be one of the primary challenges encountered in redeploying forces from one or more peace operations to a MRC. In order to redeploy ground personnel and equipment from the peace operations, the already limited number of airlift assets flying from the United States to the MRC would have to divert to the peace operation, in some cases pick up personnel and equipment, and take them to the MRC. The Air Force has not yet fully studied the implication of such a redeployment and hence could not quantify the impact of this delay on the Air Force\u2019s ability to meet MRC deployment requirements. Air Force officials did say that it would make a difficult situation even worse. According to Air Force officials, the Air Force\u2019s tactical forces would also encounter an airlift problem in moving from a peace operation to a MRC. While aircraft and aircrews could easily fly from one operation to another, the maintenance and logistics support needed to keep the aircraft flying\u2014supplies, equipment, and personnel\u2014would have to wait for available airlift.", "Another challenge that would be encountered is that certain Army contingency support forces (such as port handlers, air and sea movement control personnel, and petroleum handlers) needed in the early days of a MRC, would still be needed within the peace operation theater to facilitate the disengagement and redeployment. As a result of our analysis comparing the support capabilities needed in the first 30 days of a MRC with the contingency support capabilities deployed to Somalia, we found that in some cases 100 percent of some of these active component support forces were used in the Somalia peace operation. Had a MRC arisen during this time, immediate access to reserve component forces would have been necessary. According to DOD officials, the Army has recognized this as a challenge and is currently examining this issue as part of the Total Army Analysis 2003, which it expects to complete in mid-1995.", "According to Navy officials, the response of Navy ships to a MRC would depend more on their overall distance to the crisis location than on the operations they were currently conducting. With some peace operations, however, Navy ships may not be directed to disengage quickly and move to a MRC. A senior Navy official noted, for example, that it took approximately 7 months to resolve a crisis in Liberia in 1990-91 and until that time the amphibious ready group was not directed to participate in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm.", "Each service faces challenges with reconstituting its forces in terms of training, equipment, and supplies in order to deploy directly to a MRC. Army officials have expressed some concern that participating in peace operations may degrade combat unit readiness for combat operations because of the inability to practice certain individual and collective wartime skills. In Somalia, for example, while the combat forces received extensive experience in military operations conducted in an urban environment, they were not able to practice collective training skills. According to 10th Mountain Division officials, in some cases it took approximately 3 to 6 months to bring these skills back to a level acceptable for combat operations once they returned from Somalia. Army officials also noted that while peace operations offered the opportunity to practice and enhance logistic skills, logistics training provided in Somalia did not substitute completely for the training that would result from a prepared training exercise, such as those at the National Training Center. In the latter, the support forces would work with combat forces as they would in high-intensity combat operations. Marine Corps ground forces had similar experiences in Somalia.", "According to Air Force officials, peace operations tend to degrade the overall combat readiness of Air Force flight crews that participate in these operations on a sustained basis because they often restrict night and low-level flight operations and do not provide experience in other combat skills such as night intercept maneuvers. Similarly, naval aviators find that they lose proficiency in some combat skills, such as air combat maneuvering, through prolonged participation in peace operations. As with the Air Force, naval aviators who participate in these operations on a sustained basis are not as able to get to combat ranges where they can practice their full breadth of combat capabilities.", "The reconstitution of equipment used in peace operations may also hinder a timely disengagement and redeployment to a MRC. The extensive use of certain equipment, combined with the harsh environmental effects encountered in certain peace operations, has required extensive maintenance before the equipment can be used again. For example, upon their return from Somalia, the 10th Mountain Division\u2019s AH-60 helicopters had to enter depot level maintenance as a result of the harsh desert environment and the extensive use of these helicopters in Somalia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD disagrees with our conclusion that participation in peace operations could impede the timely response of U.S. forces to MRCs.

Our conclusions in this regard focus on certain critical capabilities that exist in limited numbers, specifically certain Army support units and certain Air Force aircraft. We reached our conclusions through analysis of how these capabilities have been used in peace operations and past conflicts and their planned use in future conflicts. We agree that most combat forces would be readily available to respond to a MRC.", "In its comments DOD states that, on the basis of the recent response of U.S. forces to the possibility of Iraqi aggression against Kuwait while U.S. forces were engaged in Haiti, it does not see any evidence that significant support unit shortfalls exist.

Second, airlift assets would have to be diverted to pick up personnel and equipment from the peace operation. Finally, some of the forces would need training, supplies, and equipment before deploying to another major operation.", "Forces with capabilities that exist in limited numbers in the active Army and would be needed in the early stages of a MRC have been used repeatedly in peace operations. Similar-type units that are not engaged in peace operations may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to MRCs because they are assigned fewer people than authorized and they may have loaned some people to the units engaged in the peace operations, which exacerbates an already difficult situation.", "Specialized aircraft that exist in limited numbers in the active force structure and their crews are also being used more frequently in peace operations. The Air Force anticipates needing almost all its specialized aircraft in the early days of a MRC.", "Some forces in each service are missing training and exercises that affect their overall combat readiness and their ability to redeploy directly to a MRC. Numerous waivers have been issued for aircrews that have not been able to complete required training due to the demands of peace operations. Naval forces involved in peace operations are spending almost all their time at sea conducting operations and so have been unable to participate in some exercises and training.", "Peace operations are also likely to have a long-term impact on the people who participate in them although it is difficult to quantify that impact. In 1994 personnel for specialized aircraft have approached the Air Force\u2019s recommended maximum number of temporary duty days away from home station in a year\u2014120. In the case of the F-4Gs, squadron personnel are likely to exceed the recommended maximum by 50 percent. There are reports that increased temporary duty days for Air Force personnel are affecting their morale and their families and that it is contributing to increased instances of divorce and decisions to leave the Air Force. Naval personnel, unable to perform as much maintenance, training, and operational inspections while at sea, are working longer hours in port and have less time for their families prior to a major deployment.", "A June 1994 Defense Science Board Report on Readiness notes that the amount of time individuals are away from home has been affected by, among other things, the rapid force drawdown and a higher level of contingency operations.

At present, the Army has placed many support functions in the reserve component. For example, many units that open and operate ports overseas are in the reserve component. This capability was placed in the reserve component during the Cold War, and DOD expected that when forces were needed in wartime it would be able to quickly access and deploy these reserve forces. However, many of these forces that are in the active component have been required in peace operations because the Army has not been authorized to involuntarily access reserve units in most peace operations. While the Army maintains limited numbers of certain types of support capability on active duty, it maintains substantial combat capability in the active component. More support forces could be made available for peace operations if the Army maintained fewer combat forces and redirected those resources to maintaining more support forces. According to Army officials, this is one of the issues that is being examined as part of the Total Army Analysis, which should be completed by mid-1995.", "Alternatively, DOD may be able to increase the number of combat and combat service support forces without decreasing the number of combat forces by making more use of civilian employees. We recently reported that the services use thousands of military personnel in support functions, such as personnel management and data processing, that are typically performed by civilian personnel and do not require skills gained from military experience.

The reserves were not activated for the operations in Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989, or Somalia in 1992. According to senior Army officials, a request went from the Army to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for involuntary access to reserves for Somalia. The request ultimately was never presented to the President. An April 1994 DOD report on accessibility of reserve forces notes that using PSRC authority would raise sensitive domestic and foreign policy concerns that require time to resolve before the President could be expected to decide on when large numbers of reservists should be ordered to active duty.", "Prior to the Haiti intervention, DOD had stated in its April 1994 report on accessibility of reserve forces that the decision to not invoke PSRC in Grenada, Panama, and Somalia supported the perception that PSRC has evolved into a de facto mobilization authority.", "As DOD\u2019s report on the reserves notes, gaining involuntary access to reserve personnel for any mission is a sensitive matter. A reserve call-up has the potential to disrupt the lives of reservists, their families, and their employers or customers. According to DOD, the assumption of many reservists is that reservists would be called up for service only when vital interests of the United States are threatened. This is based on Cold War experiences and certain post-Cold War contingencies such as Desert Storm. U.S. Army Reserve Command officials advised us of their concern that involuntary use of the reserves for peace operations would be disruptive to reservists\u2019 lives and ultimately could affect the willingness of Americans to join the reserves.", "The Office of Reserve Affairs, within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, is examining the limits and impediments to volunteerism and how to expand their use.
