Since it began operations in 2003, DHS employees have reported having low job satisfaction. DHS employee concerns about job satisfaction are one example of the challenges the department faces implementing its missions. GAO has designated the implementation and transformation of DHS as a high risk area, including its management of human capital, because it represents an enormous and complex undertaking that will require time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner. GAO was asked to examine: (1) how DHS's employee morale compared with that of other federal employees, and (2) the extent to which DHS and selected components have determined the root causes of employee morale, and developed action plans to improve morale. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed survey evaluations, focus group reports, and DHS and component action planning documents, and interviewed officials from DHS and four components, selected based on workforce size, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees reported having lower average morale than the average for the rest of the federal government, but morale varied across components and employee groups within the department. Data from the 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS)--a tool that measures employees' perceptions of whether and to what extent conditions characterizing successful organizations are present in their agencies--showed that DHS employees had 4.5 percentage points lower job satisfaction and 7.0 percentage points lower engagement in their work overall. Engagement is the extent to which employees are immersed in their work and spending extra effort on job performance. Moreover, within most demographic groups available for comparison, DHS employees scored lower on average satisfaction and engagement than the average for the rest of the federal government. For example, within most pay categories DHS employees reported lower satisfaction and engagement than non-DHS employees in the same pay groups. Levels of satisfaction and engagement varied across components, with some components reporting scores above the non-DHS averages. Several components with lower morale, such as Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), made up a substantial share of FEVS respondents at DHS, and accounted for a significant portion of the overall difference between the department and other agencies. In addition, components that were created with the department or shortly thereafter tended to have lower morale than components that previously existed. Job satisfaction and engagement varied within components as well. For example, employees in TSA's Federal Security Director staff reported higher satisfaction (by 13 percentage points) and engagement (by 14 percentage points) than TSA's airport security screeners.", "DHS has taken steps to determine the root causes of employee morale problems and implemented corrective actions, but it could strengthen its survey analyses and metrics for action plan success. To understand morale problems, DHS and selected components took steps, such as implementing an exit survey and routinely analyzing FEVS results. Components GAO selected for review--ICE, TSA, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection--conducted varying levels of analyses regarding the root causes of morale to understand leading issues that may relate to morale. DHS and the selected components planned actions to improve FEVS scores based on analyses of survey results, but GAO found that these efforts could be enhanced. Specifically, 2011 DHS-wide survey analyses did not include evaluations of demographic group differences on morale-related issues, the Coast Guard did not perform benchmarking analyses, and it was not evident from documentation the extent to which DHS and its components used root cause analyses in their action planning. Without these elements, DHS risks not being able to address the underlying concerns of its varied employee population. In addition, GAO found that despite having broad performance metrics in place to track and assess DHS employee morale on an agency-wide level, DHS does not have specific metrics within the action plans that are consistently clear and measurable. As a result, DHS's ability to assess its efforts to address employee morale problems and determine if changes should be made to ensure progress toward achieving its goals is limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS examine its root cause analysis efforts and add the following, where absent: comparisons of demographic groups, benchmarking, and linkage of root cause findings to action plans; and establish clear and measurable metrics of action plan success.

According to our reviews of  OCHCO\u2019s analyses, OCHCO\u2019s DHS-wide analyses did not include  evaluations of demographic group differences on morale-related  issues for the 2011 FEVS. According to OCHCO officials, DHS\u2019s  Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties reviews survey results to  identify diversity issues that may be reflected in the survey, and  OCHCO officials considered these results when developing one of the  current (as of August 2012) DHS action plans to create policies that  identify barriers to diversity. In 2007 and 2009, years in which DHS  administered the Annual Employee Survey (AES), demographic  comparisons were made.

Because OPM now administers the survey each year, DHS is  not able to make significant demographic group comparisons because  of the format of the data provided by OPM, according to OCHCO  officials. However, we obtained FEVS data from OPM that allowed us  to make demographic group comparisons.

For example, TSA compared  screeners, Federal Security Director staff, Federal Air Marshals, and  headquarters staff on each FEVS dimension (e.g., work experiences,  supervisor/leader, satisfaction, and work/life). As a result, TSA was  able to identify screeners as having survey scores below those of  other TSA employee groups. CBP also compared race, ethnicity,  gender, and program office scores. CBP found that no significant  differences were present in the positive responses to the 2011 FEVS  core questions when comparing race, ethnicity and gender, and found  that Border Patrol employees reported higher job satisfaction than  field operations employees (74 versus 66 percent on the job  satisfaction index). In contrast, the Coast Guard did not conduct  analysis in addition to data that was provided by DHS OCHCO.  Because OCHCO\u2019s data did not include demographic information for  the 2011 FEVS, Coast Guard did not make demographic group  comparisons.

However, as shown in appendix I, we  were able to make various demographic comparisons based on a  more detailed data file provided by OPM, which is similar to a file that  OPM makes available to agencies and the public.", "Benchmarking against similar organizations. TSA benchmarked  its FEVS results against results from similar organizations, by  comparing results with CBP, and OCHCO\u2019s DHS-wide analysis  highlighted Partnership rankings data, showing DHS\u2019s position relative  to the positions of other federal agencies as a Best Place to Work.  Similarly, ICE benchmarked its FEVS results overall and for program  offices, such as homeland security investigators, against other DHS  components, including the U.S. Secret Service and CBP. For the  2011 FEVS, CBP performed more limited benchmarking, by  comparing FEVS results with governmentwide averages. According to  CBP officials, when analyzing annual employee surveys prior to 2011,  CBP benchmarked its results against agencies with high positive  FEVS scores, such as the Social Security Administration, the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission. CBP is in the initial planning phase  of a larger benchmarking project that would benchmark CBP against  foreign immigration, customs, and agriculture inspection agencies,  such as the Canadian Border Services Agency and the Australian  Customs and Border Protection Service. If approved, this  benchmarking project is expected to occur in fiscal year 2013,  according to CBP officials.

For both DHS-wide and  selected component action plans, FEVS questions with low scores  were linked with action plan areas. For example, in the DHS-wide  action plan, low scores on employee satisfaction with opportunities to  get a better job in the organization were linked to action plan items for  enhancing employee retention. However, the extent to which DHS  and the components used root causes found through other analyses  to inform their action plans, such as quarterly exit survey results or  additional internal component surveys, was not evident in action plan  documentation (see appendix IV for a description of these additional  root cause analyses).

OCHCO  officials described resource constraints and leadership changes within the  OCHCO position as resulting in a lack of continuity in root cause analysis  efforts.

OCHCO  considers whether positive responses to survey questions noted in the  action plan improve over time as the outcome measure for whether action  plans are effective. However, as part of its oversight and feedback on  component action plans, OCHCO does not monitor or evaluate measures  of success for action planning and therefore is not in a position to  determine whether the measures reflect improvement. CBP officials  stated that they monitor the change in FEVS results overall as the intent  of the action planning is to improve their scores on the HCAAF indexes.  Coast Guard officials stated that they rely on qualitative feedback from  employees on action plan items, such as improved training and website  updates, to measure action plan performance.

If DHS were more likely  to employ the types of workers who tend to have lower morale across all  agencies of the government, the composition of the workforce might  account for the gap to a greater extent than factors specific to DHS. In  other words, morale at DHS may be no worse than at other agencies  among demographically equivalent employees.

In fact, engagement at  DHS is lower (or statistically indistinguishable from zero) than at other  agencies in each demographic subgroup we analyzed, and the gap  relative to DHS does not vary by large amounts across most subgroups.  However, the gap is somewhat larger among employees who were in  certain subgroups, such as those who had 4 to 10 years of experience  with their components and who worked outside of headquarters.", "We developed several statistical models to further assess the  demographic explanation.

Oaxaca  decomposition can assess whether the overall morale gap is explained by  the demographic characteristics of DHS employees, or whether it is  explained by lower morale among DHS employees in the same  demographic groups. In other words, does DHS employ an unusually  large number of workers who tend to have low morale across all  agencies, or do workers with the same backgrounds have uniquely lower  morale at DHS?", "As shown in table 6, the model suggests that the demographic profile of  DHS employees (measured by FEVS) tends to slightly increase their  engagement and reduce the gap compared with employees at other  agencies. The demographic characteristics we can observe in FEVS  reduce the overall gaps in the proportion engaged and satisfied on our  scales by 0.1 and 1.0 percentage points, respectively. Instead, the  morale gap is better explained by unique differences in morale between  DHS and other agencies among demographically similar employees.  Such intrinsic differences increase the gaps in the proportion engaged  and satisfied by 6.4 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively. If the  demographic profile of the DHS workforce did not change, but DHS could  achieve the same levels of morale as other agencies from the same types  of employees, our model predicts that DHS employees would not have  lower morale than employees at other agencies.", "DHS employees with lower-level positions and component tenure were  among those with lower morale, relative to employees in other agencies.  As shown in figures 6 and 7, our measures of engagement and  satisfaction generally increased with seniority and decreased with tenure,  among employees at DHS and other agencies. At DHS, however, morale  increased more slowly as employees gained more seniority, and it  declined more quickly as they spent more time at the agency. For  example, the average newly hired employee at DHS and similar  employees at other agencies had statistically indistinguishable levels of  engagement. By their sixth years, however, satisfaction for the DHS  employee declined to an average of 18 percentage points, whereas  satisfaction for the non-DHS employees declined to an average of only 26  percentage points. A similar pattern exists with respect to supervisory  status (see figures 6 and 7). These patterns are particularly important for  explaining the overall morale gap, because DHS had about 30 percent  more supervisors and about twice as many people with 6 to 10 years of  component tenure (as a share of all employees), compared with people at  other agencies (according to FEVS).", "Low employee morale is not a uniform problem throughout DHS. As  shown in table 7, engagement varies widely across components within  the department, with employees in some components not being  significantly different from the average employee at non-DHS agencies.  These components include the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Federal  Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Management Directorate  (MGMT), and U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Job satisfaction at these  components also matches or exceeds that found at other agencies (not  shown in table 7).", "DHS has a number of components whose employees have substantially  lower morale than employees at other agencies and elsewhere in the  department. The large share of DHS employees working in these  components accounts for the overall morale gap between DHS and other  agencies.", "Components with lower morale include Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),  Intelligence and Analysis (IA), National Protection and Programs  Directorate (NPPD), Science and Technology (ST), and the TSA. The  engagement scores of these components range from 9.1 to 13.9  percentage points lower than the average score for non-DHS agencies  (see table 7). As a group, these components make up 46 percent of the  employees interviewed for the FEVS. Consequently, the components with  substantially lower morale have a large influence on the gap relative to  the rest of the government, despite the fact that morale at many smaller  DHS components is no worse.", "Morale at some of the less engaged and satisfied components is, in turn,  strongly influenced by particular employee workgroups (see table 7). For  example, the average engagement at TSA is 12.8 percentage points  (apart from rounding) lower than at non-DHS agencies. Within TSA,  however, the collectively large groups of air marshal, law enforcement,  and screening workers account for much of the overall difference. A  similar pattern applies to the enforcement, removal, and homeland  security investigation staffs at ICE, the field operations staff at CBP, and  the Federal Protective Service. Such variation within components further  suggests that the morale gap is isolated to particular areas within DHS  that account for a large proportion of its workforce.", "At other components, morale is more uniformly lower across most offices.  Average engagement at all work groups within FEMA is 5.8 to 17.7  percentage points lower than the non-DHS average, with the exception of  two regional offices and the offices of the Administrator and Chief of Staff.  The components of ST and IA also have more consistently low morale  across work groups.", "One explanation for why morale varies across components focuses on  the length of time each organization has existed. Components that  existed prior to the creation of DHS may have had more time to develop  successful cultures and management practices than components that  policymakers created with the department in 2003. As a result, the  preexisting components may have better morale today than components  with less mature cultures and practices.", "To assess this explanation, we analyzed morale among two groups of  components, divided according to whether the component was  established with the creation of DHS or existed previously (see table 8).  We considered three components to be preexisting\u2014FLETC, USSS, and  the Coast Guard\u2014and the rest to be newly created. Because TSA was  created about 2 years before DHS, we included it with components that  were created with DHS.", "Our analysis shows that employees at the more recently created  components were less engaged and satisfied on average than employees  at the preexisting components and at non-DHS agencies. For the  preexisting components, engagement was about 2.2 percentage points  higher than at the rest of the government, and the difference in  satisfaction was small (less than 1.4 percentage points). In contrast,  engagement and satisfaction at the more recently created components  were about 8 and 5.1 percentage points lower than at the rest of the  government, respectively.", "We developed a statistical model to confirm whether the differences  among components persist, holding constant demographic differences  among their employees. In an alternative version of model 1 above, we  replaced DHS with a vector of variables indicating whether the employee  worked for DHS components or at an agency other than DHS. All other  parts of the model were identical.", "The model estimates generally confirmed the differences in engagement  between non-DHS and DHS component employees in the raw data (see  table 9), with two exceptions. The model estimated that, holding constant  demographic differences, employees in the Management Directorate and  Office of the Secretary were 6.9 and 7.7 percentage points less engaged  on average than employees in non-DHS agencies. This suggests that the  engagement gap for employees in these offices is more similar to the gap  at other offices, holding constant the demographic differences among  offices measured by FEVS. The model estimated that differences in  satisfaction between the components and non-DHS agencies were  generally similar to such differences in engagement (see table 9).", "The fact that differences among components remained, even among  demographically equivalent employees, suggests that either unmeasured  demographic variables or intrinsic characteristics of the components are  responsible for the differences in morale.", "Our analysis discussed in this appendix has a narrow scope: assessing  whether demographic differences among employees explain the morale  differences across DHS and non-DHS employees. Consequently, DHS or  others could expand and improve upon our findings.", "Future work could examine whether attitudinal differences among  employees at DHS and other agencies explain the overall morale gap, in  addition to demographic differences. The 2011 FEVS measures  employee attitudes about pay, benefits, health and safety hazards,  training, supervisors, and other issues that could vary meaningfully  between employees at DHS and other agencies and, therefore, explain  why DHS has lower morale. One might include these factors in a  decomposition similar to the one we performed in this appendix. This  could further assess how factors unique to DHS and factors that are  common across all agencies explain the overall morale gap.", "A broader attitudinal analysis likely would require the use of more  sophisticated statistical methods for estimating the values of and  relationships among latent variables. The broad measures of morale we  analyze in this appendix, such as the OPM Employee Engagement index,  are made up of responses to questions on smaller dimensions, such as  leadership and supervision.

Together, CBP envisioned  the result to be more effective inspections and enhanced security at ports of entry while  also accelerating the processing of legitimate trade and travel.", "Focus group results were distributed to DHS components for  consideration in action planning efforts, according to OCHCO officials.  CBP, CIS, TSA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),  and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center each addressed at  least one of the focus group results relating to leadership, communication,  empowerment, or resources in subsequent action plans, according to  OCHCO officials.", "Statistical analysis. In 2008 OCHCO performed statistical analysis of  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) data, beyond examining  high- and low-scoring questions, in an effort to determine what workplace  factors drove employee job satisfaction. Specifically, the analysis involved  isolating which sets of FEVS questions most affect employee job  satisfaction. The analysis found that five work areas identified in FEVS  questions drive employee job satisfaction: (1) performance and rewards,  (2) supervisor support, (3) physical conditions and safety, (4) senior  leadership effectiveness, and (5) the DHS mission. According to OCHCO  officials, DHS components were encouraged to conduct follow-up  discussions at the lowest possible organizational level based on  component survey scores in each of the five work areas. However,  OCHCO officials stated that they are not aware of any results of this effort  because OCHCO did not track or follow-up with the components on the  effect of key driver discussions that may have occurred. In addition,  increased emphasis on supervisor performance management training  was also implemented as a result of the analysis, according to OCHCO  officials.", "Exit survey. In 2011, DHS began administering an exit survey to  understand why employees choose to leave their DHS positions.  Specifically, according to OCHCO officials, the DHS exit survey was  designed to determine where departing employees were moving both  inside and outside of DHS, to identify barriers related to diversity, to  identify reasons that veterans may be leaving DHS, and to capture  feedback from interns. The 2011 exit survey found, among other things,  that 27 percent of departing employees who responded to the exit survey  were staying within DHS or moving to a different position, and an  additional 12 percent of respondents were retiring. Lack of quality  supervision and advancement opportunities were the top reasons  responding employees indicated for leaving their positions. Exit survey  results are shared with DHS components on a quarterly and annual basis.  2011 FEVS analysis. For the 2011 FEVS, DHS\u2019s OCHCO evaluated the  results by comparing Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework (HCAAF) index results by component. The analysis showed  where the lowest index scores were concentrated. As shown in figure 8,  lower scores across the indexes were concentrated among several  components, including Intelligence and Analysis, Transportation and  Security Administration (TSA), ICE, National Protection and Programs  Directorate, and FEMA.", "The analysis also determined how DHS\u2019s scores on the four indexes  trended over time and compared with governmentwide averages. As  shown in figure 9, DHS-wide scores have generally trended upward over  time, but continue to lag behind governmentwide averages for each  index.", "Employee Engagement Executive Steering Committee (EEESC). In  January 2012 the DHS Secretary directed all component heads to take  steps to improve employee engagement through launch of the EEESC.  According to OCHCO officials, the EEESC was launched in response to  congressional concerns about DHS employee morale and the Partnership  for Public Service results showing DHS\u2019s low placement on the list of Best  Places to Work. The EEESC is charged with serving as the DHS  corporate body responsible for identifying DHS-wide initiatives to improve  employee engagement, oversee the efforts of each DHS component to  address employee engagement, and provide periodic reports to the  Under Secretary for Management, Deputy Secretary, and Secretary on  DHS-wide efforts to improve employee morale and engagement.  Specifically, the Secretary made the following directives to component  heads: develop and assume responsibility for employee engagement  improvement plans,  identify and assign specific responsibilities for improved employee  engagement to component senior executive performance objectives,  identify and assign a senior accountable official to serve on the  EEESC,  conduct town hall meetings with employees, attend a Labor-Management Forum meeting, and provide monthly reports on actions planned and progress made to the  Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer.", "As of August 2012, each of the Secretary\u2019s directives were completed,  with the exception of assigning responsibilities for improved employee  engagement to Senior Executive performance objectives, which DHS  plans to implement in October 2012 as part of the next senior executive  performance period. The EEESC met in February 2012, and component  representatives shared their latest action plans and discussed issues of  joint concern. In preparation for the 2012 FEVS, the EEESC released a  memorandum from the Secretary describing the responsibilities of the  EEESC, highlighting department actions, and encouraging employee  participation in the FEVS, which began in April 2012. The EEESC also  agreed that a corresponding message should be released from  component heads outlining specific component actions taken in response  to past survey results and encouraging participation in the next survey. In  an April 2012 EEESC meeting, the Partnership for Public Service  provided a briefing describing the Best Places to Work in the Federal  Government rankings and best practices across the government for  improving morale scores. The EEESC members also discussed methods  for improving the response rates for the upcoming survey and engaged in  an action planning exercise designed to help identify actions for  department-wide deployment, according to OCHCO officials. As of  August 2012, EEESC action items were in development and had not  been finalized. According to OCHCO officials, the EEESC plans to decide  on action items by September 2012, but a projected date for full  implementation has yet to be established because the actions have not  been decided upon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Components Have Also Conducted Some Root Cause Analyses Using FEVS Results", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the DHS-wide efforts, the components we selected for  review\u2014ICE, TSA, the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), and CBP\u2014 conducted varying levels of analyses regarding the root causes of morale  issues to inform agency action planning efforts.

In its analysis of the 2011 FEVS, TSA focused on areas of concern  across groups, such as pay and performance appraisal concerns, and  also looked for insight on which employee groups within TSA may be  more dissatisfied with their jobs than others by comparing employee  group scores on satisfaction-related questions. TSA compared its results  with CBP results, as well as against DHS and governmentwide results.  When comparing CBP and TSA scores, TSA found that the greatest  differences in scores were on questions related to satisfaction with pay  and whether performance appraisals were a fair reflection of  performance. TSA scored 40 percentage points lower on pay satisfaction  and 25 percentage points lower on performance appraisal satisfaction. In  comparing TSA results with DHS and governmentwide results, TSA found  that TSA was below the averages for all FEVS dimensions. TSA also  evaluated FEVS results across employee groups by comparing  dimension scores for headquarters staff, the Federal Air Marshals,  Federal Security Director staff, and the screening workforce. TSA found  that the screening workforce scored at or below scores for all other  groups across all of the dimensions.", "ICE. In its analysis of the 2011 FEVS, ICE analyzed the results by  identifying ICE\u2019s FEVS questions with the top positive and negative  responses. ICE found that its top strength was employees\u2019 willingness to  put in the extra effort to get a job done. ICE\u2019s top negative result was  employees\u2019 perceptions that pay raises did not depend on how well  employees perform their jobs. ICE also sorted the primary low-scoring  results into action planning themes, such as leadership, empowerment,  and work-life balance. ICE found, among other things, that employee  views on the fairness of its performance appraisals were above DHS\u2019s  average but that views on employee preparation for potential security  threats were lower. When comparing ICE\u2019s results with average  governmentwide figures, ICE found, among other things, that ICE was  lower on all of the HCAAF indexes, including job satisfaction. According  to ICE human capital officials, future root cause analysis plans for the  2012 FEVS are to benchmark FEVS scores with those of similar law  enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency; Federal  Bureau of Investigation; Federal Law Enforcement Training Center;  United States Secret Service; Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the  U.S. Marshals.", "CBP.

CBP highlighted its greatest increases in HCAAF areas, such  as results-oriented performance, which showed a 21 percent  improvement over 2006 responses to the question\u2014my performance  appraisal is a fair reflection of my performance. The analysis also  identified areas in greatest need of improvement, which showed progress  since 2006 but continued low scores, such as questions on dealing with  poor performers who cannot or will not improve (28 percent positive),  promotions based on merit (28 percent positive) and differences in  performance are recognized (34 percent positive).", "Coast Guard.
