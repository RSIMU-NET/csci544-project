If only one article in the shipment is lost, and its depreciated value is established at $5,000, the carrier is liable for this amount.

However, DOD household goods shipments are governed generally by provisions in DOD rate solicitations, and may differ from commercial practices.", "The carrier industry objected to moving DOD household goods at the commercial $1.25 rate primarily because military servicemember claims for loss and/or damage are settled by the military services. In commercial practice, the carrier usually settles such claims directly with the owner. The carrier industry generally believed that military claims settlement was too generous and resulted in excessive claims costs to the carrier. At one time, DOD allowed carriers to settle claims directly with the servicemember. This practice was changed, according to DOD, because carrier resolution of claims was found to be unacceptable.", "MTMC agreed to pay a separate charge of $0.64 per $100 valuation plus 10 percent of temporary storage charges instead of the commercial separate charge of $0.50 per $100 valuation plus 10 percent of temporary storage charges because the military services wanted to retain claims settlement authority for DOD household goods shipments.

We estimated that at the 1985 performance level, approximately $3 million to $4 million in government costs would be transferred to the carriers under the increased liability, and that this should provide increased incentive for carriers to improve their performance. Carriers with liability costs greater than added revenues could (1) improve performance so less damage and loss occurred, (2) increase transportation rates, or (3) absorb the loss.", "We consequently supported MTMC\u2019s 1987 policies for increasing carrier liability on domestic household goods shipments and concluded that the rate of carrier compensation for the increased liability established by MTMC in 1987 should remain unchanged until carrier performance data or additional cost information indicated that changes were needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MTMC Proposes Extending Increased Liability to International Shipments", "paragraphs": ["In March 1993, MTMC proposed that carrier liability also be increased from the $0.60 per pound per article rate to the $1.25 rate for international household goods shipments.

We analyzed shipment and claims data for each of these codes.

The Army and the Marine Corps data was complete only for fiscal years 1988 through 1991 because claims data records for these services were not computerized prior to fiscal year 1988. We did not obtain data from the Navy because this service has not computerized its claims records. We did not attempt to manually review claims payment and recovery records because of the time and resources such analyses would require.", "We then did a computer matching of MTMC shipment data with the available military service claims data by Government Bill of Lading number. We associated all recorded claims data with the shipments involved, regardless of when the claims were filed, adjudicated, paid, and recovered.

Under the $1.25 rate after fiscal year 1987, Air Force recovery from carriers on domestic shipments increased to an average of almost 78 percent of the amount of claims paid, but carriers also received payments for the additional liability through separate charges.

Transportation rates are influenced by many factors other than claims costs, such as insurance, competition, and individual carrier costs related to personnel, equipment, and facilities.", "Our analysis of DOD claims data by individual carrier confirmed that many carriers, especially those with high rates of loss and damage, were encountering claims costs higher than the compensatory revenues they received for the increased liability. These carriers could have compensated by raising their transportation rates. However, carrier industry officials told us that carriers had instead chosen to absorb these costs. They said the carrier industry was overbuilt, and that carriers in general were reluctant to increase transportation rates for fear of losing DOD business to other carriers with unchanged or lower rates. Both intense carrier competition and increased carrier liability therefore appear to have contributed to lowered DOD net program costs.", "We could not determine to what extent lowered net program cost was due to reduced claims costs versus other factors.

They said that the inflation index we used\u2014the Consumer Price Index\u2014overstated the actual amount of inflation and resulted in an overstatement of the amount of savings accruing to DOD as the result of increased carrier liability on domestic household goods shipments after fiscal year 1987. The AMC further noted that since there was no decrease in the frequency of household goods claims on domestic shipments after 1987, the primary impact of the increase in carrier liability was to transfer the cost of these claims from DOD to the household goods industry.", "We used the Consumer Price Index to adjust for inflation and enable dollar comparisons over fiscal years 1986 through 1991 for two primary reasons. First, in order to avoid just such methodology disputes, during the design phase of this assignment, we sought and obtained carrier industry review and concurrence with our analysis methodology, including the use of the Consumer Price Index as the appropriate index for such comparisons. Carrier industry officials suggested changing this index only after seeing the results of our analysis.", "After reviewing the alternate index proposed by the AMC, we are not convinced that AMC\u2019s index provides a more accurate estimate than the index we used. The AMC maintained that the Consumer Price Index should not be used because it contains many components that have no direct bearing on claims costs, and instead proposed a combination of Consumer Price Index components that it claimed were more directly related to claims costs. However, while the overall Consumer Price Index does not match the specific makeup of household goods claims, neither does the index proposed by the AMC. It still excludes certain items and costs frequently found in household goods claims such as bicycles, music equipment, and photographic equipment. Also, the weighted values used by AMC\u2019s index are based on the pattern of consumer expenditures rather than claims. It is therefore unclear whether or to what degree AMC\u2019s index, or any similar index, might be more appropriate for tracking household goods claims costs. Furthermore, the overall Consumer Price Index is readily available in published form and is widely accepted as the appropriate standard for establishing constant dollar comparisons.", "However, while the overall Consumer Price Index remains a generally accepted standard for constant dollar comparisons, we acknowledge the existence of controversy over whether this index overstates inflation. AMC acknowledged in its comments that even using their index, increased carrier liability resulted in DOD claims costs reductions of 5.2 percent instead of the 9 percent we reported. Regardless of which index is used, increased carrier liability still resulted in reduced DOD claims costs.", "AMC\u2019s comments provided numerous additional reasons and data analyses to support further disagreement with the results of our analysis. The AMC cited analyses from our previous reports as the source of some of this data. In fact, the source of the preponderance of this data was AMC comments to our prior report, not work performed by us. Also, this data was based on MTMC data shown to be inaccurate by our current analysis. Furthermore, we disagree with the appropriateness of various technical aspects of the methodology AMC uses in reaching many of its conclusions.", "The AMC also suggested that fiscal year 1991 data be removed from our analysis because of differences in certain claims data for this fiscal year compared with similar data for other fiscal years. AMC\u2019s comments cited lower claims cost recovery ratios for the Air Force and the Marines in fiscal year 1991 than in any of the prior fiscal years we evaluated, and suggested that some claims data might not have been included for fiscal year 1991 due to late claims filing times.", "We believe these fluctuations are within normally expected ranges and that they do not warrant exclusion of the fiscal year 1991 data. For example, while Air Force officials told us that Operation Desert Storm affected claims personnel priorities, they also told us that claims personnel shortages and conflicting priorities were generally likely to affect their ability to consistently maintain an 80-percent recovery rate. All the services confirmed that our analysis accurately reflected their shipment and claims data for the period reviewed. We also previously investigated the drop in Marine recovery effectiveness from 63 percent in fiscal year 1990 to 46 percent in fiscal year 1991 that AMC cited in its comments.

The AMC said that if the $1.25 rate is implemented for international shipments, MTMC should pay a valuation charge (compensatory rate) of $2.31 per $100 of shipment valuation. It further said that if MTMC is unwilling to pay this level of compensation, then carrier liability should be returned to the $0.60 per pound per article rate.", "We believe the $2.31 compensatory rate proposed by the AMC is too high and would provide little incentive for carriers to reduce shipment damage and loss. This rate would cause carriers to pay higher claims costs initially, but would also result in DOD reimbursing them for the added cost. The overall financial impact on both DOD and the carrier industry would thus remain unchanged. The better performing carriers would realize windfall profits, the average carrier would break even, and only the worst performing carriers would have incentive to improve. We believe the compensatory rate should be designed to fully compensate only the better performing carriers. Other carriers would have to improve their performance, increase their transportation rates, or absorb the loss. Changing carrier liability is pointless unless it will have a significant monetary impact on both DOD and the carriers.", "Woven throughout carrier industry comments is the theme that increasing carrier liability actually does little more than to transfer claims costs to the moving industry. This is exactly what DOD has attempted to do. DOD has historically borne a disproportionately large share of claims costs. Increasing carrier liability would transfer a greater portion of the costs associated with damaged and lost household goods to the industry responsible for the problem. Even under increased liability, DOD would still be paying at least 20 percent of claims costs.", "The carrier industry further stated that carriers should be allowed to settle claims for loss and damage directly with servicemembers. They noted that it is common commercial practice for the carrier to settle claims directly with the shipper, and that DOD claims settlement is too generous. DOD officials told us that carriers had been allowed to settle claims directly with servicemembers in the past, but that this practice had been discontinued because DOD believed many settlements had been unfair. Carriers currently can and often do offer servicemembers cash for losses and damage at the time of shipment delivery in an attempt to avoid the DOD claims settlement and recovery process. Furthermore, adopting commercial claims settlement practices would be much more appropriate if commercial practices were also applied in selecting carriers for DOD shipments. The current process for awarding DOD business to carriers is regulated in such a way as to place more emphasis on low transportation rates and spreading DOD business over a large number of carriers than it is toward awarding more shipments to those carriers providing the best service and value for the cost. In any event, carriers can fully compensate for any increased costs associated with DOD claims settlement practices by increasing their transportation rates.", "The HHGFAA objected to any increase in carrier liability for international shipments. It said carrier liability for these shipments should not be increased, primarily because we had not evaluated the impact of (1) the October 1993 increase in carrier liability from $0.60 per pound per article to $1.80 per pound per article, (2) MTMC\u2019s Total Quality Assurance Program, or (3) the High Risk Protection Program implemented by the carrier industry. The HHGFAA also said that domestic and international shipments are so different that experience with the $1.25 rate on domestic shipments should not be used as a basis for applying this liability rate to international shipments. The HHGFAA suggested leaving the liability rate at $1.80 per pound per article until such time that we could perform a statistical evaluation of this rate\u2019s impact on claims costs.", "MTMC increased the carrier liability rate on international shipments from $0.60 per pound per article to $1.80 per pound per article as an interim measure pending the outcome of our study. It was intended only to give temporary relief to DOD, which had been bearing a disproportionate share of claims costs for years. As discussed in this chapter, we could not review the impact of the $1.80 per pound per article rate because inadequate time has passed to accumulate shipment and claims data to make a meaningful analysis. We did generally discuss the potential impact of the $1.80 rate. However, we are opposed to the retention of carrier liability based on a per pound per article rate because it results in carrier liability being based on a lost or damaged article\u2019s weight rather than its value. As stated earlier, this has the costly impact of DOD paying servicemember claims on the basis of an item\u2019s value or repair cost, while recovering from carriers on the basis of item weight. Carrier liability for high-value, low-weight items is greatly limited on the very items that tend to be easily damaged or are often the target of shipment pilferage. During this review we did do some audit work regarding MTMC\u2019s Total Quality Assurance Program and the carrier industry\u2019s High Risk Protection Program. In this chapter we acknowledged that these programs had potential for affecting claims costs. However, we could not determine whether or to what degree they actually impact these costs because both were implemented only recently and there has been inadequate time to accumulate the claims data needed for such an evaluation. Furthermore, the work we performed revealed that MTMC\u2019s Total Quality Assurance Program is being affected by several implementation problems, and that its effectiveness and appropriateness as a tool for assuring quality moves is presently unclear.", "We agree with the HHGFAA that risks and costs are generally higher for international shipments than for domestic shipments. However, the carrier, not DOD, is still responsible for loss and damage occurring while household goods are under its control, including handling by destination agents or other subcontractors used by the carrier. The carriers should build the cost of such risks into their transportation rates. Furthermore, while differences may exist with regard to the amount of carrier risk associated with domestic as opposed to international shipments, the process for adjudicating claims for loss and damage is the same. The issue is what liability rate should be applied. If DOD decides that it should assume more liability for loss and damage and the carriers less, then it should do so by lowering the $1.25 rate to $1.10 or some other level rather than retaining a liability system based on the weight of the items shipped instead of their value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Problems Need to Be Addressed for Increased Liability to Be Fully Effective", "paragraphs": ["Increasing carrier liability should result in reduced DOD costs and improved carrier performance. However, several problems affecting DOD\u2019s household goods programs need to be addressed for increased liability to achieve its intended effectiveness.

However, MTMC\u2019s household goods program database has major problems that prevent DOD officials from obtaining adequate information to effectively manage many aspects of this program.", "MTMC officials do not have adequate information with which to evaluate individual carrier performance. MTMC obtains periodic reports from the military service Judge Advocates General that include data on the number and amount of claims paid for loss and damage to household goods shipments, and stores this information in computerized data banks. We compared computerized household goods claims data we obtained directly from the military service Judge Advocates General with that stored by MTMC for shipments moved during fiscal years 1986 through 1991.", "We found that MTMC claims data has major omissions. For example, the MTMC database was always missing at least 28 percent of the claims paid and claims recovered data on Air Force shipments made between fiscal years 1986 and 1991, and at least 40 percent of similar data for the Army between fiscal years 1988 and 1991. MTMC officials told us that most of the similar data from the Navy and the Marine Corps had not been submitted to MTMC in fiscal years 1990 and 1991. Officials from MTMC\u2019s Traffic Management Analysis Division told us they considered MTMC\u2019s household goods claims data so unreliable as to prevent meaningful analysis.", "We also found that MTMC does not track some costs essential to evaluating increased liability effectiveness. For example, in exchange for the increased liability on domestic household goods shipments, MTMC has since 1987 paid carriers a separate charge of $0.64 per $100 shipment valuation plus 10 percent of certain storage in transit charges. We found the MTMC database does not capture what costs are paid as a result of the storage in transit calculation, and therefore, MTMC could not determine its total costs for the increased liability. We had to review actual shipment records stored at the General Services Administration to determine these costs. We also found numerous other technical problems with portions of MTMC\u2019s household goods database; these problems greatly limit MTMC\u2019s oversight of the program\u2019s performance characteristics and cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Emphasis Is Needed on Military Service Recovery Activities", "paragraphs": ["After military service claims offices adjudicate and pay servicemember claims for loss and damage on household goods shipments, the military services attempt to recover these costs from carriers up to the extent of the carrier\u2019s liability. Chapter 2 describes how military service recovery effectiveness varied under increased carrier liability on domestic shipments, with only the Air Force attaining the Project REVAL recovery goal of 78 percent of the amount of claims paid. As a result, DOD savings were about $3.2 million less than if all the military services had performed recovery as effectively as the Air Force.", "We found that recovery effectiveness varied between the services under other types of liability and shipments as well. Many of the carriers we visited told us that Air Force claims recovery was highly effective, and was attributable to its use of well-trained and knowledgeable personnel. They said the effectiveness of recovery activities performed by the other services was mixed.", "Our review of household goods shipment claims data confirmed that the Air Force generally asserted and recovered a higher percentage of the amount of claim paid than did the other military services, regardless of the type of carrier liability. DOD officials told us that the nature of household goods shipments varied little between the military services and that recovery effectiveness should also be very similar. However, military claims officials told us that problems such as personnel shortages, poor coordination between claims offices, claims backlogs, specific office performance problems, and lost or misplaced payments from carriers had affected some services in the past and that these had a negative impact on their recovery effectiveness.", "We believe these problems may continue to affect military service recovery activities. For example, one carrier told us that a recent review of their bank records revealed that 34 checks totaling $6,820 sent to DOD as the result of recovery actions between 1990 and 1993 had not been cashed. The same carrier also identified 13 more payments to DOD during 1994 totaling $1,895 that were still outstanding 2 to 4 months after check issuance.", "Effective recovery of claims costs by the military services is essential for increased carrier liability to fully meet its goals of reducing claims costs and increasing carrier incentive for preventing shipment loss and damage. This is particularly the case since DOD is paying carriers an additional separate charge in exchange for the increased liability on domestic shipments, and may do so on future overseas shipments. DOD therefore needs to place increased emphasis on recovery activities in order to achieve and maintain levels closer to those demonstrated by the Air Force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Bonding and Insurance Needs to Be Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["MTMC requires carriers to purchase cargo insurance before giving them approval to move DOD domestic household goods shipments, and both cargo insurance and performance bonds are required for approval to move DOD international shipments.

Increased carrier liability and other facets of MTMC\u2019s household goods programs are increasing the level of government funds at risk. However, past government actions to recover the cost of losses associated with carrier bankruptcies have often been inadequate.

We could not determine the extent of funds lost. MTMC officials told us efforts were underway to improve bond collections and that MTMC would be solely responsible for its own bond collections in the future.

As of 1993, there were 1,227 domestic and  147 overseas carriers approved by MTMC for moving DOD household goods shipments. Declining levels of DOD shipments is increasing carrier competition, and forcing many carriers into a weak financial condition. Carrier industry officials told us that since claims may not be addressed until several years after a shipment is completed, many carriers do not set aside sufficient funding to cover claims, instead expecting to cover these costs out of their cash flow from new shipments. Declining shipment levels increase the likelihood of some carriers being forced into bankruptcy. Furthermore, we noted that many overseas carriers rely on winning DOD shipment contracts since they have no commercial household goods shipment business.", "Second, both carrier industry and MTMC officials acknowledged a growing tendency for some carriers to adopt a business strategy of going out of business. Some carriers have bid unusually low rates to win DOD business, received payment for moving a number of shipments, and then declared bankruptcy, leaving a large unpaid claims liability. Some of these carriers then reenter the business under a new carrier name, and apply for new MTMC carrier approval.", "Many of the carrier industry officials we interviewed told us they believed MTMC carrier approval requirements were too lax. MTMC officials acknowledged they rely heavily on bonding and insurance companies to evaluate the financial suitability of carriers before approving them for DOD shipments. Both MTMC and carrier industry officials told us that some disreputable carriers were taking advantage of weak MTMC approval and collection processes to employ business strategies of going out of business. They said that the low rates bid by such companies were making it difficult for reputable carriers to stay in business.", "This problem is exacerbated by MTMC\u2019s provision of an incentive to the low-bidding carrier of as much as 30 percent to 50 percent of the traffic on international routes. This incentive is designed to reduce DOD transportation costs through increased carrier competition, and to reward the carrier bidding the lowest rate. However, DOD must ensure that adequate bonding and insurance levels and collection procedures are in place to cover shipment and liability costs in the event of carrier bankruptcy. Otherwise, the government is vulnerable to significant financial losses. For example, one carrier underbid all others on many routes for several years. At one point, this carrier was moving more than a fourth of all DOD overseas household goods shipments. According to DOD officials, this carrier then went bankrupt, leaving about $7 million in outstanding claims liabilities. DOD and insurance companies are presently involved in legal action regarding this matter, and DOD has not yet recovered any of these funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Statute of Limitations Appears Needlessly Long", "paragraphs": ["Under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3721, federal employees have 2 years to file claims for loss and damage to personal property, including household goods.

As discussed in our 1989 report on DOD household goods claims payment and recovery activities, the 2-year period contributes to claims management and adjudication problems, prevents carriers from making timely adjustments to their transportation rates, and causes increased government costs. Making timely adjustments to transportation rates will be even more important to carriers under increased carrier liability. Nearly all the carriers we visited said the statute needed to be shortened to a year or less. They told us that by contrast, claims on commercial shipments must be filed within 9 months of shipment delivery. DOD claims officials generally acknowledged that claims requiring more than 1 year to file usually involved servicemember procrastination.", "We analyzed Army and Air Force claims data for fiscal years 1988 through 1991 to determine the average amount of time required between shipment delivery and the filing of claims. We found that in each fiscal year, more than 60 percent of all claims filed were filed within 6 months of shipment delivery, and over 80 percent within 1 year of shipment delivery. For example, table 4.1 shows the amount of time in months between shipment delivery and claims filing for combined domestic and international household goods claims for the Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps in fiscal year 1991.", "DOD officials told us that the 2-year statute of limitations encourages some servicemembers to take longer than necessary to file their claims. This tends to increase the already long gaps between the time household goods shipments occur and the time claims data for evaluating costs and carrier performance is available. Claims processing and recovery by the military services often takes an additional 5 months or longer. Both DOD claims officials and carriers told us that long delays in filing household goods claims can result in claims settlement or recovery problems.", "Unnecessary delays in filing claims also exacerbate carriers\u2019 problems in obtaining the claims recovery cost information they need to adjust their rates in a timely fashion. MTMC requires household goods carriers to bid on transportation rates for contracts to transport DOD household goods shipments 6 months prior to the beginning of the 6-month period these rates will be in effect. Increased carrier liability is resulting in increased carrier costs and consequently a greater need for timely adjustment of rates.", "As discussed in our 1989 report, delays in filing household goods claims increase government costs. Late-filed claims are generally more difficult to process and consequently increase administrative costs. DOD also cannot conduct recovery activities and reuse the funds thus obtained until servicemember claims are filed and processed. The availability of these funds and the amount of interest cost to the government thus depend largely on the amount of time required for servicemembers to file their claims.

First, the period allowed for filing claims on DOD shipments is much longer than the 9-months maximum allowed for commercial shipments. Second, DOD currently requires servicemembers to report any damage to shipments within 75 days of delivery. We believe that servicemembers should reasonably be able to complete the process for filing a claim in the remaining 9-1/2 months of the 1 year statutory period. Third, we believe that since increased liability will increase carrier claims costs and thus affect the transportation rates bid by carriers, fairness dictates that claims resolution be performed as quickly as practical.", "Regarding claims filing difficulties caused by long deployments and overseas assignments, we believe that military regulations implementing the law permit DOD to provide relief in those rare instances when the servicemember cannot reasonably file a claim in a timely manner.
