Various agencies whose missions require screening for links to terrorism use watch list records. For example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) screens travelers at ports of entry. Because screening is based on names, it can result in misidentifications when persons not on the list have a name that resembles one on the list. Also, some names may be mistakenly included on the watch list. In either case, individuals can be negatively affected and may express concerns or seek agency action, or redress, to prevent future occurrences. This report addresses: (1) the extent to which the numbers of misidentified persons are known and how they could be affected, (2) the major reasons misidentifications occur and the actions agencies are taking to reduce them or minimize their effects, and (3) the opportunities for redress available to individuals with watch list-related concerns. In conducting work at TSC and the principal federal agencies that use watch list data, GAO reviewed standard operating procedures and other relevant documentation and interviewed responsible officials. GAO makes no recommendations at this time because the agencies have ongoing initiatives to improve data quality, reduce the number of misidentifications or mitigate their effects, and enhance redress efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Annually, millions of individuals--from international travelers to visa applicants--are screened for terrorism links against the watch list. At times, a person is misidentified because of name similarities, although the exact number is unknown. In some cases, agencies can verify the person is not a match by comparing birth dates or other data with watch list records, but agencies do not track the number. In other cases, they ask TSC for help. From December 2003 (when TSC began operations) to January 2006, agencies sent tens of thousands of names to TSC, and about half were misidentifications, according to TSC. While the total number of people misidentified may be substantial, it likely represents a fraction of all people screened. Even so, misidentifications can lead to delays, intensive questioning and searches, missed flights, or denied entry at the border. Misidentifications most commonly occur with names that are identical or similar to names on the watch list. To rapidly screen names against the watch list, agencies use computerized programs that account for differences due to misspellings and other variations. TSC has ongoing initiatives to improve computerized matching programs and the quality of watch list records. Also, CBP and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have established procedures designed to expedite frequently misidentified persons through screening, after confirming they are not on the watch list. Because security measures regrettably may cause personal inconveniences, TSA and CBP, with the support of TSC, provide opportunities for people who have been misidentified or mistakenly included on the watch list to seek redress. Most of these are misidentified persons who are not on the watch list but have a similar name and, therefore, may be repeatedly misidentified. Thus, TSA, for example, provides redress that relies heavily on efforts to expedite frequently misidentified persons through screening by allowing them to submit personal information that helps airlines more quickly determine that they are not on the watch list. If TSA and CBP cannot resolve questions from the public, they ask TSC for help. For 2005, TSC reported that it processed to completion 112 redress referrals and removed the names of 31 mistakenly listed persons from the watch list. To ensure that opportunities for redress are formally documented across agencies and that responsibilities are clear, the Justice Department is leading an effort to develop an interagency memorandum of understanding and expects a final draft to be ready for approval by fall 2006. TSC and frontline-screening-agency officials recognize that, after the agreement is finalized, the public needs to clearly understand how to express concerns and seek relief if negatively affected by screening. So, these officials have committed to making updated information on redress publicly available. GAO provided a draft copy of this report to the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State. They provided technical clarifications that GAO incorporated where appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To identify individuals with known or potential links to terrorism, since  the tragedies of September 11, 2001, agencies such as the departments of  State, Justice, and Homeland Security have implemented enhanced  procedures to screen international travelers, airline passengers, and visa  applicants. One important homeland security tool used by these federal  frontline-screening agencies is the terrorist-screening database, otherwise  known as the consolidated watch list, containing the names of individuals  with known and suspected links to terrorism. The database, which  contains names of foreign and U.S. citizens, is maintained by the Terrorist  Screening Center, an entity that has been operational since December 2003  under the administration of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Based upon agency-specific policies and criteria, relevant portions of the  Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s consolidated watch list can be used in a wide  range of security-related screening procedures. For instance, the  Transportation Security Administration\u2019s No Fly and Selectee lists\u2014used  by airlines to screen passengers prior to boarding\u2014are portions of the  Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s consolidated watch list. Also, to help ensure  that known or suspected terrorists do not enter the United States,  applicable portions of the watch list are to be checked by Department of  State consular officers before issuing U.S. visas and by U.S. Customs and  Border Protection officers before admitting persons at air, land, and sea  ports of entry.", "Because terrorist watch list screening involves comparisons based on  personal-identifying information such as names and dates of birth, there is  potential to generate misidentifications\u2014given that two or more persons,  for example, may have the same or similar names. As such, the screening  inevitably can raise concerns from individuals who assert that they are  being misidentified because of a name similarity to some other person  whose name is on the watch list. Misidentifications can result in travel  delays and other inconveniences for the respective individuals. Specific  instances have been widely reported in newspapers and other media,  including cases involving members of Congress and other high-profile  individuals. Misidentifications highlight the importance of having a  process\u2014often referred to as redress\u2014for affected persons to express  their concerns, seek correction of any inaccurate data, and request other  actions to reduce or eliminate future inconveniences. Similarly, such a  process would apply to other persons affected by the maintenance of  watch list data, including persons whose names are actually on the watch  list but should not be (\u201cmistakenly listed persons\u201d) as well as persons who  are properly listed. Accordingly, in reference to terrorist watch list  screening, this report addresses the following questions:    To what extent are the numbers of terrorist watch list misidentifications  known, and generally, how could misidentified persons be affected?", "What are the major reasons that misidentifications occur, and what  actions are the Terrorist Screening Center and frontline-screening  agencies taking to reduce the number of misidentified persons or expedite  them through the screening process?", "To address concerns from misidentified and mistakenly listed persons,  what opportunities for redress have the Terrorist Screening Center and  frontline-screening agencies established?", "In answering these questions, we reviewed the Terrorist Screening  Center\u2019s standard operating procedures, statistics on watch-list-related  screening encounters that resulted in referrals to the center, and other  relevant documentation; and we interviewed Terrorist Screening Center  officials, including the director, principal deputy director, chief  information officer, and privacy officer. Similarly, we interviewed officials  at and reviewed documentation obtained from the principal frontline- screening agencies\u2014Transportation Security Administration, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, and the Department of State\u2014whose  missions most frequently and directly involve interactions with travelers.  Regarding the screening of air passengers, in addition to contacting the  Transportation Security Administration to broadly discuss the procedures  of air carriers, we interviewed security officials at five major, domestic air  carriers. Also, we visited various land and air ports of entry in four  states\u2014California, Michigan, New York, and Texas. Collectively, these  states have ports of entry on both the northern and southern borders of  the United States. Regarding statistical data we obtained from the  Terrorist Screening Center\u2014such as the number of misidentifications and  the results of the redress process, particularly the number of mistakenly  listed persons whose names have been removed from the watch list\u2014we  discussed the sources of the data with center officials, including the chief  information officer, and we reviewed documentation regarding the  compilation of the statistics. We determined that the statistics were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting overall patterns and  trends. We performed our work from April 2005 through August 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Appendix I presents more details about our objectives, scope, and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In April 2003, we reported that watch lists were maintained by numerous  federal agencies and that the agencies did not have a consistent and  uniform approach to sharing information on individuals with possible links  to terrorism. Our report recommended that the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s Secretary, in collaboration with the heads of the departments  and agencies that have and use watch lists, lead an effort to consolidate  and standardize the federal government\u2019s watch list structures and  policies. Subsequently, pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 6, dated September 16, 2003, the Terrorist Screening Center was  established to consolidate the government\u2019s approach to terrorism  screening and provide for the appropriate and lawful use of terrorist  information in screening processes. The center began \u201c24/7\u201d operations on  December 1, 2003, and, about 3 months later, on March 12, 2004,  announced that watch list consolidation was completed with  establishment of the terrorist-screening database. This consolidated  database is the U.S. government\u2019s master repository for all known and  suspected international and domestic terrorist records used for watch-list- related screening. Records for inclusion in the consolidated database are  submitted to the Terrorist Screening Center from the following two  sources:  Identifying information on individuals with possible international  terrorism ties is provided through the National Counterterrorism Center,  which is managed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.", "Identifying information on individuals with ties to purely domestic  terrorism, such as Ted Kaczynski (the \u201cUnabomber\u201d), is provided by the  FBI.", "In their terrorist-screening processes, the three federal frontline-screening  agencies that we reviewed use records exported by the Terrorist  Screening Center. That is, the applicable exported records are  incorporated, respectively, into the Transportation Security  Administration\u2019s No Fly and Selectee lists, U.S. Customs and Border  Inspection\u2019s Interagency Border Inspection System, and the State  Department\u2019s Consular Lookout and Support System. The following listing  discusses the frontline-screening agencies\u2019 use of watch list records more  specifically:    Transportation Security Administration\u2019s No Fly and Selectee  Lists: As needed, the Transportation Security Administration provides  updated No Fly and Selectee lists to airlines for use in prescreening  passengers. Through the issuance of security directives, the agency  requires that airlines use these lists to screen passengers prior to boarding.  The agency\u2019s Office of Intelligence (formerly called the Transportation  Security Intelligence Service) provides assistance to airlines in  determining whether passengers are a match with persons on the lists.", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Interagency Border  Inspection System: U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers use the  Interagency Border Inspection System to screen travelers entering the  United States at ports of entry, which include land border crossings along  the Canadian and Mexican borders, sea ports, and U.S. airports for  international flight arrivals. This system includes not only the applicable  records exported by the Terrorist Screening Center, but also additional  information on people with prior criminal histories, immigration  violations, or other activities of concern that U.S. Customs and Border  Protection wants to identify and screen at ports of entry.", "State Department\u2019s Consular Lookout and Support System: This  system is the primary sensitive but unclassified database used by consular  officers abroad to screen the names of visa applicants to identify terrorists  and other aliens who are potentially ineligible for visas based on criminal  histories or other reasons specified by federal statute. According to the  State Department, all visa-issuing posts have direct access to the system  and must use it to check each applicant\u2019s name before issuing a visa.", "Also, the Terrorist Screening Center makes applicable records in the  consolidated database available to support the terrorist-screening  activities of other federal agencies\u2014such as U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, which is the largest investigative component of the  Department of Homeland Security\u2014as well as state and local law  enforcement agencies. For example, the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information  Center has a file\u2014the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File\u2014 which is accessible by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers  for screening in conjunction with arrests, detentions, or other criminal  justice purposes. A subset of this file consists of the Terrorist Screening  Center\u2019s records to be used to screen for possible terrorist links.", "Figure 1 presents a general overview of the name-matching process  typically used by frontline-screening agencies and airlines to screen  individuals against applicable records exported by the Terrorist Screening  Center, which has an important role in verifying identities. When the  computerized name-matching system of a frontline-screening agency or, in  the case of air travel, an airline generates a \u201chit\u201d (a potential name match)  against a terrorist database record, the agency or airline is to review each  potential name-match. Any obvious mismatches (misidentifications) are to  be resolved by the frontline agency or airline.", "Conversely, clearly positive or exact matches generally are to be referred  to the applicable screening agency\u2019s intelligence center and to the  Terrorist Screening Center to provide law enforcement an opportunity for  a counterterrorism response. Similarly, hits involving inconclusive  matches\u2014that is, uncertain and other hard-to-verify potential matches\u2014 typically are to be referred to the applicable screening agency\u2019s  intelligence center. In turn, if the intelligence center cannot conclusively  determine whether a hit is an exact match, the Terrorist Screening Center  is to be contacted. Referring inconclusive matches to the Terrorist  Screening Center for resolution or confirmation is important because the  possible consequences of not identifying a known or suspected terrorist  could be worse than the inconveniences associated with  misidentifications. In conducting its research, the Terrorist Screening  Center has access to classified data systems that may contain additional  information not available to the referring agency. Once the Terrorist  Screening Center has confirmed the individual as either a positive match  or a misidentification, the frontline-screening agency is to be informed.", "Homeland security-related screening processes entail some level of  inconvenience for all travelers. Also, in an operational context, people can  be and frequently are screened for reasons not related to the terrorist  watch list but rather for reasons related to an agency\u2019s mission. For  example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens travelers for any  conditions that may make them inadmissible to the country, including past  violations of immigration, drug, customs, or other laws. The agency also  randomly selects certain individuals for more thorough screening.  Similarly, prospective airline passengers may be randomly selected for  additional screening, and others may be selected if they exhibit unusual  behavior. Generally, screening agencies and airlines are not to disclose  the reason they select an individual for more thorough screening  measures, so persons may mistakenly assume it is because they are on a  terrorist watch list."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Likely a Small Percentage of All People Screened, the Thousands of Persons Misidentified to the Terrorist Watch List Can Experience Additional Questioning, Delays, and Other Effects", "paragraphs": ["Annually, hundreds of millions of individuals\u2014international travelers,  airline passengers, and visa applicants\u2014are screened against relevant  portions of the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s consolidated watch list.

During the 26- month period we studied\u2014from December 2003 (when the Terrorist  Screening Center began operations) to January 2006\u2014the center received  tens of thousands of screening-encounter referrals from frontline- screening agencies and determined that approximately half involved  misidentified persons with names the same as or similar to someone  whose name was contained on the terrorist watch list. The number of  referrals to the Terrorist Screening Center does not constitute the universe  of all persons initially misidentified by terrorist watch list screening  because the names of many persons initially misidentified are not  forwarded to the Terrorist Screening Center. Rather, by comparing birth  dates or other data, the frontline- screening agencies (e.g., U.S. Customs  and Border Protection) are able to resolve many initial misidentifications  without contacting the Terrorist Screening Center. Additionally, for air  passengers, the airlines often are able to resolve initial misidentifications  without contacting the Transportation Security Administration. The  screening agencies and airlines generally do not maintain readily available  statistics on these resolutions.", "Nonetheless, although the full universe of such misidentifications may be  substantial in absolute terms, the total number likely represents a small  fraction of all persons who are subject to terrorist watch list screening  procedures, as in the following examples:    U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that its officers managed a  total of 431 million border crossings into the United States at land, air, and  sea ports of entry in fiscal year 2005.", "Domestic airline flights\u2014flights within the United States\u2014carried 658  million passengers during the 12 months ending January 2006, according  to Department of Transportation statistics.", "The State Department reported that it processed about 7.4 million  nonimmigrant visa applications in fiscal year 2005.", "In addition to these international travelers, domestic flight passengers, and  visa applicants, any other person can be subject to terrorist watch list  screening in conjunction with routine law enforcement activities. For  instance, in stopping a motorist for a traffic violation, a state or local law  enforcement officer can check the motorist\u2019s name against the National  Crime Information Center\u2019s various files, which include terrorist watch list  records exported by the Terrorist Screening Center.

Generally, the extent of the effects of terrorist watch-list- related misidentification can vary by individual circumstances and the  operational nature of the screening agency\u2019s mission. For example, an  individual with a name similar to someone who is on the Transportation  Security Administration\u2019s No Fly list likely will be unable to utilize the  convenience of Internet, curbside, and airport kiosk check-in options. This  effect of misidentifications is reflected in a sample of 24 complaint letters  to the Transportation Security Administration that we reviewed. Many of  the complainants described their frustrations with not being able to use  alternative check-in options such as the Internet or airport kiosks.  Similarly, in a survey conducted in June 2006 by the National Business  Travel Association, many companies\u2019 travel managers responded that their  employees have expressed frustration about repeatedly having to go to the  airline ticket counter to obtain a boarding pass.", "Also, misidentifications can cause other effects, such as missed airline  flights by either leisure travelers or business travelers, which could have  economic and other consequences, although we found no readily available  data on how frequently these effects occurred. However, according to  Transportation Security Administration data, two international flights\u2014 one in December 2004 and another in May 2005\u2014were diverted from  landing at their scheduled destinations in the United States due to  potential matches to the No Fly list. In each instance, following the  diversions of the flights and further investigation after the airplanes  landed, federal authorities determined that the respective passengers were  misidentified and not true matches to the No Fly list. Nonetheless, the  diversions resulted in delays and related inconveniences for all passengers  on these flights.", "The Transportation Security Administration has acknowledged that  misidentifications can be embarrassing and time consuming for  individuals and also potentially can erode the public\u2019s confidence in the  agency\u2019s security efforts. Similarly, a recent Department of Homeland  Security report recognized that \u201cindividuals who are mistakenly put on  watch lists or who are misidentified as being on these lists can potentially  face consequences ranging from inconvenience and delay to loss of  liberty.\u201d", "Also, an individual can experience an immediate delay at a port of entry  when U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s automated search of the  Interagency Border Inspection System database returns a potential match  to a terrorist watch list record. For such potential matches, U.S. Customs  and Border Protection\u2019s operating protocol is to escort the person to  another screening area for further questioning and inspection (a process  referred to as secondary screening). The length of time the person spends  in secondary screening can be several hours, depending partly on the  difficulty or ease of verifying whether the person is or is not the individual  on the watch list. In the four states we visited\u2014California, Michigan, New  York, and Texas\u2014U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers told us  that given the importance of the homeland security mission, their practice  is to err on the side of caution by conducting very thorough screenings.", "The effects of such misidentifications and the related secondary  screenings can be emotional as well as physical, as reflected in complaint  letters to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. A sample of 28 complaint  letters to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that we reviewed alleged a  range of effects, such as experiencing travel delays, which resulted in  missing airline flights and incurring additional travel costs; being  subjected to extensive questioning and searches, while not being allowed  to contact family members, friends, or business associates to inform them  about the delays; and feeling embarrassed and frustrated.", "The State Department\u2019s screening of nonimmigrant visa applicants against  the terrorist watch list may not affect individuals in the same way as does  screening by the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs  and Border Protection. Generally, the State Department\u2019s screening differs  from other screening agencies because there is more time to search  records and make decisions. According to State Department officials, the  average time for processing a nonimmigrant visa application is about 2  days. However, additional processing time may be needed if initial  screening of the applicant shows a possible link to terrorism\u2014that is, the  applicant\u2019s name possibly matches that of a person whose name is on the  terrorist watch list. The officials explained that this additional processing  time is needed because a decision on the visa applicant cannot be made  until a security advisory opinion is obtained. That is, the consular post  must ask the Department of State headquarters in Washington, D.C., to  initiate a process of requesting that various agencies check their  respective databases or systems for the existence of any investigative or  intelligence information regarding the individual and pass the results back  to a central point. This interagency review process includes the FBI, the  Drug Enforcement Administration, the Central Intelligence Agency, and  others. According to State Department officials, visa applicants are  routinely told not to buy tickets or incur other travel-related expenses  until the clearance process has been completed and the application  approved.", "In acknowledging that the interagency review process may extend the  processing time for a visa decision, the State Department provided us (in  June 2006) the following contextual perspectives:  In the last 2 years, the department and its interagency partners have  worked to decrease the processing time in order to reduce the impact on  the traveling public.", "Nevertheless, the department\u2019s position is that the time it takes to screen a  visa applicant is a necessary part of the application procedure and,  therefore, is not an adverse governmental action. At times, additional  processing must be done in order to determine whether a visa applicant is  eligible for a visa under the law, including for national security reasons.  The additional processing is the inconvenient consequence of the proper  functioning of the visa screening system.", "Moreover, the extended processing time generally is a one-time  occurrence. Once an alien is cleared through the process, the clearance is  noted in the department\u2019s consular visa database. Thus, this person may  not be subject to the same processing delay when applying for another  visa in the future, unless additional investigative or intelligence  information arises after issuance of the first visa.", "Screening by state and local law enforcement also differs from screening  by the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection, and the State Department. Essentially, federal agencies (or air  carriers, as applicable) initiate screening when individuals make an airline  reservation, arrive at a port of entry, or apply for a visa. In contrast, a state  or local law enforcement agency may initiate screening by, for example,  pulling over a motorist for speeding. Generally, a routine procedure for the  law enforcement officer is to query the motorist\u2019s name against records in  the National Crime Information Center, which contains criminal history  records as well as terrorist watch list records. According to congressional  testimony presented in March 2004 by the Director of Public Security for  the State of New York, it takes about 12 to 15 minutes, on average, for a  New York patrol officer to contact the Terrorist Screening Center and  resolve a potential name match. More recently, in July 2006, the Director  of the Terrorist Screening Center told us that the average time nationally is  now down to about 5 minutes\u2014that is, the time period beginning with the  center\u2019s receipt of the call from a state or local law enforcement officer  and ending with the response to the officer regarding the potential name  match."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Misidentifications Occur Because of Similarities to Names on the Terrorist Watch List; Agencies Are Attempting to Reduce the Incidence of Misidentifications or Otherwise Facilitate Individuals through the Screening Process", "paragraphs": ["The most common cause of misidentifications is similarity of the names of  persons being checked to names on the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s  consolidated watch list, for which there is no complete remedy, but  agencies are taking actions to minimize the effect on frequently  misidentified persons. The Terrorist Screening Center has formed an  interagency group to improve the effectiveness of identity matching across  agencies and also has ongoing initiatives regarding data quality. As a  future enhancement, the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s strategy is to  develop the capability to link name-based watch list searches to relevant  biometric systems maintained by other agencies, although this capability  may be more useful for confirming positive matches than for reducing the  incidence of misidentifications."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Misidentifications Result Because a Traveler\u2019s Name Is Similar to Someone with a Terrorist Watch List Record", "paragraphs": ["Misidentifications occur most often because the names of some persons  being screened are the same or similar to those in the consolidated  terrorist watch list. To handle the large volumes of travelers and others  who must be screened, federal agencies and most airlines use computer- driven algorithms to rapidly compare the names of individuals against the  applicable terrorist watch list records. A primary factor in designing a  computerized name-matching process is the need to minimize the  possibility of generating false negatives\u2014that is, failing to identify an  individual whose name is on the terrorist watch list\u2014without generating  an unacceptable number of false positives (misidentifications). To help  ensure that name-based screening does not miss detecting someone who is  on the watch list, agencies and airlines may configure their algorithms in  such a way that they return a broad set of possible matches for any given  name input. For instance, the computerized algorithms may account for  differences in names due to misspellings or transcription errors.", "Operationally, for each name that is screened against the watch list, the  computerized algorithm may return a list of possible matches. If  applicable, screening agency or airline security personnel then review  these results of possible matching records arrayed by probability scores to  determine which, if any, is a positive match with the person being  screened. To help ensure awareness of best practices among agencies, the  Terrorist Screening Center has formed and chairs a working group\u2014the  Federal Identity Match Search Engine Performance Standards Working  Group\u2014which met initially in December 2005. An objective of the  working group is to provide voluntary guidance for federal agencies that  use identity-matching search engine technology. Essentially, the  prospective guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of identity  matching across agencies by, among other means, assessing which  algorithms or search engines are the most effective for screening specific  types or categories of names.

In  this regard, the officials explained that the center\u2019s standard operating  practices include at least two opportunities to review records. First,  Terrorist Screening Center staff\u2014including subject matter experts  detailed to the center from other agencies\u2014review each incoming record  submitted (nominated) to the center for inclusion in the consolidated  watch list.

One way that holds promise, where applicable, is to use  additional personal-identifying information to enhance name-based  searching. For example, as part of its efforts to develop the Secure Flight  program, the Transportation Security Administration conducted tests  between November 2004 and April 2005 to determine what combinations  of names and associated personal-identifying attributes were most  effective in matching airline passenger data against terrorist watch list  records.

However, the Terrorist Screening Center  presently does not have this capability, although use of biometric  information to supplement name-based screening is planned as a future  enhancement. Specifically, the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s strategy is not  to replicate existing biometric data systems. Rather, the center\u2019s strategy,  according to the director and principal deputy director, is to develop a  \u201cpointer\u201d capability to facilitate the online linking of name-based searches  to relevant biometric systems, such as the FBI\u2019s Integrated Automated  Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS)\u2014a computerized system for  storing, comparing, and exchanging fingerprint data in a digital format,  which contains the largest criminal biometric database in the world.  Center officials recognize that even biometric systems have screening  limitations, such as relevant federal agencies may have no fingerprints or  other biometrics to correlate with many of the biographical records in the  center\u2019s consolidated database. For instance, watch list records may be  based on intelligence gathered by electronic wire taps or other methods  that involve no opportunity to obtain biometric data.

Center  officials noted that collecting and using biometric information on innocent  persons would raise significant privacy concerns, which would have to be  thoroughly considered in interagency discussions and weighed against the  possible benefits.", "Presently, the Department of Homeland Security uses biometric data for  operating various programs to screen travelers, one of which is a required- enrollment program for selected foreign nationals who travel to the United  States and others are voluntary-enrollment or trusted-traveler programs.  However, enrollment in these programs, whether required or voluntary,  does not exempt individuals from being screened against the terrorist  watch list. As mentioned previously, for instance, the watch list is  dynamic, changing frequently with additions, deletions, and modifications.", "The required-enrollment program that uses biometric data is the U.S.  Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program,  which is an entry/exit tracking system designed to collect, maintain, and  share information on selected foreign nationals who travel to the United  States. The program uses a related system\u2014the Automated Biometrics  Identification System (IDENT), developed by the former Immigration and  Naturalization Service\u2014to collect two fingerprints (right and left index  fingers) and a digital photograph to provide for the biometric  identification of visitors. Required enrollment in the US-VISIT program is  conducted by the Department of State at visa-issuing consulates before the  visitors depart or by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at ports of entry  when the visitors arrive. American citizens, permanent legal residents,  Canadian nationals, and Mexican nationals with border-crossing cards are  not required to submit to US-VISIT screening at ports of entry. In July  2006, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General provided  an update on progress toward achieving biometric interoperability  between IDENT and IAFIS.

Also, a benefit of these programs  from a watch list perspective is that U.S. Customs and Border Protection  has greater assurance of the identity of the enrollees and that these  individuals are not persons on the watch list. Enrollment in a trusted- traveler program does not exempt individuals from being screened against  the terrorist watch list; although, according to U.S. Customs and Border  Protection officials, enrollment does mitigate the possibility of the  individuals being misidentified and selected for more extensive screening  at ports of entry.

If the determination is \u201cno\u201d\u2014that is, the  person is not actually on the watch list but was misidentified because of a  name similarity to someone who is on the terrorist watch list\u2014the  frontline-screening agency is responsible for resolving the complaint and  responding to the misidentified individual.", "If the frontline-screening agency\u2019s determination is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014which includes  not only definite matches but also any potential or \u201cmaybe\u201d matches that  require additional research to confirm\u2014the frontline agency is to refer the  redress query to the Terrorist Screening Center. Then, the center is to  check its database to determine whether the individual is indeed on the  terrorist watch list or whether the person is misidentified with someone  on the watch list. If the person is actually on the terrorist watch list, the  Terrorist Screening Center is to consult with applicable intelligence  community and law enforcement agencies to assess whether the person is  appropriately listed and should remain on the watch list or is mistakenly  listed and should be removed from the list. In either instance, the center is  to inform the applicable frontline-screening agency, which is responsible  for responding to the individual. If the complainant is a misidentified  person, the Terrorist Screening Center is to send the redress query back to  the applicable frontline-screening agency for that agency to resolve. Also,  as part of its quality-assurance efforts, the center is to review the  underlying watch list record that caused the person\u2019s adverse experience  to determine, for example, the record\u2019s validity or whether a modification  is needed, including possible removal of the record. Finally, any referrals  received by the Terrorist Screening Center not related to its mission\u2014that  is, \u201cother issues\u201d with no nexus to terrorism such as complaints involving  employee misconduct or random screening\u2014are to be sent back to the  applicable frontline-screening agency, which is to provide a response to  the individual.", "In January 2005, the Terrorist Screening Center established its formal  redress process.

However, if the basis for ineligibility  is terrorism\u2014under section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act, as amended\u2014the consular officer normally would not be  able to explain the reasons behind the denial because of national security  grounds.", "According to Bureau of Consular Affairs officials, the State Department  does have an agency-initiated process for removing erroneous or outdated  information from the Consular Lookout and Support System. In explaining  why the correction-of-records process is initiated by the agency and not  the visa applicant, the officials commented substantially as follows:    Visa applicants usually would not even know whether their names are on  the terrorist watch list. If a visa application results in the overseas post\u2019s  requesting a security advisory opinion and additional screening, the  applicant might think that any processing delay is due to a record entry in  the Consular Lookout and Support System. However, the additional  screening could be due to reasons other than terrorism, such as a criminal  record, a contagious disease, or simply an overstay on a previous visa.", "Thus, any deletion of entries from the Consular Lookout and Support  System normally would be initiated by the consular officer in the field.  That is, if the consular officer determines\u2014based on evidence presented  during the course of a visa application\u2014that an entry in the Consular  Lookout and Support System is incorrect or has been overtaken by events,  the officer is to initiate action to have the entry deleted from the system.", "Also, the Bureau of Consular Affairs officials noted that there has been an  occasional complaint that despite the issuance of a visa, the alien  experienced difficulties at a U.S. port of entry because, for example,  screening by U.S. Customs and Border Protection showed a potential  match with a terrorist watch list record. Regarding these instances, the  officials said that based on an interest in data integrity and customer  service, the department works with the Terrorist Screening Center to  review relevant records and determine an appropriate course of action,  which could consist of a watch list message or annotation specifying that  the alien is not a person on the watch list. In addition, as discussed  previously, the State Department is taking steps to annotate its database  when it screens individuals and finds that they are not on the watch list.  Such annotations are intended to expedite visa processing in the future  and limit the incidence of misidentifications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Department of Justice Is Leading an Effort to Finalize an Interagency Agreement to Help Ensure That Effective Redress Is Available", "paragraphs": ["The Terrorist Screening Center and the frontline-screening agencies have  interdependent responsibilities in providing redress for individuals who  are inadvertently and adversely affected by watch list screening. The  availability of redress is important for all affected persons, including  persons who are misidentified because of name similarities and to persons  who contend that they are mistakenly included on the terrorist watch list.  For any given watch-list-related complaint or redress query, providing  relief can necessitate interaction among several governmental agencies.  For instance, if the query involves a person who is mistakenly listed,  relevant redress participants could include the Terrorist Screening Center  and a frontline-screening agency as well as the agency that originally  submitted or nominated the person\u2019s name for inclusion in the  consolidated terrorist watch list. Nominating agencies include the FBI and  various agencies within the intelligence community, such as the Central  Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National  Security Agency.", "To help ensure that opportunities for terrorist-watch-list-related redress  are implemented effectively, the Department of Justice is leading an  effort\u2014which has been ongoing since fall 2005\u2014to develop and finalize an  interagency memorandum of understanding. Key purposes of the final  memorandum of understanding include ensuring that opportunities for  redress are formally documented and that agency responsibilities are  clear, with designated officials accountable for supporting the continued  success of the processes. The Department of Justice has a lead role in  developing the memorandum of understanding because the Terrorist  Screening Center has primary responsibility for the consolidated terrorist- screening database. Interagency partners in the effort to develop the  memorandum of understanding include the Department of Homeland  Security, the Department of State, and the National Counterterrorism  Center.", "Also, another entity involved in developing the memorandum of  understanding is the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which is  part of the Executive Office of the President and consists of five members  appointed by the president. According to the board\u2019s executive director,  the terrorist watch list redress process is a top priority for the board. The  executive director noted that since June 2006 board staff have attended all  meetings of the interagency partners engaged in developing the  memorandum of understanding. This official opined that the board\u2019s  participation has helped reprioritize this matter among the constituent  agencies and that the board is committed to continuing its involvement.", "According to Department of Justice officials, a final draft of the  memorandum of understanding is expected to be ready for interagency  clearances by fall 2006. Terrorist Screening Center officials emphasized  that the interagency memorandum of understanding was definitely  needed, particularly as a mechanism for ensuring the accuracy of the  watch list. The center officials noted, for instance, that there have been  disagreements at times between agencies over nominations to the watch  list. Thus, in handling watch-list-related complaints, the center officials  explained that the interagency memorandum of understanding could help  by clearly outlining a process for coordinating with the National  Counterterrorism Center and nominating agencies to validate the accuracy  and appropriateness of watch list records.", "Moreover, the Terrorist Screening Center officials explained that the  interagency memorandum of understanding could help resolve significant  watch-list-related redress differences among the frontline-screening  agencies. Examples regarding Department of Homeland Security  components are as follows:    The Transportation Security Administration has an office specifically  designated for redress issues, with an accountable official\u2014the Director,  Office of Transportation Security Redress. Also, the office has followed  consistent procedures in referring appropriate watch-list-related  complaints to the Terrorist Screening Center.", "In contrast, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not have a clearly  designated official accountable for redress, and the agency has not always  followed consistent procedures in referring appropriate watch-list-related  complaints to the Terrorist Screening Center.", "Additionally, regarding the State Department, the Terrorist Screening  Center officials stressed the importance of having clearly established  procedures and responsibilities. The center officials noted that even  though the State Department\u2019s operational context is somewhat different  than that of other frontline-screening agencies, the department  nonetheless has a substantial volume of interactions with the Terrorist  Screening Center. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs officials  acknowledged to us the value of having an interagency memorandum of  understanding that specifies standard operating procedures for redress  and designates points of contact. In this regard, the State Department  officials commented that they have been participating in meetings with the  Terrorist Screening Center and other interagency partners to discuss the  proposed memorandum of understanding. According to the officials, a  benefit to the State Department expected from the interagency agreement  would be clearly established and coordinated procedures for removing\u2014 from the department\u2019s Consular Lookout and Support System and the  Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s consolidated watch list\u2014any name that is  mistakenly listed or has been overtaken by subsequent events."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Homeland security measures affect all travelers to some extent. Thus, it  may be argued that travel delays and other inconveniencies resulting from  terrorist watch-list-related screening can be viewed as regrettable but  inevitable consequences of enhanced security. However, name-based  screening and its inherent limitations\u2014even full names, in most cases, are  hardly unique identifiers\u2014may result in disproportionate impact on  individuals who repeatedly are singled out for additional screening for no  other reason than the similarity of their names to someone on the watch  list.", "The Terrorist Screening Center and its interagency partners are  undertaking a number of efforts, including data-quality initiatives, to  reduce the occurrence and/or impact of watch list screening on U.S.  citizens and visitors who do not necessarily merit additional scrutiny and  the associated inconveniences. A continuing challenge for the center will  be ensuring that the consolidated watch list contains accurate data,  particularly given that the database is dynamic, changing frequently with  additions, deletions, and modifications. The efforts of an interagency  working group to improve the effectiveness of name-matching computer  algorithms may offer some promise for reducing the number of people  who experience unintended, adverse effects. However, any policy trade-off  considerations regarding use of algorithms likely will favor ensuring  homeland security over minimizing inconveniences to travelers. Regarding  future operations, the Terrorist Screening Center is actively considering  approaches for using biometric data to supplement name-based searches,  although the availability of appropriate technology is an issue that has long  confronted the interagency screening community.", "In any event, despite the best efforts of the interagency community to  maintain a fully accurate watch list and to conduct screening efficiently,  there likely will be continuing unintended consequences. Thus, it is  appropriate for the Terrorist Screening Center and its interagency partners  to continue their efforts to provide effective redress for both mistakenly  listed persons and misidentified persons. Indeed, redress queries have  already resulted in the removal of several mistakenly listed names from  the watch list. Comparatively, however, the issue of redress arises more  commonly regarding the thousands of persons who are not on the watch  list but are misidentified and adversely affected because of a name  similarity. Whether appropriate relief is being afforded these individuals is  still an open question, for several reasons. For example, although a core  element of the redress provided by the Transportation Security  Administration is the maintenance of a cleared list, there are some  indications that the cleared list is not working as intended to reduce  delays for air passengers in obtaining boarding passes. Prospectively, the  Transportation Security Administration expects that development and  implementation of the Secure Flight program will help ensure consistent  and effective use of the cleared list among air carriers, although the  agency has not publicly disclosed its future plans for the program.", "Another frontline-screening agency\u2019s initiative, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection\u2019s database-annotation initiative, may prove to be an even more  efficient approach for assisting frequently misidentified individuals. Unlike  the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s cleared list procedures, the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s initiative is based on records in the  agency\u2019s database and does not necessitate any filing of forms and other  documentation by travelers. At the time of our review, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection was planning to develop a capability to monitor the  effectiveness of the initiative. This planning effort is particularly  important, given that the initiative may eventually prove to be a model for  a proactive solution if it functions as intended.", "Finally, an overarching factor regarding whether appropriate relief is being  afforded to persons inadvertently and adversely affected by terrorist  watch-list-related screening is the absence of an interagency agreement to  help ensure that, among other matters, redress procedures and  responsibilities are clearly documented and implemented effectively. The  Terrorist Screening Center and its interagency partners are working to  address this fundamental deficiency and have indicated their intent to  provide the public with updated information on the availability of redress,  after finalization of an agreement.", "We are not making recommendations at this time because the agencies  have ongoing efforts to improve data quality and otherwise either reduce  the number of misidentifications or mitigate their effects and to provide  more effective redress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comments to the departments of  Homeland Security, State, and Justice.

Similarly, in following federal guidance, airlines may also resolve  some misidentifications without involving the Transportation Security  Administration or necessitating subsequent referrals to the Terrorist  Screening Center.

Most agencies have redress offices (e.g.,  Ombudsman) where individuals who are experiencing repeated problems  can seek help.

Misidentified persons are sometimes delayed while  the government works to distinguish them from the terrorist in the  terrorist-screening database. Because these delays are frustrating and  inconvenient, there are several initiatives in progress to help streamline  the clearance process for misidentified persons. If an individual believes  he/she is having a misidentification problem, he/she should contact the  screening agency\u2019s redress office for assistance.", "Are individuals removed from the terrorist-screening database?", "Yes.

The Terrorist Screening Center conducts research and  coordinates with other federal agencies to ensure the terrorist record is as  complete, accurate, and thorough as possible.
