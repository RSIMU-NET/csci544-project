IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone, online, in person, and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers. IRS's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel.", "IRS has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication, including developing an authentication strategy with high-level strategic efforts. However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system.", "IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters. While IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) new guidance for secure digital authentication, it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by June 2018, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, IRS may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner. Further, IRS lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies. Industry representatives, financial institutions, and government officials told GAO that the best authentication approach relies on multiple strategies and sources of information, while giving taxpayers options for actively protecting their identity. Evaluating alternatives for taxpayer authentication will help IRS avoid missing opportunities for improving authentication."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s  (IRS) efforts to monitor and improve taxpayer authentication. In fiscal year  2017, IRS issued approximately $383 billion in individual tax refunds,  including overpayment refunds and refundable tax credits, an increase of  about $16 billion from the previous fiscal year. In an environment with an  increasing risk of fraud, identity theft (IDT), and cyberattacks, IRS must  ensure that its preventative security controls provide the agency with  reasonable assurance that it is interacting with the legitimate taxpayer.  Authentication\u2014the process by which IRS verifies taxpayers are who they  claim to be\u2014is a critical step in both protecting sensitive taxpayer  information and preventing potentially billions of dollars of refunds from  being paid to fraudsters each year. According to IRS\u2019s most recent data, it  estimates that in 2016, at least $12.2 billion in IDT tax refund fraud was  attempted; of this amount, at least $1.6 billion was paid out to fraudsters.", "IRS\u2019s ability to continuously monitor its current authentication methods  while also looking ahead to new identity verification technologies is critical  to keeping ahead of fraudsters, who constantly adapt their schemes to  thwart IRS\u2019s defenses. The agency must also strike a balance in  designing its authentication programs. Authentication must be strong  enough to prevent fraudsters from gaining access to IRS services using  stolen personally identifiable information, without being overly  burdensome on legitimate taxpayers who also must authenticate.", "My remarks today highlight selected findings of our June 2018 report on  IRS\u2019s efforts monitor and improve taxpayer authentication. Specifically,  this testimony addresses (1) IRS\u2019s efforts to address its authentication  challenges, (2) IRS\u2019s progress in implementing its authentication strategy,  and (3) additional steps we identified that IRS could take to enhance its  authentication programs and stay ahead of fraudsters.", "To conduct the work for our June report, we reviewed IRS documents and  information related to taxpayer authentication including authentication  policies, risk assessments, and performance metrics. We compared IRS\u2019s  authentication efforts to applicable activities in the IRS Identity Assurance  Strategy and Roadmap (Roadmap), Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, and relevant National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) guidance, among others. We also interviewed IRS  officials knowledgeable about the agency\u2019s taxpayer authentication  programs, as well as IRS, state, and industry co-leads from two Security  Summit workgroups to understand IRS\u2019s collaborative efforts to improve  taxpayer authentication. To assess how IRS can improve its  authentication programs going forward, we met with knowledgeable  officials from NIST to discuss its guidelines for online identity-proofing and  authentication. We also compared IRS\u2019s authentication programs and  plans for future improvements to its Roadmap, federal internal controls,  guidance from NIST and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  principles for project planning, and our prior work on information  technology investment management and cost estimating. We also  interviewed officials from three other federal agencies and a  nongeneralizable selection of representatives from state revenue offices,  industry, and financial institutions to understand the range of  authentication technologies other organizations are using. Our report  includes a detailed explanation of the methods used to conduct our work.  The work on which this testimony is based was performed in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In brief, Madam Chairman, our work found that IRS has taken some steps  to improve taxpayer authentication, including working with external  partners to identify solutions for combating IDT refund fraud and  developing an authentication strategy to address its most pressing  authentication challenges. However, we also found that IRS has not  prioritized the initiatives supporting its authentication strategy nor  identified the resources required to complete them. Further, we found that  IRS does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement NIST\u2019s  new guidance for secure online authentication and also lacks a  comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication  technologies, which could provide taxpayers additional options to actively  protect their identity. We made 11 recommendations to address these  and other weaknesses identified in our report. IRS agreed with all 11  recommendations and stated that it is taking action to address them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Has Broad Efforts Underway to Address Authentication Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Our report noted that IRS has established organizational structures  essential to supporting its taxpayer authentication efforts. Specifically,  IRS created an Identity Assurance Office (IAO) in 2015 to work with  stakeholders across IRS to review and assess the agency\u2019s various  authentication programs and efforts. In 2016, IAO led an effort that  identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require  authentication and categorized these interactions based on potential risks  to the agency and taxpayers. Further, in December 2016, IAO released  its Roadmap for developing a modern and secure authentication  environment for all taxpayers regardless of how they interact with IRS\u2014 online, over the telephone, in person, or via correspondence.", "We also found that IRS is working to address its authentication  challenges by collaborating with industry members and state partners via  the Security Summit. The Security Summit was established in 2015 as an  ongoing effort between industry experts from tax software companies,  paid preparers, financial institutions, and states to improve information  sharing and fraud detection and to address common IDT challenges. The  Security Summit\u2019s authentication workgroup leads several initiatives  aimed at verifying the authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return at the  time of filing. One initiative involves analyzing data elements\u2014such as  trusted customer requirements and other characteristics of the return\u2014 that are collected during the tax return preparation and electronic filing  process. In addition, in 2016 the authentication workgroup recommended  improved account password standards to help protect taxpayers\u2019  accounts from being taken over by criminals.", "Overall, we found that officials\u2014representing IRS, industry, and states\u2014 expressed positive views about the level of commitment and cooperation  guiding the group\u2019s authentication efforts. Officials with whom we spoke  stated that they are dedicated to continuing to address authentication  issues collaboratively because they have a mutual interest in improving  authentication to reduce tax refund fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Begun to Implement Its Authentication Strategy, but Has Not Articulated Priorities and Resource Needs", "paragraphs": ["In its Roadmap, IRS outlined six core authentication objectives, 10 high- level strategic efforts, and 14 foundational initiatives to help it address  authentication challenges and identify opportunities for future investment.  While we found that IRS has made progress on some efforts identified in  its Roadmap, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor  identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with  program management leading practices.", "For example, one of IRS\u2019s foundational initiatives is to send event-driven  notifications to taxpayers, such as when they file a return or request a tax  transcript. Such notifications could help IRS and taxpayers detect  potentially fraudulent activity at the earliest stage and help improve  authentication of tax returns. The Roadmap identifies seven supporting  activities for this foundational initiative. One is to provide taxpayers with  greater control over their online accounts. Another supporting activity is to  determine methods for sending notifications to taxpayers about activity on  their account.", "However, IRS has not identified the resources required to complete these  activities, and the Roadmap notes that six of the seven activities will take  between 6 months to 3 years to complete. In December 2017, IRS  officials stated that they had developed business requirements for the  foundational initiative to give taxpayers greater control over their online  accounts. However, IRS has not identified funding for the initiative\u2019s other  supporting activities\u2014such as developing requirements to send push  notifications to taxpayers\u2014and implementation will depend on the  availability of future resources.", "In December 2017, IRS officials stated that each of the strategic efforts  and foundational initiatives identified in the Roadmap are a high priority,  and they are working to address them concurrently while balancing the  availability of resources against the greatest threats to the tax  environment. As noted in our report, we recognize that a strategy is  necessarily high-level and that IRS must remain flexible and use available resources to respond to unexpected threats. Identifying resources and  prioritizing activities in its Roadmap will help IRS clarify tradeoffs between  costs, benefits, and risks and aid in decision making.", "Further, such efforts may also help IRS establish clearer timelines and  better respond to unexpected events. As such, we recommended that  IRS estimate the resources (i.e., financial and human) required for the  foundational initiatives and supporting activities identified in its Roadmap  and prioritize its foundational initiatives. IRS agreed with our  recommendations and is currently working to finalize its overall  authentication approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Actions Could Help IRS Enhance Security and Stay Ahead of Fraudsters", "paragraphs": ["Given the widespread availability of personally identifiable information  that fraudsters can use to perpetrate tax fraud, it is essential for IRS to  further strengthen taxpayer authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters\u2019  schemes. In our report, we identified two additional areas that IRS must  address to better position the agency and protect taxpayers against future  threats.", "First, we found that IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement NIST\u2019s  June 2017 guidance for secure online authentication, however it had not  yet established detailed plans, including timelines, milestone dates, and  resource needs to fully implement it. Among other things, NIST\u2019s new  guidance directs agencies to assess the risk for each component of  identity assurance\u2014identity proofing, authentication, and federation\u2014 rather than conducting a single risk assessment for the entire process.  According to NIST officials, this approach gives agencies flexibility in  choosing technical solutions; aligns with existing, standards-based market  offerings; is modular and cost-effective; and enhances individual privacy.  In short, following NIST\u2019s new guidance will help provide IRS with better  risk-based assurance that the person trying to access IRS\u2019s online  services is who they claim to be.", "As noted in our report, IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement the  new NIST guidance. These efforts include forming a task force to guide  IRS\u2019s implementation of NIST guidance and working with the Security  Summit to develop an implementation framework for state and industry  partners. IRS has also begun analyzing gaps between IRS\u2019s current  authentication procedures and the new guidance. In addition, in  December 2017, IRS implemented a more secure online authentication  option consistent with the new guidance through its mobile application,  IRS2Go. After taxpayers link their IRS online account with the mobile app,  they can use it to generate a security code to log into their account. This  option provides taxpayers with an alternative to receiving the security  code via a text message, which NIST considers to be less secure.", "We recommended that IRS develop a plan\u2014including a timeline,  milestone dates, and resources needed\u2014for implementing changes to its  online authentication programs consistent with new NIST guidance, and  also implement these improvements. IRS agreed with our  recommendations, but noted that its ability to complete these efforts will  depend on the availability of resources.", "Second, we found that IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to  identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and  approaches. Our discussions with representatives from industry and  financial institutions and with government officials indicate that there is no  single, ideal online authentication solution that will solve IRS\u2019s challenges  related to IDT refund fraud. These representatives advocate an approach  to authentication that relies on multiple strategies and sources of  information, while giving taxpayers options for further protecting their  information.", "We identified several authentication options in our report that IRS could  consider, including the following:", "Possession-based authentication. This type of authentication offers  users a convenient, added layer of security when used as a second  factor for accessing websites or systems that would otherwise rely on  a username and password for single-factor authentication. For  example, as noted in our report, according to an industry official,  authentication using a trusted device or \u201csecurity key\u201d based on  Universal Second Factor standards complies with NIST\u2019s new  guidance for digital authentication. While IRS is not likely to provide  the devices to taxpayers, it could enable its systems to accept these  trusted devices as authenticators for taxpayers who elect to use them.", "Working with trusted partners. IRS could partner with organizations  it trusts that are accessible to taxpayers and enable the partners to  identity-proof and authenticate taxpayers. Trusted partners could  include tax preparers, financial institutions, or other federal or state  agencies. In the course of our work, IRS officials stated that they had  been exploring such options with both the Social Security  Administration and the U.S. Postal Service; however, at the time of  our report, the agencies had not yet made decisions about next steps.", "Expanding existing IRS services to further protect taxpayers. IRS  could expand the functionality of its online account to further protect  taxpayers from IDT refund fraud. For example, IRS could develop  additional functionality that allows the taxpayer to designate a bank  account or a preference for a paper check for receiving a tax refund. If  a fraudster filed a return with different information, the return would be  automatically rejected.", "IRS officials told us the agency continually researches new identity  assurance processes and technologies and has talked with other  agencies, industry groups, and vendors to better understand how  particular technology solutions could apply to IRS\u2019s environment.  However, during the course of our work, IRS could not provide us  evidence of a repeatable, comprehensive process to identify and evaluate  available authentication technologies and services. Such a process could  compare options for in-house authentication solutions with off-the-shelf  solutions based on estimates of cost, schedule, and benefits, as  applicable. To this end, we recommended that IRS develop a process to  identify and evaluate alternative options for improving taxpayer  authentication, including technologies in use by industry, states, or other  trusted partners; and based on this approach, include and prioritize these  options, as appropriate, in its Roadmap. IRS agreed with these  recommendations, but did not provide additional details on how it plans to  address them.", "In conclusion, IRS\u2019s authentication environment is one component of a  broad, complex information technology infrastructure, and we have  previously reported on the many challenges the agency faces as it  modernizes its tax systems. Taxpayer authentication has become more  difficult with the wide availability of personally identifiable information and  fraudsters\u2019 ability to develop more complex and sophisticated methods to  commit fraud undetected. Addressing the issues we describe above could  better position IRS to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in its  authentication efforts and better protect taxpayers and the Treasury.", "Chairman Jenkins, Ranking Member Lewis, and members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared remarks.
