This includes increasing computer interconnectivity, particularly through the widespread use of the Internet as a medium of communication and commerce. While providing significant benefits, this increased interconnectivity can also create vulnerabilities to cyber-based threats. Pervasive and sustained cyber attacks against the United States could have a potentially devastating impact on federal and nonfederal systems, disrupting the operations of governments and businesses and the lives of private individuals. Accordingly, GAO has designated federal information security as a governmentwide high-risk area since 1997, and in 2003 expanded it to include protecting systems and assets vital to the nation (referred to as critical infrastructures).", "GAO is providing a statement that describes (1) cyber threats facing the nation\u0092s systems, (2) vulnerabilities present in federal information systems and systems supporting critical infrastructure, and (3) reported cyber incidents and their impacts. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on previously published work in these areas and reviewed more recent GAO, agency, and inspectors general work, as well as reports on security incidents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The nation faces an evolving array of cyber-based threats arising from a variety of sources. These threats can be intentional or unintentional. Unintentional threats can be caused by software upgrades or defective equipment that inadvertently disrupt systems, and intentional threats can be both targeted and untargeted attacks from a variety of threat sources. Sources of threats include criminal groups, hackers, terrorists, organization insiders, and foreign nations engaged in crime, political activism, or espionage and information warfare. These threat sources vary in terms of the capabilities of the actors, their willingness to act, and their motives, which can include monetary gain or political advantage, among others. Moreover, potential threat actors have a variety of attack techniques at their disposal, which can adversely affect computers, software, a network, an organization\u0092s operation, an industry, or the Internet itself. The nature of cyber attacks can vastly enhance their reach and impact due to the fact that attackers do not need to be physically close to their victims and can more easily remain anonymous, among other things. The magnitude of the threat is compounded by the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber attack techniques, such as attacks that may combine multiple techniques. Using these techniques, threat actors may target individuals, businesses, critical infrastructures, or government organizations.", "The threat posed by cyber attacks is heightened by vulnerabilities in federal systems and systems supporting critical infrastructure. Specifically, significant weaknesses in information security controls continue to threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and information systems supporting the operations, assets, and personnel of federal government agencies. For example, 18 of 24 major federal agencies have reported inadequate information security controls for financial reporting for fiscal year 2011, and inspectors general at 22 of these agencies identified information security as a major management challenge for their agency. Moreover, GAO, agency, and inspector general assessments of information security controls during fiscal year 2011 revealed that most major agencies had weaknesses in most major categories of information system controls. In addition, GAO has identified vulnerabilities in systems that monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions supporting the nation\u0092s critical infrastructures. These and similar weaknesses can be exploited by threat actors, with potentially severe effects.", "The number of cybersecurity incidents reported by federal agencies continues to rise, and recent incidents illustrate that these pose serious risk. Over the past 6 years, the number of incidents reported by federal agencies to the federal information security incident center has increased by nearly 680 percent. These incidents include unauthorized access to systems; improper use of computing resources; and the installation of malicious software, among others. Reported attacks and unintentional incidents involving federal, private, and infrastructure systems demonstrate that the impact of a serious attack could be significant, including loss of personal or sensitive information, disruption or destruction of critical infrastructure, and damage to national and economic security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has previously made recommendations to resolve identified significant control deficiencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today\u2019s hearing on the cyber- based threats facing our nation.", "The increasing dependency upon information technology (IT) systems  and networked operations pervades nearly every aspect of our society. In  particular, increasing computer interconnectivity\u2014most notably growth in  the use of the Internet\u2014has revolutionized the way that our government,  our nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business.  While bringing significant benefits, this dependency can also create  vulnerabilities to cyber-based threats. Pervasive and sustained cyber  attacks against the United States could have a potentially devastating  impact on federal and nonfederal systems and operations. In January  2012, the Director of National Intelligence testified that such threats pose  a critical national and economic security concern. These growing and  evolving threats can potentially affect all segments of our society\u2014 individuals; private businesses; local, state, and federal governments; and  other entities. Underscoring the importance of this issue, we have  designated federal information security as a high-risk area since 1997  and in 2003 expanded this area to include protecting computerized  systems supporting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.", "In my testimony today, I will describe (1) cyber threats facing the nation\u2019s  systems, (2) vulnerabilities present in federal systems and systems  supporting critical infrastructure, and (3) reported cyber incidents and their impacts. In preparing this statement in April 2012, we relied on our  previous work in these areas. (Please see the related GAO products in  appendix I.) These products contain detailed overviews of the scope and  methodology we used. We also reviewed more recent agency, inspector  general, and GAO assessments of security vulnerabilities at federal  agencies and information on security incidents from the U.S. Computer  Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), media reports, and other  publicly available sources. The work on which this statement is based  was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform  audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provided a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As computer technology has advanced, both government and private  entities have become increasingly dependent on computerized  information systems to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and  report essential information. Public and private organizations rely on  computer systems to transmit sensitive and proprietary information,  develop and maintain intellectual capital, conduct operations, process  business transactions, transfer funds, and deliver services. In addition,  the Internet has grown increasingly important to American business and  consumers, serving as a medium for hundreds of billions of dollars of  commerce each year, as well as developing into an extended information  and communications infrastructure supporting vital services such as  power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense.", "Consequently, the security of these systems and networks is essential to  protecting national and economic security, public health and safety, and  the flow of commerce. Conversely, ineffective information security  controls can result in significant risks, including  loss or theft of resources, such as federal payments and collections;  inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of  sensitive information, such as national security information, personal  taxpayer information, or proprietary business information; disruption of critical operations supporting critical infrastructure,  national defense, or emergency services; undermining of agency missions due to embarrassing incidents that  erode the public\u2019s confidence in government; and use of computer resources for unauthorized purposes or to launch  attacks on other computers systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Nation Faces an Evolving Array of Cyber-Based Threats", "paragraphs": ["Cyber-based threats are evolving and growing and arise from a wide  array of sources. These threats can be unintentional or intentional.  Unintentional threats can be caused by software upgrades or defective  equipment that inadvertently disrupt systems.

These threat  sources vary in terms of the capabilities of the actors, their willingness to  act, and their motives, which can include monetary gain or political  advantage, among others. Table 1 shows common sources of cyber  threats.", "These sources of cyber threats make use of various techniques, or  exploits, that may adversely affect computers, software, a network, an  organization\u2019s operation, an industry, or the Internet itself. Table 2  provides descriptions of common types of cyber exploits.", "The unique nature of cyber-based attacks can vastly enhance their reach  and impact. For example, cyber attackers do not need to be physically  close to their victims, technology allows attacks to easily cross state and  national borders, attacks can be carried out at high speed and directed at  a number of victims simultaneously, and cyber attackers can more easily  remain anonymous. Moreover, the use of these and other techniques is  becoming more sophisticated, with attackers using multiple or \u201cblended\u201d  approaches that combine two or more techniques. Using these  techniques, threat actors may target individuals, resulting in loss of  privacy or identity theft; businesses, resulting in the compromise of  proprietary information or intellectual capital; critical infrastructures,  resulting in their disruption or destruction; or government agencies,  resulting in the loss of sensitive information and damage to economic and  national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Supporting Federal Operations and Critical Infrastructure Are Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks", "paragraphs": ["Significant weaknesses in information security controls continue to  threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information  and information systems used to support the operations, assets, and  personnel of federal agencies. For example, in their performance and  accountability reports and annual financial reports for fiscal year 2011, 18  of 24 major federal agencies indicated that inadequate information  security controls were either material weaknesses or significant  deficiencies for financial reporting purposes. In addition, inspectors  general at 22 of the major agencies identified information security or  information system control as a major management challenge for their  agency.", "Agency, inspectors general, and GAO assessments of information  security controls during fiscal year 2011 revealed that most major federal  agencies had weaknesses in most of the five major categories of  information system controls: (1) access controls, which ensure that only  authorized individuals can read, alter, or delete data; (2) configuration  management controls, which provide assurance that only authorized  software programs are implemented; (3) segregation of duties, which  reduces the risk that one individual can independently perform  inappropriate actions without detection; (4) continuity of operations  planning, which helps avoid significant disruptions in computer-dependent  operations; and (5) agencywide information security programs, which  provide a framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that  effective controls are selected and implemented. Figure 1 shows the  number of agencies that had vulnerabilities in these five information  security control categories.", "Over the past several years, we and agency inspectors general have  made hundreds of recommendations to resolve similar previously  identified significant control deficiencies. We have also recommended  that agencies fully implement comprehensive, agencywide information  security programs, including by correcting weaknesses in specific areas  of their programs. The effective implementation of these  recommendations will strengthen the security posture at these agencies.", "In addition, securing the control systems that monitor and control  sensitive processes and physical functions supporting many of our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures is a national priority, and we have identified  vulnerabilities in these systems. For example, in September 2007, we  reported that critical infrastructure control systems faced increasing risks  due to cyber threats, system vulnerabilities, and the serious potential  impact of possible attacks.infrastructure owners faced both technical and organizational challenges  to securing control systems, such as limited processing capabilities and  developing compelling business cases for investing in control systems  security, among others. We further identified federal initiatives under way  to help secure these control systems, but noted that more needed to be  done to coordinate these efforts and address shortfalls. We made  recommendations to the Department of Homeland Security to develop a  strategy for coordinating control systems security efforts and enhance  information sharing with relevant stakeholders. Since this report, the  department formed the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency  Response Team to provide industrial control system stakeholders with  situational awareness and analytical support to effectively manage risk. In  addition, it has taken several actions, such as developing a catalog of  recommended security practices for control systems, developing a  cybersecurity evaluation tool that allows asset owners to assess their  control systems and overall security posture, and collaborating with  others to promote control standards and system security. We have not  evaluated these activities to assess their effectiveness in improving the  security of control systems against cyber threats.", "Specifically, we determined that critical  In May 2008, we reported that the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s (TVA)  corporate network contained security weaknesses that could lead to the  disruption of control systems networks and devices connected to that  network. of information security program activities for the control systems  governing TVA\u2019s critical infrastructures and 73 recommendations to  address weaknesses in information security controls. TVA concurred with  the recommendations and has taken steps to implement them.", "We made 19 recommendations to improve the implementation  In addition to those present in federal systems and systems supporting  critical infrastructure, vulnerabilities in mobile computing devices used by  individuals or organizations may provide openings to cyber threats.

These agencies and organizations  have experienced a wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft,  computer intrusions, and privacy breaches, underscoring the need for  improved security practices. The following examples from news media  and other public sources illustrate that a broad array of information and  assets remain at risk.", "In April 2012, hackers breached a server at the Utah Department of  Health to access thousands of Medicaid records. Included in the  breach were Medicaid recipients and clients of the Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Plan. About 280,000 people had their Social Security  numbers exposed. In addition, another 350,000 people listed in the  eligibility inquiries may have had other sensitive data stolen, including  names, birth dates, and addresses.  In March 2012, it was reported that a security breach at Global  Payments, a firm that processed payments for Visa and Mastercard,  could compromise the credit- and debit-card information of millions of  Americans. Subsequent to the reported breach, the company\u2019s stock  fell more than 9 percent before trading in its stock was halted. Visa  also removed the company from its list of approved processors.  In February 2012, the inspector general at the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration testified that an unencrypted notebook  computer had been stolen from the agency in March 2011. The theft  resulted in the loss of the algorithms used to command and control  the International Space Station.  In March 2012, a news wire service reported that the senior  commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had  been the target of repeated cyber attacks using the social networking  website Facebook that were believed to have originated in China.  According to the article, hackers repeatedly tried to dupe those close  to the commander by setting up fake Facebook accounts in his name  in the hope that his acquaintances would make contact and answer  private messages, potentially divulging sensitive information about the  commander or themselves.  In March 2012, it was reported that Blue Cross Blue Shield of  Tennessee paid out a settlement of $1.5 million to the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services arising from potential  violations stemming from the theft of 57 unencrypted computer hard  drives that contained protected health information of over 1 million  individuals.  In January 2012, the Department of Commerce discovered that the  computer network of the department\u2019s Economic Development  Administration (EDA) was hit with a virus, forcing EDA to disable e- mail services and Internet access pending investigation into the cause  and scope of the problem, which persisted for over 12 weeks.  In June 2011, a major bank reported that hackers had broken into its  systems and gained access to the personal information of hundreds of  thousands of customers.

In April 2011, Sony disclosed that it suffered a massive breach in its  video game online network that led to the theft of personal  information, including the names, addresses, and possibly credit card  data belonging to 77 million user accounts.  In February 2011, media reports stated that computer hackers had  broken into and stolen proprietary information worth millions of dollars  from the networks of six U.S. and European energy companies.  In July 2010, a sophisticated computer attack, known as Stuxnet, was  discovered. It targeted control systems used to operate industrial  processes in the energy, nuclear, and other critical sectors, reportedly  causing physical damage. It is designed to exploit a combination of  vulnerabilities to gain access to its target and modify code to change  the process.", "A retailer reported in May 2011 that it had suffered a breach of its  customers\u2019 card data. The company discovered tampering with the  personal identification number (PIN) pads at its checkout lanes in  stores across 20 states.  In August 2006, two circulation pumps at Unit 3 of the Browns Ferry,  Alabama, nuclear power plant failed, forcing the unit to be shut down  manually. The failure of the pumps was traced to excessive traffic on  the control system network, possibly caused by the failure of another  control system device.", "These incidents illustrate the serious impact that cyber threats can have  on federal agency operations, the operations of critical infrastructures,  and the security of sensitive personal and financial information.", "In summary, the cyber-threats facing the nation are evolving and growing,  with a wide array of potential threat actors having access to increasingly  sophisticated techniques for exploiting system vulnerabilities. The danger  posed by these threats is heightened by the weaknesses that continue to  exist in federal information systems and systems supporting critical  infrastructures.
