Most had a transportation infrastructure project (a road or a port) that received about 50 percent of the compact\u0092s total funding. This report, prepared in response to a congressional mandate to review compact results, examines how MCC ensured the quality and sustainability of MCC\u0092s two transportation infrastructure projects in Georgia and Benin.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funded the rehabilitation of about 217 kilometers of road linking the previously isolated Samtskhe-Javakheti region with Tbilisi, the country\u0092s capital, and reducing the driving time from 8 \u00bc hours to 2 \u00be hours. The project was intended to increase exports from the region, integrate people in the region with the rest of Georgia, and expand trade with Turkey and Armenia. However, the urgency to meet fixed time frames resulted in problems implementing the project\u0092s quality assurance framework. For example, the construction supervisor did not have enough staff to properly monitor construction and ensure quality. Despite several recommendations from MCC\u0092s independent engineer, MCC and its Georgian counterpart, the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA-Georgia), did not adequately increase the number of construction supervisors, which resulted in pavement defects in parts of 5 of the 11 road sections and deterioration of structures such as drainage and retaining walls. One 15-kilometer section contained enough defects that the road had to be completely repaved. Furthermore, much of the repair work was to be done in the contracts\u0092 1-year defects liability period, after the compact closed and at a time when MCC no longer had oversight authority. Although MCC took steps to ensure the road project\u0092s sustainability, the Georgian government has demonstrated limited ability to keep the road operational and maintained.", "In Benin, construction for the Port of Cotonou project generally met established quality standards, but several components were not in operation at the compact\u0092s end. MCC funded the construction of several port infrastructure improvements, including a jetty, a wharf, internal port roads, a railway, and security and electricity distribution systems. The project was intended to increase the efficient transport and volume of goods flowing through the port. However, several components\u0097including the new south wharf, the port security system, and the electricity distribution system\u0097were not in operation at compact completion because the Port Authority had not ensured that the necessary infrastructure, staffing, or policies were in place to operate them. For example, the new south wharf, which was intended to increase the cargo tonnage moving through the port, is not in operation in part because the Port Authority does not have the funds to complete the dredging needed to allow large vessels to access the new wharf. Even though MCC took steps to ensure that the government of Benin could sustain the operations and maintenance of the project\u0097such as conducting a feasibility study, incorporating conditions precedent into the compact, hiring a port advisor, requiring a compact closure plan, and identifying steps the government of Benin should take to support sustainability in the compact letter of completion\u0097they were not sufficient. As a result, Benin\u0092s inability to supply the resources, manpower, or policies needed to operate all of the port\u0092s components calls into question whether the port project will achieve expected compact results or be sustained throughout the life of the infrastructure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that compact projects are implemented to established quality standards, GAO recommends that MCC (1) review how it uses information from its independent engineers, and (2) develop a mechanism to maintain influence on contractor repairs after compact closure.

Also, during the compact development  process, MCC assesses the mechanisms in place to enhance  sustainability, including a partner country\u2019s policies and practices that will  enable MCC investments to continue to provide benefits. For instance, as  part of compact proposals submitted to MCC, partner countries are  required to identify risks to project sustainability and describe the  measures needed to ensure that project benefits can be sustained  beyond the period of MCC financing.

The road  project\u2019s length was first reduced after the initial contract solicitation  attracted bids that exceeded the amount of funding originally available for  the road work. As a result, the project was divided into shorter sections  and contracts were let for about 170 kilometers of road. In the winter of  2008-2009, after MCA-Georgia allocated an additional $60 million to the  road project, about 50 kilometers of road were added to the project (see  fig. 3).

For example, MCC\u2019s independent engineer reported that some  contractors continued work in less-than-favorable conditions, such as cold  and rainy weather, to complete the work before the end of the compact.  Conducting work in these conditions can cause problems with curing  concrete (such that it does not reach its design strength) or with asphalt  raveling (not bonding to other asphalt layers). In addition, to meet time  frames, much work was completed at night when poor lighting, less  inspection, and colder temperatures made it more difficult to perform  high-quality work. Finally, one contractor did not supply a required quality  assurance plan. Without the contractor\u2019s quality assurance plan for the  specific contract, the construction supervisor did not know when the  contractor would be testing materials or who to contact regarding  identified problems. In addition, the same contractor turned in test reports  after the tested work had already been covered by subsequent stages of  work.

In addition, MCA-Georgia hired a separate construction  supervisor to oversee lot 3A when it was created, increasing the staff  available overall for construction supervision on the project. However,  the MCC independent engineer recommended that additional  construction staff were still needed to ensure the quality of the work  under way. The independent engineer also reported that the  construction supervisory firm\u2019s fee was lower than typical for this type  of international work. Nonetheless, MCA-Georgia chose not to fund  additional staff for the construction supervision firm.", "MCC had included a condition precedent in the compact that required  MCA-Georgia to engage a construction supervisor. However, because  the condition was satisfied once MCA-Georgia engaged a supervisor,  MCC stated that the condition precedent did not give it any authority  to withhold funds because of insufficient supervision staffing.", "Construction supervisor was not always used in accordance with the  quality assurance framework: According to two reports by MCC\u2019s  independent engineer, MCA-Georgia did not always use the construction  supervision staff effectively. According to the quality control framework in  the construction firms\u2019 contracts, the construction supervisor should issue  all instructions to the contractors. However, MCC\u2019s independent engineer  noted that the MCA-Georgia staff responsible for the road project  communicated directly with construction contractors and issued oral  instructions directly to the contractors to accelerate work. The  independent engineer further noted that this practice could lead to claims  of additional work, increasing costs, because contractors received  different instructions from the construction supervisor and MCA-Georgia.", "The MCC project generally improved the road by reducing its driving time  and roughness and installing bridges that appeared well built. However,  several sections of the road had pavement defects and structures such as  drainage systems and retaining walls that are deteriorating.", "The MCC project improved the condition of the road. Before rehabilitation,  the Samtskhe-Javakheti road was passable but rough, with a driving time  of about 8\u00bc hours. The project decreased the road\u2019s roughness, and after  rehabilitation, the same trip could be made in about 2\u00be hours. MCC  reported roughness measurements before rehabilitation that indicated a  vehicle would have to drive under about 30 miles per hour for passengers  to ride comfortably. Road roughness measurements made after project  completion indicated that passengers could ride comfortably even at  speeds of 75 miles per hour. We traveled a portion of the road that was  bypassed by the rehabilitation project and found it to be filled with  potholes and patches. We found the new road was much smoother (see  fig. 6).", "The scope of the project also included rehabilitating or rebuilding 27  bridges (see fig. 7). In March 2012, MCC\u2019s independent engineer  reported that all bridges were performing well and had only a few defects  such as erosion of embankment slopes, and incomplete guardrail  hardware. We observed only minor defects such as a small chip in a  bridge beam but no apparent quality problems.", "While the pavement in some lots appeared to be in good condition, the  pavement in other lots was not.

The amount of  deterioration and completed repair work varied in those lots, which  constituted about 60 percent of the total kilometers of the final project.", "In lots 4 and 6ii, surface deterioration had been treated with a surface  sealer to keep the surface from deteriorating further (see fig. 8). While  seal coating may keep water from entering the cracks and make the  road look better in the short term, it does not add pavement strength.  As a result, deterioration will continue under the anticipated increased  traffic loads for the project if the underlying cause of the cracking is  not repaired.", "Lots 2 and 3 had undergone patching, but in one case the patch failed  and the deterioration had continued beyond the patch, as shown in  figure 9.", "In other places, we found continued cracking in need of repair, as  shown in figure 10. This type of cracking\u2014known as alligator  cracking\u2014is caused by fatigue failure of the asphalt surface, which is  related to weakened layers of asphalt beneath the pavement,  insufficient pavement thickness, excessive loading, or some  combination of these factors.", "In lot 3A, much of the pavement was failing and under repair. The  contractor was in the process of milling the top layer of pavement in  some areas and full-depth patching of the pavement in other areas  (see fig. 11). In June 2011, MCC\u2019s independent engineer noted that  the entire lot 3A section of road (15 kilometers) had been constructed  poorly and had moderate to severe levels of distress in the pavement,  which indicated that a poor quality of asphalt had been used. The  construction supervisor stated that the contractor paved the road in lot  3A in two layers and that the second layer was paved when the  weather was rainy to complete the project on time. However, the  second layer did not bond to the first and thus fell apart. According to  the independent engineer, some portions of the road will require full- depth reconstruction of the road. A Georgian government official  stated that the lot 3A contractor had agreed to replace the base  materials in some places and repave the entire lot.", "The construction supervisor\u2019s most recent (December 2011) list of  pavement defects indicated pothole patching and surface dressing was  needed for lots 2, 3, 3A, 5i, and 5ii. However the independent engineer\u2019s  March 2012 trip report stated there were more extensive pavement  defects that required correction measures such as pothole repair, surface  dressing, crack repairs, or full-depth reconstruction for lots 1, 2, 3, 3A, 4,  5ii, 6ii, 6iii, and 7. The independent engineer also noted in several  locations that the defects resulted from incorrectly repaired previous  defects, the inadequate winter maintenance of the roads, and, in one  section of road, traffic loads heavier than the road was designed to carry.  The independent engineer also stated that if the roads are not correctly  repaired, they will worsen. Defects not properly repaired will likely fail  under increased traffic loads or further deteriorate, creating potholes as  water enters the cracks in the winter and then freezes. On the basis of the  independent engineer\u2019s assessment that some of the project contractors  were not meeting contract specifications, MCC sent a letter to MCA- Georgia in September 2010, noting that the work methods on lots 2, 3,  3A, and 4 were not to the standards expected and that the base material  and pavement compaction required immediate improvement. The letter  also stated that if the contractors did not improve the work, it would not be  accepted.", "Structures such as drains and retaining walls are critical to a road\u2019s  longevity. A working drainage system helps to keep water off the road,  which is critical to safety and to keep pavement from prematurely  deteriorating. However, we found defects in the drainage systems of 7 of  the 11 lots. For example:  In lots 1, 5ii, 6i, 6ii, and 7, we found some of the drainage channels  collapsing or cracked, which could cause the drains to become  blocked (see fig. 12).", "In lots 2, 6i, and 6ii, we found the concrete drainage channels with  defects because of poor concrete construction (see fig. 13).", "In lots 3, 5i, and 5ii, drains were installed above the water level in  some places, making it impossible for water to drain off the road (see  fig. 14).", "According to MCC\u2019s independent engineer, the quality of the drain  placement and the construction of the tops were inadequate because the  concrete did not cure properly or had already started to harden before it  was poured. If the drainage system does not work properly, the water will  saturate and weaken the underlying ground and cause the road to  deteriorate or freeze in the winter and create a safety hazard.", "Furthermore, we observed a failed retaining wall that, if left unrepaired,  could damage the road. Because the retaining wall had failed, serious  erosion had occurred, and if the erosion continues, it will progress until it  reaches the road, jeopardizing the road\u2019s future usefulness (see fig. 15).", "We also found additional erosion in lots 2, 6ii, and 7 (for example, see fig.  16). The independent engineer in his March 2012 report indicated a few  erosion concerns for lots 2, 3, and 7 that needed to be corrected. The  corrections are necessary for motorist safety and to protect the pavement,  bridges, and retaining walls.", "Although the construction supervisor certified the contracted road work as  substantially complete by the end of the compact, the previously  described construction defects had not been repaired. Once the work was  certified as substantially complete, responsibility for the roads moved  from the contractors to MCA-Georgia, and final contract payments with  MCC funds were made. However, according to the contracts, contractors  continue to be responsible for the completion of any work or defects  related to work quality during a 1-year defects liability period. The transfer  of the road lots to MCA-Georgia included a list of about 700 defects  identified by the construction supervisor to be completed or repaired after  substantial completion and before the end of the defects liability period  (see table 1). Additional defects can be added to the list by the  construction supervisor if they appear in the 1-year liability period. MCC  officials stated that it is desirable to complete as much of the work as  possible before the defects liability period starts. However, it was  necessary to accept the work as substantially complete before the end of  the compact time frame so that final MCC funds disbursement could be  made to MCA-Georgia. As a result, the work that remained and the repair  of the remaining defects were moved into the defects liability period.", "Additional factors present challenges to ensuring the defective work is  adequately repaired:", "MCC\u2019s independent engineer reported in October 2011 that the repair  work under way on lot 3A was not in accordance with standard  procedures and that the road that had been patched was  unsatisfactory. For example, the contractor did not apply sufficient  bonding material to ensure that the layers of asphalt would adhere to  each other before laying additional asphalt. In addition, the   independent engineer commented that patch cutting and laying of  asphalt were not properly done.", "We observed in December 2012 that much repair work remained to  be done. In addition, during the summer construction season in 2011  no construction supervision firm was in place for about 2 months of  August and September 2011. According to the October 2011 report of  MCC\u2019s independent engineer, this may have affected the contractors\u2019  progress in rectifying construction defects. The gap in supervision  occurred because the Georgian government contracted with a new  construction supervisor for the defects liability period after the  compact-funded construction supervisor\u2019s contract ended. The new  construction supervisor provided us with a summary of defects  remaining at the end of 2011, but it was not in the same format as the  original defects list. It was thus impossible to determine which defects  had been corrected and which had been added.", "The Georgian government held performance guarantees from the  contractors to ensure the work was completed. However, correction of  the work could not be completed in the 1-year defects liability period, and  the independent engineer reported in March 2012 that the performance  guarantees for lots 1, 4, 6ii, and 6iii had expired before the lots were  accepted as complete. The independent engineer also reported the  performance guarantees for lots 2, 3, 3A, 5i, 5ii, 6i, and 7 were extended  until August 2012, after the expected date that those lots will be  accepted.", "Although several officials in Georgia stated that the repairs will be made,  MCC has little ability to ensure the work will be done or done correctly.  MCC has little oversight ability to ensure the work is completed now that  the compact has ended. For example:", "MCC reported that documentation regarding the status of the projects  in the defects liability period is held by the Georgian government.  While the Georgian government provided MCC the project status for 3  of the 11 lots as of April 2012, the documentation provided was not in  English.", "MCC\u2019s independent engineer\u2019s last trip to Georgia to review the status  of the project was in March 2012, just before its contract expired.  MCC will have little technical assistance in determining the extent to  which all quality issues were addressed through the planned end of all  of the defects liability periods in July 2012. MCC stated that it is  considering other arrangements to support a site inspection in June  2012.", "All funds have been paid to the Georgian government for the project,  and the conditions precedent for the compact are no longer in force,  such as requiring a project management consultant and a  construction supervisor to be in place.

MCC officials further stated that the condition precedent  followed a similar requirement set in a World Bank loan agreement that  had been entered into slightly earlier than the MCC compact, which  emphasized ensuring that the government has the resources necessary  to care for its national roads. MCC reported that, to sustain the economic  opportunities generated by the road improvements, Georgia increased  road maintenance funding from $33.6 million in 2006 to $56 million in  2010. In addition, MCC officials stated that the Roads Department of the  Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure had been working  with the World Bank to develop the institutional framework and technical  capacity to provide good road maintenance. MCC officials also stated that  they allowed MCA-Georgia to use funds left over at compact end to  purchase some equipment (such as an excavator and a road-patching  vehicle) that would help equip the Georgian road department to perform  maintenance. Finally, MCC officials stated that Georgia, similar to other  developing countries, will face difficult decisions in how it spends its  money. They noted that the Georgian government has a preference for  constructing new roads instead of maintaining old ones; however, they  believed that Georgia would maintain the new road as a source of  national pride and hoped that, by working with MCC and other  infrastructure development partners such as the World Bank, the  government had come to realize the value of maintaining its  investments.", "During our visit to the road, we found that many maintenance items not  covered under the contractors\u2019 defects liability period were not being  done. For example, we found several lots where the pavement markings  were worn and needed to be repainted, guardrails and concrete barrier  walls had been damaged and not repaired, drainage systems needed  repair, and erosion was filling the drainage system and had not been  cleaned (see fig. 17).", "The MCC independent engineer also noted in June 2011, October 2011,  and again in March 2012 that routine maintenance seemed to be lacking  on some lots, including cleaning drainage channels and culverts,  repairing damaged guardrails, and repairing erosion spots, and other  miscellaneous damages. A Georgian official stated that there were  maintenance contracts in place to make these kinds of repairs, and the  MCC independent engineer stated in March 2012, that it did find  Georgian road department contractors performing some routine  maintenance tasks, but additional efforts were needed, and that a lack of  snow removal in the 2011-2012 winter had likely resulted in increased  road deterioration.", "The feasibility study for the road project noted that portions of lots 3, 4,  5ii, 6i, and 6ii are prone to snow drifts and part of lot 4 is sometimes  closed from October to March. Snow removal is part of keeping the road  operational. In its absence, the road is closed to traffic and the planned  benefits of the improved road such as reduced user costs, reduced travel  time to Tbilisi, and economic benefits from increased trade will not be fully  realized.", "In the curved areas of the road prone to icing, we saw small piles of salt  and sand; however, we did not see snow removal equipment or any  winter maintenance operations, even though the Georgian government  officials stated they had maintenance contracts in place to provide snow  removal operations. The project\u2019s feasibility study had recommended  installing snow fences to minimize snow drifts on the road, but on the  basis of environmental concerns, MCA-Georgia chose to plant trees  (living snow fences) to stop the snow drifting across the road and reduce  maintenance costs. However, many of these trees did not survive. Living  snow fences take several years to provide effective snow control.", "During our December 2011 field work, we found that the road was closed  in lot 4 for the 2 days we were on-site because of snow drifts on one short  (about a quarter of a kilometer) portion of lot 4. The project included  electronic message signs on the road leaving Tbilisi to allow motorists to  choose an alternate route. In addition, we found other portions of lot 4 to  have only one lane open to traffic (see fig. 18). The independent  engineer\u2019s March 2012 trip report stated that the Georgian road  department\u2019s snow removal operations had been lacking during the 2011- 2012 winter season, which had heavy and repeated snow storms. The  engineers stated the road had been closed in lot 4 from December 2011  until they visited in March 2012 and they found other sections of the road  with only narrow lanes open, resulting in traffic jams and minor accidents.", "The Georgian government may not have a sufficient maintenance budget  to maintain and operate the road. A Georgian government official stated  that it had about $63 million in its 2012 budget to maintain roads. This  appears to be a decrease from previous years\u2019 road maintenance  budgets ($81 million in 2011 and $90 million in 2010). However, this is  still an increase over the $56 million MCC reported that it had budgeted in  2010 to fulfill a condition precedent in the compact. Furthermore, of the  overall 2012 road maintenance budget, the government had budgeted  about $720,000 for maintaining the MCC road specifically. However, this  amount of funding may be insufficient because MCA-Georgia approved  paying contractors almost $700,000 to provide winter snow removal for  only part of the road (lots 2, 3, 3A, and 4) during the 2010-2011 winter.", "The road construction defects discussed above may increase  maintenance costs, decrease the life span of the project, and result in  reduced benefits from the project. Even if the road defects are adequately  repaired, they could increase the cost of maintenance because of the  need to seal cracks at the edges of pavement patches and reseal road  surface treatments periodically to provide protection to the pavement.

However,  according to a concessionaire official, the concession company had not  yet agreed upon a start date with the Port Authority as of April 2012.  However, the concessionaire was proceeding with constructing its portion  of the landside works. MCC officials stated that the concessionaire\u2019s  construction will be completed in December 2012, and a concessionaire  official told us the wharf would be operational in January 2013; however,  if the Port Authority does not honor its part of the concession agreement  and finish the dredging, a concessionaire official stated it may reduce the  amount of landside works it is going to finish, such as not install as many  cranes or not pave the entire wharf area, because it could operate the  south wharf only for smaller ships. Smaller ships and reduced wharf area  would likely reduce the amount of cargo tonnage through the port and the  fees the port would receive from the concession.

The compact goal was to reduce  the average number of hours trucks stayed at the port from 24 hours to 7  hours. However, the average after the compact ended is 28 hours.  According to officials from two shipping companies, one of their primary  concerns was that truck congestion at the port would likely limit their  ability to increase the volume of merchandise passing through the port  (see fig. 26).", "The Port Authority has taken some steps to alleviate the truck congestion.  For example, the Benin government engaged a private firm to install  tracking and communication devices in trucks beginning in December  2011 that would allow trucks to enter the port when their shipper is ready  to load or unload them. However, an official from the firm stated that, as  of April 2012, the Benin government had not allowed the firm to initiate  the system even though it has been ready to operate since late  November 2011.

However, shipping company officials  questioned whether the existing railway will be able to transfer the cargo  to the dry ports. According to March 2012 statements by shipping  company officials, the Port Authority attempted to implement the use of  the railway and a privately operated dry port for containers going to  hinterland countries at a site about 55 kilometers away from the port.  However, according to one of the shipping company officials, the railway  could transport only 90 of the 200 containers needed to be transported  daily to the dry port. One shipping company official stated the company  had over 1,700 containers backlogged in the port in early March 2012,  taking an average of more than 25 days to get a container from the port to  the dry port.

Without sustained maintenance\u2014such  as repairing drainage systems and removing snow\u2014the road will need  additional repairs and have limited usefulness in the winter. In Benin, key  project components, including security and electricity distribution systems  and the south wharf, were not operational at the end of the compact. The  operation of these and other interconnected systems depends on the  partner government, which to date has been unable to fund and  implement the work required to begin port operations. As a result, MCC  may have invested considerable U.S. resources in equipment and  structures that will not be used to maximum benefit and thus not provide  the expected economic benefits. MCC should take this opportunity to  review the problems that emerged from Georgia, Benin, and other  completed compacts and to establish or strengthen mechanisms by which  it can better invest U.S. resources in future compacts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To maximize the quality and sustainability of future projects, we  recommend that the MCC Chief Executive Officer take the following  actions:  To ensure that its quality assurance framework is fully implemented and  to ensure that transportation infrastructure projects are built to the  established quality standards, MCC should  review how MCC uses information and professional recommendations  provided by its independent engineers to address identified  deficiencies and to ensure projects are constructed to the quality  standards set out in contracts, and develop a mechanism to maintain influence through contracts\u2019 defects  liability periods when they extend beyond the compact end date.", "To ensure sustainability of compact projects, MCC should evaluate the  effectiveness of the tools it uses (such as its feasibility studies and  conditions precedent) to ensure that partner countries have adequate  infrastructure, staff, and policies necessary to operate and maintain MCC- funded infrastructure following the compact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, MCC stated that it agrees  with our three recommendations; however, it did not commit to  undertaking any specific actions to address them. With respect to the first  recommendation to review its use of information and recommendations  from its independent engineers, MCC stated that it does guide its  oversight of compact projects using the analysis provided by its  independent engineers, but that the quality of advice can vary and  independent engineers are not always privy to all factors affecting  compact programs. However, MCC did not state that it would review its  practices regarding how it uses information from these independent  engineers. With respect to our second recommendation regarding the  need for a mechanism to maintain influence on contracts whose defects  liability periods extend beyond compact end dates, MCC noted that it  sustains a dialogue with its partner countries after compact closure to  emphasize the importance of continued oversight. However, as MCC  officials have noted, because its authorizing legislation limits the term of  compacts to 5 years, MCC\u2019s ability to assist partner countries directly  once a compact closes is restricted. MCC did not state that it would seek  any additional authority to maintain influence after the end of a compact.  With respect to our third recommendation, to evaluate the tools it uses to  ensure projects\u2019 sustainability, MCC listed ways that it works to ensure  sustainability throughout the development, implementation, and closure of  compact programs. MCC also noted that it revised its Compact  Development Guidelines in January 2012 and included steps to  strengthen the agency\u2019s assessment of sustainability during compact  development. However, MCC did not commit to evaluate the  effectiveness of the tools it has used or plans to use to ensure its projects\u2019  sustainability.", "We have reprinted MCC\u2019s comments in appendix III.

For the purpose of this engagement, we  examined the quality and sustainability of MCC\u2019s two transportation  infrastructure projects in Georgia (the Samtskhe-Javakheti Road  Rehabilitation Activity) and Benin (the Port of Cotonou Access to Markets  Project). Transportation infrastructure is defined as public works that  provide the conveyance of passengers or goods from one place to  another.", "GAO selected MCC\u2019s compacts in Georgia and Benin as the focus of this  engagement through a subjective process. Our selection universe was  those compacts ending in 2010 and 2011 that had a transportation  infrastructure project. In a previous engagement we had reviewed the  MCC-funded transportation infrastructure projects in Cape Verde and  Honduras. Georgia and Benin, in combination with these previously  reviewed projects, provided some geographic variety as well as the ability  to compare two port projects and two large road projects.", "We based our assessment of the projects\u2019 quality on the quality  assurance requirements established by MCC, the partner countries\u2019  Millennium Challenge Accounts (MCA), and their contractors. MCC  requires the MCAs to (1) have an individual project director or to engage  the services of a project management firm to help manage the  administrative aspects of compact programs, (2) contract with  implementing partners (such as construction firms) using MCC\u2019s  procurement guidelines, and (3) engage a construction supervisor to  oversee the day-to-day construction and ensure compliance with contract  requirements.", "For this report, the definition of sustainability is based on the definition  from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s  Development Assistance Committee, which defines \u201csustainability\u201d as  \u201cthe continuation of benefits from a development intervention after major  development assistance has been completed.\u201d The Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Development Assistance  Committee is an international forum of many of the largest funders of aid  with a mandate to promote development cooperation and other policies  so as to contribute to sustainable development. We operationalized this  definition by specifying that sustainability is the ability of MCC\u2019s partner  country governments to operate and maintain the new infrastructure in  such a condition as is required to produce the projected benefits for the  period of time those benefits are calculated.", "To assess the quality and longer-term sustainability for compacts in  Georgia and Benin, we analyzed MCC, MCA, and other documents;  interviewed MCC officials and stakeholders; and observed project results  in both countries.", "We reviewed the compact agreement for Georgia and Benin.

All photographs in this report attributed to GAO were taken during this  time period.", "These interviews, document reviews, and site visits were used to  determine if the MCAs had implemented MCC\u2019s quality assurance  framework, if there was supporting documentation to verify that quality  testing had been undertaken, if any quality deficiencies were encountered  during construction, if any quality deficiencies remain, and whether the  infrastructure projects would be sustainable. We were not able to view  actual work in progress or visit testing facilities for most infrastructure  contracts because the work had already been completed.", "To determine the amount of funding used for transportation infrastructure  projects, we reviewed MCC financial data. We included compact  implementation funding\u2014funds disbursed before entry into force to  facilitate the implementation of the compact\u2014with other projects not  related to transportation infrastructure.", "MCC enters into a legal relationship with partner country governments,  which vest responsibility for day-to-day management of compact project  implementation in the MCA, including monitoring and evaluation activities  such as setting and revising targets, but such MCA actions require MCC\u2019s  direct oversight and approval.
