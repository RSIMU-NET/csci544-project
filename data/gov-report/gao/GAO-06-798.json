Because HSAs and HSA-eligible plans are new, there is interest in the experiences of plan enrollees, as well as in comparing the plan features and enrollee characteristics with those of traditional plans, such as preferred provider organization (PPO) plans. GAO reviewed (1) the financial features of HSA-eligible plans in comparison with those of traditional plans, (2) the characteristics of HSA-eligible plan enrollees in comparison with those of traditional plan enrollees, (3) HSA funding and use, and (4) enrollees' experiences with HSA-eligible plans. GAO analyzed data regarding HSA-eligible and traditional plans and enrollees from national employer health benefits surveys, three selected employers, and a national broker of health insurance. GAO compared Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data for tax filers reporting HSA contributions with corresponding data for all tax filers under 65 years old.

For the three employers' health plans GAO reviewed to illustrate enrollees' potential health care costs, GAO estimated that HSA-eligible plan enrollees would incur higher annual costs than PPO plan enrollees for extensive use of health care, but would incur lower annual costs than PPO plan enrollees for low to moderate use of health care. HSA-eligible plan enrollees generally had higher incomes than comparison groups, but data on age differences were inconclusive. In 2004, 51 percent of tax filers reporting an HSA contribution had an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or more, compared with 18 percent of all tax filers under 65 years old. Two of the three employers GAO reviewed and a national broker of health insurance also reported that HSA-eligible plan enrollees had higher incomes than traditional plan enrollees in 2005. GAO's data sources did not conclusively indicate whether HSA-eligible plan enrollees were older or younger than individuals and enrollees in comparison groups. Just over half of all HSA-eligible plan enrollees and most employers contributed to HSAs, and account holders used their HSA funds to pay for current medical care and to accumulate savings. About 55 percent of HSA-eligible plan enrollees reported HSA contributions to IRS in 2004. Tax filers claimed an average deduction of about $2,100 for their HSA contributions in 2004, and the average amount increased with income. About two-thirds of employers offering HSA-eligible plans contributed to their employees' HSAs, and the average employer HSA contribution was about $1,064 in 2004. About 45 percent of tax filers reporting 2004 HSA contributions also reported that they withdrew funds in 2004, and 90 percent of these funds were withdrawn for qualified medical expenses. The other 55 percent of those reporting HSA contributions in 2004 did not withdraw any funds from their HSA in 2004. HSA-eligible plan enrollees who participated in GAO's focus groups generally reported positive experiences, but most would not recommend the plans to all consumers. Participants enrolled in the plans generally understood the key attributes of their plan. Few participants reported researching cost before obtaining health care services, although many researched the cost of prescription drugs. Most participants were satisfied with their HSA-eligible plan and would recommend these plans to healthy consumers, but not to those who use maintenance medication, have a chronic condition, have children, or may not have the funds to meet the high deductible. GAO received technical comments from IRS and a national broker of health insurance and incorporated the comments as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Health savings accounts (HSA) and the high-deductible health insurance  plans that are eligible to be coupled with them are a new type of  consumer-directed health plan (CDHP) attracting interest among  employers and consumers. Both employers and plan enrollees may  contribute to tax-advantaged HSAs, and enrollees can use the accounts to  pay for their health care expenses. The high-deductible health plans  typically have lower premiums than other types of health plans because  high-deductible health plan enrollees bear a greater share of the initial  costs of care.", "The novel structure of HSA-eligible plans has raised questions regarding  how the plans and HSAs will affect enrollees\u2019 health care purchasing  decisions and costs. Proponents of HSA-eligible plans believe that the  plans will encourage enrollees to become more astute health care  consumers and thus restrain health care spending increases. Proponents  argue that the high deductibles give enrollees an incentive to seek lower- cost health care services and that the ability to carry over unspent HSA  funds from year to year gives enrollees an incentive to obtain services only  when necessary. However, some critics contend that the high deductibles  associated with HSA-eligible plans may discourage enrollees from  obtaining necessary health care services. Some critics are also concerned  that the plans may attract a disproportionate share of wealthier enrollees  who seek to use the HSA primarily as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle or  healthier or younger individuals who use fewer health care services. If  these plans do attract a larger share of individuals who are likely to use  fewer health care services, premiums for traditional health insurance  plans, such as preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, could rise  faster than they otherwise would because of the disproportionate share of  enrollees with higher health care expenses remaining in those plans.", "Because HSAs and HSA-eligible plans are a relatively new concept in  health insurance coverage, there is interest in the plan features and the  characteristics and experiences of early plan enrollees. For example,  there is interest in who is enrolling in HSA-eligible plans, and whether they  differ from enrollees in traditional health plans, such as PPO plans. In  response to your request, we examined the following questions:  1.  How do financial features, covered services, and enrollees\u2019 annual  costs compare between HSA-eligible and traditional plans?  2.  How do the characteristics of enrollees compare between HSA-eligible  and traditional plans?  3.  How are HSAs funded, and how are HSA account holders using their  funds?  4.

To compare the covered health care services and provider networks of  HSA-eligible plans with those of traditional plans, we reviewed plan  brochures provided by the three large employers and spoke with employer  and insurance carrier officials and industry experts. To illustrate the  potential health care costs faced by HSA-eligible and traditional plan  enrollees, we examined the total annual costs to enrollees of the three  employers\u2019 HSA-eligible and PPO plans in 2005.

We also compared 2005 income and age data for HSA- eligible and traditional plan enrollees who purchased coverage from the  three employers we reviewed and from eHealthInsurance.", "To examine how HSAs are funded and used, we analyzed data on  individual and employer contributions and account withdrawals. To  determine the share of enrollees that opened HSAs, we analyzed survey  data on HSA-eligible plan enrollment and IRS data on HSA contributions.

To examine individuals\u2019 HSA contributions,  we analyzed IRS data on the average tax deduction for 2004 HSA  contributions and reviewed data provided by the three employers on the  2005 contributions of employees enrolled in HSA-eligible plans. To  examine employer HSA contributions, we analyzed IRS data on the  average employer contribution in 2004 and summarized 2005 data reported  by two national employer health benefits surveys and the three large  employers we reviewed. To determine how account holders use HSA  funds, we analyzed IRS data on reported HSA withdrawals in 2004 and  conducted a series of focus groups with employees of the three large  employers we reviewed regarding HSA-eligible plan enrollees\u2019 use of  accounts in 2005.", "To determine enrollees\u2019 experiences with HSA-eligible plans, we gathered  information from focus groups of employees of the three large employers  regarding enrollee education, plan comprehension, experience with  obtaining care, use of decision-support tools, and plan satisfaction in 2005.

For example, the IRS data for  tax filers reporting an HSA contribution cannot be generalized to all HSA- eligible plan enrollees because the sample is not designed to capture  individuals enrolled in a high-deductible health plan who did not have an  associated HSA. The results of the focus groups and the data obtained  from the three employers cannot be generalized to all HSA-eligible plan  enrollees or employers because they represent only the experiences of the  focus group participants and the benefit offerings of the three employers.

The  plans must have a minimum deductible amount of $1,050 for single  coverage and $2,100 for family coverage in 2006 and a maximum limit on  enrollee out-of-pocket spending of $5,250 for single coverage and $10,500  for family coverage in 2006. Most HSA-eligible plan enrollees are covered  by plans that operate similarly to traditional plans. HSA-eligible plan  enrollees pay premiums to access covered services. As with traditional  plans, rates negotiated by insurance carriers provide incentives for HSA- eligible plan enrollees to access in-network care. However, HSA-eligible  plan enrollees are subject to higher-than-average deductibles. Preventive  care services may be exempted from the deductible requirement, but  coverage of most other services, including prescription drugs, is subject to  the deductible. After meeting the deductible, the HSA-eligible plan pays  for most of the cost of covered services until the enrollee meets the out-of- pocket spending limit, at which point the plan pays 100 percent of the cost  of covered services. Insurance carriers offer HSA-eligible plans to both  employers in the group market and individuals in the individual market.", "An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account established for paying  qualified medical expenses. Individuals are eligible to open an HSA if  they are enrolled in an HSA-eligible plan and have no other health  coverage, with limited exceptions. However, HSA-eligible plan enrollees  are not required to open or contribute to an HSA and can use non-HSA  funds to pay for medical expenses. HSA-eligible plan enrollees who choose  to pay for medical expenses from their HSA may access their account  funds by check, by debit card, or by authorizing the insurance carriers to  allow the providers to directly debit their account funds. HSAs are owned  by the account holder, and the accounts are portable\u2014individuals may  keep their accounts if they switch jobs or enroll in a non-HSA-eligible  health plan. Both employers and individuals may contribute to HSAs, and  individuals may claim a deduction on their federal income taxes for their  HSA contributions regardless of whether they itemize deductions or claim  the standard deduction. HSA balances can earn interest; roll over from  year to year; and be invested in a variety of financial instruments, such as  mutual funds. HSA balances may also accumulate subject only to annual  limits on contributions. In 2006, contributions were limited to 100 percent  of the deductible, but not more than $2,700 for single coverage or $5,450  for family coverage. Contributions, earned interest, and withdrawals for  qualified medical expenses are not federally taxed. Withdrawals for  nonqualified expenses are subject to income tax and, if made before age  65, a tax penalty. A financial institution, such as a bank or insurance  company, typically administers the account. Table 1 describes the key  features of HSA-eligible plans and HSAs.", "HSA-eligible plans typically provide, to some extent, information on the  cost of health care services and the quality of health care providers. This  information may help enrollees to become more actively engaged in  making health care purchasing decisions. Experts suggest that in order to  assess the price competitiveness of different providers or the cost of  different treatment options, enrollees need reliable, specific information  about the cost of services. Experts also suggest that in order to make  informed provider choices, enrollees need data on key quality measures to  assess the quality of different providers. These quality measures may  include the volume of procedures performed, the outcomes of those  procedures, and certain process indicators demonstrating whether  providers followed certain recommended treatment guidelines. Insurance  carriers offering HSA-eligible plans may also provide online access to  health accounts for enrollees to manage their health care spending.", "These tools may be provided by health insurance carriers to all health  insurance plan enrollees, but are likely to be more important to enrollees  of HSA-eligible plans and other CDHPs, who have a greater financial  incentive to make informed decisions about the quality and costs of health  care providers and services. However, insurance carriers have faced  challenges in obtaining or presenting quality and cost data.

While  patterns evident during the first few years of HSA-eligible plan enrollment  may not predict future trends and enrollment will depend on the particular  choices available, it will be important to monitor enrollment trends and  assess their implications for the cost of health care coverage for all HSA- eligible and traditional plan enrollees.", "Contrary to the hopes of CDHP proponents, few of the HSA-eligible plan  enrollees who participated in our focus groups researched cost before  obtaining health care services.
