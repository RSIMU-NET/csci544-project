BBA permitted Medicare participation by preferred provider organizations (PPO), provider-sponsored organizations, and insurers offering private fee- for-service (FFS) plans or medical savings accounts. It also included provisions designed to encourage the wider availability of health maintenance organizations (HMO), which have long been an option for many beneficiaries. Other BBA provisions increased the significance of each beneficiary\u2019s selection of a Medicare coverage option by limiting beneficiaries\u2019 opportunities to make new selections outside of the newly established annual open enrollment period.", "In creating the M+C program, the Congress recognized that choice should be accompanied by information that can help beneficiaries consider the full range of their Medicare options and make appropriate selections. Studies by us and others had found shortcomings in the limited information available to Medicare beneficiaries and that many beneficiaries did not adequately understand their Medicare coverage options. Study findings suggested that, at the most basic level, beneficiaries needed information to increase their awareness that M+C alternatives to the traditional FFS program might exist in their geographic areas. Increasing awareness of M+C is particularly important because individuals who become eligible for Medicare are automatically enrolled in the FFS program and must complete a separate application if they want to enroll in an M+C plan. Beneficiaries also needed information to help them understand the key differences between the traditional FFS program and M+C program. For example, M+C plans generally limit beneficiaries\u2019 freedom to select their health care provider, but typically offer benefit packages that are more comprehensive than the benefits available under FFS. Finally, beneficiaries who were interested in M+C needed an objective source of information that would help them compare specific plans. Such information can facilitate beneficiary decision-making and spur competition among M+C plans, which could result in improved service and benefit packages that are more comprehensive and better reflect beneficiary preferences.", "To help beneficiaries understand and consider all of their Medicare options, BBA provisions required the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to undertake several activities. Through the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which administered Medicare, the Secretary (at a minimum) was to   establish and operate a toll-free help line;   annually mail to beneficiaries information about Medicare, the M+C program, individual M+C plans, and other topics (and, throughout the year, mail the same information to individuals shortly before they are entitled to Medicare benefits if an M+C plan is available in their area);   create and maintain an Internet site with information on M+C plan   provide for educational and publicity campaigns to inform beneficiaries about M+C plans.", "HCFA established the National Medicare Education Program (NMEP) to organize these activities.", "The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) mandated that GAO periodically report on HCFA\u2019s Medicare education activities. In this report we (1) describe major NMEP activities, (2) review NMEP spending and funding sources, (3) assess beneficiary and plan reactions to NMEP, and (4) discuss the future of NMEP.", "To conduct our study, we met and discussed NMEP with officials representing HCFA, beneficiary advocacy groups, and health plan associations. We reviewed materials used for various education approaches, including the Medicare & You handbook, the contents of Medicare\u2019s Internet site, and the most common questions and answers for the telephone help line. We obtained information on the funding sources and costs for operating the program for the first 3 fiscal years of the program (1998, 1999, and 2000), and reviewed the results of various assessments done by HCFA and its contractors on several aspects of the program. Appendix I provides additional information on our methodology. Our work was done from November 2000 through August 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, before the establishment of the M+C program, about 5.2 million (14 percent) of Medicare\u2019s 38 million beneficiaries were enrolled in HMOs that contracted with HCFA to serve Medicare beneficiaries. At that time, PPOs and other health insurance arrangements that had become common in the private sector were not permitted in Medicare. The HMOs that participated in Medicare tended to concentrate in urban areas and certain states. Consequently, about 25 percent of beneficiaries had no alternative to the traditional FFS program. In creating the M+C program, the Congress sought to build on, and expand, the existing HMO option. BBA permitted new types of health plans, such as PPOs, to participate in Medicare and included provisions designed to encourage a wider geographic availability of health plans.", "Medicare\u2019s experience with HMOs has demonstrated that choice, and the ensuing competition among plans for market share, can produce important advantages for some beneficiaries. At a minimum, all HMOs were required to provide the services covered by Medicare\u2019s traditional FFS program. In addition, HMOs that received Medicare payments that exceeded their costs of providing Medicare-covered benefits and normal profits had to use the excess to reduce beneficiary fees or provide additional benefits\u2014such as coverage for prescription drugs or routine physical examinations. HMOs frequently exceeded program requirements and further reduced beneficiary fees or augmented their benefit packages to help retain existing members and attract new ones. As a result, nearly all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an HMO received a more comprehensive benefit package than those who remained in traditional FFS. For example, the average Medicare HMO in 1999 spent approximately $660 per member (an amount equivalent to 11.5 percent of its Medicare payment) on beneficiary fee reductions or benefit enhancements that were not required by Medicare.", "Medicare\u2019s HMO experience has also demonstrated that some beneficiaries need information and help understanding their choices if they are to select the option that best meets their needs. A 1998 study found that many Medicare beneficiaries are unfamiliar with managed care concepts. Nearly one-third of the study respondents who belonged to Medicare HMOs did not understand basic differences between HMOs and FFS. A similar percentage of FFS respondents were uninformed. The authors concluded that only 16 percent of those beneficiaries who had some basic knowledge of HMOs knew enough to make an informed selection between FFS and HMOs. Misunderstandings about managed care concepts\u2014such as the need to obtain referrals for specialty care and a limited choice of providers\u2014may partly explain why some beneficiaries disenroll from HMOs shortly after becoming members. In 1998 we reported that the percentage of new members who left their HMOs within 3 months of enrolling was 10 percent or higher at 21 of 194 Medicare HMOs in 1996. Lack of a basic understanding of HMO processes can also hinder a beneficiary\u2019s ability to obtain care through a health plan. According to a study by HHS\u2019 Office of Inspector General, many beneficiaries who were denied services by their HMOs and subsequently disenrolled did not know they could appeal the HMOs\u2019 decisions.", "Information that helps beneficiaries to compare specific Medicare health plans is important because covered benefits, fees, and consumer satisfaction can vary substantially among health plans. In our 1998 report, we found a wide variation in one potential indicator of beneficiary satisfaction\u2014the plans\u2019 disenrollment rates\u2014among HMO plans that operated in the same market. For example, in Houston, Texas, the highest disenrollment rate was nearly 56 percent while the lowest rate was 8 percent. Many beneficiaries select a health plan based upon information contained in the plan\u2019s advertisements and marketing materials. However, in 1996 we found that it was difficult to use this literature to compare various benefit packages because plans\u2019 benefit descriptions were not required to follow a common format or use standard terminology. At that time there was no widely available, objective source of information to help beneficiaries compare their Medicare options. We recommended that HCFA compile comparative information and make it available to beneficiaries. In response to our report, HCFA agreed that beneficiaries needed more information and outlined several initiatives designed to help beneficiaries understand Medicare and compare their FFS and managed care plan options.", "In establishing the M+C program, the Congress included provisions designed to help Medicare beneficiaries become better informed health care consumers. BBA mandated that HCFA take an active role in educating beneficiaries about Medicare and the M+C program. The law specifically mandated that the agency compile and distribute comparative information about M+C plans. To complement these mandated education activities, HCFA took steps to make it easier for beneficiaries to use health plans\u2019 marketing materials to compare benefit packages. Health plans are now required to make available a summary of benefits that follows a common format and uses standard terminology.", "Future changes in the Medicare program will heighten the importance of informed decisions. Historically, beneficiaries have been able to change health plans or switch between a health plan and the FFS program on a monthly basis. However, starting in November 2001, beneficiaries generally will make choices only during an annual open enrollment period for the following year. Each November, beneficiaries must decide whether they want to enroll in a particular M+C plan, change from one M+C plan to another, or return to the traditional FFS program. They will then be \u201clocked in\u201d to that choice for the following calendar year. Some proponents of this provision believed that constraining enrollment opportunities into a few weeks each year would encourage concentrated health plan advertising that would help make beneficiaries more aware of the M+C program and available health plans. The extent to which this will occur is uncertain. However, it is clear that the lock-in provision will magnify the consequences and importance of each beneficiary\u2019s decision.", "Changes in the beneficiary population may add to the demand for information. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 69 percent of Americans under age 65 want more private plans in Medicare.The same survey found the opposite among those over age 65\u2014only 31 percent want greater choice of private plans, while the rest are content with Medicare as it has been. These findings suggest that future beneficiaries may be more interested in a private health plan option, increasing the need for information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major NMEP Activities", "paragraphs": ["To fulfill BBA\u2019s beneficiary education requirements, HCFA established a NMEP that included four major approaches for delivering information to beneficiaries (see table 1). A new telephone help line (1-800-MEDICARE) handled about 3.9 million calls in 2000. The Medicare handbook, now titled Medicare & You, was expanded to contain comparative information on M+C plans and is now mailed annually to all households with a Medicare beneficiary (about 34 million). Prior to 1998, the Medicare handbook did not contain information on specific managed care plans and was generally mailed only to newly eligible beneficiaries or those who requested a copy. A Medicare Internet site (www.medicare.gov) was established to provide more detailed information on M+C plans and other topics. Community outreach efforts were implemented to inform beneficiaries who might face language or cultural barriers or otherwise need special assistance. Finally, to help ensure that its education efforts operated effectively, the agency sponsored a number of internal and external evaluations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare Telephone Help Line", "paragraphs": ["HCFA phased in a Medicare telephone help line (1-800-MEDICARE) beginning in November 1998. First available in five states (i.e., Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington), the help line was expanded to cover all states in March 1999. As publicity about the help line increased and more beneficiaries became aware of its existence, the number of calls grew from an average of 27,000 calls per month shortly after the line went nationwide to an average of 326,000 calls per month in calendar year 2000. Even with the substantially increased call volume, most beneficiaries had no trouble getting through. According to a HCFA- sponsored study, during 2000 92 percent of calls were answered within 30 seconds.", "About 60 percent of Medicare help line callers speak directly to a customer service representative (CSR). The most common reason why beneficiaries call is to request a copy of Medicare & You or another publication. Beneficiaries also frequently ask how to apply for Medicare or get a replacement Medicare card, or ask questions about Medicaid, Medicare coverage and claims payment, or M+C plans. CSRs attempt to answer beneficiaries\u2019 questions by following a prepared script. Because beneficiaries call with a wide variety of questions, about half the time the information required is not contained in the script. In those instances the CSR transfers the caller to an appropriate third party, typically a Medicare claims processing contractor (37 percent of the transferred calls); the state Medicaid office (19 percent); the Social Security Administration (16 percent); State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP) that support counselors who answer beneficiary questions about Medicare, Medigap, and Medicaid (10 percent); or other entities including M+C plans (18 percent).", "The remaining 40 percent of callers obtain the information they seek through the help line\u2019s automated system.

However, the agency also produces more than two dozen educational booklets and brochures on specific topics, including Medicare managed care. (Appendix II contains a list of these publications.)", "Prior to the enactment of BBA, HCFA annually produced a Medicare handbook but generally distributed it only to newly eligible beneficiaries and other individuals who requested a copy. Every few years HCFA mailed a current copy of the handbook to all beneficiaries. The intervals between mailings varied and depended partly on the extent to which the Medicare program had changed since the last mailing. However, in response to BBA, HCFA changed its handbook distribution practices. BBA required that beneficiaries receive comprehensive written information about the Medicare FFS program, the M+C program, and available options prior to Medicare\u2019s newly established annual open enrollment period each November. To fulfill this requirement, HCFA began annual mailings of the Medicare handbook in 1998.", "The Medicare & You edition for 2001 contains between 80 and 92 pages, depending on the geographic area for which it is intended. The document\u2019s length is due, in part, to BBA provisions that require the annual mailing to describe Medicare FFS program benefits, cost sharing, and liability for uncovered services; grievance and appeal rights; supplemental coverage options; the process for enrolling in M+C plans; and the potential effects on beneficiaries enrolled in M+C plans that withdraw from the program or reduce geographic service areas. Another reason for the length is that HCFA-sponsored research indicated that the handbook must use a large type size and limit the amount of text on each page to make it readable for the majority of the Medicare population. The handbook is designed as a reference guide and contains instructions and telephone numbers for obtaining additional information.", "Although every Medicare handbook describes both the traditional FFS program and the M+C program, the handbooks issued in geographic areas served by M+C plans also contain a section with comparative information tailored to those areas. These supplemental sections, which range in length from 24 to 36 pages, list every M+C plan that operates in the area along with the plan\u2019s telephone number, the geographic areas it serves, the monthly premium it charges, and whether it provides coverage for prescription drugs. Beneficiaries are directed to call either the plan or Medicare\u2019s telephone help line or to log onto Medicare\u2019s Internet site to obtain more detailed information about a specific plan. The supplemental section also contains two quality indicators for each plan  of members who rated their care as the best possible and the percentage of female members who received a mammogram during a 2-year period. The results for each plan are compared with all M+C plans operating in the same state. The mammogram percentages are also compared with FFS program beneficiaries in the same state.

HCFA established the Citizens Advisory Panel on Medicare Education. Along with the alliance partners, the advisory panel\u2014which consists of 15 members from fields of senior citizen advocacy, health economics research, health insurers, providers and clinicians, and employers\u2014provides input to guide NMEP activities.

The total of $244.5 million in user fees spent in fiscal years 1998 through 2000 funded about three-quarters of the program. However, M+C plans objected to funding so much of NMEP because plans enrolled less than 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries and because NMEP provided general information about Medicare in addition to information specific to the M+C program. To address this perceived inequity, BBRA specified that the total amount of user fees collected in a year would equal the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in M+C plans multiplied by $100 million. In fiscal year 2001, for example, BBRA\u2019s formula allows CMS to collect approximately $17 million in user fees.", "To adjust to the loss of approximately $78 million in annual user fee revenues without scaling back NMEP activities, a larger portion of HCFA\u2019s Medicare operations budget had to be devoted to the program. In fiscal year 2001, $54.1 million of the $1.2 billion Medicare operations budget has been used to support NMEP, more than double the previous annual average of $20.2 million. In fiscal year 2001, the effect of reduced user fee revenues was partially offset by surpluses in NMEP\u2019s accounts. CMS can draw on $15.5 million in previously collected but unspent user fees, $25.0 million in previously collected user fees allocated to a printing account, and $5.6 million in previously funded program management money held in a postage account (see table 4). Therefore, the full impact of the reduction will not be apparent until fiscal year 2002, when CMS will have to devote an additional $46.1 million of the agency\u2019s budget to NMEP to maintain historical spending levels or scale back NMEP\u2019s activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary and Plan Reaction to NMEP", "paragraphs": ["Beneficiaries and beneficiary advocacy groups generally praised NMEP\u2019s major activities.

However, HCFA-sponsored research suggests that NMEP may need to adopt new education strategies to encourage other beneficiaries to actively consider their Medicare options.", "Beginning in the fall of 2001, it will become more important for beneficiaries to be aware that M+C health plan alternatives to the traditional FFS program may be available in their geographic area and to understand each option and its implications. As required by the BBA, Medicare will now have an annual open enrollment period each November when beneficiaries may select either the FFS program or a specific M+C plan for the following calendar year. Beneficiaries who do not specify a different selection during that period will remain in the FFS program or their M+C plan. Beneficiaries will have strictly limited opportunities for changing their selection outside of the open enrollment period, a constraint known as \u201clock-in.\u201d", "Although modifications to NMEP may be indicated to promote active, informed choice, CMS is constrained in its ability to alter certain aspects of the information campaign. BBA provisions specify the content and timing of many existing NMEP activities. Altering these activities could require statutory changes. In addition, short time frames each year hamper the agency\u2019s ability to compile and distribute comparative information in advance of the open enrollment period.", "Recently, CMS announced changes to NMEP activities planned for this fall. The agency will undertake a $30 million advertising campaign to increase awareness of M+C and recent changes in the Medicare program. CMS also announced it will allow plans to submit their benefit package proposals for the 2002 contract year by September 17, 2001, instead of the July deadline specified in BBRA. This extension is intended to encourage plan participation in the M+C program. However, it will hamper the ability of both CMS and plans to distribute information to beneficiaries before the start of the annual enrollment period in November. To help minimize the impact that this delay might have on beneficiaries, the agency has also announced it will extend the enrollment period through December 2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Promoting Active, Informed Choice", "paragraphs": ["To date, HCFA has improved NMEP by enhancing or fine tuning existing activities. During the first 3 years of NMEP, the agency increased the amount of comparative information available through the handbook, telephone help line, and Internet site. It also improved the presentation of some information. For example, in response to focus group findings and comments from literacy experts, HCFA made the handbook easier for beneficiaries to read by increasing the typeface size and amount of white space surrounding the text. To make finding information easier, HCFA expanded the handbook\u2019s table of contents and added color tabs for the telephone section. The agency modified portions of the handbook that focus group participants identified as confusing. HCFA also sought efficiencies to limit NMEP costs. For example, it evaluated the types of inquiries CSRs received and used the findings to modify the information available through the automated menus. As a result, the number of calls handled by the automated menus increased from 20 percent to 40 percent. Because calls that do not involve a CSR are substantially less expensive, these actions have helped to control the cost of the help line.", "HCFA recently began studying alternative education strategies that could require more substantial changes to NMEP. Research suggests that NMEP primarily helped the minority of beneficiaries who were already considering their Medicare coverage options. The comparative information and improved access to information may have enabled those beneficiaries to make more informed decisions. However, NMEP did not appear to motivate the majority of beneficiaries to consciously examine their present Medicare arrangements and consider whether alternatives might be better for them. Although health plans, through their marketing efforts, seek to move beneficiaries to such a decision point, the language in BBA indicates that CMS is expected to play a role too. Specifically, BBA directs the Secretary of HHS (and thus, by extension, CMS) to undertake activities that \u201cpromote an active, informed selection.\u201d To that end, CMS is researching how NMEP might encourage more beneficiaries to consciously consider their Medicare options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandates and Short Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["Whether CMS decides to maintain the existing NMEP efforts or replace or augment them with new activities, the agency faces two major constraints.", "BBA requirements. The prescriptive nature of BBA\u2019s NMEP provisions may limit CMS\u2019 flexibility to alter existing activities. The Medicare handbook illustrates one of the major constraints facing CMS. Beneficiary advocacy groups and organizations representing health plans indicated that the current handbook is too long and raised doubts about whether it is the best vehicle to educate beneficiaries about their options. One beneficiary advocate questioned whether mailing the handbook annually to all Medicare households was the best use of NMEP resources. They suggested that CMS could distribute the handbook to new enrollees and make it available to others upon request, but conduct mass mailings only when changes in Medicare required an update. However, BBA requires an annual mailing and specifies an extensive list of topics\u2014in addition to a list of available M+C plans and a comparison of plan options\u2014that must be covered. For example, the mailing must include information on the FFS program\u2019s covered benefits and cost sharing; procedures for selecting an M+C plan or the FFS program; beneficiary rights and the appeals process in both M+C plans and the FFS program; and descriptions of benefits, enrollment rights, and other requirements of Medicare supplemental policies (Medigap). Significantly modifying the content of the handbook or changing how frequently it is mailed may require a statutory change.", "Short time frames. Compressed time frames each year hampers the agency\u2019s efforts to distribute more complete comparative information in printed form. A complaint voiced by beneficiary and health plan representatives is that the Medicare handbook contains limited comparative information about M+C plans. According to HCFA officials, plan benefit package details have not been available until late September when plans\u2019 Medicare contracts for the coming year were approved. That left the agency too little time to assemble extensive data in a handbook that must be mailed out by mid-October, as required by BBA. HCFA therefore pre-approved selected aspects of each plan\u2019s contract. The agency focused on the basic information it believed would most help beneficiaries make some initial decisions: plan service area, monthly premium, whether prescription drugs are covered, and how to contact the plan for detailed information. HCFA included other information, such as rates of mammography screening exams and beneficiary satisfaction with plans\u2019 primary care physicians, that was not dependent on the contract approval package. Complete benefit information for each plan was not available until more than a month after the Medicare handbook was printed (see fig. 1). At that time, the information was posted on the Medicare Health Plan Compare pages of the Medicare Internet site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent CMS Announcements Regarding Fall 2001 NMEP Activities", "paragraphs": ["CMS recently announced that it would fund a $30 million advertising campaign this fall to increase beneficiaries\u2019 awareness of the choices available to them and to encourage them to use the NMEP information channels to learn more about those choices.

The agency will also extend the operating hours of the help line and add an interactive feature to the Internet site designed to help beneficiaries select the Medicare coverage option that best fits their preferences.", "CMS has made other decisions about the fall information campaign that illustrate the sometimes difficult trade-off between accommodating plans and serving beneficiaries. To encourage health plan participation in the M+C program, CMS has allowed plans additional time to prepare their 2002 benefit proposals. In a June 2001 memorandum, CMS notified M+C plans that for contract year 2002 the deadline for filing complete cost and benefit information in their adjusted community rate proposals (ACRP) would be moved from July 2, 2001 to September 17, 2001. M+C plans were still required to submit a non-binding summary by July 2, 2001. According to CMS officials, the agency expects to review and approve all of the ACRPs by October 26, 2001.", "The ACRP extension further shortens the time frames for NMEP activities, hampering the ability of CMS and health plans to disseminate information before the BBA-established November open enrollment period (see fig. 1). For example, 2002 cost and benefit information will not be posted on the Medicare\u2019s Internet site until October 1. Plan benefit packages that have not been approved by CMS will include a disclaimer that the information is pending approval. CMS had planned to not include any information about specific health plans in the annual handbook mailed to Medicare households. However, an August 9, 2001 court order requires the Secretary of HHS to mail comparative information on health plans to beneficiaries at least 15 days before the beginning of the November open enrollment period (October 16), the deadline specified in BBA. To comply with the court order, CMS will prepare separate brochures containing comparative plan information and mail them by October 16. To reduce the potentially adverse effects of an abbreviated fall information campaign, the agency will allow health plans to distribute marketing materials with proposed benefit package information marked \u201cpending Federal approval.\u201d CMS will also extend the open enrollment period through the end of December."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HCFA fulfilled the BBA\u2019s basic requirements for NMEP by making information readily available through a number of communication devices such as printed materials, telephone help line, Internet site, and community outreach efforts.

Currently, beneficiaries may change health plans or switch between the traditional FFS and M+C programs monthly. However, in November and December 2001 beneficiaries will select how they will receive Medicare coverage during 2002\u2014under the traditional FFS program arrangements or through a specific M+C plan. After beneficiaries make their initial selection they typically will have only one opportunity to switch their coverage arrangements until the start of the new benefit year in 2003.", "The agency only recently began studying approaches that might encourage more beneficiaries to actively consider their Medicare coverage options.
