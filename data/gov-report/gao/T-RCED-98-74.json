The first of these is our March 1997 report, which discusses the time taken to evaluate hazardous waste sites for possible placement on the National Priorities List (NPL)\u2014the Superfund program\u2019s list of the nation\u2019s worst hazardous waste sites\u2014and the time to clean them up after the listing. The second report is our September 1997 report on the status of cleanup for sites listed from 1986 to 1994. The pace of Superfund cleanups has been a long-standing concern of the Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).In the 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Congress set time goals for EPA to (1) evaluate sites for placement, when warranted, on the NPL and (2) begin various cleanup actions. EPA has also established targets for processing Superfund sites for budget and planning purposes. I would like to outline the findings of these reports and briefly respond to EPA\u2019s comments on our March report.", "Our March 1997 report said that EPA took an average of 9.4 years\u2014calculated from the date of each site\u2019s discovery\u2014to evaluate and process the nonfederal sites it added to the NPL in 1996. This evaluation and processing time was generally longer than for prior years. For example, listing took an average of 5.8 years after discovery for the nonfederal sites added to the NPL in 1986 through 1990. SARA requires EPA to evaluate nonfederal sites for listing, when warranted, within 4 years of their discovery. Listing decisions were made within 4 years of discovery for 43 percent of the 8,931 nonfederal sites discovered in 1987 through 1991\u2014the last year for which an analysis could be done at the time of our review. A number of factors contributed to the increased time to list a site, including a backlog of sites awaiting evaluation and a reduction in the annual number of sites being added to the NPL.", "Our March report also said that cleanup times have also lengthened for completed projects. Nonfederal cleanup projects completed in 1986 through 1989 were finished, on average, 3.9 years after the sites were placed on the NPL. By 1996, however, nonfederal cleanup completions averaged 10.6 years. Although SARA did not set deadlines for completing cleanups within a certain number of years, EPA set an expectation for 1993 for its regions to complete a cleanup within 5 years of a site\u2019s listing. Ten percent of the cleanup projects at nonfederal sites listed in 1986 through 1990 were finished within 5 years of the site\u2019s listing. Much of the time to complete cleanups is attributable to the early planning phases of the cleanup process when the decision is made on the selection of a cleanup remedy. Actual construction work at sites is being done quicker than the selection of cleanup remedies. EPA officials attributed the increased completion times for cleanups to the growing complexity of sites, efforts to reach settlements with parties responsible for site contamination, and resource constraints.", "Our September report said that because a large portion\u201487 percent\u2014of the sites listed on the NPL in fiscal years 1986 through 1994 were still in the Superfund cleanup process as of July 1, 1997, the average cleanup time for this group of listed sites will exceed 8 years, possibly by a substantial margin. EPA has estimated that recently listed sites will be cleaned up within an average of 8 years.", "EPA said that the methodology used in our March 1997 report was biased in favor of showing increasing completion times and that the report is inconsistent with our earlier Superfund reports. It claimed to have recently speeded up the Superfund process. We believe that our March 1997 report fairly portrays trends in the program and is consistent with our earlier reports. In its comments to us, EPA did not adequately support its claim of faster processing times."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1980, the Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, to clean up highly contaminated hazardous waste sites. The act gave EPA the authority to clean up the sites and to compel the parties responsible for the contamination to perform or pay for the cleanups. As of September 30, 1997, there were 1,353 sites on the NPL, and another 52 had been proposed for listing; 159 of the currently listed sites are federal sites. As of the end of fiscal year 1997, EPA had begun constructing cleanup remedies at 477 sites. It has completed constructing cleanup remedies at 504 sites. EPA\u2019s goal is to complete the construction of remedies at 650 sites by the end of the year 2000, assuming level funding.", "Cleanup actions fall into two broad categories: removal actions and remedial actions. Removal actions are usually short-term actions designed to stabilize or clean up a hazardous site that poses an immediate threat to human health or the environment. Remedial actions are usually longer-term and more costly actions aimed at a permanent remedy. The sites that are referred to EPA for Superfund consideration are screened in a number of evaluations leading to a decision on whether to list the site on the NPL. Once listed, the sites are further studied for risks, and cleanup remedies are chosen, designed, and constructed. (See app. I for a more detailed description of the steps to place a site on the NPL and the time taken to accomplish those steps. See app. II for a similar discussion of the steps to clean up a site.)", "The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) provided that facilities discovered after the act was passed should be evaluated for placement on the NPL within 4 years of the site\u2019s discovery if EPA determines on the basis of a site inspection or preliminary assessment that such an evaluation is warranted. In 1992, EPA developed techniques to speed up the evaluation and cleanup of sites. These techniques included the expanded use of removal actions and the merging of certain site evaluations. EPA pilot-tested these techniques in 1992 and declared them operational in 1994. In 1995, EPA initiated its final round of administrative reforms, intended to make the program faster and achieve other improvements. In planning its Superfund activities in 1993, EPA set an expectation that sites would be cleaned up within 5 years from listing. More recently however, EPA has estimated that newly listed sites will be cleaned up within 8 years.", "For our reviews, we asked EPA to provide us with data on the length of time taken (l) to evaluate sites for possible placement on the NPL and (2) to complete cleanups of listed sites. The source of the data was EPA\u2019s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS), which is the official repository of Superfund data. To measure the time taken to evaluate sites for listing, we identified sites that were added to the NPL each year and calculated the time between their listing and their \u201cdiscovery,\u201d i.e., their entry into CERCLIS. To measure the time for the cleanup process following listing, we identified the \u201coperable units\u201d at which remedial actions had been completed each year and calculated the time between the end of the remedial action and the date the site was added to the NPL. We also measured the time it had taken operable units to complete various phases of the Superfund process.

The average site listing time has not met SARA\u2019s 4-year goal since 1986.", "Although average listing times have generally lengthened, it should be understood that EPA can move quickly to list some sites if circumstances warrant. For example, in 1996, it listed three sites within 9 to 12 months after discovery when the Public Health Service\u2019s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry issued a public health advisory concerning the sites. EPA used an expedited process that bypassed its normal evaluation process to list these sites. In addition, EPA may undertake removal actions at sites to deal with imminent threats before they are listed. However, listing is necessary before the full range of problems presented by many sites can be addressed under Superfund.", "The increase in the time to complete site listing is primarily a result of delays in processing sites in the end stage of the listing process, that is, after the sites have been inspected and the final analysis needed to evaluate their eligibility is done. (See app. I for a description of the Superfund process for evaluating sites for listing.) The time to complete this end stage for sites that were listed on the NPL rose from about 2 years in fiscal year 1986 to about 6 years in fiscal year 1996. A substantial portion of this time is accounted for by periods in which sites were in backlogs awaiting processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cleanup Completion Times Have Lengthened", "paragraphs": ["For sites with completed cleanups, the average time between the sites\u2019 placement on the NPL and the completion of the cleanup increased in 1986 to 1996.

In 1996, cleanup completions averaged 10.6 years for nonfederal operable units. As mentioned earlier, in 1993 EPA set an expectation for its regions to complete a cleanup within 5 years of a site\u2019s listing. More recently, EPA said it expected that the sites listed in fiscal years 1993 through 1996 would be cleaned up in an average of 8 years.", "The increase in overall cleanup times was accompanied by a marked increase in the time to select cleanup remedies\u2014the study phase of the cleanup process and the time during which attempts are made to reach settlements with the parties responsible for site contamination. This study phase was completed on average in about 2-1/2 years in 1986 but took an average of about 8 years in 1996.

We calculated, for the sites that began the cleanup process in fiscal years 1986 through 1994, (1) how long it took to clean up completed sites and (2) how long the uncompleted sites have been in the cleanup process. We found that, as of July 1, 1997, remedial action had been completed at 13 percent (95) of the 752 sites placed on the NPL in fiscal years 1986 through 1994. These remedial actions were completed in an average of 6.3 years after the sites were listed. As of the same date, remedial action had not been completed at 87 percent (657) of the sites listed in fiscal years 1986 through 1994. These uncompleted sites had been in the cleanup process an average of 8.1 years, that is, they had been listed on the NPL an average of 8.1 years earlier. Assuming that all remedial actions at these \u201cin process\u201d sites had been completed on July 1, 1997, the average cleanup duration for all sites listed on the NPL during the 9-year period would have been 7.9 years, almost as long as EPA\u2019s 8-year estimate of the cleanup time for recently listed sites. But because such a large proportion of the sites are still in process, the average cleanup time for these sites will exceed 8 years, possibly by a substantial margin. EPA can reach its 8-year cleanup estimate for recently listed sites only through much faster cleanup times than have been achieved in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing the Sites\u2019 Listing and Cleanup Times", "paragraphs": ["The Superfund database, which was the primary source for the data presented in this statement, does not contain all the information needed to fully explain the reasons for the changes in study and cleanup completion times over the history of the program. However, our past reviews and discussions with EPA officials have identified some of the factors that have lengthened listing and cleanup times.", "The time from discovery to listing has increased over the years for a number of reasons. A major factor was that the Superfund program started with a backlog of sites awaiting evaluation. In addition, program changes caused other delays. These changes included revisions to eligibility standards requiring the reevaluation of many sites, the need to seek states\u2019 concurrence for site listings, and reductions in the annual number of sites that EPA added to Superfund. Furthermore, between 1994 through 1996, EPA\u2019s budget for assessing sites was cut by some 50 percent and, according to EPA officials, EPA\u2019s current priority is to finish cleaning up sites that have already been listed. The probability of long time frames for future site listings is indicated by the large number of sites that are awaiting a listing decision (about 3,000) and the small number of sites that have been admitted to the Superfund program in recent years (an average of 16 per year in fiscal years 1992 through 1996).", "EPA officials said that the upward trend in cleanup times for completed sites might be linked to the completion of more difficult cleanups. Our work supports this explanation. In September 1994, we reported that EPA\u2019s data revealed longer average cleanup times for ongoing projects than for those already completed. In that report, we said that despite EPA\u2019s efforts to expedite cleanups, cleanup times might grow longer because of the greater complexity of these ongoing projects. Also, EPA officials said that the effort to find the parties responsible for contaminating sites and reach cleanup settlements with them can increase cleanup times. They also thought that funding had affected the pace of cleanup. For example, they said that because of budget constraints, EPA was not able to fund $200 million to $300 million in cleanup projects in fiscal year 1996. In addition, EPA has shifted funding away from selecting remedies and toward the design and construction phases of the cleanup process. As indicated, remedy selection times have increased greatly over the years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Reaction to Our Findings", "paragraphs": ["In responding to a draft of our March 1997 report and in a December letter to GAO, EPA objected to our portrayal of the program\u2019s completion times.

We have responded to these objections in our final March 1997 report and in a letter to the Administrator of EPA.We would like at this time to reemphasize a few of the points we made in our response to EPA\u2019s comments:", "Our methodology accurately and fairly presents information on various trends in the Superfund program. This methodology shows increasing cleanup times for sites completing the Superfund cleanup process, not because it was \u201cprogrammed\u201d to produce this result, as EPA claimed, but because these times have, in fact, increased.", "Our reports and testimony over the last several years that have discussed the slow progress of site cleanups in the Superfund program are entirely consistent with our March 1997 report. For example, in 1994 we reported that EPA\u2019s data indicated a trend toward longer cleanup times for projects still under way, even though the agency had initiated several major efforts to expedite the process. In fact, some of these \u201cin process\u201d sites are now reaching the end of cleanup and are reflected in the March 1997 report\u2019s data on recent longer cleanup completion times.", "The data we presented in our March 1997 report are most relevant for judging the program\u2019s performance for those sites that have completed the entire assessment and cleanup process or the segments of it\u2014such as remedy selection\u2014that we measured.

EPA enters a potentially contaminated site into a database known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS).

If the preliminary assessment shows that the site warrants further study, EPA may proceed to the next step of the evaluation process, the site inspection, which takes a more detailed look at possible contamination. If at any point the site is found not to pose a potential threat serious enough to warrant federal attention, the site can be eliminated from further consideration under CERCLA.", "If warranted by the results of the site inspection, EPA applies the hazard ranking system to evaluate the site\u2019s potential risk to public health and the environment. The hazard ranking system is a numerically based scoring system that uses information from the preliminary assessment and the site inspection to assign each site a score ranging from 0 to 100. This score is used as a screening tool to determine whether a site should be considered for further action under CERCLA. A site with a score of 28.5 or higher is considered for placement on the NPL.
