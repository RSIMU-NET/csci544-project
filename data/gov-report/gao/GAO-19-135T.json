However, many passenger railroads are nearing completion of the equipment installation stage. For example, two-thirds of passenger railroads reported being more than 90 percent complete with equipment installation. With regard to testing, Amtrak has reported that it has initiated both field testing and revenue service demonstration (RSD), an advanced form of field testing that is required to fully implement PTC. However, most commuter railroads reported slower progress with testing. Of the 28 commuter railroads required to implement PTC, 19 reported initiating field testing, but only eight reported initiating RSD. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) recently clarified the criteria railroads must meet to qualify for a 2-year extension past the December 31, 2018, PTC implementation deadline. To receive an extension, railroads must meet six statutory criteria. For the sixth criterion, commuter railroads are authorized to either initiate RSD on at least one track segment or use FRA-approved substitute criteria. FRA clarified these and other requirements at three PTC symposiums hosted for railroads in summer 2018. For example, FRA officials said that initiating field testing instead of RSD was one approach that commuter railroads could potentially take to receive FRA's approval of substitute criteria. FRA's actions are consistent with GAO's March 2018 recommendation that the agency communicate to railroads the requirements and process for an extension.", "Challenges related to PTC implementation and FRA's resources raise questions as to the extent FRA and the passenger railroad industry are poised for full PTC implementation by December 31, 2020. Most passenger railroads anticipate needing an extension, leaving substantial work for both railroads and FRA to complete before the end of 2020. Almost three-quarters of passenger railroads (21 of 29) reported that they, or the railroad which owns the track on which they operate, will apply for an extension. More than half of these railroads reported planning to apply for an extension using substitute criteria, and of these, eight intend to apply for substitute criteria based on field testing. Though use of substitute criteria is authorized in law, this approach defers time-intensive RSD testing into 2019 and beyond. In addition, passenger railroads reported that they continue to face many of the same challenges GAO previously identified, such as software defects and limited industry-wide availability of vendors. Further, passenger railroads expressed concern that FRA's workload will markedly increase as railroads submit requests for extension approvals. FRA has acknowledged concerns about the pending surge of submissions and agency officials said they have taken recent steps to help manage the forthcoming influx of documentation, such as reallocating resources. However, as of September 21, 2018, only one passenger railroad had applied for an extension. It remains unclear how many extension requests FRA will receive or what FRA's enforcement strategy will be for noncompliance with the statute, such as for railroads that fail to apply for an extension by the deadline."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In March 2018, GAO recommended FRA take steps to systematically communicate extension information to railroads and to use a risk-based approach to prioritize agency resources and workload.

In September 2008\u201410 years ago  last month\u2014a commuter train and freight train collided in the Chatsworth  neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, resulting in 25 deaths and over  100 injuries. In the wake of this accident, legislation was enacted  requiring certain railroads to implement PTC\u2014a communications-based  system designed to slow or stop a train that is not being operated safely.  Forty railroads are required to implement PTC. These railroads include  28 commuter railroads and Amtrak, which collectively provide over 500-  million passenger trips annually. Railroads that play a key role in our  nation\u2019s freight network must also implement PTC, including the seven  largest Class I and four Class II and III freight railroads.", "As we have previously reported, PTC implementation is a complex and  lengthy process, which touches almost every part of major rail lines and  almost every aspect of railroads\u2019 train operations. Each implementing  railroad must install more than 20 major components that will ultimately  communicate trains\u2019 locations, movements, and speed, and then slow or  stop a train that is not being operated safely. Full implementation of PTC  involves a number of steps, including but not limited to: planning and  system development, equipment installation, testing, system certification,  and achieving interoperability. Since U.S. railroads often operate some or  all of their trains as \u201ctenants\u201d on the track of another railroad, known as  the \u201chost,\u201d interoperability is intended to enable trains that operate on the  same track to be governed by the PTC system and to move seamlessly  across track owned by different railroads.", "When PTC implementation was mandated in 2008, the statutory deadline  for railroads\u2019 implementation was December 31, 2015. We reported in  September 2015 that nearly all railroads did not expect to meet this  deadline. In October 2015, Congress extended the deadline to  December 31, 2018, and established criteria that would enable FRA, the  agency responsible for overseeing PTC implementation, to grant railroads  meeting certain requirements an alternative schedule up to year-end  2020. Throughout this statement we refer to the alternative schedule as  the \u201cextension.\u201d My testimony today discusses the efforts of FRA and  passenger railroads\u2014which include commuter railroads and Amtrak, an  intercity passenger railroad\u2014to implement PTC as the December 31,  2018, deadline approaches and since we testified on PTC in March  2018. My statement today will address (1) passenger railroads\u2019  implementation progress and the steps that FRA has taken to assist  these railroads and (2) how passenger railroads and FRA plan to  approach PTC implementation to meet the December 2018 and  December 2020 deadlines.", "To describe passenger railroads\u2019 progress, we analyzed the most recent  available quarterly PTC implementation reports that railroads submitted to  FRA, reports that reflected the progress as of June 30, 2018. We  analyzed the reports to determine the extent that each railroad has  installed PTC hardware and initiated testing. Based on our review of  these data for anomalies, outliers, or missing information and our  previous assessment of such quarterly reports for our March 2018  testimony, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes of describing railroads\u2019 progress in PTC implementation. To  describe passenger railroads\u2019 and FRA\u2019s progress and approaches, we  interviewed representatives from 16 railroads, including the 12 railroads  (11 commuter railroads and one Class III freight railroad) that FRA  identified in June 2018 as at risk of not having implemented PTC or  qualifying for an extension by December 31, 2018. The remaining four  railroads we interviewed were: Amtrak, which provides intercity passenger rail service; two Class I freight railroads, which were selected  based on their relationships with tenant railroads and substantial progress  toward PTC implementation; and a commuter railroad that received  approval from FRA in March 2018 for an exception from PTC system  implementation. To describe how railroads and FRA plan to approach  PTC implementation for the December 2018 and 2020 deadlines, we sent  41 railroads a semi-structured questionnaire. The questions we asked  were based on the data collection efforts from our March 2018 testimony.  We analyzed railroads\u2019 responses and summarized their plans and  challenges into common categories. To determine the stage of PTC  implementation railroads expected to reach by December 31, 2018, we  considered railroads\u2019 responses to our questionnaire, information  provided in interviews, and documents submitted to FRA regarding  railroads\u2019 planned implementation approaches, among other information.  To describe railroads\u2019 progress and FRA\u2019s actions to assist railroads, we  interviewed the industry associations for commuter (American Public  Transportation Association) and freight (Association of American  Railroads) railroads, and two PTC vendors. We also reviewed applicable  laws and FRA regulations, presentations, reports, and guidance and  interviewed FRA officials. While our audit work included Class I, II, and III  freight railroads, commuter railroads, and intercity passenger rail, this  statement is focused on passenger railroads\u2019\u2014commuter and intercity\u2014 progress and approaches to meet the December 2018 and December  2020 deadlines.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2018 to October 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["PTC systems are required by law to prevent certain types of accidents or  incidents. In particular, a PTC system must be designed to prevent train- to-train collisions, derailments due to excessive speed, incursions into  work zone limits, and the movement of a train through a switch left in the  wrong position. While railroads may implement any PTC system that  meets these requirements, the majority of passenger railroads are  implementing one of four types of systems. PTC\u2019s intended safety  benefits can be fully achieved nationwide when all required railroads have  successfully installed PTC components, tested that these components  work together and the systems function as designed, and are  interoperable with other host and tenant railroads\u2019 PTC systems that  share track. Interoperability means the locomotives of any host railroad  and tenant railroad operating over the same track segment will  communicate with and respond to the PTC system, allowing uninterrupted  movements over property boundaries. Interoperability is critical to PTC  functioning properly given the complexity of the rail network in the United  States. In much of the country, Class I freight railroads function as hosts  for Amtrak and commuter railroads. For example, one of the seven major  Class I freight railroads reports that 24 tenant railroads operate over its  PTC-equipped tracks, including freight, Amtrak, and commuter railroads.  A notable exception to this is the Northeast Corridor, which runs from  Washington, D.C., to Boston, Massachusetts, which Amtrak  predominantly owns and over which six freight and seven commuter  railroads operate as tenants.", "PTC implementation involves multiple stages to achieve full  implementation, including planning and system development, equipment  installation and testing, system certification, and full deployment, including  interoperability. Each railroad must develop an FRA-approved PTC  implementation plan that includes project schedules and milestones for  certain activities, such as equipment installation. The equipment  installation stage involves many components, including communication  systems; hardware on locomotives and along the side of the track (called  \u201cwayside equipment\u201d); and software in centralized office locations as well  as onboard the train and along the track. Each railroad is required to  report quarterly and annually to FRA on its PTC implementation status  relative to its implementation plan. A railroad can also revise its  implementation plan to reflect changes to the project, which then must be  reviewed and approved by FRA.", "In addition, railroads must demonstrate that the PTC systems are  deployed safely and meet functional requirements through multiple stages  of testing. Before initiating testing on the general rail system, railroads  must submit a formal test request for FRA approval that includes, among  other things, the specific test procedures, dates and locations for testing,  and the effect the tests will have on current operations. The multiple  stages of PTC testing include:", "Laboratory testing: locomotive and wayside equipment testing in a  lab environment to verify that individual components function as  designed.", "Field testing: includes several different tests of individual  components and the overall system, such as testing of each  locomotive type to verify that it meets functional requirements and  field integration testing\u2014a key implementation milestone to verify that  each PTC component is integrated and functioning safely as  designed.", "Revenue service demonstration (RSD): an advanced form of field  testing in which the railroad operates PTC-equipped trains in regular  service under specific conditions. RSD is intended to validate the  performance of the PTC system as a whole and to test the system  under normal, real-world operations.", "Interoperability testing: host and tenant railroads that operate on the  same track must work together to test interoperability to ensure each  railroad can operate seamlessly across property boundaries. Almost  all of the 40 railroads currently required to implement PTC must  demonstrate interoperability with at least one other railroad\u2019s PTC  system.", "Using results from field and RSD testing, combined with other  information, host railroads must then submit a safety plan to FRA for  approval. We have previously reported that these safety plans are about  5,000 pages in length. Once FRA approves a safety plan, the railroad  receives PTC system certification, which is required for full  implementation, and is authorized to operate the PTC system in revenue  service. According to FRA officials, the FRA may impose conditions to the  PTC safety plan approval as necessary to ensure safety, resulting in a  conditional certification.", "Railroads may receive a maximum 2-year extension from FRA past the  December 31, 2018, deadline if they meet six criteria set forth in statute.  Specifically, railroads must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of FRA, that  they have: (1) installed all PTC system hardware consistent with the total  amounts identified in the railroad\u2019s implementation plan; (2) acquired all  necessary spectrum consistent with the implementation plan; (3)  completed required employee training; (4) included in a revised  implementation plan an alternative schedule and sequence for  implementing the PTC system as soon as practicable but no later than  December 31, 2020; (5) certified to FRA that they will be in full  compliance with PTC statutory requirements by the date provided in the  alternative schedule and sequence; and (6) for Class I railroads and  Amtrak, initiated RSD or implemented a PTC system on more than 50  percent of the track they own or control that is required to have PTC. For  commuter and Class II and III railroads, the sixth statutory criterion is to  have either initiated RSD on at least one territory required to have  operations governed by a PTC system or \u201cmet any other criteria  established by the Secretary,\u201d which FRA refers to as \u201csubstitute\u201d  criteria.", "FRA is responsible for overseeing railroads\u2019 implementation of PTC, and  the agency monitors progress and provides direct assistance to railroads  implementing PTC. For example, FRA officials provide technical  assistance to railroads, address questions, and review railroad-submitted  documentation. FRA has a PTC Staff Director, designated PTC  specialists in the eight FRA regions, and additional engineers and test  monitors responsible for overseeing technical and engineering aspects of  implementation and reviewing railroads\u2019 submissions and requests, as  well as programmatic support staff. In anticipation of the upcoming  implementation deadline, in May 2017, FRA began to send notification  letters to railroads it determined were at risk of both not meeting the  December 31, 2018, implementation deadline and not completing the  requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. FRA identified \u201cat- risk\u201d railroads by comparing a railroad\u2019s hardware installation status to the  total hardware required for PTC implementation, according to the  railroad\u2019s implementation plan. FRA has increased the \u201cat-risk\u201d threshold  percentage over time as the deadline approaches. (See Table 1).", "FRA has additional oversight tools, which include use of its general civil  penalty enforcement authority for failure to meet certain statutory PTC  requirements. FRA has used this authority in 2017 and 2018 to assess  civil penalties, primarily against passenger railroads that failed to comply  with the equipment installation milestones, the spectrum acquisition  milestones, or both, that the railroads had established in their  implementation plans for the end of 2016 and 2017.", "As part of our body of work on PTC, we found that railroads face  numerous PTC implementation challenges and made recommendations  to FRA to improve its oversight of implementation. Specifically, in 2013  and 2015 we found that many railroads were struggling to make progress  due to a number of complex and interrelated challenges, such as  developing system components and identifying and correcting issues  discovered during testing. For example, we found in March 2018 that FRA  had not systematically communicated information or used a risk-based  approach to help commuter railroads prepare for the 2018 deadline or to  qualify for an extension. We also found that many railroads were  concerned about FRA\u2019s ability to review submitted documentation in a  timely manner, particularly given the length of some required  documentation such as safety plans and FRA\u2019s limited resources for  document review. In March 2018, we recommended FRA identify and  adopt a method for systematically communicating information to railroads  and use a risk-based approach to prioritize its resources and workload.", "FRA agreed with our recommendations.

For example, in response to our questionnaire, 12 of 29  passenger railroads reported challenges with PTC vendors and  contractors. One passenger railroad noted that because its contractor  manages PTC projects across the country with the same deadline and  requirements, it can be difficult for all railroads to get the resources they  need from their contractor. We previously reported that there are a limited  number of vendors available to design PTC systems, provide software  and hardware, and conduct testing. For example, we reported in 2015  that, according to railroad industry representatives, there were two  vendors for the onboard train management computer and three vendors  for the wayside equipment. One small passenger railroad recently  testified that, because a single manufacturer was providing PTC  equipment and software to many railroads across the country, it had to  wait over a year for PTC equipment to be delivered and installed. We also previously reported that railroads face software challenges, and noted  that railroads had concerns with the number of defects identified during  software testing, since these take time to address. In response to our  questionnaire, nine passenger railroads reported encountering challenges  related to maturity of the PTC software systems, such as working through  software bugs or defects during testing.", "As passenger railroads work to complete PTC implementation activities,  some have made service or schedule adjustments to accommodate the  need to install equipment or perform testing. Moreover, several  passenger railroads told us that as PTC implementation schedules  become more compressed, avoiding effects on passengers becomes  more difficult. We identified 10 passenger railroads that have made  changes to their operations due, in part, to PTC implementation, including  the six largest commuter railroads in the country, which collectively  reported over 400 million passenger trips in 2017. These changes had  effects such as reduced service or longer travel times. For example, one  of the largest passenger railroads in the country reduced service on  certain routes and eliminated some express trains to accommodate  schedules enabling them to complete PTC equipment installation prior to  the December 2018 deadline. Another large passenger railroad has  shutdown weekend service\u2014providing bus service to transport  passengers between stations\u2014for PTC testing.

Specifically,  FRA presented information on the procedures for requesting and  obtaining FRA\u2019s approval for an extension to implement PTC beyond the  December 2018 deadline including FRA\u2019s review process. FRA also  clarified that for commuter railroads, initiating field testing was one  approach that could potentially qualify as substitute criteria, rather than  initiating RSD.", "Representatives we interviewed from the passenger railroads that  participated in the symposiums found them to be helpful, and some  passenger railroads reported that the information presented led them to  adjust their approach to meeting the December 2018 deadline. For  example, one passenger railroad representative we spoke to said that  until the symposium, he was unaware that using field testing as substitute  criteria was a potential option. Some passenger railroads we met with  also told us they are re-evaluating what activities and documentation  need to be revised and submitted to FRA before the December 2018  deadline based on the information presented at the symposiums. For  example, representatives from one passenger railroad we met with said  that FRA officials encouraged them to update their PTC implementation  plan right away with current equipment installation totals, to ensure  consistency across all required documentation by the end of 2018. A  couple of passenger railroads noted that the information presented at the  symposiums clarified many questions and would have been beneficial to  know a year or two earlier in the implementation process.", "In addition, in recent months FRA has continued to provide assistance to  railroads and has taken a series of steps to better prepare railroads for  the 2018 deadline. These steps include meeting regularly with individual  railroads and developing approaches intended to help many railroads  meet the requirements necessary for a deadline extension.

However, FRA  officials noted that with the exception of possibly one or two railroads,  they anticipate that all passenger and freight railroads will likely need an  extension, and that railroads must submit their requests by the end of the  year to be considered in compliance with PTC requirements. A railroad  must demonstrate that it has met all of the statutory criteria necessary to  qualify before, or when, it formally requests an extension. And as  previously discussed, many railroads remain in the early stages of PTC  implementation. Of the eight passenger railroads that anticipate reaching  full implementation by December 31, 2018, six are already operating  under conditionally certified safety plans; one has submitted its safety  plan for review; one plans to submit its safety plan to FRA in fall 2018 for  certification.

For example, one commuter railroad we met with has  applied for, and was granted approval by FRA to use, the initiation of field  testing on a 16.5-mile segment of track as substitute criteria to qualify for  an extension. That railroad must ultimately implement PTC over 321  miles of track that it owns and operates over, meaning that it will need to  complete field testing, RSD, and interoperability testing on the remaining  95 percent of its track and achieve system certification prior to the 2020  deadline. In March 2018, we testified that FRA officials told us that  moving from the start of field testing to the start of RSD can take between  1 and 3 years, and has averaged about 2 years for those railroads that  have completed that stage. We also reported that FRA officials believe  that most railroads underestimate the amount of time needed for testing.  FRA officials told us that they do not consider railroads that are approved  for an extension under substitute criteria to be necessarily at a higher risk  of not completing PTC implementation by 2020. However, in light of these  time estimates and the unknown challenges that railroads may face  during testing, railroads that are in the early field-testing stage moving  into 2019 could face challenges completing PTC implementation by the  extended December 2020 deadline.", "Railroads further behind in PTC implementation may need to apply for an  extension due to factors such as compressed implementation schedules,  as well as the time needed for FRA approvals.

Instead, the railroad plans to submit an extension request using  substitute criteria consisting of field testing in order to be in compliance at  the end of the year. Such an approach involves first applying for and  receiving approval for substitute criteria and then formally requesting an  extension and submitting supporting documentation to FRA before the  end of the year. Entering RSD prior to the deadline could be difficult given  that FRA officials told us they have advised railroads to allow at least a  month for FRA\u2019s review of test requests, which must be approved prior to  initiating field testing and RSD.", "Some passenger railroads also reported challenges regarding host and  tenant responsibilities, including coordination and interoperability\u2014which  are likely to continue beyond 2018. Some passenger railroads told us that  coordinating with host or tenant railroads that are in different  implementation stages as the 2018 deadline approaches poses several  challenges. For example, a few passenger railroads told us that they are  unable to conduct interoperability testing because their host or tenant  railroad has not yet reached that stage of implementation. Additionally,  officials from Amtrak\u2014which interoperates with 21 other railroads\u2014noted  that the host-tenant relationship can be complicated and requires a high  level of coordination to resolve issues between railroads. Amtrak officials  also told us they were conducting risk assessments to determine whether  and how to continue service in situations where their host or tenant  railroad has not completed PTC implementation or met the requirements  necessary for an extension. While few passenger railroads have reached  the interoperability stage, one railroad association stated that  interoperability is, and will continue to be, a substantial challenge for  metropolitan areas with dense and complex rail networks with several  host-tenant relationships.

In addition, FRA officials said that their goal is to not delay any  railroad that is ready to move into testing, and that they advised railroads  to build 30 to 45 days for test request reviews into their project schedules.", "Despite these efforts, some passenger railroads remain concerned about  the agency\u2019s ability to manage the PTC workload in the coming months  and beyond 2018. For example, seven of 29 passenger railroads  identified FRA\u2019s resources and review times as a challenge leading up to  the December 2018 deadline. In addition, three passenger railroads  reported that they would complete all the requirements for full PTC  implementation by the December 31, 2018, deadline, but planned to  apply for an extension due to concerns that FRA would not be able to  review and certify their safety plans to enable them to reach full  implementation prior to the deadline. Based on similar concerns, in March  2018, we recommended FRA develop an approach to prioritize the  allocation of resources to address areas of greatest risk as railroads work  to complete PTC implementation. FRA has acknowledged the railroads\u2019 concern given the surge of submissions requiring FRA approval in 2018  and has reported the agency is reallocating existing expertise and  expanding the PTC workforce through training, expanding contracts with  existing support contractors, and initiating one additional contract to  provide technical support. For example, FRA officials told us that they  reallocated resources to shift PTC specialists\u2019 responsibilities to focus  exclusively on testing-related activities because their involvement is  critical for the testing stage. Taking steps to prioritize limited resources  will only increase in importance as the amount of documentation needing  FRA review continues to grow in 2019 and 2020, as railroads move  through testing and submit complex and lengthy safety plans.", "Although FRA has taken steps to provide key extension information to  railroads and to help ensure railroads\u2019 compliance with PTC deadlines,  uncertainty remains, particularly in regard to FRA\u2019s enforcement strategy  if railroads are noncompliant with the PTC implementation requirements,  such as if railroads were to fail to apply for an extension by the deadline.  Representatives from all railroads implementing PTC with whom we met  told us that FRA\u2019s planned enforcement approach for any railroad that  fails to meet the requirements for an extension beyond 2018 is unclear.  FRA officials told us they have shared the range of applicable civil  penalties with railroads for years, but that any policy decision about how  potential fines will be levied for non-compliant railroads has not yet been  made. In addition, it is also unclear how the agency would approach  enforcement for railroads that have a host or tenant operating on their  tracks that has not completed implementation or met the requirements  necessary for an extension. Ten of the 13 passenger railroads we met  with told us they do not currently have or see a need to develop  contingency plans. For example, representatives from one passenger  railroad said they did not have a contingency plan because FRA has  made clear they are committed to helping railroads comply with the 2018  deadline. FRA officials said that the goal of enforcement is to help bring  all railroads into compliance and that they would look at the specific  circumstances for any host-tenant issues before assessing a fine.", "In conclusion, almost all passenger railroads will likely request an  extension beyond 2018, which will require FRA approval. Many commuter  railroads plan to request substitute criteria which may result in those  railroads remaining in the early stages of PTC implementation at the start  of 2019. However, given that only one passenger railroad has submitted  an extension request, it is unlikely we will know how many railroads will  be granted an extension by the December 31, 2018 deadline. While few  passenger railroads had developed contingency plans when we met with  them, as December nears and schedules become further compressed,  additional railroads may have to make service or schedule adjustments to  help them reach compliance with the deadline. Although FRA has  reported taking some actions in response to our March 2018  recommendation that they better prioritize resources, FRA resources and  review times remain a significant concern\u2014both for near-term efforts  such as extension requests and for the safety plans that need to be  reviewed and certified prior to the end of 2020. These issues\u2014combined  with the ongoing implementation, testing, and interoperability challenges  that a number of railroads reported to us\u2014raise questions as to the extent  FRA and the nation's passenger railroads are poised for full PTC  implementation by December 31, 2020.", "Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
