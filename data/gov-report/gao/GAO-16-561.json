In an April 2010 report, GAO identified 18 government programs that provide food assistance to low-income households. Servicemembers may apply for and, if they qualify, receive benefits from any of these programs. However, servicemembers' eligibility for these programs can vary by program and location. For example, GAO found that it might be easier for servicemembers to qualify for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) than Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) because WIC allows state agencies to exclude portions of a servicemember's pay when determining eligibility and SNAP does not. Also, charitable organizations, such as food pantries, are available to servicemembers in need of food assistance.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has some data on servicemembers' use of food assistance programs it administers, but it does not know the extent that servicemembers use such programs because (1) it is not fully collecting or analyzing such information within the department, and (2) it has not coordinated with organizations such as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to access their data on servicemembers' use of their programs. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should use quality information to achieve its objectives. DOD has data on the number of servicemembers' children receiving free and reduced-price school meals at DOD Education Activity (DODEA) schools in the United States. For example, DODEA data for September 2015 showed that 24 percent of children in DODEA schools in the continental U.S. were eligible for free meals and 21 percent were eligible for reduced-price meals. A DOD survey also provides some information on servicemembers' use of food assistance programs such as SNAP. However, this survey is of limited usefulness in part because it does not inquire about other food assistance programs used by servicemembers such as National School Lunch Program; also no office within DOD is monitoring food assistance needs such as through survey data. Without more complete survey data, DOD will not understand the prevalence of need among servicemembers to effectively target its support and determine if it should assign department-level responsibility for monitoring food assistance needs.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also state that management should communicate with external parties to obtain needed information. USDA has access to data on servicemembers' use of food assistance programs, but none of the DOD officials with whom GAO spoke were aware of efforts by the department to coordinate with USDA to access these data. For example, USDA administers SNAP benefits that, according to a 2013 U.S. Census Bureau survey, were used by about 23,000 active-duty servicemembers in the previous 12 months. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision to address the sharing of SNAP data between USDA and DOD; however, DOD does not have a coordination effort underway to access such data. Without such coordination, DOD will miss the opportunity to collect data on the needs of its servicemembers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) revise surveys of servicemembers to collect and analyze more complete data and, if warranted, implement actions such as assigning department-level responsibilities for monitoring food assistance; and (2) coordinate with USDA to access its usage information.

GAO continues to believe the recommendation is valid, as discussed in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Defense Commissary Agency, servicemembers on  active duty spent over $21 million in food stamp benefits at military  commissaries from September 2014 through August 2015. This suggests  that some people serving our country may be having difficulty making  ends meet. Military families facing financial hardship have federal, state  and private-sector options for food assistance. One option provided by  the Department of Defense (DOD) to active-duty servicemembers is the  Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA). In 2000, Congress  created FSSA as an alternative to the United States Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (SNAP)\u2014formerly called the Food Stamp Program. However, in 2015, the  Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission  reported that few active-duty servicemembers took advantage of FSSA  and recommended that Congress end the FSSA program for  servicemembers located in the United States and its territories, and refer  servicemembers to apply for benefits under the USDA\u2019s SNAP program.   The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016  implemented the commission\u2019s recommendation with the effect that after  September 30, 2016, FSSA will be available only to active-duty  servicemembers serving outside the United States and its territories.  However, a 2015 House Armed Services committee report stated a  concern that active-duty servicemembers and their families may have a  continuing need for nutrition assistance.", "House Report 114-102, which accompanied a bill for the NDAA for fiscal  year 2016, includes a provision that we review the food assistance  programs available to active-duty servicemembers and their families.  Subsequently, the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry committee  became co-requesters of our work in response to this House report  provision. This report assesses (1) the extent to which active-duty  servicemembers and their families have access to government and  charitable food assistance programs and any variations in eligibility  requirements for these programs, (2) the extent to which DOD has  identified active-duty servicemembers\u2019 use of food assistance programs,  and (3) any challenges that active-duty servicemembers encounter when  seeking food assistance.", "For our first objective, we reviewed our prior related reports and a  Congressional Research Service report on domestic food assistance  programs, and we interviewed officials from DOD and USDA to identify  food assistance programs available to active-duty servicemembers and  their families. We interviewed officials who administer these programs at  the federal, state, and local levels to obtain additional background  information and to confirm the availability and our understanding of the  food assistance programs we identified. We also met with representatives  of various charitable organizations that provide food assistance to active- duty servicemembers and their families. To determine if there were any  variations in eligibility requirements in government food assistance  programs, we reviewed the laws that established selected food  assistance programs and analyzed eligibility criteria for these programs  and used those eligibility criteria to develop scenarios to illustrate  situations in which a servicemember would or would not qualify for these  food assistance programs.", "For our second objective, we interviewed officials from multiple offices  within the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  (USD (P&R)) to determine which office(s) had department-level  responsibilities related to active-duty servicemembers\u2019 use of food  assistance programs and to obtain any relevant data on servicemembers\u2019  use of these programs. We reviewed DOD documents on the  organization and the assigned responsibilities of USD (P&R). We  obtained and reviewed DOD\u2019s Status of Forces Survey of Active Duty  Members for calendar years 2010, 2012, and 2013, the U.S. Census  Bureau\u2019s 2013 American Community Survey, FSSA data from the  Defense Joint Military Pay System, and data on the number of students in  DOD Education Activity (DODEA) schools who were eligible to receive  free and/or reduced-price meals. We found this information to be  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on DOD\u2019s awareness of  military participants receiving these benefits. Also, we compared the data  collection and communications processes for DOD with Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, which state that management  should obtain quality information to achieve its objectives and that it  should communicate with external parties regarding the information that is  needed to achieve its objectives. To obtain information on other food  assistance programs available to servicemembers and their families, we  visited four selected military installations in the United States and  interviewed officials who administer these programs, officials who assist  servicemembers in need, and visited food pantries, if any, on the  installation. We selected sites to represent each of the military services  and to include locations with a large population of servicemembers and  dependents, a range of cost-of-living areas\u2014using the Basic Allowance  for Housing (BAH) rates\u2014and a food pantry and/or a Special  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)  program office on the military installation. Based on these criteria, we  visited Fort Hood, Texas; Naval Base San Diego, California; Marine  Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California; and Altus Air Force Base,  Oklahoma. During our site visits, we met with military officials who assist  servicemembers and their families in financial difficulty\u2014 which may  include a need for food assistance\u2014as well as state and local officials  who oversee non-military food assistance programs that servicemembers  may use. We also met with representatives from military and non-military  charitable organizations to learn what food assistance they provide to  active-duty servicemembers and their families.", "For our third objective, we conducted site visits to four selected military  installations and interviewed military service officials who work with  servicemembers in need to gain their perspectives on any challenges that  may be faced by servicemembers attempting to obtain food assistance.  Specifically, we interviewed military Chaplains, First Sergeants and  Command Master Chiefs, financial specialists, and officials from  charitable military organizations, including Army Emergency Relief, the  Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, and the Air Force Aid Society. We  also interviewed private and local government officials who assist civilians  and some servicemembers with food assistance, such as SNAP, WIC,  summer meals programs, and food pantries. Further, we interviewed  representatives from advocacy groups who support active-duty families or  try to reduce hunger in America. We provide further details on our scope  and methodology in Appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Non-cash compensation  includes various types of benefits such as health care, child-care centers,  educational benefits, and access to subsidized commissaries (i.e.,  grocery stores). DOD operates a worldwide chain of commissaries that  sell food and related household items to active-duty, reserve and guard  members of the military services, retirees of these military services, their  families, and other authorized patrons. According to the Defense  Commissary Agency\u2019s Annual Financial Report Fiscal Year 2015, DOD\u2019s  240 commissaries sold $5.5 billion of items to approximately 5.3 million  households in fiscal year 2015. Commissaries sell food and related  household items to authorized patrons at cost plus a 5-percent surcharge,  which DOD estimates saves patrons an average of more than 30 percent  on their purchases compared to commercial prices.

For  example, in a testimony before Congress on May 2015, we identified 18  selected federal government programs that focus primarily on providing  food and nutrition assistance, such as SNAP and WIC, to low-income  individuals and households. Active-duty servicemembers and their  families may apply to any of these programs, and can receive benefits if  they meet the eligibility requirements. Appendix II provides a general  description of these 18 programs as well as the target population.  Additionally, DOD provides active-duty servicemembers with FSSA. By  design, the FSSA program increases a servicemember\u2019s income by an  amount to preclude them from applying for benefits under the SNAP  program. However, the NDAA for fiscal year 2016 restricted the  availability of FSSA to only servicemembers stationed outside the United  States and its territories starting October 1, 2016. Servicemembers  stationed in the United States and its territories and in need of food  assistance previously provided by FSSA are expected to apply to the  SNAP program.", "In addition to the government food assistance programs, active-duty  servicemembers and their families can seek assistance from a variety of  charitable organizations. For example, each military service has a  charitable organization such as the Army Emergency Relief that,  depending on the type of assistance needed, is able to provide  servicemembers with grants or interest-free loans that can be used to  purchase food and to help meet any other immediate needs they may  have in an emergency situation. During our visits to four selected military  installations, we also found that additional assistance may be available to  active-duty servicemembers and their families through locally-developed  initiatives, such as food pantries, that are typically organized by  volunteers to address food assistance needs at a particular military  installation. Many of the food pantries we examined were local operations  intended to meet emergency needs; however, at one of the military  installations we visited there were four food pantries operating on the  installation that provided food routinely once a month. Table 1 provides  further details about some of the different types of food assistance  available to active-duty servicemembers and their families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Servicemembers\u2019 Eligibility for Government Food Assistance Programs Can Vary Based on the Program\u2019s Criteria and the Servicemember\u2019s Location", "paragraphs": ["An applicant\u2019s income must be below a given level in order to qualify for  benefits from the government food assistance programs. To develop an  understanding of how active-duty servicemembers could meet the  financial criteria, we compared the base income for servicemembers in a  specific paygrade with the income eligibility requirements for five  government food assistance programs that are commonly used by active- duty servicemembers and their families. Specifically, these five programs  include DOD\u2019s FSSA\u2014the only food assistance program offered through  DOD\u2014and four USDA programs, including SNAP, WIC, NSLP, and  SBP. These programs\u2019 statutory authorities define the financial criteria  as a maximum income limit by household or family size. Our  comparison enabled us to develop an understanding of the size of  household or family a servicemember in a specific paygrade would need  in order to qualify for a program. Although other factors beyond  household or family size and base income affect servicemembers\u2019  eligibility for these food assistance programs, our analysis is generally  limited to these factors in order to isolate the effect of income on  eligibility. Further, we recognize that to receive benefits the  servicemember would also have to meet the program\u2019s non-financial  eligibility requirements, which are detailed in appendix III. Given that, we  compared the basic pay and allowances of a servicemember in the E-4  paygrade with maximum income eligibility criteria for the five government  food assistance programs commonly used by active-duty  servicemembers and their families and determined the minimum  household or family size the servicemember needed in order to qualify for  each program. We selected the paygrade of E-4 in part because it  includes junior enlisted personnel who are compensated at the lower end  of the pay scale for active-duty servicemembers. Further, DOD\u2019s data on  FSSA recipients showed that servicemembers in the paygrade of E-4  were the most frequent recipients of this allowance, thus suggesting that  there may be food assistance needs more commonly experienced by  personnel at this paygrade. The results of our analysis are presented in  Figure 1 and show that a servicemember\u2019s income eligibility will likely  vary based on where he or she lives and the program through which one  applies for food assistance.", "We found that each of the government food assistance programs  included in our review requires that an applicant\u2019s household or family  income falls below a specified amount to qualify for benefits and that this  income limit varies by program and sometimes by state. Further, including  BAH benefits in a determination of an applicant\u2019s income eligibility also  plays a role in the food assistance programs used by active-duty  servicemembers and their families. Specifically, we found that it might be  easier for servicemembers to qualify for WIC than SNAP or FSSA  because WIC allows state agencies to choose to exclude BAH from  income. For example, based on our analysis a servicemember at Naval  Base San Diego, California, would need a minimum household size of 3  to qualify for WIC benefits, but would require a minimum household size  of 7 to qualify for SNAP benefits and a minimum household size of 9 to  qualify for FSSA. We also found that servicemembers may be more likely  to qualify for free or reduced- price meals from NSLP and SBP if they  reside in privatized housing than if they live in the local community  because the eligibility criteria for those programs do not count BAH as  income for servicemembers living in privatized military housing. For  example, based on our analysis a servicemember residing in privatized  military housing on Camp Pendleton in California would require a  minimum household size of 3 to qualify for reduced-price school meals  compared to a servicemember residing in the local community who would  need a minimum household size of 6 to qualify.", "Based on our analysis, we found that it might be easier for  servicemembers to qualify for SNAP than FSSA because SNAP\u2019s  statutory authority gives the states, in certain instances, the option to  increase the gross-income limit for SNAP to as much as 200 percent of  the federal poverty guidelines but fixes the income limit for FSSA at 130  percent of the federal poverty guidelines regardless of the state the  servicemember lives in. For example, our analysis suggests that a  servicemember at Camp Pendleton, California, would need a minimum  household size of 6 to qualify for SNAP benefits but would require a  minimum household size of 9 to qualify for FSSA, and a servicemember  at Fort Hood, Texas, would need a minimum household size of 6 to  qualify for SNAP benefits but would require a minimum household size of  7 to qualify for FSSA benefits. In this example, a smaller household size  is required to qualify for SNAP than for FSSA primarily because California  and Texas raised the gross-income test for SNAP to 200 percent and 165  percent of federal poverty guidelines, respectively.

However, these  data are of limited usefulness because DOD does not collect and analyze  relevant data that are available from other sources within the department  and that would facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of  servicemembers\u2019 use of food assistance programs. Further, FSSA data  alone will provide fewer insights into servicemembers\u2019 use of food  assistance programs in the future because, as previously noted, the  benefit will no longer be available to servicemembers who are stationed  within the continental U.S. after September 30, 2016.", "Through the DOD Education Activity (DODEA), which operates 52  schools on military installations within the continental United States, DOD  has access to data on the number of children who attend these schools  and are eligible to receive free and reduced-price lunches and  breakfast.

These data do not  fully capture the use of food assistance by servicemembers and their  families, but they may be an indicator of a need that exists for a specific  population within the military services. However, a DODEA official stated  that prior to our request she was not aware of any efforts by DOD to  collect and analyze such data to better understand the extent to which  servicemembers use food assistance.", "DOD also periodically conducts Status of Forces surveys that seek to  understand attitudes and views on a wide range of personnel issues and  the results of which are used to help DOD decision makers evaluate  existing programs and policies, establish baselines before implementing  new programs and policies, and monitor the progress of programs and  policies and their effects on the total force. However, DOD has not  utilized this survey as a tool to collect and analyze data on the use of food  assistance programs by active-duty servicemembers and their families.  DOD Instruction 1342.22 directs DOD\u2019s family readiness services, which  include a variety of support programs for servicemembers and their  families that range from financial assistance to child care, be designed,  funded, and managed using results obtained from a performance  management strategy that includes assessment of needs. DOD\u2019s Status  of Forces surveys include a survey of active-duty servicemembers that, in  recent years, has included questions about the use of food assistance  programs. Based on the 2013 survey\u2014the most recent results  available\u2014DOD estimated that 2 percent (about 20,000) of active-duty  servicemembers or their spouses had received income or financial  support from SNAP in the previous 12 months and 9 percent received  income from either WIC and/or Temporary Assistance For Needy  Families (TANF). However, the WIC and TANF data are of limited  usefulness in determining the extent to which servicemembers use food  assistance, in part, because it combines data on WIC\u2014a food assistance  program\u2014with TANF data\u2014a non-food assistance program. The survey  also does not specifically address other sources of food assistance that  may be used by active-duty servicemembers and their families such as  NSLP, SBP, SFSP, or food pantries. Further, in July 2010, we reported  that the low response rates to the Status of Forces Survey could  potentially bias the survey results and recommended that the Defense  Manpower Data Center develop and implement guidance to conduct a  nonresponse analysis. DOD agreed with the recommendation, but it has  not fully implemented our recommendation because, according to DOD  officials, funding is not currently available to carry out the full intent of the  recommendation.

We found that none of these offices had efforts  to monitor or collect data on servicemembers\u2019 food assistance needs,  including coordinating with USDA regarding collecting and sharing data or  other relevant information. The USDA works through various state and  local agencies to administer four of the five food assistance programs  commonly used by active-duty servicemembers and their families,  including: (1) SNAP, (2) WIC, (3) NSLP, and (4) SBP. A provision in the  NDAA for fiscal year 2016 addressed DOD\u2019s access to information on  SNAP usage by servicemembers.  The NDAA for fiscal year 2016 calls  for the USDA to ensure that any safeguards that prevent the use or  disclosure of information collected from SNAP recipients will not prevent  the USDA from disclosing that information to DOD, or DOD using that  information, for the purposes of determining the number of SNAP  applicant households that contain one or more military servicemembers.  DOD provided us an email exchange that occurred in February to March  2016 discussing how to use the new authority provided in section 605 of  the 2016 NDAA to obtain SNAP data. However, officials were not aware  of further attempts to collect such information. According to results from  the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s annual American Community Survey  (ACS), about 23,000 active-duty servicemembers received SNAP  benefits in the previous 12 months. While it is known that  servicemembers use food assistance programs and that information on  recipients can be obtained, specific data on servicemembers\u2019 use of  these programs are not available because there is no requirement or  need that has been established for agencies such as the USDA to collect  such information. For example, during visits to four selected military  installations, we met with local administrators of USDA food assistance  programs who told us that they are able to identify servicemembers  through required documentation such as a Leave and Earnings  Statement that will identify if an individual is a member of the U.S.  military. However, officials said that they do not ask about or routinely  document an applicant\u2019s military status since it does not have a bearing  on their eligibility for assistance.", "We also spoke with representatives from charitable organizations located  on the installations that we visited who have information that DOD could  use to gain insights into the needs of its servicemembers. For example,  we spoke with representatives from Army Emergency Relief, the Navy- Marine Corps Relief Society, and the Air Force Aid Society\u2014each of  which offers various types of support, including financial support to  purchase food for servicemembers in need.

For example, a  program such as SNAP counts the amount a servicemember receives in  BAH as part of one\u2019s income when determining eligibility for benefits,  while other programs, such as WIC, do not count BAH as income. Also,  the amount of a servicemember\u2019s BAH benefit is affected by location,  meaning that the same servicemember may qualify for food assistance at  one location but not be eligible at another location with a higher housing  benefit. For example, a servicemember stationed at Altus Air Force Base,  Oklahoma, would have a BAH rate of $789, that, when combined with  one\u2019s basic pay, may result in a level of income that is low enough to  qualify for food assistance.

Further, the U.S. Code defines regular  military compensation to include BAH and DOD\u2019s description of military  pay and compensation includes BAH. On January 12, 2016, the Chief  Executive Officer for MAZON, a national nonprofit organization working  to end hunger, testified to the House Committee on Agriculture,  Subcommittee on Nutrition, that many lower ranking servicemembers are  made ineligible for SNAP because their housing allowance is counted as  income. MAZON contended that since BAH is excluded as income for  the purposes of calculating income taxes and eligibility for some federal  programs, such as Head Start, that BAH should be excluded as income  for the purposes of determining eligibility for all food assistance  programs.

To assess the extent to which  active-duty servicemembers and their families have access to  government and charitable food assistance programs, we reviewed  various reports and documents to identify federal government programs  that focus primarily on providing food and nutrition assistance to low- income individuals and households. The reports and documents included:  our related report, Domestic Food Assistance: Complex System Benefits  Millions, but Additional Efforts Could Address Potential Inefficiency and  Overlap among Smaller Programs; our related testimony, Domestic Food  Assistance: Multiple Programs Benefit Millions of Americans, but  Additional Action Is Needed to Address Potential Overlap and  Inefficiencies, and a Congressional Research Service report on domestic  food assistance programs, Domestic Food Assistance: Summary of  Programs. For the purpose of this engagement, we focused on  government and charitable food assistance programs available to active- duty servicemembers and their families who are assigned to installations  within the continental United States. We interviewed officials from United  States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Defense  (DOD) to identify food assistance programs available to active-duty  servicemembers and their families. Further, we interviewed officials who  administer these programs at the federal, state, and local levels to obtain  additional background information and confirm the availability and  completeness of the food assistance programs we identified. To find  charitable organizations that provide food assistance to active-duty  servicemembers and their families, we interviewed officials from each of  the military services who identified the following charities that support  servicemembers and families: Army Emergency Relief, Air Force Aid  Society, and Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society. Further, we conducted  internet searches to identify charitable food pantries operating on military  installations, and when one was located, we contacted local military  service officials to confirm its existence.", "To assess the extent to which there was any variation in eligibility  requirements for government food assistance programs, we reviewed the  laws that established selected food assistance programs and analyzed  eligibility criteria for these programs and used those eligibility criteria to  develop scenarios to illustrate situations in which a servicemember would  or would not qualify for these food assistance programs. Specifically, we  conducted an analysis to show what a servicemember in the paygrade of  E-4 needs to meet the income eligibility requirements for Family  Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA), Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for  Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), National School Lunch Program  (NSLP), and School Breakfast Program (SBP) at the four military  installations we visited. We selected the paygrade of E-4 because these  servicemembers are junior enlisted personnel and as such are at the  lower end of the pay scale for active-duty servicemembers. Also, FSSA  program data for calendar year 2014 showed that the E-4 paygrade was  the most frequent paygrade to receive this allowance, suggesting that  personnel at this paygrade have a need for assistance. In calculating the  servicemember\u2019s income, we included only three types of military pay:  Basic Pay, Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), and Basic Allowance  for Housing (BAH) with dependent rate. We included these elements of  military pay because active-duty servicemembers who are entitled to  basic pay are also entitled to BAS and BAH. We did not include other  military pay and allowances because active-duty servicemembers are not  necessarily eligible for the other pay and allowances. Further, our  analysis is based on the assumption that the only source of income for  the household is the servicemembers\u2019 military pay. Next, we reviewed  relevant federal statutes to determine the income criteria for each of the  programs and what types of military pay and allowances are included in  active-duty servicemembers\u2019 income when applying to one of these food  assistance programs. Since federal law provides states some discretion  in setting the income criteria for some of the food assistance programs  and deciding what portion of military pay is included in income, we  interviewed state officials to determine how they calculated the income of  active-duty servicemembers and what specific income criteria they  employ. The state\u2019s income criteria are on a graduated scale that as the  household size increases, the income level to qualify for benefits also  increases. We compared the income of a servicemember in the paygrade  of E-4 to the income criteria used by the state and determined how large  a household the servicemember needed in order to qualify given his/her  income.", "To determine the household size required to qualify for SNAP benefits,  we made additional calculations with several assumptions. Applicants for  SNAP must pass a two-income test, a gross-income test and a net- income test. Most households must meet gross- and net-income tests,  but a household with an elderly person or a person who is receiving  certain types of disability payments has to meet only the net-income test.  We based our analysis on the assumption that the servicemembers had  to pass both the gross- and net-income tests. To calculate net income,  SNAP allows taking a number of deductions from the household income.  In conducting our analysis, we assumed that the household does not  include any elderly or disabled persons, there were no dependent care,  medical expenses, or child-support deductions, the monthly rent or  mortgage payment equaled the servicemember\u2019s BAH, and the standard  utility allowance was appropriate to use in the calculations. We had state  or local officials responsible for the SNAP program in their area review  our calculations to ensure they were correct.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has identified that active-duty  servicemembers and their families use food assistance programs, we  interviewed officials from multiple offices within Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)) to determine which  office(s) had department-level responsibilities related to active-duty  servicemembers\u2019 use of food assistance programs and to obtain any  relevant data on servicemembers\u2019 use of these programs. We reviewed  DOD documents on the organization and assigned responsibilities of  USD (P&R). We obtained and reviewed the results of recent surveys  completed by active-duty servicemembers that include questions about  the use of food assistance programs. Specifically, we obtained and  reviewed DOD\u2019s Status of Forces Survey of Active Duty Members for  calendar year 2010, 2012, and 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2013  American Community Survey, FSSA data from the Defense Joint Military  Pay System, and data on the number of students in DOD Education  Activity (DODEA) schools who were eligible to receive free and/or  reduced-price meals. We assessed the reliability of this information by  interviewing responsible officials and, in the case of the Status of Forces  Survey, reviewing documentation of the survey\u2019s methodology. We found  this information to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting  DOD\u2019s awareness of military participants receiving these benefits. Also,  we compared the data collection and communications processes for DOD  with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which  state that management should obtain quality information to achieve its  objectives and that it should communicate with external parties regarding  the information that is needed to achieve its objectives. To obtain  information on other food assistance programs available to  servicemembers and their families for which data were not available, we  visited four military installations in the United States and interviewed  officials who administer these programs, officials who assist  servicemembers in need, and visited food pantries, if any, on the  installation. We selected sites to represent each of the military services.  We then refined our site selections to include: locations with a large  population of servicemembers and dependents, a range of cost-of-living  areas (using the BAH rates), and the presence of a food pantry and/or a  WIC program office on the military installation. Specifically, we visited Fort  Hood, Texas; Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Naval Base San Diego,  California; and Camp Pendleton, California. In addition, we visited and  interviewed state and local officials who oversee non-military food  assistance programs at these four geographic locations. Finally, we  interviewed officials from the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, Army  Emergency Relief, and the Air Force Aid Society to learn what food  assistance they provide to active-duty servicemembers and their families.", "To identify any challenges that active-duty servicemembers encounter  when seeking food assistance, we interviewed military service officials  who assist servicemembers in need of financial assistance, including food  assistance, to gain their perspectives on any challenges that may be  faced by servicemembers attempting to obtain such assistance.
