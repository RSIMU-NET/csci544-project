DOD's initial design process was unrealistic and inappropriate. However, after a strategic reassessment, DOD adjusted its approach to reflect a more cautious and deliberative process that involved more stakeholders. DOD's NSPS design process generally reflects four of six selected key practices for successful organizational transformations. First, DOD and OPM have developed a process to design the new personnel system that is supported by top leadership in both organizations. Second, from the outset, a set of guiding principles and key performance parameters have guided the NSPS design process. Third, DOD has a dedicated team in place to design and implement NSPS and manage the transformation process. Fourth, DOD has established a timeline, albeit ambitious, and implementation goals. The design process, however, is lacking in two other practices. First, DOD developed and implemented a written communication strategy document, but the strategy is not comprehensive. It does not identify all key internal stakeholders and their concerns, and does not tailor key messages to specific stakeholder groups. Failure to adequately consider a wide variety of people and cultural issues can lead to unsuccessful transformations. Second, while the process has involved employees through town hall meetings and other mechanisms, it has not included employee representatives on the working groups that drafted the design options. It should be noted that 10 federal labor unions have filed suit alleging that DOD failed to abide by the statutory requirements to include employee representatives in the development of DOD's new labor relations system authorized as part of NSPS. A successful transformation must provide for meaningful involvement by employees and their representatives to gain their input into and understanding of the changes that will occur. DOD will face multiple implementation challenges. For example, in addition to the challenges of continuing to involve employees and other stakeholders and providing adequate resources to implement the system, DOD faces the challenges of ensuring an effective, ongoing two-way communication strategy and evaluating the new system. In recent testimony, GAO stated that DOD's communication strategy must include the active and visible involvement of a number of key players, including the Secretary of Defense, for successful implementation of the system. Moreover, DOD must ensure sustained and committed leadership after the system is fully implemented and the NSPS Senior Executive and the Program Executive Office transition out of existence. To provide sustained leadership attention to a range of business transformation initiatives, like NSPS, GAO recently recommended the creation of a chief management official at DOD."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is designing a new civilian personnel  management system\u2014the National Security Personnel System (NSPS)\u2014 that represents a huge undertaking for DOD, given its massive size and  geographically and culturally diverse workforce.

The Congress provided these authorities to  DOD in response to the department\u2019s position that the inflexibility of  federal personnel systems was one of the most important constraints on its  ability to attract, retain, reward, and develop a civilian workforce to meet  the national security mission of the 21st century. In addition, DOD\u2019s new  personnel management system will have far-reaching implications, not just  for DOD, but for civil service reform across the federal government.

Experience  shows that failure to adequately address\u2014and often even consider\u2014a wide  variety of personnel and cultural issues is at the heart of unsuccessful  transformations. In our prior work, we identified nine key practices and  lessons learned from major public and private sector organizational  mergers, acquisitions, and transformations. These practices are to (1) ensure top leadership drives the transformation, (2) establish a  coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide the  transformation, (3) focus on a key set of principles and priorities at the  outset of the transformation, (4) set implementation goals and a timeline to  build momentum and show progress from day one, (5) dedicate an  implementation team to manage the transformation process, (6) use the  performance management system to define responsibility and assure  accountability for change, (7) establish a communication strategy to create  shared expectations and report related progress, (8) involve employees to  obtain their ideas and gain their ownership for the transformation, and  (9) build a world-class organization.", "In recent years, we have examined various aspects of DOD\u2019s human capital  management of its civilian workforce. For example, we have reported on  gaps in the defense components\u2019 civilian human capital plans, including the  absence of results-oriented performance measures and the need for  comprehensive strategic workforce plans and for data on the skills and  competencies needed to successfully accomplish future missions. Prior to  the enactment of NSPS legislation in November 2003, we raised a number  of critical issues about the proposed system in a series of testimonies  before three congressional committees. In recent testimony on DOD\u2019s  transformation efforts, we indicated that DOD is challenged in its efforts to  affect fundamental business management reform, such as NSPS, and  indicated that our ongoing work continues to raise questions about DOD\u2019s  chances of success. Our recently released report on the fiscal challenges  the federal government faces in the 21st century identifies several issues  regarding DOD\u2019s civilian workforce that are ripe for reexamination,  including whether DOD is pursuing the design and implementation of NSPS in a manner that maximizes the chance of success. To address challenges  inherent in business transformation reforms, such as NSPS, we recently  recommended installing a chief management official at DOD.", "In 2001, we designated strategic human capital management as a high-risk  area because of the federal government's long-standing lack of a consistent  strategic approach to marshaling, managing, and maintaining the human  capital needed to maximize government performance and ensure its  accountability. The strategic management of human capital was identified  as a top priority of the President's Management Agenda in 2001, and the  Congress also has sought to elevate human capital issues through a wide  range of initiatives. Significant changes in how the federal workforce is  managed are under way, but strategic human capital management remains  high risk because federal human capital strategies are still not  appropriately constituted to meet current and emerging challenges. These  challenges include providing the sustained leadership essential to  completing multiyear transformations, developing effective strategic  workforce plans, creating effective hiring processes and using flexibilities  and incentives to retain critical talent and reshape workforces, and  reforming performance management systems so that pay and awards are  linked to performance and organizational results.", "We prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority and are  providing it to you to assist the Congress in evaluating federal human  capital management systems. This report addresses DOD\u2019s efforts to design  its new civilian personnel management system. Specifically, this report (1)  describes DOD\u2019s process to design its personnel management system, (2)  analyzes the extent to which DOD\u2019s process reflects key practices for  successful transformations, and (3) identifies the most significant  challenges DOD faces in implementing NSPS.", "To describe DOD\u2019s design process, we interviewed key agency officials at  DOD and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as well as design  team participants, DOD employee representatives, and experts in federal  labor relations and federal adverse actions and personnel appeals systems.  We also examined documents relevant to NSPS design efforts (e.g., focus  group reports and town hall meeting schedules, requirements and other  planning documents, and briefings on the results of various design  options), and applicable laws and regulations governing federal civilian  personnel management. Using six of the nine key practices for  organizational transformations from our prior work, we determined the  extent to which DOD\u2019s NSPS design process incorporated key practices of  successful transformations. The six key practices that we used are:  (1) ensuring that top leadership drives the transformation, (2) focusing on a  key set of principles and priorities, (3) setting implementation goals and a  timeline, (4) dedicating an implementation team, (5) establishing a  communication strategy, and (6) involving employees. We did not evaluate  the key practices \u201cestablishing a coherent mission and integrated strategic  goals to guide the transformation\u201d because in March 2003, we reported on  the department\u2019s strategic planning efforts for civilian personnel and  assessed whether DOD and selected defense components\u2019 goals and  objectives contained in strategic plans for civilian personnel were aligned  with overarching missions of the organizations. In addition, we did not  evaluate the key practices of \u201cusing a performance management system to  define responsibility and assure accountability for change\u201d and \u201cbuilding a  world-class organization\u201d because DOD has considerable work ahead to  design and implement NSPS and assess the overall system. To identify the  most significant challenges DOD faced in developing NSPS, we interviewed  key DOD, OPM, and other federal agency officials and DOD labor union  representatives (referred to as employee representatives throughout this  report) and reviewed and analyzed relevant documents.", "We conducted our review from October 2004 through June 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Additional information on our scope and methodology can be found in  appendix I.

Major cost drivers in implementing pay-for-performance systems are the  direct costs associated with salaries and training. DOD estimates that  the overall cost associated with implementing NSPS will be  approximately $158 million through fiscal year 2008.

The active involvement of  all stakeholders will be critical to the success of NSPS. The involvement  of employees and their representatives both directly and indirectly is  crucial to the success of new initiatives, including implementing a pay- for-performance system.

In recent  testimony on the transformation of DOD business operations, we stated  that as DOD embarks on large-scale business transformation efforts,  such as NSPS, the complexity and long-term nature of these efforts  requires the development of an executive position capable of providing  strong and sustained change management leadership across the  department\u2014and over a number of years and various administrations.  One way to ensure such leadership would be to create by legislation a  full-time executive-level II position for a chief management official, who  would serve as the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management.

Although DOD\u2019s process to design its new personnel management  system represents a phased, deliberative process, it does not fully reflect  some key practices of successful transformations. Because DOD has not  fully addressed all of these practices, it does not have a comprehensive  written communication strategy document that effectively addresses  employee concerns and their information needs, and facilitates two-way  communication between employees, employee representatives, and  management. Without a comprehensive written communication strategy  document, DOD may be hampered in achieving employee buy-in, which  could lead to an unsuccessful implementation of the system.", "In addition, evaluating the impact of NSPS will be an ongoing challenge for  DOD.
