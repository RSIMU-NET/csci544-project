GAO was asked to assess the extent to which (1) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken action to support fusion centers' efforts to maintain and grow their operations, and (2) DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have supported fusion centers in establishing privacy and civil liberties protections. GAO reviewed relevant legislation and federal guidance; conducted interviews with 14 of 72 fusion centers, selected on the basis of location and time in operation, among other factors; and interviewed DHS and DOJ officials. The views of fusion center officials are not generalizable but provided insights"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Fusion centers have cited DHS grant funding as critical to achieving the baseline capabilities--the standards the government and fusion centers have defined as necessary for centers to be considered capable of performing basic functions in the national information sharing network, such as standards related to information gathering and intelligence analysis. However, DHS has not set standard performance measures for the centers. Fusion centers nationwide reported that federal funding accounted for about 61 percent of their total fiscal year 2010 budgets, but DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), the primary grant program through which fusion centers receive funding, is not specifically focused on, or limited to, fusion centers. Rather, states and local governments determine the amount of HSGP funding they allocate to fusion centers each year from among a number of competing homeland security needs. As a result, fusion centers continue to raise concerns about the lack of a longer-term, predictable federal funding source. DHS, in coordination with the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment and DOJ, has a nationwide assessment of centers' baseline capabilities under way. To be completed in October 2010, the goal of the assessment is to provide federal agencies and fusion centers with more accurate information on the status of centers' abilities, help identify gaps between centers' current operations and the baseline capabilities, and use this information to develop strategies and realign resources to close those gaps going forward. Recent federal guidance also requires that, by October 29, 2010, DHS should develop an annual reporting process that will document the total operational and sustainment costs of each of the 72 fusion centers in the national network so as to assess the adequacy of current funding mechanisms. If centers are to receive continued federal financial support, it is important that they are also able to demonstrate their impact and value added to the nation's information sharing goals. However, there are no standard performance measures across all fusion centers to do this. DHS has not started developing such measures because the agency is currently focusing on completing the nationwide assessment and compiling its results and, as such, has not defined next steps or target timeframes for designing and implementing these measures. Defining the steps it will take to design and implement a set of measures and committing to a target timeframe for their completion could better position DHS to demonstrate the value and impact of the national network of fusion centers. To help fusion centers develop privacy and civil liberties policies and protections, DHS and DOJ have provided technical assistance and training, including a template on which to base a privacy and civil liberties policy, and a joint process for reviewing fusion centers' policies to ensure they are consistent with federal requirements. The 14 centers GAO interviewed were at different stages of the policy review process, with 7 completed as of June 2010. Officials from all 14 of the fusion centers GAO interviewed stated that the guidance DHS and DOJ provided was helpful and integral in assisting them to draft their policies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS define steps to develop and implement standard performance measures for centers and commit to a timeframe for completing them. DHS concurred and described steps it is taking to address the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent terrorist activity, such as the attempted Times Square bombing and  the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253, emphasizes the  importance of developing a national information sharing capability to  efficiently and expeditiously gather, analyze, and disseminate law  enforcement, homeland security, public safety, and terrorism information.  Since 2001, all 50 states and some local governments have established  fusion centers to address gaps in terrorism-related information sharing  that the federal government cannot address alone and provide a  mechanism for information sharing within the state. Although fusion  centers vary because they were primarily established to meet state and  local needs, under federal law, a fusion center is defined as a collaborative  effort of two or more federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies  that combines resources, expertise, or information with the goal of  maximizing the ability of such agencies to detect, prevent, investigate,  apprehend, and respond to criminal or terrorist activity. As of August 2010,  there were 72 fusion centers nationwide. Fusion centers are a component  of the nation\u2019s Information Sharing Environment (ISE), which was  established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004 (Intelligence Reform Act) to facilitate information sharing, access,  and collaboration in order to combat terrorism more effectively.", "The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Commission Act) requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in  consultation with others, to establish a state, local, and regional fusion  center initiative within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to  establish partnerships with fusion centers. Through the initiative, DHS is  required to provide to fusion centers operational and intelligence advice  and assistance, as well as management assistance, and facilitate close  communication and coordination between fusion centers and DHS. In  addition, the initiative is to provide training to fusion centers and  encourage the centers to participate in terrorism-threat-related exercises  conducted by DHS. Accordingly, the federal government has recognized  that fusion centers represent a critical source of local information about  potential threats for federal agencies and a mechanism for these agencies  to disseminate terrorism-related information and intelligence. DHS, the  Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Program Manager for the ISE (PM- ISE) have taken steps to partner with and leverage fusion centers as part  of the overall ISE. Further, the National Strategy for Information Sharing  (National Strategy) states that fusion centers will serve as the primary  focal points within states and localities for the receipt and sharing of  terrorism-related information. Through the National Strategy, the federal  government is promoting fusion centers to achieve a baseline level of  capability and to ensure compliance with all applicable privacy laws and  standards to become interconnected with the federal government and  each other in a national network capable of sharing terrorism-related  information.", "In January 2005, we designated information sharing for homeland security  a high-risk area because the government had continued to face formidable  challenges in analyzing and disseminating this information in a timely,  accurate, and useful manner. We reported that information is a crucial tool  in fighting terrorism and that its timely dissemination is critical to  maintaining the security of our nation. This area remained on the high-risk  list for our January 2009 update. In 2007, we reviewed the status of fusion  centers nationwide and reported that fusion center officials faced  challenges in obtaining and maintaining the funding and personnel  necessary to conduct their operations. According to the officials,  uncertainties in the amount of federal grant funding to be allocated from  year to year made it difficult to plan for the future and created concerns  about the centers\u2019 ability to sustain their capability for the long-term. To  improve efforts to create a national network of fusion centers, we  recommended that the federal government should articulate its role in  supporting fusion centers and determine whether it expects to provide  resources to centers over the long-term to help ensure their sustainability.  DHS and the PM-ISE concurred with our recommendation, stating that  recent efforts to define DHS\u2019s, and the federal government\u2019s, roles and  responsibilities in supporting the development of the nationwide network  of fusion centers demonstrates a long-term commitment to helping to  ensure their sustainability. However, federal, state, and local entities  continue to raise concerns about fusion centers\u2019 ability to maintain their  operations with limited or uncertain federal grant funding, especially as  many state and local governments face near-term and long-term fiscal  challenges.", "In addition, the 9/11 Commission Act requires the Secretary of Homeland  Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to establish guidelines  that include standards for fusion centers related to the privacy of  information. For example, these standards are to include that any fusion  center shall develop, publish, and adhere to a privacy and civil liberties  policy consistent with federal, state, and local law. Because fusion centers  collect, analyze, and disseminate information on potential criminal and  terrorist threats, some entities have raised concerns that centers are  susceptible to privacy and civil liberties violations. For example, according  to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the fusion center concept  encourages state and local law enforcement personnel to gather  intelligence that could potentially lead to violations of citizens\u2019 rights to  privacy and civil liberties. According to a senior DOJ official, such  violations by fusion centers could lead to a loss of public support or  confidence in fusion centers, harm to individuals, proliferation of  inaccurate data, or liability. In light of these risks, questions remain about  how centers are implementing privacy and civil liberties policies to ensure  that centers handle information in a manner that protects citizens\u2019  constitutional rights.", "Considering these issues and the fusion centers\u2019 role in the ISE, you asked  us to provide Congress with an assessment of the current status of fusion  centers\u2019 efforts to maintain and grow their operations and establish  privacy and civil liberties protections with support from the federal  government. Specifically, this report addresses the following questions:    To what extent has DHS taken action to support fusion centers\u2019 efforts to  maintain and grow their operations?", "To what extent are DHS and DOJ supporting fusion centers in establishing  privacy and civil liberties protections?", "To assess the extent to which DHS has supported centers in their efforts,  we analyzed relevant laws and strategies, such as the 9/11 Commission Act  and the National Strategy, related to fusion centers\u2019 role in the ISE and  federal efforts to support centers. We also examined guidance, such as the  Baseline Capabilities for State and Major Urban Area Fusion Centers  (Baseline Capabilities), which describes the minimum capabilities and  operational standards necessary for fusion centers. We focused our  review on DHS\u2019s efforts because DHS is the Executive Agent in managing  federal interaction with fusion centers and is to coordinate its efforts with  DOJ and the PM-ISE. To obtain fusion center views, we conducted  interviews with officials from a non-probability sample of 14 of 72 fusion  centers. We selected these centers to reflect a range of characteristics,  including whether the center is a state or major urban area fusion center;  length of time in operation; geographic region; and fiscal year 2010  funding allocations for the centers\u2019 states or urban areas from the DHS  Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which is the primary federal  grant program through which fusion centers may receive funding.  Specifically, we interviewed fusion center directors, or their designees, to  obtain information on their centers\u2019 approaches and plans to sustain  operations, and their perspectives on federal efforts to support these  approaches as well as any challenges or issues encountered in sustaining  operations. While their comments cannot be generalized to all fusion  centers nationwide, the interviews provided a range of perspectives and  useful insights on the issue of sustainability.", "To assess DHS support provided to fusion centers, we examined guidance,  such as for the DHS Fiscal Year 2010 HSGP. We also analyzed documents,  such as program descriptions, related to federal efforts to assess fusion  centers\u2019 baseline capabilities and provide training, technical assistance,  and grant funding. We interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s Office of  Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), which oversees the fusion center  program; DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Grant  Programs Directorate and Office of Counterterrorism and Security  Preparedness within Protection and National Preparedness, which  administer the HSGP and provide support to fusion centers; DOJ\u2019s Office  of Justice Programs, which provides training and technical assistance to  centers; the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which provides  personnel and support to centers; and the Office of the PM-ISE, which  oversees management of the ISE. We discussed plans and efforts related to  establishing performance measures for fusion centers and compared these  plans with criteria in standard practices for program management. In  addition, we conducted interviews with the National Fusion Center  Association (NFCA), a nonprofit association that represents the interests  of fusion centers, to obtain a broad perspective on fusion center  sustainability and the role of DHS, DOJ, and the PM-ISE in supporting  centers\u2019 efforts. Lastly, we attended the 2010 National Fusion Center  Conference to obtain information about federal plans and efforts to  support centers and issues and concerns of centers nationwide.", "To assess the extent to which DHS and DOJ are supporting fusion centers  in establishing privacy and civil liberties protections, we analyzed relevant  statutes, including the 9/11 Commission Act and the Intelligence Reform  Act, and guidance, such as the ISE Privacy Guidelines, Baseline  Capabilities, and DHS HSGP guidance to identify required and  recommended actions for fusion centers to take to establish these  protections. We analyzed plans and documentation, such as the DHS  Privacy Office\u2019s 2008 Privacy Impact Assessment of fusion centers and  privacy-related training and technical assistance materials. We also  assessed the DHS and DOJ Fusion Center Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil  Liberties Policy Template, which is intended to assist fusion center  personnel in developing their privacy and civil liberties policies. We  compared this template against the ISE Privacy Guidelines to determine  the extent to which the template included components of that guidance. In  addition, we interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s Privacy Office, DHS\u2019s Office  for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), DOJ\u2019s Office of Privacy and  Civil Liberties, and the PM-ISE about efforts to review centers\u2019 policies,  the status of centers\u2019 policy development, privacy-related training and  technical assistance, and plans for supporting fusion centers\u2019  implementation of privacy and civil liberties protections. We also  interviewed representatives from the Institute for Intergovernmental  Research, the DOJ contractor that reviews fusion centers\u2019 privacy and civil  liberties policies, to obtain additional information about the review  process and any challenges encountered related to the development of  these policies. To describe steps fusion centers are taking to establish  privacy and civil liberties protections, we included questions in our  interviews with officials from 14 fusion centers about the development of  privacy and civil liberties policies and procedures; support provided by  DHS, DOJ, and the PM-ISE; and any challenges or issues encountered in  establishing the protections. Lastly, we included questions in our  interviews with NFCA and ACLU officials to obtain a broad perspective on  privacy issues in fusion centers.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2010 through  September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

After centers had begun to be established around the country, Congress  passed the 9/11 Commission Act to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to share information with and support fusion centers. The  National Strategy identifies fusion centers as vital assets critical to sharing  information related to terrorism because they serve as focal points for the  two-way exchange of information between federal agencies and state and  local governments. According to DHS, fusion centers are the primary way  that DHS shares intelligence and analysis with state and local homeland  security agencies. For example, fusion centers typically issue analytical  products, such as daily or weekly bulletins on general criminal or  intelligence information and intelligence assessments which, in general,  provide in-depth reporting on an emerging threat, group, or crime. These  products are primarily created for law enforcement entities and other  community partners, such as members of the critical infrastructure  sectors. In recent years, fusion centers have been credited with being  influential in disrupting a planned terrorist attack on the New York City  subway system, investigating bomb threats against U.S. airlines, and  providing intelligence support to several political conventions and  summits. Other fusion centers have been instrumental in providing  intelligence and analytical support to assist with securing our nation\u2019s  borders. For example, the Arizona Counterterrorism Information Center  and the New York State Intelligence Center routinely (i.e., either twice a  week or quarterly, respectively) issue border-specific intelligence products  to enhance the situational awareness of law enforcement agencies in  border communities.", "While all fusion centers were generally created by state and local  governments to improve information sharing across levels of government  and to prevent terrorism or other threats, the missions of fusion centers  vary based on the environment in which the center operates. Some fusion  centers have adopted an \u201call-crimes\u201d approach, incorporating information  on terrorism and other high-risk threats into their jurisdiction\u2019s existing  law enforcement framework to ensure that possible precursor crimes,  such as counterfeiting or narcotics smuggling, are screened and analyzed  for linkages to terrorist planning or other criminal activity. Other fusion  centers have adopted an \u201call-hazards\u201d approach. In addition to collecting,  analyzing, and disseminating information on potential terrorist planning  and other crimes, these fusion centers identify and prioritize types of  major disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes or earthquakes,  which could occur within their jurisdiction. In doing so, they gather,  analyze, and disseminate information to assist relevant responsible  agencies\u2014law enforcement, fire, public health, emergency management,  critical infrastructure\u2014with the prevention, protection, response, or  recovery efforts of those incidents.", "Fusion centers also vary in their personnel composition and staffing levels.  Consistent with the statutory definition of a fusion center, these centers  typically bring together in one location representatives from several  different state or local agencies, such as state and local law enforcement  agencies\u2014state police, county sheriffs, and city police departments\u2014 homeland security agencies, emergency management agencies, and the  National Guard. In addition, as DHS is required to the maximum extent  possible to assign officers and intelligence analysts to fusion centers,  many centers have federal personnel working on-site, such as DHS  intelligence operations specialists and Customs and Border Protection  agents, along with others such as FBI intelligence analysts and Drug  Enforcement Administration agents. In terms of staffing levels, a 2009 joint  DHS and PM-ISE survey of fusion centers reported that the number of  personnel working at these centers ranged from under 10 employees to  over 75 per center, as shown in figure 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Role in Relation to Fusion Centers", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that DHS had already begun to provide support to fusion  centers but needed to play a stronger, more constructive role in assisting  these centers, Congress passed the 9/11 Commission Act, which required  the Secretary of Homeland Security to create the State, Local, and  Regional Fusion Center Initiative. The Act also required the Secretary, in  coordination with representatives from fusion centers and the states, to  take certain actions in support of the initiative. Specifically, the Act  requires that the Secretary take a number of steps to support the centers,  including supporting efforts to integrate fusion centers into the ISE,  assigning personnel to centers, incorporating fusion center intelligence  information into DHS information, providing training, and facilitating close  communication and coordination between the centers and DHS, among  others. The law also required the Secretary to issue guidance that includes  standards that fusion centers shall undertake certain activities. These  include, for example, that centers collaboratively develop a mission  statement, identify expectations and goals, measure performance, and  determine center effectiveness; create a collaborative environment for the  sharing of intelligence and information among federal, state, local, and  tribal government agencies, the private sector, and the public, consistent  with guidance from the President and the PM-ISE; and offer a variety of  intelligence and information services and products.", "DHS has taken steps to organize and establish a management structure to  coordinate its support of fusion centers. In June 2006, DHS tasked I&A  with the responsibility for managing DHS\u2019s support to fusion centers. I&A  established a State and Local Program Office (SLPO) as the focal point for  supporting fusion center operations and to maximize state and local  capabilities to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist and homeland  security threats.", "Consistent with the 9/11 Commission Act and Intelligence Reform Act,  DHS, in conjunction with DOJ and the PM-ISE, has issued a series of  guidance documents to support fusion centers in establishing their  operations. In 2006, through the Global Justice Information Sharing  Initiative (Global), DHS and DOJ jointly issued the Fusion Center  Guidelines, a document that outlines 18 recommended elements for  establishing and operating fusion centers consistently across the country,  such as establishing and maintaining a center based on funding availability  and sustainability; ensuring personnel are properly trained; and  developing, publishing, and adhering to a privacy and civil liberties  policy.", "To supplement the Fusion Center Guidelines, in September 2008, DHS,  DOJ, and Global jointly published the Baseline Capabilities, which were  developed in collaboration with the PM-ISE and other federal, state, and  local officials. The Baseline Capabilities define the capabilities needed to  achieve a national, integrated network of fusion centers and detail the  standards necessary for a fusion center to be considered capable of  performing basic functions by the fusion center community. For example,  the Baseline Capabilities include standards for fusion centers related to  information gathering, recognition of indicators and warnings, processing  information, intelligence analysis and production, and intelligence and  information dissemination. In addition, the Baseline Capabilities include  standards for the management and administrative functioning of a fusion  center. Among these are standards for ensuring information privacy and  civil liberties protections, developing a training plan for personnel, and  establishing information technology and communications infrastructure to  ensure seamless communication between center personnel and partners.  The development of these baseline standards is called for in the National  Strategy, which identifies their development as a key step to reaching a  national integrated network of fusion centers. By achieving this baseline  level of capability, it is intended that a fusion center will have the  necessary structures, processes, and tools in place to support the  gathering, processing, analysis, and dissemination of terrorism, homeland  security, and law enforcement information.", "In accordance with the 9/11 Commission Act, DHS, DOJ, and the PM-ISE  rely on fusion centers as critical nodes in the nation\u2019s homeland security  strategy and provide them with a variety of other support.", "Federal Grant Funding: DHS\u2019s HSGP awards funds to states, territories,  and urban areas to enhance their ability to prepare for, prevent, protect  against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks and other major  disasters. The fiscal year 2010 HSGP consists of five separate programs,  two of which are primarily used by states and local jurisdictions, at their  discretion, for fusion-center-related funding. These grant programs are  not specifically focused on, or limited to, fusion centers. Thus, fusion  centers do not receive direct, dedicated funding from DHS; rather, the  amount of grant funding a fusion center receives is determined by a state\u2019s  State Administrative Agency (SAA)\u2014the state-level agency responsible for  managing all homeland security grants and associated program  requirements\u2014or an urban area\u2019s working group, which has similar  responsibilities. A fusion center typically contributes to the development  of a state\u2019s federal grant application by providing information on how it  will use the proposed funding needed, called an investment justification.    Personnel: DHS and DOJ have deployed, or assigned, either part-time or  full-time personnel to fusion centers to support their operations and serve  as liaisons between the fusion center and federal components. For  example, DHS personnel are to assist the center in using ISE information;  review information provided by state, local, and tribal personnel; create  products derived from this information and other DHS homeland security  information; and assist in disseminating these products. As of July 2010,  DHS\u2019s I&A had deployed 58 intelligence officers and the FBI had deployed  74 special agents and analysts full time to 38 of the 72 fusion centers.", "Access to Information and Systems: DHS and DOJ also share classified  and unclassified homeland security and terrorism information with fusion  centers through several information technology networks and systems.  For example, in February 2010, DHS\u2019s I&A reported that it had installed  the Homeland Secure Data Network, which supports the sharing of federal  secret-level intelligence and information with state, local, and tribal  partners, at 33 of 72 fusion centers. DHS also provides an unclassified  network, the Homeland Security Information Network, which allows  federal, state, and local homeland security and terrorism-related  information sharing.", "Training and Technical Assistance: DHS has partnered with DOJ, through  Global, to offer fusion centers a variety of training and technical assistance  programs.

The goal of the nationwide  assessment, according to DHS senior officials, is to help enable both  federal and fusion center representatives to (1) obtain more accurate  information on the current status of centers\u2019 abilities to meet the baseline  capabilities, (2) help identify gaps between centers\u2019 current operations and  the capabilities, and (3) use this information to develop strategies and  realign resources to support centers\u2019 efforts to close those gaps going  forward. Further, according to both DHS senior officials and fusion center  representatives, the results of the assessment are also intended to provide  centers with the information needed to develop more accurate and  specific investment justifications to their SAAs in competing for DHS  HSGP funding.", "According to DHS and a senior official from the NFCA, personnel from  DHS, the PM-ISE, and DOJ coordinated with state and local government  representatives and fusion center officials prior to and during the National  Fusion Center Conference in February 2010 to jointly identify four critical  operational capabilities and four enabling capabilities to be prioritized in  developing the national network of fusion centers. Among the four  enabling capabilities are those that relate to establishing a sustainment  strategy and establishing privacy and civil liberties protections, as shown  in table 2.", "The nationwide assessment of fusion centers consists of two phases\u2014a  self-report survey followed by onsite validation. First, the PM-ISE sent a  self-assessment questionnaire, which was to be completed in May 2010, to  all 72 designated fusion centers to use to assess their current operations  against all baseline capabilities. Second, starting in June 2010, seven  validation teams consisting of federal and fusion center personnel began  making site visits to fusion centers to validate centers\u2019 responses to the  self-assessment. Specifically, the validation teams are to conduct a  review of the four critical operational capabilities that were identified  collaboratively by federal officials and fusion center directors as being  critical to the functioning of the national network. Validation teams are  also to review information on the privacy and civil liberties protections  established by these fusion centers and to discuss the centers\u2019 sustainment  strategies. Senior DHS officials stated that this review is to involve  discussions on each fusion centers\u2019 experiences and related issues,  challenges, and associated costs of achieving and maintaining the four  critical operational capabilities, as well as the privacy and civil rights/civil  liberties enabling capability, to provide additional information on why  gaps may exist and how to address them.", "According to DHS senior officials, the site visits were completed in  September 2010. The results of the assessment, which are to include the  aggregate of both the self-assessment and on-site validation data, are  expected to be analyzed and shared in a report with the participating  fusion centers by the end of October 2010. Further, according to DHS  senior officials, they are planning to conduct the assessment on a  recurring basis. Thus, this initial assessment is expected to serve as a  baseline against which to measure the development of the baseline  capabilities in individual fusion centers, as well as across the national  network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Efforts Under Way to Link DHS Grants to Filling Baseline Capabilities Gaps and Plans to Assess Costs of the Fusion Center Network", "paragraphs": ["DHS has opportunities to better target federal fusion center funding to fill  critical baseline capability gaps and is taking steps to do so. Both the  National Strategy and DHS emphasize that federal agencies are to play an  active role in addressing the challenge of sustaining fusion centers by  ensuring that they are able to achieve and maintain the baseline  capabilities. Specifically, the National Strategy states that federal agencies  are to assist fusion centers in incorporating the baseline capabilities into  their operations by amending and modifying grants and grants guidance,  and other applicable funding programs, to ensure that centers are able to  meet and sustain the baseline capabilities and operational standards. In its  fiscal year 2010 HSGP grant guidance, DHS encourages, but does not  require, that fusion centers prioritize the allocation of HSGP funding they  receive through their SAAs to meet and maintain the baseline capabilities.  Further, senior DHS officials stated, generally, that the results of the  nationwide assessment will be used to address future fusion center  funding and that the office will determine how it may leverage DHS\u2019s  HSGP to ensure that centers have access to grant funds and assist with  putting these mechanisms in place for the future.", "Senior officials from DHS as well as all 14 of the fusion centers we  contacted stated that linking, or tying, future HSGP grant funding to  achieving and maintaining the baseline capabilities may better enable  fusion centers to obtain the resources needed to address the gaps in  baseline capabilities by allowing them to more specifically detail how  grant funding is to be used in their investment justifications. For example,  by tying future grant funding to developing fusion centers\u2019 ability to gather  information, aggregate it, analyze it, and share it as appropriate, centers  may be more likely to obtain the funding necessary to develop the specific  information systems and analytical tools needed to enable them to achieve  these capabilities. An Acting Director with FEMA\u2019s Office of  Counterterrorism and Security Preparedness stated that, as part of  developing the Fiscal Year 2011 HSGP guidance, FEMA is currently  working with DHS and fusion center stakeholders to evaluate the potential  for amending the guidance to accomplish two goals. Specifically, they are  working to (1) require, rather than encourage, that fusion centers use 2011  grant funding allocated from SAAs to achieve and maintain all of the  baseline capabilities; and (2) focus funding to specifically address gaps in  baseline capabilities identified during the assessment process. For  example, the official said that they are exploring options such as requiring  centers to include in their investment justifications the results of the  nationwide assessment and indicating how the center would use funding  to fill any identified gaps. Further, this official added that FEMA has also  begun collaborating within DHS and with DOJ to discuss current grant  programs and possibilities for future interagency coordination on the  support specifically for fusion centers. Directives such as these could help  ensure that capabilities are met by enabling fusion centers to provide  specific data about operational gaps and needs in their investment  justifications.", "While DHS could ensure that fusion centers target the federal funding they  receive on filling baseline capabilities gaps, fusion centers have called on  the federal government to establish a dedicated funding stream for them.  DHS\u2019s HSGP is the primary grant program through which fusion centers  receive funding, but these grants are not specifically focused on, nor  limited to, fusion centers. As such, fusion centers compete with other state  homeland security, law enforcement, and emergency management  agencies and missions for a portion of the total amount of HSGP funding  awarded to the SAA, which decides what portion of the total funding  centers will receive. This process has generated long-standing concerns by  the fusion center community about the lack of a longer-term, predictable  funding source for the centers. For example, we reported in October 2007  that fusion centers reported challenges with funding, that these issues  made it difficult to plan for the future, and that fusion centers were  concerned about their ability to sustain their capability for the long term.  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) similarly reported in January  2008 that the threat of diminished or eliminated federal or state funding,  such as a decrease in DHS grant funding programs, poses a risk to the  development of fusion centers. The DHS Office of Inspector General  subsequently reported in December 2008 that fusion center officials they  spoke with remained concerned with sustainability and funding,  emphasizing that sustainment planning and funding from the federal  government is essential for the success of fusion centers.", "Officials from 13 of the 14 centers we contacted cited a number of  challenges with obtaining funding and the lack of a dedicated funding  source, which affected their ability to plan long term or expand their  operations. For example, officials in 9 of these centers stated that  uncertainty around the amount of federal grant funding the fusion center  will receive from their states each year made it difficult to plan and  expand operations. For instance, an official from a fusion center stated  that the center relies on federal funding for 80 percent of its annual  operating budget, but has to compete with several other state agencies and  about 75 counties for a portion of HSGP funding each year. Officials in  another fusion center stated that competition for limited federal grant  funding has made getting the necessary funding more difficult and, as a  result, they have had to scale back part of their outreach efforts to state  and local entities, which is one of the four critical enabling capabilities.", "In referring to the role fusion centers are to have in the national  information sharing network, officials from all 14 fusion centers stated  that there should be a federal grant funding stream or program dedicated  specifically to support fusion centers. For example, officials from 6  centers stated that, since the National Strategy has identified fusion  centers as a key component of the success of the ISE, the federal  government should recognize the importance of providing dedicated  funding support so that centers with varying missions and resources can  continue to close baseline capability gaps and function as key partners in  the national network. An official from one of these fusion centers stated  that while centers are owned and operated by state and local entities\u2014and  should thus be supported by state and local resources\u2014centers are also  expected, as members of the ISE, to support a national information  sharing, homeland security mission. Moreover, this official said that if  fusion centers, as the primary focal points of information sharing between  state and local and federal governments, are to support this mission, there  should be a targeted federal funding source to support centers\u2019 efforts to  meet and achieve the baseline capabilities, which have been identified as  being essential for centers to function in the national network.", "Senior I&A and FEMA officials said that they understood the fusion  centers\u2019 concerns and recognized the challenges centers faced in  competing for funding. However, these FEMA officials stated that they do  not have the authority to create a fusion-center-specific grant within the  HSGP and that doing so would require congressional action. These FEMA  officials said that, in addition to the nationwide assessment that is  underway to identify gaps in baseline capabilities, within the HSGP, they  have broadened the allowable costs for which fusion centers can use  HSGP funding and prioritized funding on achieving the baseline  capabilities. However, DHS has not directed that a certain percentage of  HSGP funding be used for fusion centers out of concern that other state  agencies, such as emergency management agencies, would likewise lobby  for such specific funding. These officials added that this would not be  possible because they are trying to balance ensuring that SAAs have  flexibility in administering HSGP funds while ensuring that federal fusion  center requirements are supported and met.", "Further, senior DHS officials stated that DHS has recognized the need to  conduct extensive research on funding options for fusion centers, stating  that, after the nationwide assessment is completed, the SLPO is to assess  key budgetary processes to determine how support to fusion centers can  be affected and determine DHS\u2019s ability to identify additional funding  options for centers. In addition, Fiscal Year 2012 implementation guidance  for the ISE requires that, by October 29, 2010, DHS should develop and  promulgate an annual common reporting process that will document the  total operational and sustainment costs of each of the 72 fusion centers in  the national network. Senior DHS officials stated that, while not yet  completed, the SLPO has begun to develop this reporting process and that  it is to be based in part on surveys implemented in previous years at fusion  centers. These officials added that the goal of the guidance is to develop  annual data on the costs to sustain fusion centers, and that these data are  a necessary first step to assessing the adequacy of current funding  mechanisms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taking Steps to Implement Standard Performance Measures to Track the Results of Fusion Centers\u2019 Efforts to Support Information Sharing Could Help Demonstrate Centers\u2019 Value to the ISE", "paragraphs": ["If fusion centers are to receive continued financial support, it is important  that centers are also able to demonstrate that they are providing critical  information that is helping the federal government and state and local  agencies protect against terrorist and homeland security threats. We have  previously emphasized the importance of performance measures as  management tools to track an agency\u2019s progress toward achieving goals  and to provide information on which to base organizational and  management decisions. Performance data allow agencies to share  effective approaches, recognize problems, look for solutions, and develop  ways to improve results.", "The Fusion Center Guidelines recommend that individual fusion centers  develop and use performance measures as an ongoing means to measure  and track performance and determine and evaluate the effectiveness of  their operations to make better decisions and allocate resources. The  Baseline Capabilities expand on these guidelines and recommend that  fusion centers develop measures that allow them to, among other things,  track their performance and results against the centers\u2019 individual goals  and objectives. Officials from 5 of the 14 centers we contacted stated that  one of the gaps they identified between their current operations and the  baseline capabilities was development of methods to monitor and evaluate  their fusion center\u2019s performance. Officials from these 5 fusion centers  stated that it was a challenge to develop performance measures to monitor  their operations and demonstrate results because their mission was to  prevent crimes, and it is difficult to know how many crimes were averted  due to their efforts. Additionally, officials from 3 of these 5 fusion centers  stated that their ability to develop performance measures was also  affected by the fact that, due to limited personnel, addressing other  operational work responsibilities, such as analyzing intelligence  information and developing related reports, was the priority. A senior  official from NFCA said that these challenges are similarly experienced  across the broader network of fusion centers, and that centers would  welcome a collaborative process in developing these measures to involve  participation from, among others, federal agencies such as DHS, DOJ, and  the PM-ISE.", "According to DHS senior officials, the nationwide assessment currently  under way is to gauge whether or not each fusion center has developed  methods to monitor and evaluate its own performance. For example, the  assessment results are to indicate to what extent a center has developed  mechanisms to receive feedback on the value of its products or to  determine the effectiveness of its operations in achieving identified goals  and objectives. DHS senior officials stated that the results will be used to  help federal agencies assess to what extent there are gaps in this baseline  capability across the national network of fusion centers and to make  decisions about where to allocate resources to support centers\u2019 efforts to  develop these individual performance measures.", "However, while federal guidance recommends that individual fusion  centers develop and use performance measures as a baseline capability,  currently there are no standard measures to track performance across  fusion centers and demonstrate the impact of centers\u2019 operations in  support of national information sharing goals. According to PM-ISE and  DHS senior officials, the results of the nationwide assessment are not  intended to provide standard measures for fusion centers to demonstrate  the results they are achieving in meeting broader information sharing  goals as part of the national network. For example, the assessment results  are not intended to provide information about how well centers  disseminated federal information to local security partners or how useful  federal agencies found the information that centers provided them.", "The PM-ISE and DHS have recognized the value of implementing standard  performance measures across fusion centers. In its 2009 annual report to  Congress, the PM-ISE stated that among the activities the office would  undertake in 2009 and 2010 would be designing a set of performance  measures to demonstrate the value of a national integrated network of  fusion centers operating in accordance with the baseline capabilities.  Senior PM-ISE officials stated that the PM-ISE had not begun this effort  and is no longer planning to develop these performance measures  however, because DHS, as the lead agency in coordinating federal support  of fusion centers, is now responsible for managing development of these  performance measures. Further, in response to a requirement under the  9/11 Commission Act, DHS stated in its 2008 fusion center Concept of  Operations that it will develop qualitative and quantitative measures of  performance for the overall network of fusion centers and relevant federal  entities, such as DHS and DOJ. According to senior DHS officials, the  agency recognizes that developing these measures is important to  demonstrate the value of agency efforts in support of the ISE. However,  these officials stated that, while DHS has started collecting some  information that will help in developing such measures, the agency is  currently focusing on completing the nationwide assessment to gauge the  capabilities and gaps across fusion centers. As such, these officials said  that they have not defined next steps or target timeframes for designing  and implementing these measures. Standard practices for program and  project management state that specific desired outcomes or results should  be conceptualized, defined, and documented in the planning process as  part of a road map, along with the appropriate steps and time frames  needed to achieve those results. By defining the steps it will take to  design and implement a set of standard measures to track the results and  performance across fusion centers and committing to a target timeframe  for completion, DHS could help ensure that centers and federal agencies  demonstrate the value of fusion centers\u2019 operations to national  information sharing goals and prioritize limited resources needed to  achieve and maintain those functions deemed critical to support the  national fusion center network."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Are Providing Technical Assistance and Training to Centers to Help Them Develop Privacy and Civil Liberties Policies and Protections, and DHS Is Assessing the Status of These Protections", "paragraphs": ["DHS and DOJ are providing technical assistance to assist fusion centers in  developing privacy and civil liberties policies, and fusion centers  nationwide are in varying stages of completing their policies.

According to federal guidance, if centers adhere to the Baseline  Capabilities, they in turn will be in adherence with the ISE Privacy  Guidelines. Further, DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 HSGP funding guidance  stipulates that federal funds may not be used to support fusion-center- related initiatives unless a fusion center has developed a privacy and civil  liberties policy containing protections that are at least as comprehensive  as the ISE Privacy Guidelines within 6 months of the grant award.

To ensure  fusion centers comply with the certification requirements in DHS\u2019s grant  guidance, DHS and DOJ have established a joint process to review and  certify fusion centers\u2019 privacy and civil liberties policies. First, a fusion  center sends its draft policy to a team of attorneys contracted by DOJ\u2019s  Bureau of Justice Assistance to provide a detailed review of the policy and  compare its language and provisions against language in the template.  After its review, DOJ submits the center\u2019s completed draft policy to the  DHS Privacy Office for a final review. This office reviews the policy  specifically to determine whether it contains protections that are at least  as comprehensive as the ISE Privacy Guidelines.

For example, a  Director with DHS\u2019s Privacy Office noted that a fusion center can, in  theory, have a model privacy and civil liberties policy but not correctly  implement its protections, increasing the risk of potential violations such  as the proliferation of inaccurate data. The 9/11 Commission Act requires  that the Secretary issue guidelines that contain standards that fusion  centers shall not only develop and publish a privacy and civil liberties  policy, but also that they adhere to it. Further, the Baseline Capabilities  recommend that fusion centers, as part of their privacy and civil liberties  protections, identify methods for monitoring the implementation of their  privacy and civil liberties policies and procedures to incorporate revisions  and updates. While the 9/11 Commission Act does not dictate specific  oversight mechanisms for fusion center privacy and civil liberties  protections, DHS, in coordination with DOJ and the PM-ISE, has two  efforts under way to assess the status of these protections across fusion  centers and is taking steps to encourage centers to assess their own  protections going forward to identify any existing privacy and civil  liberties risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.", "First, the nationwide assessment asks fusion centers to provide  information on each of the privacy-related baseline capabilities, including  information on the centers\u2019 designated privacy/civil liberties officials,  components of their privacy and civil liberties policies and related  protections, policy outreach efforts, and training. Following that,  validation teams are to review the self-reported information in detail with  each fusion center. According to senior DHS officials, this information  may help to identify any critical gaps in privacy and civil liberties  protections across the national network of fusion centers. Senior DHS  Privacy officials stated that this information will be an important tool in  developing a longer-term oversight and assessment strategy to ensure that  resources are aligned to address these gaps.", "Second, the 9/11 Commission Act, enacted in August 2007, requires, among  other things, that DHS submit (1) a report within 90 days of the enactment  of the Act containing a Concept of Operations for the Fusion Center  Initiative that includes a privacy impact assessment (PIA) and a civil  liberties impact assessment (CLIA) examining the privacy and civil  liberties implications of fusion centers, and (2) another PIA and CLIA  within 1 year of enactment. In general, these assessments allow agencies  to assess privacy and civil liberties risks in their information sharing  initiatives and to identify potential corrective actions to address those  risks. DHS published a PIA in December 2008 that identified several risks  to privacy presented by fusion centers, explained mitigation strategies for  those risks, and made recommendations on how DHS and fusion centers  can take additional action to further enhance the privacy interests of the  citizens in their jurisdictions. CRCL similarly published a CLIA in  December 2008 that evaluated fusion centers\u2019 impact on the civil liberties  of particular groups or individuals, outlined procedures for filing a civil  liberties complaint with DHS, and highlighted the importance of training  fusion center personnel on civil rights and civil liberties.", "DHS has not completed the second PIA or CLIA, which were to be issued  by August 2008. However, according to senior DHS Privacy officials, the  DHS Privacy Office is currently beginning to develop the updated PIA.  These officials said that they identified two key milestones when  determining when to begin work on the updated PIA. First, the officials  said that they wanted to complete the \u201ctraining the trainers\u201d program for  designated fusion center privacy/civil liberties officials, which they did in  July 2010. Second, officials said that they delayed the start of the updated  PIA to allow time for fusion centers to develop their privacy and civil  liberties policies\u2014which are to be certified by DHS by March 2011.  Ensuring that centers had completed, and were beginning to implement,  their policies would help in assessing updates to any risks identified in the  initial PIA, according to these officials. Senior DHS Privacy officials stated  that they have begun planning for the updated PIA, and that the  assessment will be published in 2011. These officials stated that the  updated PIA will be comprehensive in its scope, and include an  assessment of the steps fusion centers have taken to address the  recommendations of the 2008 PIA, an analysis of federal and state  government involvement in fusion center privacy and civil liberties  protections, a description of what federal agencies have done and are  doing to assist fusion centers in establishing these protections, and a  discussion about related initiatives. These officials added that the updated  PIA will be a useful tool in assessing where fusion centers are in  implementing protections and addressing the 2008 PIA recommendations,  and that the information will be used to inform decisions on where to  focus their training and oversight efforts going forward.", "Further, senior officials from CRCL stated that they have also begun to  develop the updated CLIA, and plan to publish the assessment in 2011.  According to these officials, the updated CLIA will address topics such as  oversight of fusion centers, common issues and challenges that fusion  centers face in establishing civil rights and civil liberties protections,  examples of civil rights and civil liberties complaints directed at fusion  centers, and key issues brought up during fusion center trainings. Given  the assessments\u2019 proposed scope and content, completing the updates to  the PIA and CLIA as required will help provide critical information to help  ensure that fusion centers are implementing privacy and civil liberties  protections and that DHS, and other federal agencies, are supporting them  in their efforts.", "In addition to the nationwide assessment and updated PIA and CLIA, DHS  is also taking steps to encourage fusion centers to conduct their own PIAs  once their privacy and civil liberties policies are reviewed and certified by  the DHS Privacy Office as a means to oversee their own privacy and civil  liberties protections going forward. According to senior DHS Privacy  officials, individual PIAs are integral for a fusion center\u2019s development and  promote transparency by describing fusion center activities and  authorities more fully than the policies can alone. To assist fusion centers  in developing their own PIAs, DHS and DOJ jointly published a guide to  conducting PIAs specific to state, local, and tribal information sharing  initiatives, including a template to lead policy developers through  appropriate privacy risk assessment questions. In addition to the  template itself, according to senior DHS Privacy officials, the importance  of conducting a fusion center PIA is conveyed through the three-part  training and technical assistance program where the steps the office took  to conduct its own PIA in 2008 are covered."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Fusion centers\u2014as the primary focal points for the two-way exchange of  information between federal agencies and state and local governments\u2014 play a critical and unique role in national efforts to combat terrorism more  effectively. In light of their reliance on fusion centers as critical  components in the ISE, DHS, in collaboration with DOJ and the PM-ISE,  provide fusion centers with a variety of support, including DHS grant  funding, personnel, and technical assistance. However, centers remain  concerned about their long-term sustainability and ability to meet and  maintain the baseline capabilities given the current federal funding  sources and fiscally constrained state and local economic environments.  DHS\u2019s efforts to require, rather than encourage, centers to target HSGP  funding to achieving and maintaining the baseline capabilities are aimed at  enabling fusion centers to close gaps in capabilities and develop more  accurate and specific investment justifications in competing for DHS  HSGP funding within their respective states. Further, by completing the  nationwide assessment and the required cost assessment of the fusion  center network, DHS can begin to address long-standing concerns and  questions about sustaining the fusion center network. If fusion centers are  to receive continued financial support, it is important that centers  demonstrate that they are providing critical information that is helping the  federal government protect against homeland security and terrorist threats  through a set of performance measures. The PM-ISE and DHS have  recognized the value of developing such performance measures, but  defining the steps it will take to design and implement them and  committing to a target time frame for completion could help ensure that  fusion centers and federal agencies track fusion center performance in a  manner that demonstrates the value of fusion center operations within the  ISE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the ability to demonstrate the results fusion centers are  achieving in support of national information sharing goals and help  prioritize how future resources should be allocated, we recommend that  the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the State and Local Program  Office, in partnership with fusion center officials, to define the steps it will  take to design and implement a set of standard performance measures to  show the results and value centers are adding to the Information Sharing  Environment and commit to a target timeframe for completing them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Program Manager for  the ISE on September 13, 2010. DHS, DOJ, and the PM-ISE did not provide  official written comments to include in our report. However, in an email  received September 23, 2010, a DHS liaison stated that DHS concurred  with our recommendation. DHS and DOJ provided written technical  comments, which we incorporated into the report, as appropriate. In its  technical comments, DHS stated that the agency has recently started to  develop a performance management framework to demonstrate the value  and impact of the national network of fusion centers and is using the  nationwide assessment data to support the development of specific  performance measures. With regard to target timeframes, DHS stated that  it is planning to (1) collaborate with fusion center directors and  interagency partners on the development of these performance measures  throughout the remainder of 2010 and (2) provide performance  management resources at the next National Fusion Center Conference in  March 2011. If properly implemented and monitored, developing these  standard performance measures should enhance the ability to demonstrate  the results fusion centers are achieving in support of national information  sharing goals and help prioritize how future resources should be allocated.", "DHS also noted that while the report emphasizes the importance of  sustainment funding for fusion centers, it does not recommend that DHS  develop a sustainment strategy to assist fusion centers in getting the  critical federal support they require. In our 2007 report, we recommended  that the federal government articulate such a sustainment strategy for  fusion centers\u2014a recommendation with which DHS agreed and that we  consider to still be current and applicable. Specifically, we recommended  that the federal government define and articulate its role in supporting  fusion centers and determine whether it expects to provide resources to  centers over the long-term to help ensure their sustainability. During our  review, DHS described actions that it plans to take that begin to build this  strategy.  More specifically, DHS said that it plans to collect and assess  cost data from centers\u2014a necessary first step to assessing the adequacy of  current funding mechanisms and level of the resources that DHS provides  to fusion centers. While a positive start, it will be important for DHS to  follow through on these plans and develop a sustainment strategy for  fusion centers.  This would in turn be responsive to our recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Attorney General, the Program Manager for the ISE, and  other interested congressional committees and subcommittees.

For example, in the 13 fusion  centers with privacy/civil liberties officials, 3 of these officials were center  directors and 6 were analysts. The remaining 4 fusion centers designated  attorneys from other bureaus or agencies within their respective state or  local governments, such as state attorneys\u2019 general offices, as their  privacy/civil liberties official. These officials stated that because they  either did not have the appropriate legal expertise within the fusion center  or had an existing working relationship with a state bureau or agency,  designating officials outside their center as the privacy/civil liberties  official was the best option available in achieving this baseline capability.  Among the 9 centers that had designated fusion center personnel as the  privacy/civil liberties official, none of these personnel was an attorney;  however, officials in 3 of these centers stated that their privacy/civil  liberties officials had access to other legal counsel within the state police  agency or city police department, for example, to help clarify laws and  regulations governing privacy and civil liberties protections and to assist  with the development of the centers\u2019 policies.", "Fusion center officials we interviewed reported several challenges in  designating privacy/civil liberties officials, including concerns that some  officials had other operational duties at the fusion center or may not have  sufficient legal expertise to ensure implementation of privacy and civil  liberties protections. For example, of the nine fusion centers with  directors or analysts serving as the privacy/civil liberties official, two had  officials whose sole duty was to oversee development of the center\u2019s  privacy and civil liberties policy and implementation of privacy and civil  liberties protections. The other seven privacy/civil liberties officials had  other operational duties at the fusion center. For instance, one fusion  center\u2019s privacy/civil liberties official also served as the center\u2019s critical  infrastructure and key resources analyst, which according to the center  officials, slowed the development of the center\u2019s privacy and civil liberties  policy. According to a Director with DHS\u2019s Privacy Office, it is difficult to  assess the effect of fusion center privacy/civil liberties officials having  responsibilities outside of their privacy-related duties because the position  is relatively new and this is common. The official added that, in general, it  is better to have the designated privacy/civil liberties official be able to  focus exclusively on privacy-related duties. Additionally, officials in two  fusion centers were concerned that their privacy/civil liberties officials  may not have sufficient legal expertise to effectively monitor privacy and  civil liberties protections at the centers. For example, one official stated  that it was difficult to identify personnel who, in addition to legal  expertise, had experience in both intelligence analysis and standard law  enforcement practices which, in his experience, were necessary skills for a  center\u2019s privacy/civil liberties official. Senior DHS Privacy officials said  that, in recognizing that fusion center privacy/civil liberties officials have  multiple duties and vary in terms of their experience and legal expertise,  DHS is committed to training and has taken steps to train centers\u2019  designated officials and tailor DHS\u2019s privacy instruction to the needs of  individual fusion centers to help centers achieve this baseline capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Privacy/Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Training and Technical Assistance Program", "paragraphs": ["DHS, in partnership with DOJ and Global, has implemented a three-part  training and technical assistance program in support of fusion centers\u2019  efforts to provide appropriate privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties  training for all state, local, tribal, and private sector representatives at the  fusion center:    A \u201cTraining the Trainers\u201d Program: In this 2010 program, representatives  from the DHS Privacy Office and CRCL provided instruction to fusion  center privacy/civil liberties officials at four regional fusion center  conferences that are held annually. These 1 1/2-day classes were intended  to provide privacy/civil liberties officials with instruction on the  requirements of a fusion center in implementing privacy and civil liberties  protections, the general privacy law framework of the ISE, and instruction  on how privacy/civil liberties officials can best teach the material to fusion  center personnel at their centers. According to senior officials from CRCL,  privacy/civil liberties officials from 68 of 72 fusion centers have received  the training as of August 2010. According to directors with the DHS  Privacy Office and CRCL, the training delivered at the conferences is  specialized and tailored based on feedback the offices receive from fusion  center staff on key issues they would like covered. Officials added that  they obtain feedback at each training session to also identify the privacy,  civil rights, and civil liberties-related subject areas in which privacy/civil  liberties officials may need more training. Participants in this program are  asked to teach the material to other fusion center personnel within their  centers within 6 months.", "A Web site \u201cTool Kit:\u201d This tool-kit, or Web portal, provides a single point  of access to federal resources on privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties  training. The portal contains training material and video resources for  state and local personnel on a broad range of privacy, civil rights, and civil  liberties topics. The public Web portal can be found at  www.it.ojp.gov/PrivacyLiberty. Furthermore, the Web portal provides  access to training resources on the requirements in 28 C.F.R. part 23,  which contains guidelines for law enforcement agencies operating  federally grant-funded criminal intelligence systems. DHS HSGP guidance  states that in fiscal year 2010, all fusion center employees are expected to  complete the online 28 C.F.R. part 23 certification training. Officials from  all 14 fusion centers we contacted stated that fusion center staff have  completed the requisite online certification training, and that it was helpful  in making their staff aware of the regulations governing their criminal  intelligence systems. Furthermore, officials from 5 of these 14 fusion  centers stated that they plan to require that fusion center personnel  complete the 28 C.F.R. part 23 certification training on an annual basis to  ensure that staff are well-versed on privacy requirements.", "An On-site Training Program: For this program, representatives from the  DHS Privacy Office and CRCL travel to fusion centers, upon request, to  provide a full day of training on privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties  issues in the following core areas: civil rights and civil liberties basics in  the ISE, privacy fundamentals, cultural competency, First Amendment  issues in the ISE, and \u201cred flags\u201d when reviewing or creating intelligence  products. Additionally, fusion centers have the option of selecting topics  from a list of available training modules, such as a civil rights and civil  liberties case scenario or an intelligence analysis product review exercise,  and receiving customized instruction based on the training needs of their  fusion center. Prior to the training, representatives from CRCL conduct  interviews with fusion center officials to learn about their specific privacy,  civil rights and civil liberties questions or issues, review state constitution  and relevant state law, and research local media to identify the types of  issues related to the work of the fusion center that have raised concerns  among citizens in their jurisdictions. According to senior officials from the  DHS Privacy Office and CRCL, as of August 2010, 21 of 72 fusion centers  have received this on-site training.
