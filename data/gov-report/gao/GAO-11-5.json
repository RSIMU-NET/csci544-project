GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent of oversight provided by the USITC IG, (2) the budget and staffing resources available for oversight, and (3) how the role of the IG is addressed in the governance of USITC. To accomplish these objectives, GAO reviewed USITC IG reports and budgets for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, and relevant policies and procedures regarding governance and accountability. GAO also interviewed the USITC Chairman, Commissioners, current and former acting and temporary IGs, and office directors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The IG Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act), requires IGs to provide independent audits and investigations of the programs, offices, and activities in their respective federal entities. However, during the 5-year period reviewed, the USITC IG office conducted no audits and had no investigative case files or investigative reports of USITC. The IG office's oversight activities consisted primarily of monitoring and reviewing the work of independent public accountants (IPA) who conducted annual mandatory audits of USITC's financial statements and information security programs and practices. The most recent peer review of the USITC IG office's audit quality concluded that an opinion could not be rendered on the audit organization because no audits had been conducted by the IG in the past 5 years. The IG Act requires the designated federal entity heads to appoint an IG and provide adequate budgetary resources and sufficient staff. Both the lack of an appointed IG and constrained IG office budgets and staffing resources contributed to the limited oversight of USITC. From November 1, 2005, through December 5, 2009, USITC relied on acting IGs and a temporary IG to provide oversight. During this period the IG position was vacant for 17 months with no acting or temporary IG while USITC relied on the Assistant IG for Audits to provide oversight. Between fiscal years 2005 and 2009, the USITC budget increased about 23 percent, but the IG office budget resources remained relatively flat with funds only available for IPA-conducted audits and two staff during the last 4 years reviewed. The lack of comprehensive audit plans by the acting and temporary IGs to fully communicate their resource needs to USITC contributed to inadequate IG office resources and resulted in limited oversight. In fiscal year 2010, USITC appointed a Senior Executive Service-level IG to address requirements of the IG Reform Act of 2008. Also, consistent with the act, USITC provided a fiscal year 2010 IG office budget based on discussions with the current IG, which increased staffing and was certified by the IG as adequate. The IG stated that future oversight may require additional resources, which we believe can be communicated and justified by a staffing analysis as part of IG audit planning. The IG Act provides each IG with protections of independence including the authority for access to all entity documents and records. In addition, the IG is required to refer cases with potential violations of federal criminal law to the Attorney General. We found instances where the governance structure did not fully support the temporary USITC IG's responsibilities. Specifically, during 2009, the temporary IG was unable to obtain timely access to sensitive contract documents because USITC's policies and procedures did not clearly provide for IG access to such documents. The orientation book for the Commissioners, who may not have prior federal service, does not contain information about the USITC IG's authorities and responsibilities. In another instance, due to the lack of a formal policy or other agreement with the IG office, the Chairman referred the results of a possible criminal investigation to the Department of Justice (DOJ) without coordinating with the temporary IG, resulting in the potential for duplication of investigative efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making a recommendation to the USITC IG to prepare a staffing analysis as part of audit planning to determine the resources needed for effective oversight of USITC.

USITC is headed by six Commissioners who are appointed by the  President and confirmed by the Senate for terms of 9 years, unless  appointed to fill an unexpired term. The terms are set by statute and are  staggered so that a different term expires every 18 months. No more than  three Commissioners may be members of the same political party. From  among the appointed Commissioners in office, the President designates a  Chairman and Vice Chairman to each serve for a 2-year term. The  Chairman may not be of the same political party as the preceding  Chairman, and the Chairman and the Vice Chairman may not be of the  same political party. The Chairman is responsible, within statutory limits,  for the administrative functions of USITC.", "The mission of USITC is to (1) administer U.S. trade remedy laws within  its mandate; (2) provide the President, the U.S. Trade Representative, and  Congress with independent high-quality analysis, information, and support  on matters relating to tariffs and international trade and competitiveness;  and (3) maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  (HTS).

Of the  59 IGs, the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appointed  29. These presidentially appointed IGs may only be removed by the  President. The other 30 IG Offices were established by the 1988  amendments to the IG Act in designated federal entities (DFE) named in  the legislation. The USITC IG is one of the 30 DFE IGs. Generally, the  DFE IGs have the same authorities and responsibilities as those IGs  established by the original IG Act of 1978; however, they are appointed  and may be removed by their entity heads rather than by the President and  are not subject to Senate confirmation. For purposes of the IG Act, the  USITC Chairman was the head of USITC during our review period.", "The act provides the IGs with independence by authorizing them, among  other things, to select and employ their own staffs, make such  investigations and reports as they deem necessary, and report the results  of their work directly to Congress. In addition, the IG Act provides the IGs  with a right of access to information, and prohibits interference with IG  audits or investigations by agency personnel. The act further provides the  IGs with the duty to inform the Attorney General of suspected violations of  federal criminal law.", "Congress passed the IG Reform Act of 2008 (IG Reform Act) to further  enhance IG independence and accountability. The act maintains the  framework and IG community that existed under the IG Act and adds  authorities and requirements to help build a stronger, more independent,  professional, and accountable IG community. The act requires that the  heads of entities, including USITC, and the President, for those IGs  appointed by the President, inform both houses of Congress 30 days  before taking actions to remove or transfer an IG. The act also provides a  statutory process for handling allegations of wrongdoing by IGs so that  such reviews are not done by the same management officials who are  subject to IG oversight.", "The IG Reform Act also specifies that DFE IGs, such as the USITC IG, be  classified at a grade level or rank designation at or above those of a  majority of the senior-level executives of the DFE. It requires the head of  each DFE to transmit proposed budgets to the President with an aggregate  request for the IG, amounts for IG training, and amounts for the support of  the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE).
