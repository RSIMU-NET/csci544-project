Since 2001, U.S. agencies have provided $275 million in labor-related technical assistance and capacity-building activities for FTA partners, including $222 million for the four FTAs GAO reviewed.

Also, union representatives and other stakeholders GAO interviewed in partner countries often did not understand the submission process, possibly limiting the number of submissions filed.

GAO's current review found that although the agencies have taken several steps since 2009 to strengthen their monitoring and enforcement of FTA labor provisions, they lack a strategic approach to systematically assess whether partner countries' conditions and practices are inconsistent with labor provisions in the FTAs. Despite some proactive steps, they generally rely on labor submissions to begin identifying, investigating, and initiating steps to address possible inconsistencies with FTA labor provisions. According to agency officials, resource limitations have prevented more proactive monitoring of all FTA labor provisions. As a result, USTR and DOL systematically monitor and enforce compliance with FTA labor provisions for only a few priority countries.

According to  USTR officials, labor submissions are a central component of the  FTAs\u2019 framework for monitoring and enforcement of labor obligations  and USTR and DOL invest extensive time and resources in  addressing submissions. For the Bahrain and Guatemala  submissions, DOL, with USTR, formally requested labor consultations  under the FTAs\u2019 labor chapters to address the concerns raised in the  submissions. In Guatemala\u2019s case, after consultations failed to  address the concerns, the U.S. government invoked dispute  settlement proceedings; during these proceedings, the two  governments negotiated the Enforcement Plan, outlining steps that  Guatemala agreed to take.

The reports include  updated contact information for each partner and identify labor  conditions or practices\u2014for example, related to freedom of  association and collective bargaining\u2014that may be inconsistent with  the FTA labor provisions. They also outline steps that DOL staff  propose to take to address any identified concerns, subject to  approval and resource availability. According to DOL officials, DOL  uses the management reports to identify labor concerns, rather than  potential FTA violations for enforcement purposes, and to facilitate  engagement on technical assistance projects with FTA partner  countries. DOL officials noted that claiming and proving a violation of  FTA labor provisions would be very costly and legally complicated.  The officials explained that when a management report identifies labor  concerns, DOL may request formal or informal consultations with the  partner country\u2019s ministry of labor to discuss these concerns and will  attempt to cooperatively address them.

This lack of a joint approach may be inconsistent with USTR\u2019s  2009 statement that the agencies would work in close partnership to  immediately identify and investigate labor violations.", "Further, while the agencies take steps such as gathering facts from  credible and reliable sources and prioritizing their monitoring of the  partner countries, they have not jointly operationalized other key steps  that we previously identified as typical for monitoring and enforcement of  trade agreements. For example, although DOL\u2019s management reports are  its primary means, other than submissions, of monitoring and identifying  issues that may be inconsistent with FTA labor provisions, the agencies  have not established a coordinated strategic approach to identify and  carry out steps necessary to address issues identified in the reports.  According to DOL, the management reports are available to USTR and  State and the three agencies routinely discuss the reports\u2019 contents.  USTR confirmed that DOL shares information from the reports with the  Subcommittee on Labor Monitoring and Enforcement for discussion and  consideration. However, USTR officials noted that USTR regards the  management reports as one of multiple information sources that it  considers before deciding to engage with a country about a labor  concern, rather than as an indicator of a need to engage with the country.  USTR officials also noted that USTR views the management reports as a  new internal DOL tool and is assessing how best to use these reports in  the interagency process.", "Moreover, USTR, DOL, and State have differing perspectives on how to  monitor and enforce FTA labor provisions, according to agency officials.  According to a USTR official, each agency approaches monitoring and  enforcement in relation to its mission, and as a result, some of the 13  countries that DOL has identified internally as priorities differ from  countries that USTR has identified as priorities in the context of the FTAs.  The USTR official stated that USTR must assess whether a labor issue  constitutes a breach of obligations set forth in the relevant FTA before it  pursues dispute settlement, whereas DOL and State\u2014as observers of  labor conditions and human rights, respectively\u2014approach labor issues  more strictly as labor rights concerns. According to a State official, USTR  prefers to address identified partner countries\u2019 labor issues without the  intent to invoke the FTA.", "Our prior work identifying best practices for interagency collaboration has  shown that agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts  by engaging in eight practices. For example, to achieve a common  outcome, collaborating agencies need to, among other things, not only  define and articulate the outcome but also establish strategies that work  in concert with their partners\u2019 or are joint in nature.

According to USTR officials, although the Office of Labor Affairs staff has  doubled from two to four since 2008, the number of trade partner  countries for which they are responsible has increased from 14 to 20.  USTR staff stated that because so few staff are available, they cannot  engage with partner countries regarding every labor issue identified and  must address such issues in cooperation with other agencies. USTR staff  also noted that they depend on DOL and State for day-to-day monitoring  of labor conditions in partner countries.", "DOL. Resource constraints limit DOL\u2019s ability to monitor implementation  of FTA labor provisions except in partner countries that DOL has  identified as priorities, such as countries cited in labor submissions,  according to DOL officials. DOL reported that in fiscal years 2013 and  2014, the Monitoring and Enforcement of Trade Agreements Division had  five to eight full-time staff, with primary responsibilities that include  monitoring labor conditions in 20 FTA partners and addressing and  following up on labor submissions\u2014for example, assessing  implementation of submission report recommendations and engaging in  consultations with the FTA partner. DOL officials stated that over the past  year, the division\u2019s staff spent 80 percent of their work hours monitoring  implementation of the Guatemala Enforcement Plan; following up on  activities initiated under the Colombia Labor Action Plan; and addressing  labor submissions for Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Bahrain, and   The employees\u2019 remaining work hours were available to  Mexico.monitor and engage with the other 14 FTA partner countries.

Moreover, U.S. agencies\u2019 work with the partners to resolve these  concerns has in some cases been very time consuming. For example, 6  years after DOL received the Guatemala labor submission, the  submission remains open, and according to U.S. agencies, Guatemala  has not fully addressed the weaknesses in its labor law enforcement or  the resulting hardships on workers.", "Further, although USTR and DOL jointly pledged in 2009 to adopt a more  assertive, interagency approach to monitoring and enforcing FTA labor  provisions, in practice the agencies systematically investigate possible  inconsistencies with these provisions primarily in response to labor  submissions.

Without such strategic coordination, and given  constraints on resources, both agencies have focused their monitoring  and enforcement activities, apart from addressing labor submissions, on a  few priority countries. As a result, consistency with FTA labor provisions  in most partner countries is generally not monitored and enforced  systematically.

In August 2012, DOL issued a public report finding that  although the Ministry of Labor and Promotion of Employment appeared to  have fulfilled its duties during the collective bargaining processes at issue,  SUNAT had failed to comply with certain elements of the Peruvian  Collective Bargaining Law, including deadlines for launching  negotiations. Further, with regard to all other issues raised in the  submission, DOL determined that important legal ambiguity during the  period at issue prevented a finding that SUNAT had failed to comply with  the law or that the government of Peru had failed to comply with, or  enforce, its own labor laws during that time. DOL\u2019s report did not  recommend formal consultations between the U.S. government and the  Peruvian government. According to DOL, because the government of  Peru had taken important steps to address some of the issues raised in  the submission, including issuing legal instruments to help clarify legal  ambiguity and facilitate collective bargaining, DOL did not believe that  formal consultations were needed to continue positive engagement and  progress on these matters. As a result, DOL closed the submission as  resolved in August 2012.", "In September 2011, according to DOL, while it was reviewing the  submission, the government of Peru issued two executive orders that  clarified the parties\u2019 collective bargaining duties in this and similar cases.  DOL\u2019s report on the submission explained that on March 29, 2012, after  applying the recent executive orders, an arbitral panel reached a decision  favorable to SINAUT that contained both economic and noneconomic  awards for the union. Moreover, DOL reported that the government of  Peru appealed the ruling, contending that the ruling reflects a  misapplication and misinterpretation of the Public Sector Budget Law.  According to the DOL report, on appeal, the Peruvian labor courts  overturned the economic elements of the arbitral award, based on a ruling  that those elements conflicted with Peru\u2019s Public Sector Budget Law, but  sustained the noneconomic elements of the award.", "Figure 9 shoes the timeline and status of the Peru labor submission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "See Comment 12", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments regarding the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative\u2019s (USTR) letter dated September 16, 2014.", "In its letter, USTR questions our evaluation of its monitoring and  enforcement of free trade agreement (FTA) partners\u2019 compliance with their  labor commitments and expresses concern that we do not give sufficient  credit to U.S. agencies for their multifaceted work to help FTA partners  comply with their labor commitments. We acknowledge in our report that  the agencies have given, overall, greater political and organizational  priority to monitoring and enforcement of FTA labor commitments since we  last reported on this topic in 2009. The evidence that USTR and the  Department of Labor (DOL) provided demonstrate that their monitoring  and enforcement activities have sometimes led to a strengthening of FTA  partners labor laws and practices that might not have occurred absent  these activities. Nevertheless, we stand by our current assessment that  USTR and DOL have not demonstrated a proactive and systematic  approach to monitoring and enforcing FTA partners\u2019 compliance with their  FTA labor commitments, with the exception of a few partner countries. On  the contrary, the evidence that the agencies provided shows that USTR\u2019s  and DOL\u2019s approaches and actions are generally ad hoc and leave  important gaps.", "Our review focuses on steps that USTR and DOL have taken, with support  from the Department of State (State), to monitor and enforce the labor  provisions in the FTAs. In reviewing USTR\u2019s and DOL\u2019s monitoring and  enforcement of the provisions in the FTA labor chapters, we looked for evidence that USTR and DOL took steps to ensure that each FTA  partner had the requisite laws in place by the time the President  determined that the FTA could enter into force, as well as evidence that USTR and DOL have taken steps to ensure that the  partners are enforcing their laws and maintaining labor rights in law and  practice since the FTAs entered into force.", "Further, because USTR announced in 2009 that it would not wait for  complaints (e.g., labor submissions) to investigate and address possible  inconsistencies with FTA provisions, we looked for evidence that the  agencies had established means or mechanisms to anticipate, analyze,  and resolve problems in the absence of a submission.", "We consider the approach to monitoring and enforcement that USTR  outlines in its letter to be broadly compatible with the definitions of  monitoring and enforcement and with the key elements of monitoring and  enforcement that we have identified in our report. That is, enforcement  involves taking action to secure compliance by the partner, and monitoring  and enforcement typically involve six key steps: (1) gathering and  analyzing information, (2) setting priorities, (3) identifying compliance  problems, (4) developing and implementing responses, (5) taking  enforcement actions, and (6) coordinating with agencies.", "Following are specific comments in response to USTR\u2019s letter.", "Comment 1: Throughout our year-long review process, we requested  documentation of USTR\u2019s monitoring and enforcement of labor provisions.  However, USTR provided a large number of documents very late in the  process and provided most documents only after receiving our draft report.  We thoroughly reviewed and considered all documents that USTR  provided and made changes in our report as appropriate to ensure its  accuracy and completeness. Several of these changes are described in  the comments that follow.", "Comment 2: The evidence that we obtained from USTR and DOL does  not support USTR\u2019s assertion that the two agencies actively and  systematically monitored and enforced labor provisions in all 20 FTA  countries, implementing all of the key elements that we identified,  regardless of whether the country had been the subject of a submission.  USTR and DOL submitted evidence that they had taken some of these key  steps in several FTA partner countries, three of which\u2014Colombia, Jordan,  and Panama\u2014were not the subject of labor submissions. In addition, to  support its technical comments about a draft of our report, USTR  submitted further evidence of certain proactive steps, which we have  incorporated in our report as appropriate. However, in the absence of  evidence that USTR and DOL have taken steps to analyze and address  possible inconsistencies with FTA labor provisions in most partner  countries that have not been the subject of a labor submission, we could  not conclude that the agencies had implemented a systematic approach to  monitoring the implementation of all labor provisions in all FTAs. Moreover,  according to DOL\u2014on which USTR relies for day-to-day monitoring of the  FTA partners\u2014the division\u2019s staff spent 80 percent of their work hours in  the past year monitoring implementation of the Guatemala Enforcement  Plan, addressing submissions for five other countries, and following up on  activities initiated under the Colombia Labor Action Plan. This left the  employees\u2019 remaining work hours available to monitor and engage the  other 14 FTA partner countries. With the exception of Colombia,  stakeholders in countries we visited indicated that their recent interactions  with USTR and DOL had been very limited. Stakeholders in these  countries also told us that the FTA labor affairs councils in their countries  had been largely inactive and that the councils\u2019 meetings were considered  a formality.", "Comment 3: Having reviewed all of the cables that State provided, we  consider them a useful tool for DOL and State to obtain information about  labor conditions in partner countries. Our report acknowledges that USTR  is an addressee on such cables and is generally well informed about labor  conditions in partner countries as a result of this and other input. Obtaining  and analyzing information from credible sources such as State is integral  to completing the first step of the monitoring and enforcement process.", "Comment 4: USTR states that it deploys a range of tools to try to resolve  concerns, whether they were identified formally or informally. However, we  found that USTR\u2019s and DOL\u2019s approach to addressing concerns that were  identified formally, such as by a submission, is more systematic than their  approach to addressing concerns that they have identified informally. For  example, in responding to a labor submission, DOL conducts a formal  review and issues an official report, which generally identifies any possible  inconsistencies with labor provisions in the FTA and contains specific  recommendations to resolve the issue. DOL and USTR typically use the  report\u2019s findings to further engage with the FTA partner country and  develop an action plan, such as in the case of Guatemala. When they  have identified a concern informally, USTR and DOL may engage with the  partner country to discuss the concern, usually in the context of an  established FTA mechanism such as the FTA labor affairs council or free  trade commission. However, we found that USTR and DOL use these  mechanisms infrequently, and USTR and DOL officials told us that except  for a few high-priority countries such as Colombia, the agencies do not  typically perform in-depth analysis of a partner country\u2019s compliance with  its FTA labor commitments unless the country has been the subject of a  submission.", "Comment 5: We acknowledge that USTR\u2019s work with Colombia did not  end with the ratification of the FTA. We added text to our report to indicate  our concurrence with this point and to illustrate USTR\u2019s postratification  monitoring and enforcement activities.", "Comment 6: We acknowledge that USTR and DOL have engaged  extensively with the government of Colombia to monitor the  implementation of the Labor Action Plan, in the process addressing  several of the key elements of monitoring and enforcement FTAs.  However, we cannot conclude that a systematic approach to monitoring  and enforcement labor provisions is in place, because we did not see  evidence of certain key elements\u2014for example, an approach to respond to  outstanding issues identified since the implementation of the Labor Action  Plan.", "USTR also indicates that its level of engagement to monitor and enforce  labor provisions in Colombia is not unique and that USTR and DOL have  engaged with other FTA countries to a similar extent as with Colombia.  However, we did not see evidence of such a level of engagement with  other countries that have not been the subject of a submission. In fact,  DOL reported that in the last year, its monitoring division staff spent 80  percent of their time following up on the Colombia Labor Action Plan  activities and addressing submissions.", "Comment 7: We do not assume or indicate that a tailored, country-specific  approach to labor monitoring and enforcement is inappropriate, and we do  not exclude such approaches from our evaluation. We reviewed the  documentation that USTR and DOL provided, looking for evidence that key  elements of monitoring and enforcement have been implemented. We  recognize that USTR and DOL have successfully implemented certain  steps, such as gathering information and identifying compliance problems,  using different methods in different countries. However, we did not see  evidence of an overarching strategy that assures that priorities and  problems are systematically addressed.", "Comment 8: We evaluated all evidence that USTR and DOL provided,  including documentation that USTR provided with its technical comments,  and we made changes to our report. Specifically, we incorporated  language acknowledging that in some partner countries, the agencies took  steps before and after FTA ratification that were consistent with key  elements of monitoring and enforcement and that likely contributed to  assuring that the partners met certain labor commitments.", "Comment 9: We acknowledge that the labor submission process is a  central component of USTR\u2019s and DOL\u2019s approach to addressing possible  inconsistencies with FTA labor provisions in partner countries and that the  agencies have done extensive work to investigate allegations in the  submissions that DOL has accepted. However, in our view, reliance on  labor submissions to assess compliance and take enforcement actions is  inconsistent with USTR\u2019s 2009 commitment to no longer enforce FTA  partners\u2019 labor commitments \u201conly on a complaint-driven basis\u201d but instead  to \u201cimmediately identify and investigate labor violations.\u201d", "Comment 10: As stated, the report acknowledges that labor submissions  are a key component of USTR\u2019s and DOL\u2019s monitoring and enforcement of  FTA labor provisions and that the agencies undertake considerable  research and analysis in the process of addressing submissions We  modified the text of the report to clarify that after DOL receives a  submission, it works with USTR and State to engage diplomatically to  address concerns, as well as independently to investigate and analyze the  issues.", "Comment 11: We acknowledge that USTR and DOL work together to  address labor concerns identified in submissions and to engage with  partner countries regarding labor matters. Our review of evidence obtained  from the agencies and in FTA partner countries generally confirmed that  USTR and DOL also coordinate on an ad hoc basis. However, the  evidence that we reviewed did not show that the agencies have developed  a coordinated, strategic approach to systematically address the key steps  of monitoring and enforcing labor provisions in all FTAs and to address  labor conditions that may be inconsistent with FTA provisions, such as the  conditions identified in DOL\u2019s management reports. For example, agendas  that USTR provided for two meetings of the interagency Subcommittee on  Labor Monitoring and Enforcement list meeting topics but do not detail  expected actions or outcomes; USTR provided no record, beyond a  general description, of what transpired at the meetings or of any intra- agency correspondence following the meetings. Further, during our  interviews with USTR officials, the officials discussed items that the  interagency process had not produced, such as up-to-date assessments of  risk; agreed-on priorities; and formal action plans for partners other than  Colombia, Guatemala, and Jordan. For example, USTR officials indicated  that a previous interagency effort to develop a comprehensive risk-based  approach had been overtaken by events and not revised. DOL officials  indicated that in general, there had been no discussion of cross-agency  resource use  However, our work on best practices in collaboration has  shown that agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts by  engaging in the following eight practices: (1) define and articulate a  common outcome; (2) establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies; (3)  identify and address needs by leveraging resources, (4) agree on roles  and responsibilities; (5) establish compatible policies, procedures, and  other means to operate across agency boundaries; (6) develop  mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; (7) reinforce  agency accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and  reports; and (8) reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts  through performance management systems.", "Comment 12: Our report does not state that USTR should explicitly  accuse partner countries of trade violations in its annual report to  Congress. Our report states that, reflecting in part USTR\u2019s and DOL\u2019s  limited monitoring and enforcement of these provisions, USTR\u2019s annual  report generally does not detail concerns about the implementation of FTA  labor provisions by partner countries that have not been the subject of  labor submissions. Our report also states that appropriate information  resulting from more extensive monitoring and enforcement could help  inform Congress and other U.S. stakeholders about the extent to which  trade partners are fulfilling their FTA labor commitments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kim Frankena (Assistant  Director), Francisco Enriquez (Analyst-in-Charge), Juan P.
