FSIS is not consistently identifying repetitive violations, according to GAO's review of 1,180 noncompliance records for fiscal year 2001. This has occurred, in part, because FSIS has not established specific, uniform, and clearly defined criteria for its inspectors to use in determining when a violation is repetitive. Furthermore, at the district level, FSIS officials' understanding of the criteria to consider in determining if a violation is repetitive varied. Also, in several instances, inspectors have not fully documented the basis for their decisions about repetitive violations on noncompliance records. FSIS is not ensuring that plants take prompt and effective action to return to compliance after a HACCP violation has been identified.

To help address these problems, FSIS stepped up its inspector training and initiated two new review mechanisms:   Food safety systems correlation reviews, which examine a range of inspector practices within FSIS districts to improve the effectiveness of inspections.

When a Salmonella test is scheduled, the FSIS inspector should take one sample each day the plant produces the product until a set is complete, according to FSIS guidance. The number of samples in the set depends on the product and ranges from a low of 51 samples for broiler chickens to a high of 82 samples for steers and heifers. On July 25, 2002, FSIS issued new, more- detailed guidance on actions the agency and plants will take after Salmonella set failures. When a plant fails a first set of Salmonella tests, FSIS will, among other things, notify the plant in writing of the failure and assess the plant\u2019s HACCP procedures. After a second consecutive Salmonella set failure, FSIS will notify the plant that it must reassess its HACCP plan to determine if changes are needed. After the plant completes its reassessment, FSIS will conduct an in-depth verification review, among other things.", "With regard to the zero tolerance standard for visible feces, the FSIS inspector checks a prescribed number of carcasses on each production shift to verify that the plant has successfully eliminated visible fecal contamination.

We also recommended that FSIS review all plants\u2019 HACCP plans to verify that plants identify and control, through their HACCP plans, all food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur. In June 2000 USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General reviewed 57 HACCP plans from 15 plants nationwide and reported that 14 of the plants had at least one incomplete HACCP plan. The report made recommendations to ensure that hazard analyses were complete and all critical control points identified.", "In response to these reports, FSIS implemented the following additional oversight mechanisms:   Food safety systems correlation reviews to improve the effectiveness of FSIS inspection activities.

According to HACCP regulations, repetitive violations indicate that a plant\u2019s HACCP system is inadequate and that an enforcement action may be warranted. An enforcement action can also be taken for a single serious violation. FSIS may take the following types of enforcement actions:   A regulatory control action, which includes the retention of product, rejection of equipment or facilities, slowing or stopping of production lines, or refusal to allow the processing of specifically identified product. This action is considered the least burdensome type of enforcement action and can be initiated by an FSIS inspector to quickly respond to violations that can be easily remedied.", "A withholding action is the inspector\u2019s or district officials\u2019 refusal to allow the USDA marks of inspection to be applied to the product. This action is used for more serious HACCP violations, such as repeated failure to maintain HACCP records adequate for inspectors to determine whether or not a product was adulterated. This action may affect all products in the plant or only those products produced by a particular process. When only a particular process is involved, the plant may continue with its other operations, but it may not distribute the affected product.", "A suspension is an interruption in the assignment of FSIS inspectors and, hence, production, in all or part of a plant.

The plant did not establish a critical control point to address that risk. Instead, it identified USDA inspection activities as the control measure. FSIS regulations require the plant itself to have control measures for all hazards that it identifies as reasonably likely to occur.", "The in-depth verification reviews also showed that some plants may have a fundamental misunderstanding of what constitutes a hazard that is reasonably likely to occur.

For example, in one plant, two inspectors issued noncompliance records documenting three violations over a 15-day period that had the same inspection procedure (slaughter), element of the HACCP system (monitoring), and violation (fecal contamination). One inspector issued the first and second records 5 days apart; the other inspector issued the third record 10 days later. The first inspector did not link the first and second records and determine that the second record was repetitive. However, the inspector who wrote the third record linked it to the two earlier records, and determined that it was repetitive.", "Noncompliance records that contained the same information were not always identified as repetitive, which led to inconsistent action on the same violations and understating the potential seriousness of the problem. For example, on 23 occasions, an inspector in one plant wrote a noncompliance record followed within 2 days by another record containing the same information. However, the inspector linked the first record to the second and determined that the second was repetitive on only one occasion. Inspectors used different time limits in which violations could be linked as repetitive, which may misstate the seriousness of the problem. For example, inspectors at one plant used a calendar month. Violations occurring within the same month could be linked to one another as repetitive, but violations in a subsequent month could not be linked back to incidences in the previous months. Inspectors at another plant used a period of 4 years. At this plant, noncompliance records for some violations were linked as repetitive to as many as 225 other violations. FSIS has not given guidance on an appropriate length of time for linking violations, but for training purposes, it uses a rolling 90-day period as the time limit for linking violations as repetitive, meaning that an inspector would look back 90 days from the date of a violation.", "We also found that when inspectors identified violations as repetitive, they did not consistently document the basis for their decision\u2014the record identification numbers of the previous violations. For example, at one plant, inspectors did not record the identification numbers for 75 percent of the previous repetitive violations, while at another plant, 46 percent of repetitive violations did not have this information. When documentation is lacking, FSIS cannot determine with any confidence the number of times a violation has been repeated and whether it warrants further enforcement action.", "At the district level, we found that officials in the 10 districts where we sampled noncompliance records used varying factors, such as the type of violation (e.g., fecal contamination) or element (e.g., record keeping), that they said should be considered important in determining whether violations were repetitive.

For example, the reports can identify the number and percentage of various HACCP inspection procedures at a plant that resulted in violations related to monitoring. FSIS\u2019s managers told us they considered these reports adequate to identify the potential for a repetitive problem and trigger the need to explore individual noncompliance records to determine if a repetitive problem exists. Consistently and accurately linking repetitive violations is important because FSIS uses repetitive violations as a factor in assessing whether a plant has an effective HACCP system, whether an enforcement action is warranted, and whether the meat or poultry products from that plant are safe for consumers.", "However, the inspection database does not capture summary information on the number of repetitive noncompliance records an inspector issues to a plant, the nature of the repetitive deficiencies, or plant managers\u2019 success or failure in taking effective preventive action. This type of summary information could assist managers in both overseeing inspectors\u2019 performance and plants\u2019 compliance with HACCP requirements. In addition, it could serve as one indicator for considering further enforcement action or for advising industry on the need to address a common problem. For example, managers could oversee inspectors\u2019 performance by comparing inspectors\u2019 rates of identifying repeat violations. If an inspector identified high rates, then a manager could investigate to determine if the inspector proposed or took further enforcement action. If the inspector identified low rates of repetitive violations, but the data showed high numbers of a particular type of violation, then managers could investigate to determine why these inspectors did not identify these as repetitive.", "Managers have some information on repetitive violations, but not in summary format. Inspectors enter information into the database on an electronic version of the noncompliance record. Once entered, FSIS inspectors, supervisors, and managers from almost any location nationwide can review these individual noncompliance records. However, to assess the extent of repetitive violations that a particular inspector identified, a manager or supervisor would need to view every noncompliance record\u2014a cumbersome process. FSIS officials maintain that the individual inspector is responsible for assessing the extent of repetitive violations, making a professional judgment on the need for further enforcement action, and bringing this matter to the attention of managers.

Second, FSIS does not ensure that plants take prompt action to meet the Salmonella performance standard after a second consecutive failure.

However, FSIS inspectors do not consistently initiate enforcement actions in such cases. For example, in the 1,180 noncompliance records we examined at 16 plants, the violation of FSIS\u2019s zero tolerance standard for fecal contamination was the most common type of repetitive violation. Each time an inspector documents this violation, FSIS regulations require the plant to take corrective action to remove the contamination. However, FSIS did not take withholding or suspension enforcement actions at any of the 11 plants where repetitive fecal contamination was identified. For example, FSIS issued 96 noncompliance records to one plant for these violations and although 88 percent of these records were linked as repetitive, FSIS did not initiate a withholding or suspension enforcement action. District officials stated that FSIS did not initiate an enforcement action because the plant had \u201cdone a good job\u201d of addressing violations that were brought to its attention previously and the number of noncompliance records issued to the plant for fecal contamination was \u201cnot out of line\u201d for a large plant. In addition, the officials said that violations of the fecal standard are bound to occur and most of the fecal contamination was minuscule\u2014about one- eighth to one-quarter of an inch in diameter.", "In another case, inspectors issued 154 noncompliance records to a plant for fecal contamination during the fiscal year, and they identified 109 of the deficiencies (71 percent) as repetitive, yet took no withholding or suspension enforcement action. For this plant, an FSIS official told us that the inspector did not recommend enforcement action because, in the inspector\u2019s professional opinion, the findings did not warrant it. However, because fecal matter can harbor serious contaminants, including E. coli 0157: H7, any fecal matter is a potentially serious health risk. FSIS\u2019s zero tolerance standard for visible feces recognizes this risk.", "At plants where FSIS conducted an in-depth verification review, the noncompliance records also indicate that FSIS is not ensuring that plants quickly take effective action to eliminate repetitive violations. For example, at one slaughter plant, over 9-months, FSIS inspectors documented 27 instances of animals presented for slaughter that had levels of antibiotic drug residues that exceeded the amounts allowed by FSIS. On the earliest noncompliance record we reviewed, dated August 2000, the FSIS inspector wrote that the finding of excessive drug residue indicates, \u201cthat there may be an inadequacy in  HACCP plan to control food safety hazards identified in  hazard analysis.\u201d However, it was not until April 2001, 8 months later, that the plant implemented a program designed to prevent drug residues from entering its products.", "FSIS has not established consistent criteria for inspectors to consider when assessing whether repetitive violations warrant a withholding or suspension enforcement action. According to FSIS officials, the decision to pursue an enforcement action is left to the professional judgment of each plant inspector. However, some district officials and inspectors we interviewed indicated that they would benefit from having FSIS identify a uniform set of factors for them to assess when considering whether an enforcement action is warranted. These officials suggested, for example, the length of time between repetitive violations, the number of repetitive noncompliance records issued, the nature of the violations, and the plant\u2019s efforts and/or success in implementing preventive actions.", "FSIS officials told us they recognize the need to establish criteria for assessing whether repetitive violations warrant enforcement action and are in the process of updating a policy directive to include such criteria.

In addition, FSIS has conducted in-depth verification reviews to evaluate the design and implementation of HACCP plans at plants that failed a second set of Salmonella tests. In 2000 and 2001, FSIS conducted in-depth verification reviews at 31 of these plants. In one case, FSIS conducted an in-depth verification review at one plant that had failed three of the past four sets of tests. However, the failure that triggered the review was the first set in a new series. Following the in-depth verification review, 14 plants passed a third set of tests and 5 failed.

About 8 months elapsed from the date of the plant\u2019s response to the reassessment letter until the third set of Salmonella tests began because, according to the district officials, the district did not closely monitor the progress of the changes the plant was making and because the plant requested and received FSIS\u2019s permission to delay the third set until those changes were made.", "Because plants may continue to produce products that could pose a Salmonella risk from the first-set failure until they pass, it is important that the second- and third-set tests be scheduled and completed as soon as possible. An FSIS headquarters official acknowledged that, in some cases, the time between the second and third set of Salmonella tests has been too long. However, the official stated that plants sometimes make significant changes to their operations after an in-depth verification review and the time needed to reassess, modify and validate HACCP plans can be considerable. Nonetheless, in the Dallas district case described above, at least a portion of the delays were due to inattentive oversight by FSIS.

The new office, which began operating on July 15, 2002, will conduct in-depth examinations of FSIS policies to determine if the policies are adequate or if additional actions are needed. The new office began by looking at the Salmonella testing program to determine whether it is accomplishing all it should to protect human health. It expects to report its findings by mid-September 2002.

When a suspension is in abeyance, FSIS inspection services resume, and the plant continues operating while it makes corrections. In analyzing 60 HACCP administrative enforcement case files for 2001 for plants in the Albany, Alameda, and Madison districts, at which FSIS had suspended inspection services, we found that 57 of the 60 suspensions were placed in abeyance. In half of the suspensions that were in abeyance (28 of the 57 cases), FSIS placed the suspension in abeyance on the same day the suspension was issued. Because there was either no or very limited interruption in inspection services at the plant, the effect on the plant, in terms of economic loss or disruption, was negligible.", "On January 24, 2001, FSIS published policy guidance stating that no plant\u2019s suspension should remain in abeyance for more than 90 days without a specific \u201coperational reason,\u201d such as a violation that involved a process that the plant operates intermittently. Limiting the time that suspensions can remain in abeyance was also FSIS\u2019s practice prior to the January 2001 policy notice establishing a specific time frame. Our sample of the 57 enforcement cases included 30 plants that had suspensions in abeyance that were closed after the 90-day policy went into effect in January 2001. Of these 30 enforcement cases, only 1 was closed within 90 days. The average number of days from suspension in abeyance to case closure was 316 days, or over 10 months. According to FSIS officials in charge of enforcement in the three district offices where we reviewed enforcement cases, the 90-day time frame for holding suspensions in abeyance was not met because (1) the district office did not require inspection personnel to report to them on whether the plants had completed their corrective and preventive actions within the 90-day period, (2) it often took longer than 90 days for inspection personnel to inform the district office that plants had completed their corrective and preventive actions and the cases could be closed, and (3) closing these cases was a low priority for the district office.", "Further, none of FSIS\u2019s \u201cNotice of Suspension of Inspection\u201d documents or other correspondence in the enforcement files for the 30 cases we examined specified a date by which corrective actions were expected to be implemented and their effectiveness verified. As long as FSIS does not establish specific deadlines for plants with suspensions in abeyance to correct their problems, plants have little incentive to quickly implement and verify the effectiveness of their corrective actions.", "In addition, we were generally unable to verify that violations were corrected before FSIS issued the letter ending the suspension in abeyance and closing the case. The enforcement case files frequently did not contain evidence showing how and when the district offices determined that the plants had completed corrective and preventive actions. However, in the Albany District Office, 6 of the 21 closed enforcement files contained correspondence from inspection personnel to the district office documenting how and when the plant had corrected the violation and recommending closing the case. An FSIS headquarters official responsible for enforcement activities told us that he would expect to see documentation showing how decisions were reached in all case files.", "Moreover, in the Alameda district office, two of the four plants we reviewed continued to have violations of the same requirements for which the plant was suspended, according to the inspectors\u2019 documentation. Nevertheless, the suspension remained in abeyance, and FSIS did not take any further enforcement action. For example, one suspension that was placed in abeyance on the day it was issued in October 2000 was the result of the plant\u2019s repeated failure to keep adequate HACCP records to verify that critical control points were being properly monitored to ensure food safety. In March 2001, inspectors documented three more instances of the plant\u2019s failure to keep the same type of HACCP records and two more instances in the following months until the case was closed in September 2001.", "FSIS also allows plants to have multiple suspensions in abeyance in effect simultaneously, each for a separate production process, or to have sequential suspensions in abeyance that last for extended periods of time. As a result, a plant can continually struggle to meet requirements and require special regulatory oversight for an extended period of time and yet remain in business. For example, the plant in the Alameda District mentioned above had sequential suspensions placed in abeyance. In October 2001, just 1 month after the earlier suspension was lifted, the district office sent the plant a letter indicating FSIS\u2019s intention to take enforcement action because of the plant\u2019s failure to collect product samples for E. coli testing, as required by the HACCP regulations. On the basis of the plant\u2019s response to the letter, the district office deferred any enforcement action for 90 days. Recognizing that this was a problem plant, in November 2001, the district had a consumer safety officer conduct a comprehensive review of the plant\u2019s HACCP system. Owing to the HACCP design and implementation problems discovered by the consumer safety officer, such as deficiencies in the hazard analysis and record keeping, inspection was again suspended in early December 2001 and the suspension was placed in abeyance 2 days later. In January 2002, because of the plant\u2019s failure to adhere to its October 2001 plan to improve its E. coli sampling procedures, inspection was again suspended and then placed in abeyance 1 day later. Alameda district officials told us they recommended to FSIS headquarters that FSIS withdraw this plant\u2019s grant of inspection and were told that there was insufficient cause to take this action.", "In its August 2, 2002, letter to us, FSIS stated that an administrative enforcement data system, which it implemented in January 2002, \u201cfor distributing copies, tracking status, and querying for information on administrative actions\u201d provides, among other things, \u201cstatus reports  show suspensions in abeyance to assist District Managers in assuring proper follow up at these establishments.\u201d It further stated that it sets \u201cvery specific timelines for the plant to meet with respect to corrective or preventive measures\u201d and that its \u201cin-plant personnel conduct verification activities to ensure they are meeting the conditions outlined in the timeline.

Similarly, FSIS\u2019s practice of placing a plant in suspension but then immediately putting the suspension in abeyance for protracted periods of time negates an important incentive for plants to quickly correct problems. While some corrective actions could take a significant period of time to implement\u2014and placing a suspension in abeyance might be warranted when FSIS is sure that interim actions will provide for food safety\u2014the circumstances should be clearly established and progress closely monitored and documented to ensure that plants are returning to compliance as soon as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that all HACCP plans fully meet regulatory requirements, we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct FSIS to   provide inspectors with additional training on their roles and responsibilities under the HACCP system and use data, such as the results from the food safety system correlation reviews, to help target training to address specific weaknesses;   develop procedures for its field supervisors and district managers to use to monitor inspector activities, including, among other things, ensuring that FSIS inspectors are consistently applying HACCP requirements;   develop a risk-based strategy and time frames for consumer safety officers to complete their reviews of HACCP plans at all plants; and   develop a strategy for its supervisors, managers, and officials to systematically use data, including annual data on noncompliance records by districts, to help oversee plants\u2019 compliance with HACCP requirements.", "To ensure that FSIS inspectors and district officials use consistent criteria for identifying repetitive violations of HACCP regulatory requirements, we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct FSIS to   establish specific, uniform criteria for identifying repetitive violations;   ensure that inspectors consistently document repetitive violations;   modify data management systems to capture the extent to which inspectors are identifying repetitive violations at plants; and   develop a strategy for its supervisors, managers, and officials to systemically use available data, including summary information, to help identify repetitive violations.", "To ensure that plants take prompt actions to correct violations, we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct FSIS to   establish clear, consistent criteria for inspectors to use when considering whether to recommend suspension because of repetitive violations; require its inspectors to document the basis for their decision on whether or not to recommend further enforcement action based upon documented repetitive violations;   develop guidance with specific time frames for actions to be taken at plants that fail a second set of Salmonella tests, including time frames for FSIS to initiate an in-depth verification review, report the results of the review, and initiate a third set of tests;   establish, and document in enforcement case files, time frames for plants with suspensions in abeyance to implement and verify the necessary corrective actions; and   document in the enforcement case file how and when the district office determined that the plant had completed its corrective actions and, if the suspension is allowed to remain in abeyance for more than 90 days, the reason for the extension."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["We provided USDA with a draft of this report for review and comment.

We selected these plants from among those where FSIS frequently found violations in fiscal year 2001. Specifically, we selected our sample from among those plants where 8 percent or more of the time, when FSIS conducted a HACCP inspection, it found a violation. Only about 4 percent of the total plants subject to HACCP inspection met this criterion. We excluded from our sample any plants that are participating in FSIS\u2019s HACCP-Based Inspection Models Project or those that had been subject to an enforcement action. Of the 16 plants we selected, FSIS considers 6 to be large, 7 small, and 3 very small. Ten of the plants we selected were poultry plants and 6 were beef plants. We analyzed all of the HACCP-related noncompliance records provided by FSIS for fiscal year 2001 at these 16 plants\u2014in total 1,180 records\u2014to determine the extent to which inspectors had identified repetitive violations. We interviewed district officials from the 10 district offices to determine the factors they consider important in determining whether violations were repetitive.

Second, we analyzed FSIS\u2019s data on the 31 plants that failed a second set of Salmonella tests and, at which FSIS conducted an in-depth verification review, to identify the time that elapsed between the first, second, and third sets of Salmonella tests. Third, we analyzed the case files for 68 HACCP administrative enforcement cases that were active in fiscal year 2001 from three FSIS districts (Albany, Alameda, Madison).

We also spoke to FSIS headquarters officials about enforcement issues and reviewed FSIS\u2019s policy documents related to HACCP enforcement.", "We conducted our review from August 2001 through August 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the August 26, 2002, letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  USDA believes the report does not fully acknowledge FSIS\u2019s progress and continuous efforts to ensure that all plants meet regulatory requirements. It noted that FSIS has placed significant resources into the processes and systems that provided the data for our study and that FSIS has efforts ongoing to evaluate the same data. Our draft report acknowledges that in response to reports from GAO and USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General, FSIS initiated the food safety systems correlation reviews and in-depth verification reviews and recognizes that these reviews have been useful in identifying problems with HACCP implementation. USDA describes a number of actions that FSIS has recently taken or is planning to take that are consistent with our recommendations. Many of these actions, if fully carried out, may go a long way toward addressing the problems we found in FSIS\u2019s oversight and enforcement of HACCP. However, diligent management attention will be needed to ensure this. 2.  USDA believes that the title of the report is misleading. We disagree.", "We believe the title accurately reflects the concerns detailed throughout the body of the report. 3.  The July 25, 2002, FSIS notice 28-02\u2014Action to Be Taken in Establishments Subject to Salmonella Testing\u2014does not establish specific time frames for actions to be taken at plants that fail a second set of Salmonella tests as we recommend. 4.  While the September 5, 2001, notice 36-01\u2014Rules of Practice\u2014 identifies FSIS\u2019s various enforcement tools and general circumstances in which each type would be appropriate, it does not establish clear, consistent criteria for inspectors to use when considering whether to recommend a suspension as an enforcement action in response to repetitive violations. We are recommending that FSIS do so. 5.  FSIS\u2019s August 9, 2002, notice 29-02\u2014HACCP Verification Procedures and the 30-day Reassessment Letter\u2014addresses our recommendation for the need for additional training for inspectors on their roles and responsibilities. However, FSIS\u2019s efforts to provide training for inspectors on their roles and responsibilities, in response to our previous report recommendation, were not fully effective. We are keeping this recommendation because it is too early to tell whether this effort will be effective. 6.  Our draft report acknowledged that FSIS had established a new office to ensure that its programs and policies are implemented and monitored correctly. While the review of the Salmonella testing program does not directly address any of our recommendations, it may help FSIS to provide inspector training and procedures for field supervisors and district managers to oversee inspector activities\u2014 which we do recommend\u2014with respect to Salmonella requirements. 7.  FSIS directive 5000.1\u2014Enforcement of Regulatory Requirements in Establishments Subject to HACCP System Regulations (including regulations on Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures, E. coli Testing and Criteria, and Salmonella Performance Standards)\u2014should help FSIS address several of our recommendations, including those related to ensuring that all HACCP plans fully meet regulatory requirements and ensuring that plants take prompt actions to correct violations. 8.  FSIS directive 4430.3\u2014In-Plant Performance System (IPPS) Reviews\u2014 should respond to our recommendation regarding procedures to monitor inspector activities. FSIS is planning to implement the new directive and begin training supervisors in October 2002. We are keeping this recommendation to ensure the directive is implemented as planned. 9.  This new interactive computer tool that inspectors, supervisors, and managers can use to strengthen HACCP problem solving using fictional scenarios. It should help FSIS address our recommendations regarding inspector training and supervisor oversight of inspector activities. 10. The draft report acknowledged the budget constraints regarding the hiring of consumer safety officers. 11. FSIS is still testing the PBIS 5.0 and district early warning systems, which should provide useful data for FSIS managers to carry out their HACCP responsibilities. 12. FSIS does not believe that plants are given too much time to comply with regulatory requirements. We disagree. Our review of enforcement case files found that, on average, these cases were closed in 10 months rather than the 3 months (90 days) recommended by FSIS. In addition, while it may be FSIS\u2019s policy to establish specific time frames for plants to make corrective actions, none of the 30 enforcement case files we examined for plants with suspensions in abeyance that were closed after the 90-day policy went into effect contained this information. 13. We were not able to determine whether there has been improvement in the average amount of time it takes FSIS to close HACCP-related suspensions in abeyance because the data FSIS provided us with included suspensions for both sanitation violations as well as those for HACCP violations. In addition, when they are closed, it is not known how the unspecified number of cases that currently remain open will affect the average closure time. 14. We did not question the appropriateness of plants having multiple suspensions. Rather, we questioned the appropriateness of placing suspensions in abeyance at plants that have had repeated problems or multiple problems. The examples cited in our report involved (1) a plant suspension that remained in abeyance even though the plant continued to violate the same requirements for which it had been originally suspended and (2) a plant that had multiple sequential suspensions placed in abeyance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Leo G.
