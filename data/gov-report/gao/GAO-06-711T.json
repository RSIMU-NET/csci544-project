The UN allowed Iraq to control contract negotiations for imported commodities with little oversight, enabling the regime to obtain illicit funds through surcharges and kickbacks. The UN did not take steps to address the economic impact that the sanctions had on countries that depended on Iraqi trade, which undermined international support for sanctions and allowed Iraq to smuggle oil outside the Oil for Food program. Overall, the sanctions were effective in helping to prevent the Iraq regime from obtaining military items, but the UN was less rigorous in overseeing economic activities such as monitoring the price and value of Iraq's contracts. The UN's neglect of Iraq's illicit revenue streams helped support a sanctioned regime and undermined the goals of using oil revenues to benefit the Iraqi people. The UN did not adequately address key internal control elements as it implemented the Oil for Food program. First, UN entities lacked clear lines of authority. For example, the Office of the Iraq Program lacked clear authority for rejecting commodity contracts based on pricing concerns. In addition, the customs contractor at Iraq's border was not authorized to evaluate imports for price and quality. Second, the UN did not assess emerging risks as the Oil for Food program expanded from a 6-month emergency measure to deliver food and medicine to a 6-year program providing more than $31 billion to 24 economic sectors. Third, some monitoring activities constrained Iraq's ability to obtain illicit oil surcharges, but smuggling continued despite the presence of inspectors. In addition, the UN's internal audit office identified hundreds of weaknesses and irregularities in its reports. However, it lacked the resources and independence to provide effective oversight of this costly and complex UN effort. The Oil for Food program offers several lessons for designing future sanctions and strengthening existing UN programs: assess whether the sanctions program gives undue control to the sanctioned country; consider the economic impact that sanctions have on neighboring countries; ensure that all aspects of sanctions are equally enforced; establish clear authority and responsibility for management, oversight, and monitoring activities; assess and mitigate risk as programs and funding expand; and assess the role of internal oversight units and ensure that they have the resources and independence needed for effective oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the lessons learned from the  United Nations (UN) Oil for Food program and the implications for future  sanctions programs and ongoing UN reform efforts.", "In 1996, the UN and Iraq began the Oil for Food program to address  growing concerns about Iraq\u2019s humanitarian situation after international  sanctions were imposed in 1990. The intent of the program was to allow  the Iraq government to use the proceeds of its oil sales to pay for food,  medicine, and infrastructure maintenance and, at the same time, prevent  the regime from obtaining goods for military purposes. Iraq obtained more  than $67 billion in oil revenues through the program; as of November 2003,  about $31 billion in commodities and humanitarian assistance had been  delivered to Iraq. Four key entities were responsible for most of the  program\u2019s operations\u2014the Security Council\u2019s Iraq sanctions committee,  the UN Secretariat\u2019s Office of the Iraq Program, nine UN agencies with  separate programs in northern Iraq, and the Iraqi government under  Saddam Hussein.", "The 2005 Defense Authorization Act mandated that GAO review the Oil for  Food program following allegations of corruption and misconduct.

Today, I will discuss (1) the control environment established by the UN for  managing the sanctions and Oil for Food program; (2) other key internal  control elements addressed by the UN, including lines of authority and  responsibility, risk assessment, and monitoring and oversight; and (3) our  observations on the lessons learned from the Oil for Food program. To  address these objectives, we used the body of work that GAO has  completed on Iraq sanctions, the Oil for Food program, and UN oversight  issues.", "Policymakers and program managers are continually seeking ways to  better achieve agencies\u2019 missions and program results and improve  accountability for results. A key factor in helping to achieve such  outcomes is appropriate internal control, which, if properly designed and  implemented, provide reasonable assurance that objectives are being met.  Internal controls also serve as the first line of defense in safeguarding  assets and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.

Several  countries in the region depended on Iraqi trade, but no provisions were  made to address the economic impact of the sanctions on these countries.  This undermined international support for sanctions and allowed Iraq to  smuggle oil outside the Oil for Food program. The sanctions helped  prevent the Iraq regime from obtaining prohibited military and dual-use  items, but little attention was given to oversight of the economic activities  related to the Oil for Food program, such as monitoring the price and  value of Iraq\u2019s contracts.

At that time, the Secretary General proposed that the  UN, an independent agent, or the Iraqi government be given the  responsibility to negotiate contracts with oil purchasers and commodity  suppliers. However, the Secretary General subsequently concluded that it  would be highly unusual or impractical for the UN or an independent  agent to trade Iraq\u2019s oil or purchase commodities and recommended that  Iraq negotiate the contracts and select the contractors. Nonetheless, he  stated that the UN and Security Council must ensure that Iraq\u2019s  contracting did not circumvent the sanctions and was not fraudulent.  Accordingly, the Security Council proposed that UN agents review the  contracts and compliance at the oil ministry. Iraq refused these conditions.", "By the mid-1990s, the humanitarian conditions had worsened. The UN  reported that the average Iraqi\u2019s food intake was about 1,275 calories per  day, compared with the standard requirement of 2,100 calories. In April  1995, the Security Council passed resolution 986 to permit Iraq to use its  oil sales to finance humanitarian assistance. Against a backdrop of  pressure to maintain sanctions while addressing emergency humanitarian  needs, the UN conceded to Iraq\u2019s demand that it retain independent  control over contract negotiations. Accordingly, a May 1996 memorandum  of understanding between the UN and Iraq allowed Iraq to directly tender  and negotiate contracts without UN oversight and to distribute imported  goods to the intended recipients.", "When the Oil for Food program began, the UN was responsible for  confirming the equitable distribution of commodities, ensuring the  effectiveness of program operations, and determining Iraq\u2019s humanitarian  needs. According to the memorandum of understanding, the Iraqi  government was to provide UN observers with full cooperation and access  to distribution activities. However, observers faced intimidation and  restrictions from Iraqi regime officials in carrying out their duties.  According to a former UN official, observers could not conduct random  spot checks and had to rely on distribution information provided by  ministry officials, who then steered them to specific locations. The  Independent Inquiry Committee reported that observers were required to  have government escorts and cited various instances of intimidation and  interference by Iraqi officials. The committee concluded that the limits  placed on the observers\u2019 ability to ask questions and gather information  affected the UN Secretariat\u2019s ability to provide complete field reports to  the sanctions committee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UN Did Not Address the Economic Impact of Sanctions on Member Countries", "paragraphs": ["Under Security Council resolutions, all member states had the  responsibility for enforcing sanctions. For Iraq, the UN depended on  neighboring countries to deter the importation of illicit commodities and  smuggling. However, concessions to regional trade activity affected the  sanctions environment and allowed the Iraqi regime to obtain revenues  outside the Oil for Food program. Although oil sales outside the program  were prohibited, the Security Council\u2019s Iraq sanctions committee did not  address pre-existing trade between Iraq and other member states, and no  provisions were made for countries that relied heavily on trade with Iraq.  Illicit oil sales were primarily conducted on the basis of formal trade  agreements. For example, trade agreements with Iraq allowed Jordan\u2014a  U.S. ally dependent on Iraqi trade\u2014to purchase heavily discounted oil in  exchange for up to $300 million in Jordanian goods. Members of the  sanctions committee, including the United States, took note of Iraq\u2019s illicit  oil sales to its neighbors, but took no direct action to halt the sales or take  steps against the states or entities engaged in them. In addition, successive  U.S. administrations issued annual waivers to Congress exempting Turkey  and Jordan from unilateral U.S. sanctions for violating the UN sanctions  against Iraq.", "According to U.S. government officials and oil industry experts, Iraq  smuggled oil through several routes. Oil entered Syria by pipeline, crossed  the borders of Jordan and Turkey by truck, and was smuggled through the  Persian Gulf by ship. Syria received up to 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day  in violation of the sanctions. Oil smuggling also occurred through Iran. The  Security Council authorized the Multinational Interception Force in the  Persian Gulf, but, according to the Department of Defense, it interdicted  only about 25 percent of the oil smuggled through the Gulf."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sanctions Enforcement Focused on Military Items, but Less Rigorous Oversight for Economic Activities Facilitated Iraq\u2019s Ability to Obtain Illicit Revenues", "paragraphs": ["The UN\u2019s focus on screening military and dual-use items was largely  effective in constraining Iraq\u2019s ability to import these goods through the  Oil for Food program. Each member of the Security Council\u2019s Iraq  sanctions committee had authority to approve, hold, or block any contract  for goods exported to Iraq. The United States, as a member of the  committee, devoted resources to conducting a review of each commodity  contract. As a result, the United States was the Security Council member  that most frequently placed holds on proposed sales to Iraq; as of May  2002, it was responsible for about 90 percent of the holds placed by the  Security Council. U.S. technical experts assessed each item in a contract  to determine its potential military application and whether the item was  appropriate for the intended end user. These experts also examined the  end user\u2019s track record with such commodities. An estimated 60 U.S.  government personnel within the Departments of State, Defense, Energy,  and other agencies examined all proposed sales of items that could be  used to assist the Iraqi military or develop weapons of mass destruction. In  addition, the Department of the Treasury was responsible for issuing U.S.  export licenses to Iraq. It compiled the results of the review by U.S.  agencies under the UN approval process and obtained input from the  Department of Commerce on whether a contract included any items found  on a list of goods prohibited for export to Iraq for reasons of national  security or nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation.", "In addition to screening items imported by Iraq, the UN conducted  weapons inspections inside Iraq until 1998, when international inspectors  were forced to withdraw. Sanctions also may have constrained Iraq\u2019s  purchases of conventional weapons, as we reported in 2002. In 2004, the  Iraq Survey Group reported that sanctions had curbed Iraq\u2019s ability to  import weapons and finance its military, intelligence, and security forces.", "The UN\u2019s neglect of Iraq\u2019s illicit revenue streams from smuggling and  kickbacks facilitated unauthorized revenue for a sanctioned regime and  undermined the program\u2019s goal of using Iraqi oil revenues to benefit the  Iraqi people. According to a report by Department of Defense contract  experts, in a typical contract pricing environment, fair and reasonable  commodity prices are generally based on prevailing world market  conditions or competitive bids among multiple suppliers. Ensuring a fair  and reasonable price for goods can mitigate the possibility of overpricing  and kickbacks. The Security Council\u2019s Iraq sanctions committee and the  Secretariat\u2019s Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) were responsible for  reviewing commodity contracts under the Oil for Food program, but  neither entity conducted sufficient reviews of commodity pricing and  value.

The Iraq government, other UN  agencies, UN member states, the interdiction force in the Persian Gulf,  inspection contractors, and internal and external audit offices also played  specific roles (see figure 1). However, no single entity was accountable for  the program in its entirety. In 2005, the Independent Inquiry Committee  reported that the Security Council had failed to clearly define the  program\u2019s broad parameters, policies, and administrative responsibilities  and that neither the Security Council nor the Secretariat had control over  the entire program.", "The absence of clear lines of authority and responsibility were important  structural weaknesses that further undermined the management and  oversight of the Oil for Food program. For example, OIP was to examine  each commodity contract for price and value before submitting it to the  sanctions committee for approval. However, the Independent Inquiry  Committee found that OIP lacked clear authority to reject contracts on  pricing grounds and did not hire customs experts with the requisite  expertise to conduct thorough pricing evaluations. In addition, UN  inspectors did not have the authority to inspect goods imported into Iraq  to verify price and quality. These inspectors mostly verified the arrival of  goods in the country for the purpose of paying the contractor.", "The Secretariat\u2019s contract for inspecting imports at three entry points in  Iraq required inspection agents to \u201cauthenticate\u201d goods, but the agents\u2019  responsibilities fell short of a more rigorous review of the imports\u2019 price  and quality. Under the Oil for Food program, inspection agents compared  appropriate documentation, including UN approval letters, with the  commodities arriving in Iraq; visually inspected about 7 to 10 percent of  the goods; and tested food items to ensure that they were \u201cfit for human  consumption.\u201d However, inspection agents were not required to (1) verify  that food items were of the quality contracted, (2) assess the value of  goods shipped, (3) inspect goods that were not voluntarily presented by  transporters, or (4) select the items and suppliers or negotiate contracts.  In addition, no provisions were made to interdict prohibited goods arriving  at the border. According to Cotecna, the inspections contractor from 1999  to 2004, \u201cauthentication\u201d is not a standard customs term or function. The  UN created the term for the Oil for Food program and did not include  traditional customs inspection activities, such as price verification and  quality inspection. In anticipation of an oil for food program, the UN  selected Cotecna in 1992 for a program that was never implemented.  Under that proposal, Cotecna would have verified fair pricing and  inspected the quality of the items to help ensure that they conformed to  contract requirements.", "Finally, limited authority for contractors overseeing oil exports facilitated  Iraq\u2019s ability to obtain illicit revenues from smuggling that ranged from  $5.7 billion to $8.4 billion over the course of the Oil for Food program. In  1996, the Secretariat contracted with Saybolt to oversee the export of oil  from Iraq through selected export points. The inspectors were to monitor  the amount of oil leaving Iraq under the Oil for Food program at these  locations and to stop shipments if they found irregularities. The inspectors  worked at two locations\u2014the Ceyhan-Zakho pipeline between Iraq and  Turkey and the Mina al-Bakr loading platform in southern Iraq. In 2005, a  Saybolt official testified that its mandate did not include monitoring all oil  exports leaving Iraq from other locations or acting as a police force.

The Oil for Food program  expanded rapidly as it evolved from an emergency 6-month measure to  provide humanitarian needs to a 6-year program that delivered about   $31 billion in commodities and services in 24 sectors. Beginning in 1998,  when the international community was not satisfied with Iraq\u2019s  compliance with weapons inspections, the Security Council continued the  sanctions and expanded its initial emphasis on food and medicines to  include infrastructure rehabilitation and activities in 14 sectors. These  sectors included food, food handling, health, nutrition, electricity,  agriculture and irrigation, education, transport and telecommunications,  water and sanitation, housing, settlement rehabilitation for internally  displaced persons, demining, a special allocation for vulnerable groups,  and oil industry spare parts and equipment. In June 2002, the Iraqi  government introduced another 10 sectors, including construction,  industry, labor and social affairs, youth and sports, information, culture,  religious affairs, justice, finance, and the Central Bank of Iraq.", "The Security Council and UN Secretariat did not assess the risks posed by  this expansion, particularly in light of the fact that they had allowed the  Iraqi government to tender and negotiate its contracts. The UN Office of  Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was the only entity that attempted to  assess the enormous risks in the Oil for Food program, but OIP blocked  that attempt. In August 2000, the Under Secretary General for OIOS  proposed an overall risk assessment to the Deputy Secretary General to  improve the program by identifying the factors that could prevent  management from fulfilling the program\u2019s objectives. The proposal noted  that this assessment could be a model for other UN departments and  activities. OIOS considered the Oil for Food program a high-risk activity  and decided to focus on an assessment of OIP\u2019s Program Management  Division. This unit was responsible for providing policy and management  advice to OIP\u2019s executive director and for supporting OIP\u2019s field  implementation and observation duties.

However, by this date, the UN was  preparing for the November 2003 transfer of the program to the Coalition  Provisional Authority in Iraq, and the report was of limited usefulness for  addressing high-risk areas. Comprehensive and timely risk assessments  might have identified the internal control weaknesses\u2014such as inadequate  contract pricing reviews\u2014that facilitated Iraq\u2019s ability to levy illicit  contract revenues. These assessments also might have identified the  structural management weaknesses that led to ineffective communication  and coordination within the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oil Export Monitoring Activities Did Not Deter Smuggling but Did Mitigate Contract Surcharges", "paragraphs": ["Ongoing monitoring and specific control activities should meet the  management and oversight needs of the agency or program.

He also testified that the lack of metering equipment allowed the two  \u201ctopping off\u201d incidents involving the oil tanker Essex, in which the tanker  loaded additional oil after the inspectors had certified the loading and left  the vessel. In November 2001, a Saybolt representative noted that Iraq\u2019s  distribution plans for that period provided for the installation of a meter at  the Mina al-Bakr port. A U.S. official called for OIP to develop a plan to  prevent unauthorized oil sales that would include installing a meter at the  port. However, Iraq did not tender a contract for the meter. As of March  2006, the Iraqi government has not yet installed oil meters at Mina al-Bakr.", "In addition, the sanctions committee relied on the advice of independent  oil overseers to approve oil sales contracts. The overseers reviewed Iraq\u2019s  oil sales contracts to determine compliance with program requirements  and whether the prices that Iraq negotiated for its oil were fair and  reflected market pricing. However, the inadequate number of overseers  monitoring Iraq\u2019s oil pricing over a 14-month period may have been a  factor in Iraq\u2019s ability to levy illicit surcharges on oil contracts. From June  1999 to August 2000, only one oil overseer was responsible for monitoring  billions in Iraq\u2019s oil transactions, contrary to the sanctions committee\u2019s  requirements for at least four overseers. Four overseers were hired at the  beginning of the program but three resigned by June 1999. Political  disputes among sanctions committee members prevented the committee  from agreeing on replacements. According to the Independent Inquiry  Committee, the sanctions committee demonstrated weak program  oversight in its inability to fill the vacant positions.", "In contrast, in October 2001, the Security Council\u2019s sanctions committee  imposed a positive control activity\u2014retroactive oil pricing\u2014to prevent  Iraqi officials from adding illegal oil surcharges to contracts. In November  2000, UN oil overseers reported that Iraq\u2019s oil prices were low and did not  reflect the fair market value. The overseers also reported in December  2000 that Iraq had asked oil purchasers to pay surcharges. In early 2001,  the United States informed the sanctions committee about its concerns  regarding allegations that Iraqi government officials were receiving illegal  surcharges on oil contracts. The United States delayed oil pricing until  after the Iraq government signed contracts with oil purchasers but without  knowing the price it would have to pay until delivery. Setting the price at  the time the oil was delivered helped to ensure a fair market price. This  practice, known as retroactive pricing, curbed the ability of the Iraqi  government to levy illicit surcharges on its oil sales contracts. Prior to  retroactive pricing, estimates of Iraq\u2019s illicit revenues from surcharges on  exported oil ranged from about $230 million to almost $900 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UN Internal Audit Office Lacked Sufficient Resources and Independence to Provide Effective Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Ongoing monitoring of internal control should include activities to help  ensure that the findings of audits and other evaluations are promptly  resolved.
