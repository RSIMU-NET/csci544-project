To obtain an understanding of the government's implementation of these key IT management policies, congressional requesters asked GAO to determine the extent to which 26 major agencies have in place practices associated with key legislative and other requirements for (1) IT strategic planning/ performance measurement and (2) IT investment management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies' use of 12 IT strategic planning/performance measurement practices--identified based on legislation, policy, and guidance--is uneven. For example, agencies generally have IT strategic plans and goals, but these goals are not always linked to specific performance measures that are tracked. Without enterprisewide performance measures that are tracked against actual results, agencies lack critical information about whether their overall IT activities are achieving expected goals. Agencies' use of 18 IT investment management practices that GAO identified is also mixed. For example, the agencies largely have IT investment management boards, but no agency had the practices associated with the control phase fully in place. Executive-level oversight of project-level management activities provides organizations with increased assurance that each investment will achieve the desired cost, benefit, and schedule results. Agencies cited a variety of reasons for not having practices fully in place, such as that the chief information officer position had been vacant, that not including a requirement in guidance was an oversight, and that the process was being revised, although they could not always provide an explanation. Regardless of the reason, these practices are important ingredients for ensuring effective strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment management, which, in turn, make it more likely that the billions of dollars in government IT investments are wisely spent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the President\u2019s most recent budget, the federal government  spends billions of dollars annually on information technology (IT)\u2014 reportedly investing about $50 billion in fiscal year 2002 and expecting to  invest about $60 billion in fiscal year 2004. Despite this substantial  investment, the government\u2019s management of information resources has  produced mixed results. Although agencies have taken constructive steps  to implement modern strategies, systems, and management policies and  practices, our most recent high-risk and performance and accountability  series identified continuing high-risk system modernization efforts and  governmentwide information and technology management challenges.", "For years, the Congress has been working to increase the effectiveness of  information and technology management in the federal government by  passing legislation and providing oversight. For example, the Paperwork  Reduction Act of 1995 applied life-cycle management principles to  information and technology management and required that agencies  indicate in strategic information resources management (IRM) plans how  they are applying information resources to improve the productivity,  efficiency, and effectiveness of government programs. The Clinger-Cohen  Act of 1996 amended the Paperwork Reduction Act, establishing agency  chief information officers (CIO) who report directly to the agency head and  are responsible for information resources management activities. Among  other things, the Clinger-Cohen Act also (1) required senior executive  involvement in IT decision making and (2) imposed much-needed  discipline in acquiring and managing technology resources.", "To obtain a broad view of the government\u2019s implementation of key IT  management, you requested that we determine the extent to which  agencies have in place practices associated with key legislative and other  requirements for (1) IT strategic planning/performance measurement and  (2) IT investment management. To address these objectives, we identified  and reviewed major legislative requirements and executive orders  pertaining to IT strategic planning/performance measurement, which  defines what an organization seeks to accomplish, identifies the strategies  it will use to achieve desired results, and then determines\u2014through  measurement\u2014how well it is succeeding in reaching results-oriented goals  and achieving objectives; and IT investment management, which involves  selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments. Specifically, we  identified 30 important IT management practices in these areas using  legislative requirements, such as the Paperwork Reduction Act and the  Clinger-Cohen Act, and policy and guidance issued by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and GAO.

For example, electronic  government (e-government) has the potential to help build better  relationships between government and the public by facilitating timely and  efficient interaction with citizens. To help the agencies more effectively  manage IT, the Congress has established a statutory framework of  requirements and roles and responsibilities relating to information and  technology management. Nevertheless, the agencies face significant  challenges in effectively planning for and managing their IT. Such  challenges can be overcome through the use of a systematic and robust  management approach that addresses critical elements, such as IT  strategic planning and investment management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government\u2019s Statutory Framework for Information and Technology Management", "paragraphs": ["The Congress established a statutory framework to help address the  information and technology management challenges that agencies face.  Under this framework, agencies are accountable for effectively and  efficiently developing, acquiring, and using IT in their organizations. In  particular, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act  of 1996 require agency heads, acting through agency CIOs, to, among other  things,  better link their IT planning and investment decisions to program   develop and maintain a strategic IRM plan that describes how IRM  activities help accomplish agency missions;  develop and maintain an ongoing process to establish goals for  improving IRM\u2019s contribution to program productivity, efficiency, and  effectiveness; methods for measuring progress toward these goals; and  clear roles and responsibilities for achieving these goals;  develop and implement a sound IT architecture;  implement and enforce IT management policies, procedures, standards,   establish policies and procedures for ensuring that IT systems provide  reliable, consistent, and timely financial or program performance data;  and  implement and enforce applicable policies, procedures, standards, and  guidelines on privacy, security, disclosure, and information sharing.", "Moreover, under the government\u2019s current legislative framework, OMB has  important responsibilities for providing direction on governmentwide  information and technology management and overseeing agency activities  in these areas. Among OMB\u2019s responsibilities are  ensuring agency integration of IRM plans, program plans, and budgets  for the acquisition and use of IT and the efficiency and effectiveness of  interagency IT initiatives;  developing and maintaining a governmentwide strategic IRM plan;  developing, as part of the budget process, a mechanism for analyzing,  tracking, and evaluating the risks and results of all major capital  investments made by an executive agency for information systems; directing and overseeing the implementation of policy, principles,  standards, and guidelines for the dissemination of and access to public  information;  encouraging agency heads to develop and use best practices in IT   developing and overseeing the implementation of privacy and security  policies, principles, standards, and guidelines.", "Further, in 2002, the Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation  intended to improve the collection, use, and dissemination of government  information and to strengthen information security. Specifically, Public  Law 107-347, the E-Government Act of 2002, which was enacted in  December 2002, includes provisions to promote the use of the Internet and  other information technologies to provide government services  electronically. The E-Government Act also contains the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, which replaced  and strengthened the Government Information Security Reform legislative  provisions (commonly referred to as \u201cGISRA\u201d). Among other provisions,  FISMA requires each agency, including national security agencies, to (1)  establish an agencywide risk-based information security program to be  overseen by the agency CIO and ensure that information security is  practiced throughout the life cycle of each agency system; and (2) develop,  maintain, and annually update an inventory of major information systems  (including major national security systems) operated by the agency or  under its control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal IT Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Even with the framework laid out by the Congress, the federal government  faces enduring IT challenges. Specifically, in January 2003, we reported on  a variety of challenges facing federal agencies in continuing to take  advantage of the opportunities presented by IT. Unless and until the  challenges outlined below are overcome, federal agencies are unlikely to  optimize their use of IT, which can affect an organization\u2019s ability to  effectively and efficiently implement its programs and missions.", "Pursuing opportunities for e-government. E-government offers many  opportunities to better serve the public, make government more  efficient and effective, and reduce costs. Federal agencies have  implemented a wide array of e-government applications, including using  the Internet to collect and disseminate information and forms; buy and  pay for goods and services; submit bids and proposals; and apply for  licenses, grants, and benefits. Although substantial progress has been  made, the government has not yet fully reached its potential in this area.  Recognizing this, a key element of the President\u2019s Management Agenda  is the expansion of e-government to enhance access to information and  services, particularly through the Internet. In response, OMB  established a task force that selected a strategic set of initiatives to lead  this expansion. Our review of the initial planning projects associated  with these initiatives found that important aspects\u2014such as  collaboration and customer focus\u2014had not been thought out for all of  the projects and that major uncertainties in funding and milestones  were not uncommon. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB take  steps as overseer of the e-government initiatives to reduce the risk that  the projects would not meet their objectives.", "Improving the collection, use, and dissemination of government  information. The rapid evolution of IT is creating challenges in  managing and preserving electronic records. Complex electronic  records are increasingly being created in a decentralized environment  and in volumes that make it difficult to organize them and make them  accessible. Further, storage media themselves are affected by the dual  problems of obsolescence and deterioration. These problems are  compounded as computer hardware and application software become  obsolete, since they may leave behind electronic records that can no  longer be read. Overall responsibility for the government\u2019s electronic  records lies with the National Archives and Records Administration  (NARA). Our past work has shown that while NARA has taken some  action to respond to the challenges associated with managing and  preserving electronic records, most electronic records remain  unscheduled; that is, their value had not been assessed and their  disposition had not been determined. In addition, records of historical  value were not being identified and provided to NARA; as a result, they  were at risk of being lost. We recommended that NARA develop  strategies for raising agency management\u2019s awareness of the importance  of records management and for performing systematic inspections. In  July 2003 we testified that although NARA has made progress in  addressing these issues, more work remains to be done.", "The growth of electronic information\u2014as well as the security threats  facing our nation\u2014are also highlighting privacy issues. For example,  online privacy has emerged as one of the key\u2014and most contentious\u2014 issues surrounding the continued evolution of the Internet. In addition,  our survey of 25 departments and agencies about their implementation  of the Privacy Act\u2014which regulates how federal agencies may use the  personal information that individuals supply when obtaining  government services or fulfilling obligations\u2014found that a key  characteristic of the agencies\u2019 2,400 systems of records is that an  estimated 70 percent contained electronic records. Our survey also  found that although compliance with Privacy Act provisions and  related OMB guidance was generally high in many areas, according to  agency reports, it was uneven across the federal government. To  improve agency compliance and address issues reported by the  agencies, we made recommendations to OMB, such as to direct  agencies to correct compliance deficiencies, to monitor agency  compliance, and to reassess its guidance.", "Strengthening information security. Since September 1996, we have  reported that poor information security is a high-risk area across the  federal government with potentially devastating consequences.  Although agencies have taken steps to redesign and strengthen their  information system security programs, our analyses of information  security at major federal agencies have shown that federal systems were  not being adequately protected from computer-based threats. Our latest  analyses of audit reports published from October 2001 through October  2002 continue to show significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that put critical operations and assets at risk. In addition, in  June 2003 we testified that agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2002 reports and  evaluations required by GISRA found that many agencies have not  implemented security requirements for most of their systems, such as  performing risk assessments and testing controls. In addition, the  usefulness of agency corrective action plans may be limited when they  do not identify all weaknesses or contain realistic completion dates.", "One of the most serious problems currently facing the government is  cyber critical infrastructure protection, which is protecting the information systems that support the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures,  such as national defense and power distribution. Since the September  11 attacks, warnings of the potential for terrorist cyber attacks against  our critical infrastructures have increased. In addition, as greater  amounts of money are transferred through computer systems, as more  sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities  increasingly rely on commercially available information technology, the  likelihood increases that information attacks will threaten vital national  interests. Among the critical infrastructure protection challenges the  government faces are (1) developing a national critical infrastructure  protection strategy, (2) improving analysis and warning capabilities,  and (3) improving information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities.  For each of the challenges, improvements have been made and  continuing efforts are in progress, but much more is needed to address  them. In particular, we have identified and made numerous  recommendations over the last several years concerning critical  infrastructure challenges that still need to be addressed. As a result of  our concerns in this area, we have expanded our information security  high-risk area to include cyber critical infrastructure protection.", "Constructing and enforcing sound enterprise architectures. Our  experience with federal agencies has shown that attempts to modernize  IT environments without blueprints\u2014models simplifying the  complexities of how agencies operate today, how they want to operate  in the future, and how they will get there\u2014often result in unconstrained  investment and systems that are duplicative and ineffective. Enterprise  architectures offer such blueprints. Our reports on the federal  government\u2019s use of enterprise architectures in both February 2002 and  November 2003 found that agencies\u2019 use of enterprise architectures was  a work in progress, with much to be accomplished. Nevertheless,  opportunities exist to significantly improve this outlook if OMB were to  adopt a governmentwide, structured, and systematic approach to  promoting enterprise architecture use, measuring agency progress, and  identifying and pursuing governmentwide solutions to common  enterprise architecture challenges that agencies face. Accordingly, we  made recommendations to OMB to address these areas.", "Employing IT system and service management practices. Our work  and other best-practice research have shown that applying rigorous  practices to the acquisition or development of IT systems or the  acquisition of IT services improves the likelihood of success. In other  words, the quality of IT systems and services is governed largely by the  quality of the processes involved in developing or acquiring each. For  example, using models and methods that define and determine  organizations\u2019 software-intensive systems process maturity that were  developed by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering  Institute, which is recognized for its expertise in software processes, we  evaluated several agencies\u2019 software development or acquisition  processes. We found that agencies are not consistently using rigorous or  disciplined system management practices. We have made numerous  recommendations to agencies to improve their management processes,  and they have taken, or plan to take, actions to improve. Regarding IT  services acquisition, we identified leading commercial practices for  outsourcing IT services that government entities could use to enhance  their acquisition of IT services.", "Using effective agency IT investment management practices.", "Investments in IT can have a dramatic impact on an organization\u2019s  performance. If managed effectively, these investments can vastly  improve government performance and accountability. If not, however,  they can result in wasteful spending and lost opportunities for  improving delivery of services to the public.

For example, strong strategic planning is focused on using IT  to help accomplish the highest priority customer needs and mission goals,  while effective performance measurement helps determine the success or  failure of IT activities. Finally, IT investment management provides a  systematic method for minimizing risks while maximizing the return on  investments and involves a process for selecting, controlling, and  evaluating investments.

Strategic planning defines what an  organization seeks to accomplish and identifies the strategies it will use  to achieve desired results. A defined strategic planning process allows  an agency to clearly articulate its strategic direction and to establish  linkages among planning elements such as goals, objectives, and  strategies.", "About half of the agencies fully documented their strategic planning  processes. For example, the General Services Administration (GSA)  documented an IT governance structure that addresses the roles and  responsibilities of various organizations in strategic planning and  investment management. In addition, in its IT strategic plan, GSA  describes how it developed the plan, including its vision, business- related priorities, and goals. In contrast, the Department of Agriculture  has not completely documented its IT strategic planning process or  integrated its IT management operations and decisions with other  agency processes. According to Agriculture IT officials, the  department\u2019s ongoing budget and performance integration initiative is  expected to result in a more clearly defined and integrated IT strategic  management planning process. Such a process provides the essential  foundation for ensuring that IT resources are effectively managed.", "Strategic IRM plans. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that  agencies indicate in strategic IRM plans how they are applying  information resources to improve the productivity, efficiency, and  effectiveness of government programs. An important element of a  strategic plan is that it presents an integrated system of high-level  decisions that are reached through a formal, visible process. The plan is  thus an effective tool with which to communicate the mission and  direction to stakeholders. In addition, a strategic IRM plan that  communicates a clear and comprehensive vision for how the agency will  use information resources to improve agency performance is important  because IRM encompasses virtually all aspects of an agency\u2019s  information activities.", "Although the Paperwork Reduction Act also requires agencies to  develop IRM plans in accordance with OMB\u2019s guidance, OMB does not  provide cohesive guidance on the specific contents of IRM plans. OMB  Circular A-130 directs that agencies have IRM plans that support  agency strategic plans, provide a description of how IRM helps  accomplish agency missions, and ensure that IRM decisions are  integrated with organizational planning, budgets, procurement,  financial management, human resources management, and program  decisions. However, Circular A-130 does not provide overall guidance  on the plan\u2019s contents. As a result, although agencies generally  provided OMB with a variety of planning documents to meet its  requirement that they submit an IRM plan, these plans were generally  limited to IT strategic or e-government issues and did not address other  elements of IRM, as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act.  Specifically, these plans generally include individual IT projects and  initiatives, security, and enterprise architecture elements but do not  often address other information functions, such as information  collection, records management, and privacy, or the coordinated  management of all information functions.", "OMB IT staff agreed that the agency has not set forth guidance on the  contents of agency IRM plans in a single place, stating that its focus has  been on looking at agencies\u2019 cumulative results and not on planning  documents. In addition, these staff also noted that agencies account for  their IRM activities through multiple documents (e.g., Information  Collection Budgets and Government Paperwork Elimination Act  plans). However, the OMB IT staff stated that they would look at  whether more guidance is needed to help agencies in their development  of IRM plans, but have not yet made a commitment to provide such  guidance. Half the agencies indicated a need for OMB to provide  additional guidance on the development and content of IRM plans.", "Strong agency strategic IRM plans could also provide valuable input to  a governmentwide IRM plan, which is also required by the Paperwork  Reduction Act. As we reported last year, although OMB designated the  CIO Council\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2001-2002 as the  governmentwide strategic IRM plan, it does not constitute an effective  and comprehensive strategic vision. Accordingly, we recommended  that OMB develop and implement a governmentwide strategic IRM plan  that articulates a comprehensive federal vision and plan for all aspects  of government information. In April 2003, we testified that OMB had  taken a number of actions that demonstrate progress in fulfilling the  Paperwork Reduction Act\u2019s requirement of providing a unifying IRM  vision. However, more remains to be done. In particular, we reported  that although OMB\u2019s strategies and models are promising, their ability  to reduce paperwork burden and accomplish other objectives depends  on how OMB implements them.", "One element required by the Clinger-Cohen Act to be included in  agency IRM plans is the identification of a major IT acquisition  program(s), or any phase or increment of that program, that  significantly deviated from cost, performance, or schedule goals  established by the program. However, few agencies met this  requirement. In these cases, a common reason cited for not including  this information was that it was not appropriate to have such detailed  information in a strategic plan because such plans should be forward  thinking and may not be developed every year. Agencies also identified  other mechanisms that they use to track and report cost, schedule, and  performance deviations. Because agencies generally do not address  this Clinger-Cohen Act requirement in their IRM plans, they may benefit  from additional guidance from OMB on how to address this  requirement.", "IT goals. The Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act  require agencies to establish goals that address how IT contributes to  program productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, and service delivery to  the public. We have previously reported that leading organizations  define specific goals, objectives, and measures, use a diversity of  measure types, and describe how IT outputs and outcomes impact  operational customer and agency program delivery requirements.", "The agencies generally have the types of goals outlined in the  Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act. For example, the  Social Security Administration (SSA) set a goal of achieving an average  of at least a 2 percent per year improvement in productivity, and it  expects that advances in automation will be a key to achieving this goal  along with process and regulation changes. In addition, the Department  of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) latest departmental strategic plan has a goal  that includes using business process reengineering and technology  integration to speed up delivery of benefit payments, improve the  quality of health care provided in its medical centers, and administer  programs more efficiently. The VA goal includes strategies such as  using its enterprise architecture as a continuous improvement process,  implementing e-government solutions to transform paper-based  electronic collections to electronic-based mechanisms, and  establishing a single, high-performance wide area data network. Five  agencies do not have one or more of the goals required by the  Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act. For example, the  Department of Labor\u2019s single IT strategic goal\u2014to provide better and  more secure service to citizens, businesses, government, and Labor  employees to improve mission performance\u2014which it included in its  fiscal year 2004 performance plan, does not address all required goals.  Further, in contrast to other agencies, Labor does not have goals in its  IRM plan. It is important that agencies specify clear goals and  objectives to set the focus and direction of IT performance.", "IT performance measures. The Paperwork Reduction Act, the Clinger- Cohen Act, and Executive Order 13103 require agencies to establish a  variety of IT performance measures, such as those related to how IT  contributes to program productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness, and  to monitor the actual-versus-expected performance of those measures.  As we have previously reported, an effective performance management  system offers a variety of benefits, including serving as an early warning  indicator of problems and the effectiveness of corrective actions,  providing input to resource allocation and planning, and providing  periodic feedback to employees, customers, stakeholders, and the  general public about the quality, quantity, cost, and timeliness of  products and services.", "Although the agencies largely have one or more of the required  performance measures, these measures are not always linked to the  agencies\u2019 enterprisewide IT goals. For example, the Department of  Defense (DOD), Air Force, and Navy have a variety of enterprisewide  IT goals but do not have performance measures associated with these  goals. Each of these organizations are in the process of developing such  measures. To illustrate, the Air Force\u2019s August 2002 information  strategy includes nine goals, such as providing decision makers and all  Air Force personnel with on-demand access to authoritative, relevant,  and sufficient information to perform their duties efficiently and  effectively, but does not have performance measures for these goals.  The Air Force recognizes the importance of linking performance  measures to its goals and is developing such measures, which it expects  to complete by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004.", "Leading organizations use performance measures to objectively  evaluate mission, business, and project outcomes. Such organizations  also focus on performance measures for gauging service to key  management processes and tailoring performance measures to  determine whether IT is making a difference in improving performance.  Few agencies monitored actual-versus-expected performance for all of  their enterprisewide IT goals. Specifically, although some agencies  tracked actual-versus-expected outcomes for the IT performance  measures in their performance plans or accountability reports and/or  for specific IT projects, they generally did not track the performance  measures specified in their IRM plans. For example, although the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) IT strategic plan  identifies enterprisewide goals and performance measures, these  measures generally do not identify quantified outcomes (e.g., the  measures indicate that the outcome will be a percentage transaction  increase or cost decrease in certain areas but do not provide a baseline  or target). In addition, the HHS plan does not describe how the  department will monitor actual-versus-expected performance for these  measures. HHS\u2019s Director of Business Operations in its IRM office  reported that the department recognizes the need to develop an  integrated program for monitoring performance against the  enterprisewide measures in the IT strategic plan. He stated that HHS  has recently begun an initiative to establish such a process. By not  measuring actual-versus-expected performance, agencies lack the  information to determine where to target agency resources to improve  overall mission accomplishment.", "Benchmarking. The Clinger-Cohen Act requires agencies to  quantitatively benchmark agency process performance against public-  and private-sector organizations, where comparable processes and  organizations exist. Benchmarking is used by entities because there may  be external organizations that have more innovative or more efficient  processes than their own processes. Our previous study of IT  performance measurement at leading organizations found that they had  spent considerable time and effort comparing their performance  information with that of other organizations.", "Seven agencies have mechanisms\u2014such as policies and strategies\u2014in  place related to benchmarking their IT processes. For example, DOD\u2019s  information resources and IT directive states that DOD components  shall routinely and systematically benchmark their functional  processes against models of excellence in the public and private sector  and use these and other analyses to develop, simplify, or refine the  processes before IT solutions are applied. In general, however,  agencies\u2019 benchmarking decisions are ad hoc. Few agencies have  developed a mechanism to identify comparable external private- or  public-sector organizations and processes and/or have policies related  to benchmarking; however, all but 10 of the agencies provided  examples of benchmarking that had been performed. For example, the  Small Business Administration (SBA) does not have benchmarking  policies in place, but the agency provided an example of a  benchmarking study performed by a contractor that compared SBA\u2019s IT  operations and processes against industry cost and performance  benchmarks and best practices and resulted in recommendations for  improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Practice-Specific Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Table 1 provides additional detail on each strategic planning/performance  measurement practice and our evaluation of whether each agency had the  practice in place.

For example, reasons cited by agency IT  officials included that they lacked the support from agency leadership, that  the agency had not been developing IRM plans until recently and  recognized that the plan needed further refinement, that the process was  being revised (in at least one case because of changes that are needed to  reflect a loss of component organizations to the new DHS), and that  requirements were evolving. In other cases, the agency reported that it had  the information but it was not in the format required by legislation. For  instance, FISMA requires agencies to include in the performance plans  required by the Government Performance and Results Act the resources,  including budget, staffing, and training, and time periods to implement its  information security program. None of the agencies included this  information in their performance plans. However, the agencies commonly  reported that they had this information but that it was in another  document. Nevertheless, this does not negate the need for having the  agency report to the Congress in the required form. This is particularly  important since, as in the example of the FISMA requirement, the reporting  requirement involves a public document, whereas other reports may not be  publicly available.", "In the case of DHS, while we did not include the department in our  assessment and in table 1, the department is in the process of developing  its first IT strategic plan.

An IT investment  management process is an integrated approach to managing investments  that provides for the continuous identification, selection, control, life-cycle  management, and evaluation of IT investments. Among the investment  management practices that are most frequently in place are having  investment management boards and requiring that projects demonstrate  that they are economically beneficial. Practices less commonly in place are  those requiring that IT investments be performed in a modular, or  incremental, manner and that they be effectively controlled. Only by  effectively and efficiently managing their IT resources through a robust  investment management process can agencies gain opportunities to make  better allocation decisions among many investment alternatives and  further leverage their IT investments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Governmentwide Progress Demonstrated, but More Work Remains", "paragraphs": ["Critical aspects of IT investment management include developing well- supported proposals, establishing investment management boards, and  selecting and controlling IT investments. The agencies\u2019 use of practices  associated with these aspects of investment management is wide-ranging,  as follows:   IT investment proposals. Various legislative requirements, an executive  order, and OMB policies provide minimum standards that govern  agencies\u2019 consideration of IT investments. In addition, we have issued  guidance to agencies for selecting, controlling, and evaluating IT  investments. Such processes help ensure, for example, that  investments are cost-beneficial and meet mission needs and that the  most appropriate development or acquisition approach is chosen.", "The agencies in our review have mixed results when evaluated against  these various criteria. For example, the agencies almost always require  that proposed investments demonstrate that they support the agency\u2019s  business needs, are cost-beneficial, address security issues, and  consider alternatives. To demonstrate, the Department of  Transportation requires that proposed projects complete a business  case to indicate that the project (1) will meet basic requirements in  areas such as mission need, affordability, technical standards, and  disabled access requirements, (2) is economically beneficial, and (3)  has considered alternatives.", "One element in this area that agencies were not as likely to have fully in  place was the Clinger-Cohen Act requirement that agencies follow, to  the maximum extent practicable, a modular, or incremental, approach  when investing in IT projects. Incremental investment helps to mitigate  the risks inherent in large IT acquisitions/developments by breaking  apart a single large project into smaller, independently useful  components with known and defined relationships and dependencies.  An example of such an approach is DOD\u2019s policy stating that IT  acquisition decisions should be based on phased, evolutionary  segments that are as brief and narrow in scope as possible and that  each segment should solve a specific part of an overall mission problem  and deliver a measurable net benefit independent of future segments.  However, 14 agencies do not have a policy that calls for investments to  be done in a modular manner. For example, although the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that it worked with  program offices to try to segment work so that the scope and size of  each project is manageable, it does not have a policy that calls for  investments to be done in a modular manner. The absence of a policy  calls into question whether EPA is implementing incremental  investment in a consistent and effective manner.", "Investment management boards. Our investment management guide  states that establishing one or more IT investment boards is a key  component of the investment management process. According to our  guide, the membership of this board should include key business  executives and should be responsible for final project funding decisions  or should provide recommendations for the projects under its scope of  authority. Such executive-level boards, made up of business-unit  executives, concentrate management\u2019s attention on assessing and  managing risks and regulating the trade-offs between continued funding  of existing operations and developing new performance capabilities.", "Almost all of the agencies in our review have one or more enterprise- level investment management boards. For example, HUD\u2019s Technology  Investment Board Executive Committee and supporting boards have  responsibility for selecting, controlling, and evaluating the  department\u2019s IT investments. HUD\u2019s contractor-performed maturity  audits also have helped the department validate its board structure and  its related investment management processes. However, the investment  management boards for six agencies are not involved, or the agency did  not document the board\u2019s involvement, in the control phase. For  example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has a CIO advisory  group that addresses only the select phase of the IT investment  management process. NSF\u2019s CIO explained that the agency reviews the  progress of its major information system projects through other means,  such as meetings with management. In providing comments on a draft  of this report, the CIO stated that he believes that NSF has a  comprehensive set of management processes and review structures to  select, control, and evaluate IT investments and cited various groups  and committees used as part of this process. However, NSF\u2019s summary  of its investment management process and memo establishing the CIO  advisory group include only general statements related to the oversight  of IT investments, and NSF provided no additional documentation  demonstrating that its investment management board plays a role in the  control and evaluation phases. Our investment management guidance  identifies having an IT investment management board(s) be responsible  for project oversight as a critical process. Maintaining responsibility for  oversight with the same body that selected the investment is crucial to  fostering a culture of accountability by holding the investment board  that initially selected an investment responsible for its ongoing success.", "In addition, 17 agencies do not fully address the practice that calls for  processes to be in place that address the coordination and alignment of  multiple investment review boards. For example, we recently reported  that the Department of the Interior has established three department- level IT investment boards and begun to take steps to ensure that  investment boards are established at the bureau level. However, at the  time of our review, the department (1) could not assert that  department-level board members exhibited core competencies in using  Interior\u2019s IT investment approach and (2) had limited ability to oversee  investments in its bureaus. We made recommendations to Interior to  strengthen both the activities of the department-level boards and the  department\u2019s ability to oversee investment management activities at the  bureaus.", "Selection of IT investments. During the selection phase of an IT  investment management process, the organization (1) selects projects  that will best support its mission needs and (2) identifies and analyzes  each project\u2019s risks and returns before committing significant funds. To  achieve desired results, it is important that agencies have a selection  process that, for example, uses selection criteria to choose the IT  investments that best support the organization\u2019s mission and prioritizes  proposals.", "Twenty-two agencies use selection criteria in choosing their IT  investments. In addition, about half the agencies use scoring models  to help choose their investments. For example, the working group and  CIO office officials that support the Department of Education\u2019s  investment review board used a scoring model as part of deciding  which IT investments to recommend for the board\u2019s consideration and  approval. This model contained two main categories of criteria: (1)  value criteria that measured the impact and significance of the  initiative, given project goals and the strategic objectives of the  department; and (2) health criteria that measured the potential for the  success of the initiative and helped to assess both the performance and  the associated risks that are involved in project and contract  management. In the case of DOD, in February 2003 we reported that it  had established some, and was establishing other IT investment  criteria, but these criteria had not been finalized. Accordingly, we  recommended, and DOD concurred, that DOD establish a standard set  of criteria. In September we reported that this recommendation had not  been implemented. DOD officials stated that the department was  developing the criteria but that the proposed governance structure had  not yet been adopted.", "Control over IT investments. During the control phase of the IT  investment management process, the organization ensures that, as  projects develop and as funds are spent, the project is continuing to  meet mission needs at the expected levels of cost and risk. If the project  is not meeting expectations or if problems have arisen, steps are quickly  taken to address the deficiencies. Executive level oversight of project- level management activities provides the organization with increased  assurance that each investment will achieve the desired cost, benefit,  and schedule results.", "Although no agencies had the practices associated with the control  phase fully in place, some have implemented important aspects of this  phase. For example, Labor requires project managers to prepare a  control status report based on a review schedule established during the  selection phase, which is reviewed by the Office of the CIO and its  technical review board as part of determining whether to continue,  modify, or cancel the initiative. For initiatives meeting certain criteria,  the technical review board makes recommendations to the  management council, which serves as the department\u2019s top tier  executive investment review council, is chaired by the Assistant  Secretary of Administration and Management, and consists of  component agency heads.", "Nevertheless, in general, the agencies are weaker in the practices  pertaining to the control phase of the investment management process  than in the selection phase. In particular, the agencies did not always  have important mechanisms in place for agencywide investment  management boards to effectively control investments, including  decision-making rules for project oversight, early warning mechanisms,  and/or requirements that corrective actions for under-performing  projects be agreed upon and tracked. For example, the Department of  the Treasury does not have a department-level control process; instead,  each bureau may conduct its own reviews that address the  performance of its IT investments and corrective actions for under- performing projects. In a multitiered organization like Treasury, the  department is responsible for providing leadership and oversight for  foundational critical processes by ensuring that written policies and  procedures are established, repositories of information are created that  support IT investment decision making, resources are allocated,  responsibilities are assigned, and all of the activities are properly  carried out where they may be most effectively executed. In such an  organization, the CIO is specifically responsible for ensuring that the  organization is effectively managing its IT investments at every level.  Treasury IT officials recognize the department\u2019s weaknesses in this  area and informed us that they are working on developing a new capital  planning and investment control process that is expected to address  these weaknesses. Similarly, the Department of Energy is planning on  implementing the investment control process outlined in its September  2003 capital planning and investment control guide in fiscal year 2004,  which addresses important elements such as corrective action plans.  However, this guide does not document the role of Energy\u2019s investment  management boards in this process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Practice-Specific Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Table 2 provides additional detail on each investment management practice  and our evaluation of whether each agency had the practice in place.

This may be attributed, in part, to OMB not  establishing comprehensive guidance for the agencies detailing the  elements that should be included in such a plan. There were also numerous  instances of individual agencies that do not have specific IT strategic  planning, performance measurement, or investment management practices  fully in place. Agencies cited a variety of reasons for not having these  practices in place, such as that the CIO position had been vacant, not  including a requirement in guidance was an oversight, or that the process  was being revised. Nevertheless, not only are these practices based on law,  executive orders, OMB policies, and our guidance, but they are also  important ingredients for ensuring effective strategic planning,  performance measurement, and investment management, which, in turn,  make it more likely that the billions of dollars in government IT  investments will be wisely spent.

As part of this guidance, OMB  should also consider the most effective means for agencies to  communicate information about any major IT acquisition program(s) or  phase or increment of that program that significantly deviated from cost,  performance, or schedule goals established by the program. One option for  communicating this information, for example, could be through the annual  agency performance reports that are required by the Government  Performance and Results Act.", "We are also generally making recommendations to the agencies in our  review regarding those practices that are not fully in place unless, for  example, (1) we have outstanding recommendations related to the  practice, (2) the agency has a draft document addressing the practice, or  (3) implementation of the practice was ongoing.

We continue to believe that agencies need additional  guidance from OMB on the development and content of their IRM plans  because OMB Circular A-130 does not provide overall guidance on the  contents of agency IRM plans and half the agencies indicated a need for  OMB to provide additional guidance on the development and content of  IRM plans. Further, additional guidance would help to ensure that agency  plans address all elements of IRM, as defined by the Paperwork Reduction  Act.

We based our evaluation on the agency\u2019s self-assessment and  comments made by GSA\u2019s Director, Office of Policy and Plans.  However, based on GSA\u2019s representation in commenting on our draft,  we changed our evaluation of the referenced practice. 2. The Clinger-Cohen Act requires agencies to include in its information  resources management (IRM) plan the identification of a major IT  acquisition program(s), or any phase or increment of that program, that  significantly deviated from cost, performance, or schedule goals  established by the program. As we acknowledge in this report,  agencies, which would include GSA, identified other mechanisms that  they use to track and report cost, schedule, and performance  deviations. Moreover, we evaluated agencies as a \u201cpartially\u201d instead of a  \u201cno\u201d in this practice to take into account that the agency had the  required information, although it was not in the prescribed format.   Accordingly, we did not modify our report. 3. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 requires  agencies to include in the performance plans required by the  Government Performance and Results Act the resources and time  periods to implement their information security program. As we noted  in this report, agencies, which would include GSA, commonly stated  that they had this information but that it was in another document.  Nevertheless, this does not negate the need for having the agency  report to the Congress in the form that it requires. This is particularly  important since performance plans are public documents. Accordingly,  we did not modify our report. 4. GSA\u2019s new documentation illustrates that it has performance measures  for each of the IT goals in its IRM plan. However, GSA did not provide  evidence that it was tracking actual versus expected performance for  measures associated with one of its goals. We revised our report to  reflect GSA\u2019s new documentation and our evaluation. 5. We revised our report on the basis of this new documentation. 6. GSA\u2019s highest-level IT investment management board is its Executive  Committee. GSA did not provide a charter or any other evidence of  policies and procedures for this committee. We therefore did not  modify our report. 7. The additional documentation provided by GSA (1) does not address  decision-making rules and (2) illustrates that GSA uses a monthly  project control report on cost, schedule, and performance status, but  the report does not explicitly address deviations in system capability. In  addition, according to GSA\u2019s capital planning and investment control  order, the format of the report is left to the applicable organization,  thereby making it less likely that the investment management boards  are obtaining consistent information. We therefore did not modify our  report. 8. We agree that GSA\u2019s capital planning and investment control order  requires that projects that have significant variances are to provide \u201cget  well\u201d plans and that monthly control reports are used to report on  project cost, schedule, and performance status. However, it is not clear  that these status reports can be used to systemically track corrective  actions. Moreover, according to GSA\u2019s capital planning and investment  control order, the format of the monthly control report is left to the  applicable organization, thereby making it less likely that the status of  corrective actions is being consistently reported. We therefore did not  modify our report. 9. See comment 8. 10. We modified our recommendations based on our evaluation of GSA\u2019s  documentation. See comment 4 for our assessment. 11. Executive Order 13103 requires agencies to use software piracy  performance measures that comply with guidance issued by the federal  CIO Council. The Council, in turn, called on the agencies to develop  such measures. The additional documentation that GSA provided was  an order requiring agency employees to use properly licensed software,  but it does not include performance measures that would demonstrate  that this requirement is being honored. Measuring how well agencies  are combating software piracy is important because it can verify that  the controls that they have put in place are working. Accordingly, we  did not change this part of the recommendation. 12. We modified our recommendation to reflect that GSA requires projects  that have significant variances to develop corrective action plans.  However, the other elements of the recommendation pertaining to the  tracking and reporting on corrective actions remain outstanding.
