Twenty-seven of them are still operational but are expected to become nonoperational in the next 25 years, and 56 are nonoperational now. In 2009, EM agreed to accept 14 NNSA facilities when it had funds available to begin decontamination and decommissioning. Six years later, none of these facilities have been transferred, and EM officials said they may not be able to accept these or other NNSA facilities until at least 2030 due to budget uncertainties and other priorities. Meanwhile, as NNSA maintains contaminated nonoperational facilities, the facilities' condition continues to worsen, resulting in increased costs to maintain them, and NNSA documents show that some facilities will require significant additional maintenance to prevent the spread of contamination. For example, the Alpha-5 facility at NNSA's Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee has degraded to the extent that site officials now detect contaminants, such as mercury, in areas where they were not detected 2 years earlier, and additional funds are needed to repair its failing roof.", "EM does not consider the risks of NNSA's nonoperational facilities when prioritizing its cleanup activities.

EM\u2019s mission includes decontaminating and  decommissioning facilities that are contaminated from decades of nuclear  weapons production and nuclear energy research. Since its inception in  1989, EM has assumed responsibility for the disposition of 4,885  nonoperational nuclear, radiological, and industrial facilities. EM reported  at the end of fiscal year 2012 that it had completed the decontamination  and decommissioning of 1,927 (about 39 percent) of these facilities,  leaving 2,958 (about 61 percent) that remain under EM\u2019s responsibility.  For its first decade of operation, all nonoperational DOE facilities\u2014and, in  some cases, entire sites\u2014that needed cleanup work were transferred to  EM as a general policy. In 2001, however, EM stopped accepting facilities  from other program offices and declared that each DOE program office,  including NNSA, was responsible for the disposition of its own  contaminated facilities. According to EM documents, this decision was  due in part to the large number of facilities it had already accepted and  the cost of the required maintenance.", "In 2006, DOE directed EM to take responsibility for disposing of the  department\u2019s contaminated nonoperational facilities.

We also analyzed data NNSA uses  to track the condition of its facilities and their associated surveillance and  maintenance costs. Specifically, we used NNSA\u2019s data to identify  contaminated nonoperational facilities, operational facilities that will be  considered nonoperational over the next 25 years, and the annual cost to  maintain these facilities. NNSA collects these data from its sites  biannually and combines them into one database. To assess the reliability  of the data elements needed to answer our objectives, we reviewed  NNSA\u2019s processes for verifying these data and related documents and  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We also  corroborated the data obtained from NNSA headquarters with data we  collected from the six NNSA sites that manage these facilities. On the  basis of these steps, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We also reviewed planning and policy documents that  NNSA uses to identify and manage facilities before they are transferred to  EM. In addition, we visited two of the six NNSA sites with contaminated  facilities\u2014Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California  and the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12) in Tennessee\u2014to view  contaminated facilities and interview officials that are familiar with facility  surveillance and maintenance. We selected these two sites because  NNSA identified them as having some of the most contaminated facilities  and because these sites have both operational and nonoperational  facilities; because this is a nonprobability sample, our observations at  these sites cannot be generalized to all NNSA sites but provide illustrative  examples of sites with contaminated operational and nonoperational  facilities. We also interviewed officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Infrastructure  and Capital Planning, which is responsible for collecting the facility data  from the sites, as well as the Office of Field Financial Management.", "To determine the extent to which EM considers the risks of NNSA\u2019s  contaminated nonoperational facilities and the costs to maintain them, we  reviewed DOE and EM policies and guidance documents related to the  facility transfer process and prioritization of EM\u2019s cleanup work.  Specifically, we reviewed DOE\u2019s Transition Implementation Guide and  EM\u2019s Standard Operating Policies and Procedures for Excess Facility  Transfer to the Office of Environmental Management, among others. We  also interviewed officials at EM\u2019s Office of Deactivation and  Decommissioning and Facility Engineering, which developed EM\u2019s  transfer process. To identify if and how a facility\u2019s risk was factored into  the transfer process, we reviewed NNSA memorandums that identify risks  associated with its contaminated facilities and those outlining transfer  decisions between EM and NNSA. To learn how EM prioritizes cleanup  work and funding, we interviewed officials from EM\u2019s Program Planning  and Budget Office. We also interviewed officials at EM\u2019s site offices for Y- 12 and LANL because those sites have some of the oldest and most  contaminated facilities, according to NNSA documents.

Operating with a budget of $11.2 billion in fiscal year 2014, work activities  to support NNSA\u2019s national security missions are largely carried out by  management and operating contractors; an arrangement with historical  roots. Since the Manhattan Project produced the first atomic bomb during  World War II, NNSA and its predecessor agencies have depended on the  expertise of private firms, universities, and others to carry out research  and development work and efficiently operate the facilities necessary for  the nation\u2019s nuclear defense. Ensuring a safe and reliable nuclear  weapons stockpile is an extraordinarily complicated task and requires  state-of-the-art experimental and computing facilities, as well as the skills  of top scientists in the field.", "The life cycle of an NNSA facility includes several phases, including  planning and acquisition, maintenance, operation, and disposal.  According to DOE\u2019s policy on asset management, a program office, such  as NNSA, must notify DOE\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Project  Management when it determines that a facility is not fully utilized or is not  needed for the mission of the program office. DOE then determines  whether the facility could be used by another program office. If the facility  is not accepted for use by another program office, DOE determines it to  be excess. At this point, if the facility is contaminated with chemicals  and/or radiological materials as a consequence of nuclear weapons  production and/or nuclear energy research, the facility becomes eligible  for potential transfer to EM for decontamination and decommissioning.", "EM established a multistep transfer process in 2011 for NNSA and other  DOE program offices to transfer their contaminated facilities to EM for  decontamination and decommissioning. EM\u2019s transfer process consists  of nine steps beginning with NNSA or another program office nominating  a facility for transfer. Once nominated, EM reviews the facility to confirm  that it meets EM\u2019s eligibility requirements for transfer\u2014the facility must be  considered excess to all DOE mission needs, not just to the program  office;  contaminated with chemical or radiological contaminants resulting  from nuclear weapons research and/or production, not contamination  resulting solely from construction material, such as asbestos; and an individual, self-contained facility, and not part of a larger complex.", "After EM confirms a facility is eligible for transfer, EM evaluates it in more  detail and, if necessary, the program office performs necessary  stabilization activities, such as structural repairs and any other identified  actions to ensure the facility is in stable condition prior to transfer to EM  (see fig. 1).", "When EM confirms a facility is eligible for transfer, however, the facility is  not transferred to EM until it has funding available to immediately begin  decontamination and decommissioning. EM adopted this funding- dependent disposition policy, as a practice, in 2007 and formalized it as  part of its transfer policy in 2011. Prior to 2001, EM had been given  responsibility for hundreds of excess facilities from other DOE program  offices without any additional resources to manage them, according to  EM officials. Until EM has funds available to immediately begin  disposition, program offices, such as NNSA, are responsible for  maintaining their nonoperational facilities through activities known as  surveillance and maintenance. Surveillance and maintenance activities  may include, for example, periodic inspections of structures, as well as  preventive, predictive, and corrective maintenance. These activities may  also include the maintenance of selected systems and equipment  essential for transition and disposition activities, such as maintaining  ventilation systems, to ensure, at a minimum, that any contamination is  adequately contained and that the potential hazards to workers, the  public, and the environment are eliminated or mitigated and controlled.", "Cleanup work at DOE\u2019s sites is governed by one or more regulatory  agreements or orders that establish the scope of work to be performed at  a given site and the dates by which specific cleanup milestones must be  achieved. Cleanup work is performed at some sites under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act of 1980 (CERCLA). CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund,  provides federal authority to respond to releases or threatened releases  of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants that may  endanger public health or the environment, and it established a trust fund  to pay for cleanup activities. Portions of the cleanup work are also subject  to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), which  generally prohibits the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste  without a permit. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may  authorize states to adopt and enforce their own hazardous waste  management programs (including issuing permits) as long as the state  programs are at least equivalent to and consistent with RCRA. In  addition, the Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 made federal  facilities subject to state hazardous waste permitting and enforcement  authorities.

At that time, they will  consider which facilities to fund. However, without developing a  prioritized, risk-based list of facilities for disposition that includes facilities  from NNSA, it is unclear whether EM\u2019s planning is consistent with the  2006 memorandum, and EM may not be providing Congress with the  most complete information on its cleanup needs and priorities in its  annual budget submissions. Such planning would also help inform EM\u2019s  annual budget submission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EM Does Not Consider the Costs of Deferring Cleanup of NNSA\u2019s Nonoperational Facilities When Developing Cleanup Schedules", "paragraphs": ["EM\u2019s process for prioritizing facilities for cleanup does not take into  account the costs associated with deferring the disposition of NNSA\u2019s  nonoperational facilities. A 2010 EM study considered the cost of  deferring decontamination and decommissioning several facilities and  found that hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved if EM disposed  of the facilities earlier than planned, but no analysis has been done for  facilities already accepted by EM or nonoperational facilities at NNSA.  Specifically, EM conducted a life cycle cost analysis in 2010 to determine  if costs would be saved by disposing of contaminated facilities at five  DOE Office of Science sites earlier than it had originally planned. Based  on that analysis, EM concluded that, if disposition work began in 2010  rather than 2017 as it had originally planned, the early cleanup would  result in life cycle savings of about $734 million, primarily by avoiding  future surveillance and maintenance costs. According to one senior  official from EM\u2019s Office of Deactivation and Decommissioning and  Facility Engineering, EM did not begin disposition of these facilities after  EM performed the life cycle cost analysis because EM did not request  funds to accelerate the cleanup. Although EM has not performed such  analyses for NNSA\u2019s nonoperational facilities that meet EM\u2019s transfer  requirements, one senior official from EM\u2019s Office of Deactivation and  Decommissioning and Facility Engineering told us that such an analysis  may show that hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved by avoiding  future surveillance and maintenance costs and increased disposition  costs.", "Conditions at many of NNSA\u2019s contaminated facilities, some of which  have been nonoperational for many years, continue to worsen, resulting  in increased costs and risks, which are not considered by EM when  prioritizing its cleanup work. As previously discussed, facility life cycle  costs\u2014including surveillance and maintenance and disposition costs\u2014 and risks to human health and the environment continue to increase as  facilities degrade. For example, site officials estimate that about $2.6  million in repairs and structural upgrades will be needed for two  nonoperational contaminated facilities at LLNL prior to 2019\u201411 years  before EM officials estimate they may be able to accept any facilities from  NNSA for disposition, as shown in the following examples:", "The MARS E-Beam Facility: This facility will require an estimated  $700,000 to temporarily extend the life of its roof for 5 to 8 years and  remove air filtration systems that could release contaminants. The  facility stopped operating in 1999 and has a structurally failing roof  above contaminated areas that has resulted in water intrusion, which  NNSA documents state could spread contamination.", "The Rotating Target Neutron Source Facility: This facility stopped  operating in 1987 and will need an estimated $1.9 million to mitigate  the risks of a failing roof above highly contaminated areas, which has  resulted in water intrusion that could spread tritium contamination.", "A 2011 EM report found that the longer facilities sit idle, the further they  degrade, and the more dangerous and costly they are to maintain or  dispose of. The report also stated that some older facilities have a  limited life before major investments and structural upgrades must be  considered to maintain the ability to safely enter them for cleanup  activities. According to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide,  which is a compilation of cost-estimating best practices drawn from  across industry and government, agencies should consider all life cycle  costs, risks, and trade-offs to support the best decisions for allocating  existing and future resources. Nevertheless, EM does not consider the  remaining life cycle costs of NNSA\u2019s contaminated nonoperational  facilities, such as NNSA\u2019s costs for surveillance and maintenance and  structural upgrades, in developing its lists of cleanup priorities, according  to EM officials. Officials from EM\u2019s Office of Deactivation and  Decommissioning and Facility Engineering told us that, in their view, EM  does not need to evaluate the surveillance and maintenance costs of  facilities for which it is not responsible.", "EM documents have identified several benefits of early disposition that  could be realized if life cycle costs are considered in the cleanup  prioritization process. In 2005, EM finished a $6.5 billion, 10-year  accelerated cleanup of the Rocky Flats Site located 16 miles northwest of  Denver, Colorado, even though DOE had estimated in 1995 that the  cleanup and disposition activities at Rocky Flats would require $27 billion  over 65 years. Disposition activities at Rocky Flats required the  decontamination and decommissioning of 800 nonoperational facilities,  including structures contaminated with radiological and chemical  materials. We reported in July 2006 that the accelerated schedule was  one of four factors that contributed to the early completion of Rocky Flats\u2019  cleanup. In a 2009 report to Congress, EM estimated that its early  disposition and cleanup of Rocky Flats resulted in $20.5 billion in life  cycle cost savings, including savings on future surveillance and  maintenance costs, and 50 years in schedule savings.", "Site: Y-12 National Security Complex  Gross square feet: 313,771  Year deactivated: 2007  Annual anticipated surveillance and  expenditures: $1,735,000   Total estimated disposition cost:  $194,357,000  Commissioned in 1945, Beta-4 originally  performed uranium enrichment during World  War II, but transitioned to lithium enrichment  and weapons fabrication support during the  Cold War. The facility is contaminated with  radiological and other hazardous materials  including uranium alloys, asbestos, lead, and  mercury. Beta-4 is located adjacent to active  facilities and is approximately a third of a mile  from a residential neighborhood. The facility is  degrading and, according to site officials,  structural failures could result in releases of  radiological and chemical contamination in the  event of a fire. According to National Nuclear  Security Administration documents, areas of  the facility\u2019s roof leak and windows are  loosening from their casements. Water  intrusion due to the deteriorating roof could  result in the spread of contamination. Further,  according to the documents, if a fire occurred,  workers could be exposed to chemical and  radiological materials, and water runoff from  fire suppression activities could contain  contaminants. The facility also obstructs  access to soil suspected to require  remediation.", "EM\u2019s accelerated cleanup of the Fernald Site in Harrison, Ohio, produced  similar results. EM\u2019s cleanup of Fernald included the decontamination  and decommissioning of over 178 facilities. By pursuing closure and  disposition of the Fernald Site earlier than planned, cleanup was  completed 23 years early and for $200 million less than EM originally  estimated. In 2008, EM considered the costs of deferring cleanup at a  facility within the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. In considering  such costs, EM chose to decontaminate and decommission Building  711-L, a facility with a collapsing roof, earlier than it had originally  planned, which allowed the program office to avoid spending operating  funds repairing and maintaining a deteriorating nonoperational facility that  would later be demolished. By weighing the full life cycle costs and  deciding to perform accelerated disposition, EM documents show that  there are other benefits beyond cost savings of avoiding future  surveillance and maintenance costs, including:  reducing disposition costs by avoiding future repairs,  reducing environmental and safety risks from highly contaminated and  degraded facilities, and making areas of land and infrastructure available to support agency  missions and reduce sites\u2019 footprints."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["EM faces an enormous task in the disposition of the nation\u2019s  contaminated facilities that were used to develop and produce nuclear  weapons, many of which still contain radioactive and other hazardous  substances. Assessing all of the nonoperational contaminated facilities  across NNSA\u2019s sites, prioritizing them for decontamination and  decommissioning, as well as conducting cleanup activities is a  complicated undertaking for EM. However, EM is not comprehensively  integrating risks posed by NNSA\u2019s nonoperational contaminated facilities,  as called for by the 2006 Deputy Secretary Program Decision  Memorandum and federal internal control standards. By not integrating  nonoperational facilities from NNSA with its own lists of cleanup priorities,  EM is not including all risks from NNSA in its planning and may be putting  lower-risk facilities under its responsibility ahead of deteriorating facilities  managed by NNSA that are of greater risk to human health and the  environment. Without developing such a prioritized, risk-based list, EM is  not providing Congress with complete information about EM\u2019s current and  future cleanup obligations as Congress deliberates annually about  appropriating funds for cleanup activities. As EM has previously  demonstrated in its analysis of the costs of deferring facility disposition  and by cleaning up the Rocky Flats and Fernald sites earlier than  planned, analyzing life cycle costs of nonoperational facilities shows that  accelerating cleanup of some facilities, while others are maintained in  their current states, could offer significant cost savings. EM does not  currently analyze and consider life cycle costs for facilities it does not  manage because it does not accept facilities for transfer until funding is  available to carry out the decontamination and decommissioning work.  However, because EM is not considering the full life cycle costs of such  facilities, EM cannot ensure that its plans for decontaminating and  decommissioning facilities result in the most cost-effective use of its  limited resources.
