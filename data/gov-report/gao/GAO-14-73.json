Prior to being sold to retail consumers such as households and businesses, electricity is traded in wholesale markets. Regulation of electricity markets is divided; states oversee retail markets, and FERC oversees wholesale markets. In 2004, GAO reported on the benefits of encouraging consumers to reduce demand when the cost to generate electricity is high. These activities are known as \u201cdemand-response activities,\u201d which can reduce the costs of producing electricity, improve market functions, and enhance reliability.", "GAO was asked to examine demand-response activities. This report provides an update since 2004 and discusses: (1) federal efforts to facilitate demand-response activities, (2) FERC efforts to collect and report data on demand-response activities, (3) changes in the extent of demand-response activities, and (4) key benefits and challenges of current efforts. GAO reviewed documents and conducted interviews with government officials and industry stakeholders with demand-response expertise."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2004, the federal government has made efforts to facilitate demand-response activities, including expanding their use in wholesale electricity markets. Among these efforts, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued regulatory orders affecting Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO)\u2014entities that operate the transmission system and administer wholesale markets in some parts of the country. For example, FERC issued orders approving RTO rules for quantifying the extent of demand-response activities and compensating consumers for their demand-response activities.", "FERC collects and reports data on demand-response activities in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but these efforts have limitations. Electricity markets and demand-response activities have changed since FERC began collecting and reporting this data in 2006, but FERC has not reviewed the scope of its efforts to determine whether they could better reflect changes in electricity markets and demand-response activities. For example, FERC has reported that the limited number of retail consumers paying rates that vary with the cost of serving them is a barrier to expanding demand-response activities, but its report provides limited data on the number of consumers doing so. GAO has reported that evaluation of programs or efforts with a specific focus\u2014such as FERC's demand-response data collection efforts\u2014can play a key role in management and oversight. FERC, in some cases, adjusts the data it collects before making them available to the public\u2014using its judgment to improve the data's consistency, for example\u2014but does not fully document these adjustments. Best practices for data management advise that data modifications be documented. By not addressing these limitations, FERC is missing opportunities to make its data more informative and transparent to users for analysis of trends in demand-response activities and the extent to which progress has been made in addressing barriers.", "Since GAO's 2004 report, FERC data show that the extent of demand-response activities has increased, with demand-response activities in wholesale and retail markets more than doubling from a total of 29,653 megawatts (MW) of potential reduction in peak demand in 2005 to more than 66,350 MW in 2011\u2014about 8.5 percent of total peak demand. Demand-response activities in retail markets have increased 81 percent from a reported 20,754 MW of potential reduction in 2005 to a reported 37,543 MW in 2011. In wholesale markets, demand-response activities more than tripled from 2005 through 2011\u2014increasing from 8,899 MW of potential reduction in 2005 to 28,807 MW of potential reduction in 2011\u2014but the extent of demand-response activities has varied by RTO region.", "According to stakeholders, current demand-response efforts provide benefits for consumers, including increasing reliability and lowering prices, but these efforts also pose a number of challenges for wholesale markets. For example, FERC's efforts to encourage demand-response activities in the markets it oversees have made these markets more complex by introducing administrative functions that, according to stakeholders, have led to challenges. Challenges include the need to develop estimates of the amount of electricity a consumer would have used in order to quantify the reduction in electricity use from demand-response activities. FERC has taken some steps to address these challenges, but it is too soon to tell whether these steps will be effective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends FERC review the scope of its data collection and improve the transparency of its reporting efforts.

Since electricity cannot be easily stored, power plants\u2019  electricity output must be matched precisely with demand, which varies  significantly depending on the time of day and year. To maintain a reliable  supply of electricity, operators of the electricity grid take steps to ensure  that power plants will be available to generate electricity when needed. In  doing so, they typically ensure availability exceeds estimated demand so  that any unexpected increases in demand or power plant outages can be  accommodated without consumers losing access to electricity. As  demand for electricity varies throughout the day and year, grid operators  respond by continually increasing or decreasing the amount of electricity  that they call upon power plants to generate. As we have previously  reported, the cost of generating electricity varies, and grid operators  generally rely on plants that are the least costly to operate first and most often and plants that are the most costly to operate last and least often.Because the plants used to meet the highest levels of demand are  generally much more expensive to operate, there is significant variation in  the costs of serving consumers throughout the day and year.", "The price consumers pay for electricity is often a combination of rates determined by  regulators and prices determined by markets.

We also found that such demand-response activities  could encourage consumers to reduce demand when the cost to generate  electricity is high. However, we highlighted three main barriers to  expanding demand-response activities: (1) state regulations that shield  consumers from short-term variations in the cost of producing electricity  or wholesale prices; (2) the absence of equipment required for  participation in demand-response programs at consumers\u2019 sites, such as  advanced meters that can measure electricity consumption on a more  frequent basis; and (3) consumers\u2019 limited awareness of demand- response programs and their potential benefits.

In addition, we reviewed  FERC demand-response data about how overall levels of demand- response activities have changed over time. We also analyzed data from  a 2012 FERC survey of utility demand-response activities to identify the  primary demand-response approaches in use at the retail level. To  assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed FERC officials and  performed electronic testing of the data. We found some elements of the  data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In other cases, we were  unable to determine the quality of the data and, therefore, did not include  related analyses in our report. In addition, we reviewed current literature,  including reports about demand-response activities.

Electricity  may be generated at power plants by burning fossil fuels; through nuclear  fission; or by harnessing wind, solar, geothermal, or hydroenergy. Once  electricity is generated, it is sent through the electricity grid, which  consists of high-voltage, high-capacity transmission systems to areas  where it is transformed to a lower voltage and sent through the local  distribution system for use by business and residential consumers.  Throughout this process, a grid operator, such as a local utility, must  constantly balance the generation and consumption of electricity. To do  so, grid operators monitor electricity consumption from a centralized  location using computerized systems and send minute-by-minute signals  to power plants to adjust their output to match changes in the demand for  electricity.", "Balancing the generation and consumption of electricity is challenging for  grid operators because consumers use sharply different amounts of  electricity through the course of the day and year. Although there are  regional variations, demand typically rises through the day and reaches  its highest point\u2014called the peak\u2014in late afternoon or early evening. In  some parts of the country, average hourly demand can be up to twice as  high during late afternoon and early evening as it is during the middle of  the night and early morning hours. In addition to these daily variations in  demand, electricity demand varies seasonally, mainly because air- conditioning during the summer accounts for a large share of overall  electricity usage in many parts of the country. In some areas, peak usage  can be twice as high during the summer as it is during the winter.", "The power plants that grid operators use to meet this varying demand  include baseload plants and peakers. Baseload plants are generally the  most costly to build but have the lowest hourly operating costs. In  general, grid operators maximize the amount of electricity supplied by the  baseload plants, which are often used continuously for long periods of  time. As demand rises through the day and through the year and exceeds  the amount of electricity generation that can be delivered from baseload  power plants, grid operators increasingly rely on electricity supplied by  peakers. Peakers are usually less costly to build but more costly to  operate. As grid operators\u2019 reliance on peakers rises, the cost of  meeting demand can increase considerably. For example, the wholesale  price of electricity can rise almost 10-fold in the late afternoon and early  evening, when demand is at its highest and more peakers are being  utilized, compared to nighttime and early morning, when demand is at its  lowest and few, if any, peakers are being utilized. Peak periods are  generally short and account for only a few hours per day and, overall, a  small percentage of the hours during a year, but can significantly  contribute to the overall costs of serving consumers. According to a 2012  report by DOE\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, spikes in   This  demand during peak periods have a significant economic impact.report estimates that, in many electricity systems, 10 percent or more of  the costs of generating electricity are incurred to meet levels of demand  that occur less than 1 percent of the time.", "Maintaining a reliable supply of electricity is a complex process requiring  the grid operator to coordinate three broad types of services as follows:", "Energy. Operators schedule which power plants will produce  electricity\u2014referred to as energy scheduling\u2014to maintain the balance  of electricity generation and consumption. As a general rule, grid  operators will schedule the least costly baseload power plants first  and run them longest, and schedule the most costly peaker plants last  and run them less often.", "Capacity. Operators procure capacity\u2014long-term commitments to  provide specific amounts of electricity generation to ensure that there  will be sufficient electricity to reliably meet consumers\u2019 expected future  electricity needs. Procuring capacity may involve operators of power  plants committing that existing or new power plants will be available to  generate electricity, if needed, at a particular future date. To provide  for potential unexpected increases in demand or any problems that  prevent some power plants from providing electricity or transmission  lines from delivering electricity as expected, the commitments to  provide electricity may exceed expected demand by a specified  percentage or safety margin.", "Ancillary services. Operators procure several ancillary services to  maintain a reliable electricity supply. Ancillary services encompass  several highly technical functions required for grid operators to ensure  that electricity produced can be delivered and used by consumers.  Some ancillary services help ensure that electricity can be delivered  within technical standards\u2014for example, at the right voltage and  frequency\u2014to keep the grid stable and be useful for consumers who  may have equipment that needs to operate at specific voltage and  frequency levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restructuring of the Electricity Sector and the Expanding Role of Competition and Markets", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 2 decades, some states and the federal government have  taken steps to restructure the regulation of their electric systems with the  goals of increasing the roles of competition in markets, lowering prices,  and giving consumers access to a wider array of services.

In certain parts of the country, states and the federal government  restructured the electricity industry to one in which the wholesale price for  electricity generation is determined largely by supply and demand in  competitive markets. More specifically, historically, at the retail level,  integrated monopoly utilities provided consumers with electricity at  regulated prices, and state regulators generally set retail electricity prices  based on a utility\u2019s cost of production plus a fair rate of return on the  utility\u2019s investment in its infrastructure, including power plants and power  lines. However, beginning in the late 1990s, some states chose to  restructure the retail markets they oversee to allow the price of electricity  to be determined largely by supply and demand in competitive markets. In  parts of the country where electricity markets have restructured, new  entities called retail service providers compete with existing utilities to  provide electricity to consumers by offering electricity plans with differing  prices, terms, and incentives.", "At the wholesale level, FERC is required by law to ensure that the rates it  oversees are \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and not \u201cunduly discriminatory or  preferential,\u201d among other things. Prior to restructuring the wholesale  electricity markets in the late 1990s, FERC met this requirement by  approving rates for transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in  interstate commerce based on the utilities\u2019 costs of production plus a fair  rate of return on the utilities\u2019 investment. After restructuring wholesale  electricity markets, FERC continued to develop transmission rates in this  same way. In addition, FERC provided authority for many entities\u2014for  example, independent owners of power plants\u2014to sell electricity at prices  determined by supply and demand where FERC determined that the  markets were sufficiently competitive or that adequate procedures were in  place to mitigate the effect of companies with a large market share and  the ability to significantly control or affect prices in the markets. As a  result, these entities can now compete with existing utilities and one  another to sell electricity in wholesale markets.", "As part of this restructuring process, FERC also encouraged the voluntary  creation of new entities called Regional Transmission Organizations  (RTO) to manage regional networks of electric transmission lines as grid  operators\u2014functions that, in these areas, had traditionally been carried  out by local utilities. Figure 2 indicates the location of major RTOs that  have developed in certain regions of the United States. As grid operators,  RTOs are responsible for managing transmission in their regions, which  includes establishing and implementing rules and pricing related to  transmission, as well as considering factors, such as weather conditions  and equipment outages, that could affect the reliability of electricity supply  and demand.", "Like other grid operators, such as utilities, RTOs take steps to schedule  and procure energy, capacity, and ancillary services. RTOs often do so  using the three broad types of markets they manage\u2014energy markets;  capacity markets; and markets for several different ancillary services,  including voltage support and frequency support. In the energy markets,  for example, sellers\u2014such as owners of power plants\u2014place offers with  RTOs to supply an amount of electricity at a specific price. Potential  buyers of this electricity, such as retail service providers, also place bids  with RTOs defining their willingness to pay for it. RTOs periodically\u2014 hourly, for example\u2014\u201cstack\u201d the offers to supply electricity from lowest  offered price to highest until the RTO estimates that it has sufficient  electricity to meet the total demand. The market clearing price, or the  highest supply bid needed to satisfy the last unit of demand, is paid for  each unit of electricity produced for that time period. Regions with RTOs  are referred to as having \u201corganized wholesale markets,\u201d because the  RTOs centrally coordinate these transactions between buyers and sellers  according to rules the RTOs have established and FERC has approved.", "In regions of the country without RTOs, electric utilities generally continue  to serve the role of grid operator. In these regions, the local utility often  integrates the delivery of electricity services\u2014energy to maintain the  balance of electricity generation and consumption, capacity to meet  demand and provide a safety margin, and a range of ancillary services.

FERC reported that demand-response  activities\u2014known as load management or demand-side management\u2014 increased markedly in the 1980s and early 1990s. This increase was  driven by a combination of a directive in the Public Utility Regulatory  Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to examine standards for time-based  pricing and by state and federal policy focused on managing consumer  demand and planning future resource availability for providing  electricity.demand-response activities generally declined between 1998 and 2003,  just as FERC was beginning to restructure wholesale electricity markets.", "However, according to data from NERC, estimates of certain  Demand-response activities may occur within both retail and wholesale  markets. The actions taken by retail and wholesale demand-response  program participants are often not substantially different and typically  involve consumers reducing their electricity consumption by delaying or  stopping the use of electricity-consuming appliances, processes, or  machinery during periods of high demand. As with electricity prices,  FERC and state regulators each have interest in and responsibility for  overseeing aspects of these demand-response activities, at the wholesale  and retail levels, respectively.", "There are two broad approaches to demand-response: (1) consumer- initiated and (2) operator-initiated. Specifically, these approaches are as  follows:", "Consumer-initiated approaches. With consumer-initiated demand- response approaches, consumers determine when they will take  specific actions to reduce the amount of electricity they consume.  There are various types of consumer-initiated demand-response  approaches. For example, retail consumers may pay time-based  prices that vary with the cost of serving them with the goal of  encouraging them to choose to reduce their use of electricity when  prices are high. Time-based prices include time-of-use prices, which  vary at broad intervals, such as peak and off-peak times, and real- time prices, which vary at least hourly in response to changes in  market conditions such as the cost of producing electricity at that time.  Consumers\u2019 actions to reduce demand may be manual\u2014such as  turning off lights or delaying use of the clothes dryer\u2014or automatic\u2014 such as using thermostats or other automated systems that are  preprogrammed to reduce air conditioning use when prices reach a  certain level. To participate in programs that use consumer-initiated  approaches, consumers may need access to certain technology, such  as the internet or a home display that provides information about  changing prices. In addition, they may need a type of electric meter  known as an advanced meter, which measures and records data on  consumers\u2019 electricity use at closer intervals than standard electricity  meter\u2014typically at least hourly\u2014and provides these data to both  consumers and electricity suppliers.", "Operator-initiated approaches. Operator-initiated approaches allow  grid operators to call on participating consumers to reduce demand\u2014 for example, by shutting down equipment\u2014during periods of tight  supply in exchange for a payment or other financial incentive. These  approaches can minimize the number of consumers losing access to  electricity during periods of extremely high demand, reduce stress on  a distribution network, or help accommodate the unexpected shut  down of a power plant or transmission line. Incentives for participation  in these approaches may include a payment, a bill credit, or a lower  electricity price.

For example, demand-response resources may be  provided directly by large consumers such as steel mills or other  manufacturing facilities that purchase electricity directly from wholesale  markets. These large consumers may delay the use of highly electricity  intensive equipment, such as an electric arc furnace used to melt steel,  until later in the day than they had planned in exchange for payments or  other incentives. Demand-response resources may also be provided by  intermediaries that combine the demand-response activities\u2014for  example, reductions in use of air-conditioning or household appliances at  peak times\u2014of multiple retail consumers to provide the quantity of  demand-response resources required to participate in wholesale  markets.

They provide this electricity by  reducing their or their customers\u2019 demand from levels they had  expected to consume. Unlike the generators that are also bidding in  these markets, which produce additional electricity by increasing the  electricity generation of a power plant, demand-response providers  make electricity available to the market by not consuming it. Demand- response resources may be scheduled if they are among the least  costly options for addressing energy needs at a particular location.", "Capacity.

FERC has taken steps to address  these challenges by adopting standards for quantifying demand-response  activities and undertaking enforcement activities, but these steps require  time and resources, and it is too soon to tell whether they will be effective.", "First, several stakeholders said that developing baselines in electricity  markets\u2014that is, an estimate of how much electricity a consumer would  have consumed if not for their demand-response activities\u2014can be  difficult. Individual electricity consumption reflects factors unique to  individual consumers that are inherently difficult to predict. Specifically,  consumers\u2019 past electricity use does not necessarily predict future use  because electricity use depends on many variables, such as weather and,  for large industrial consumers, production cycles. For example, the  electricity demand of some industrial and commercial consumers is  difficult to estimate because their electricity consumption varies based on  changes in the demand for the products they produce. Further,  determining when to measure a baseline can be difficult since consumers\u2019  electricity use may vary frequently and electricity use before and after a  consumer\u2019s demand-response activities may not accurately reflect the  extent of the consumer\u2019s demand-response contribution. For example,  comments from an industrial coalition and two demand-response  aggregators to FERC describe a potential situation in which a steelmaker  has a furnace temporarily out of service for maintenance. After  maintenance is completed, if the steelmaker chooses to take a demand- response action by delaying its next production cycle, measuring this  steelmaker\u2019s baseline immediately before the steelmaker took the  demand-response action\u2014when its furnace was out of service\u2014would  not reflect the steelmaker\u2019s contribution. Baselines can have significant  implications for demand-response activities. If a baseline is set too high,  consumers may be compensated for a greater quantity of electricity  resulting from their demand-response actions than the quantity they  actually provided, potentially raising costs to all electricity consumers who  ultimately pay for demand-response activities. If the baseline is set too  low, consumers may not be credited with providing the quantity of  electricity resulting from the demand-response actions they actually  provided, and they may be less willing to take demand-response actions  in the future, limiting the potential benefits. As a result, RTOs and  demand-response providers must devote resources to the efforts of  developing reasonable and fair baselines for demand-response programs  to operate effectively.", "Second, some stakeholders noted that using baselines as a key  component of compensation for demand-response activities subjects  them to manipulation, which requires RTOs and FERC to devote time and  resources to oversight and enforcement. For example, in recent years,  FERC has identified multiple instances in which consumers manipulated  their baseline to receive additional financial compensation for demand- response activities or to avoid financial penalties for not providing the  quantity of demand-response activities they agreed to. Specifically, in  June 2013, FERC reported what it believed were irregular activities by a  company that manages sports and entertainment facilities. According to a  FERC document, witnesses reported that stadium lighting at one of the  company\u2019s baseball stadiums was turned on 2 hours before a demand- response event was scheduled to begin. No games were scheduled for  that day, indicating that the increased electricity use was not needed for  operations at the ballpark. These actions could have artificially inflated the  company\u2019s baseline, thereby increasing the company\u2019s compensation for  the reduction in demand that resulted from switching the lights off during  the demand-response event. FERC recently approved a $1.3 million  settlement with the company. More recently, FERC fined two Maine  paper mills after concluding that they had manipulated New England\u2019s  demand-response programs.paper mills had improperly set their baseline electricity usage by lowering  their use of on-site generation below what was their normal practice.  According to FERC, doing so increased their consumption of electricity  from the grid and inflated their baselines. Once the baseline was set,  FERC determined that the mills returned to their normal practice of using  their on-site generation, which made it appear that they had taken  demand-response actions by lowering their use of electricity from the grid.  FERC recently approved an approximately $3 million settlement with one  paper mill, and the other case is currently being contested in court. FERC  officials told us that FERC\u2019s enforcement office continues to pursue  investigations related to fraudulent demand-response activities. As a  result of the potential for such manipulations, RTOs and FERC must  devote time and resources toward oversight and enforcement tasks, such  as monitoring, investigating, and adjudicating potential violations of the  rules for demand-response activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Stated That Compensating Wholesale Demand-Response Activities Also Poses Challenges and Disagreed about FERC\u2019s Approach", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we spoke with also highlighted challenges to compensating  demand-response activities.

If the quantity of electricity reduced as a result of demand- response activities is too small, the price and reliability benefits that  demand-response activities provide may be reduced. In contrast, if the  quantity of electricity reduced as a result of demand-response activities is  too high, it may dampen the incentives to invest in new power plants,  which could reduce their availability for meeting demand in the long run.", "Central to the issue of reasonable compensation is the fact that, because  both demand-response activities and electricity generation from power  plants can be used to help meet demand for electricity, they compete for  compensation in the wholesale market.", "Some stakeholders told us that they believe that demand-response  providers should receive less compensation than power plants for the  services they provide. Specifically, these stakeholders said the following:", "Some stakeholders noted that power plants\u2014assets with long useful  lives\u2014are more dependable in the long run than demand-response  resources. For example, these stakeholders told us that owners of  power plants are typically obligated to ensure that power plants are  available to generate electricity. In contrast, these stakeholders noted  that there may not be such a requirement for mandatory participation  by demand-response providers. For example, representatives from  one RTO noted that consumers enter into agreements to provide  demand-response resources through aggregators and may change  their availability on a month-to-month basis. As a result, they said that  the RTO is not able to accurately predict how many demand-response  resources its region will have in the future. In addition, while the  amount of electricity generation that power plants can generally  provide is known, there may be limits to how often consumers can be  requested to curtail their electricity consumption and for how long. For  example, the market rules for PJM Interconnection\u2019s most widely  subscribed demand-response program limit PJM\u2019s requests of  customers for demand-response activities to no more than 10  interruptions from June through September with a maximum  interruption of 6 hours. Representatives from PJM Interconnection told  us they are attempting to increase the use of demand-response  approaches with fewer restrictions.", "Several stakeholders noted that providing equal compensation for  demand-response activities as electricity generation may result in  benefits to demand-response providers in excess of what would be  economically justified. Several stated that, in their view, if these  resources are compensated equally, the providers are effectively  benefitting twice\u2014once when they are paid for their demand-response  activities and a second time because they save money by not having  to purchase as much electricity as they were originally planning to.  One stakeholder noted that while it may be reasonable to provide  compensation to demand-response providers at a level equal to  power plants if the providers had first purchased the electricity and  were just reselling it, demand-response providers may have not done  so. In essence, demand-response providers may be compensated for  agreeing to reduce their use of electricity that they may not have  purchased in the first place. Some stakeholders noted that providing  equal compensation could result in more demand-response resources  than are economically justified.", "Some stakeholders told us they believe that demand-response providers  should receive compensation equal to the compensation power plants  receive for generating electricity. Specifically, stakeholders said the  following:", "Some stakeholders noted that providing equal compensation can  encourage demand-response resources to participate in wholesale  markets in which they provide benefits. According to one stakeholder,  demand-response activities can provide reliability benefits, including  addressing localized reliability concerns. Localized reliability concerns  sometimes arise when the transmission lines leading to a local area  do not have the capability to transport sufficient electricity for that  area. Even though adequate electricity is available to meet overall  demand, there may not be sufficient transmission available to deliver  the electricity at certain points during the day or year. One stakeholder  told us that, in these instances, the demand-response activities of  consumers living in the local area could help resolve the reliability  concern. Two other stakeholders\u2014a representative of a demand- response aggregator and a state public utility commission official\u2014 told us that, without equal compensation, the quantity of demand- response activities in the wholesale energy markets would likely be  smaller.", "Some stakeholders told us that, although demand-response activities  and electricity generation are different kinds of resources, providing  equal compensation is appropriate since demand-response activities  provide a benefit to the market by replacing the need to have power  plants provide additional electricity. One stakeholder said that equal  compensation always provides an economic benefit to consumers  since FERC requires demand-response activities to be cost-effective.  This means that the estimated benefit from the reduction of the  wholesale market price attributable to demand-response activities  should be greater than the amount of compensation paid for the  demand-response activities. Another stakeholder noted that equal  compensation in electricity markets is designed to provide a  competitive price that balances supply and demand in the  marketplace in an unbiased manner. The purpose of equal  compensation is not to provide equal benefit to all resources, since  each resource\u2014including power plants with different fuel types\u2014has  varying costs and will, therefore, benefit from equal compensation to  varying degrees.", "In 2011, FERC issued Order 745 generally requiring that, when certain  conditions are met, demand-response providers should receive equal  compensation. Prior to issuance, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking and provided an opportunity for the public to comment. In the  final order, FERC acknowledged divergent opinions on the appropriate  level of compensation, but it determined that equal compensation should  generally be provided for demand-response activities that provide the  same services as generation. It may take time to determine whether  Order 745 will have the desired effect."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Two Additional Challenges as a Result of Demand- Response Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders identified the following two additional challenges that have  developed related to demand-response efforts:", "Environmental impacts of backup or replacement generation.", "Some stakeholders highlighted challenges associated with the use of  backup generators for demand-response activities. Some consumers  may use backup generators\u2014on-site generating units that replace  electricity that would have been provided by the grid\u2014to generate  electricity to offset some or all of their demand reductions. Although  these backup generators can play an important role in maintaining  reliability, they may be more polluting than the power plants serving  the grid. EPA officials told us that they did not know the environmental  impact of backup generation being used to offset demand-response  activities and said that the impact will depend on how often backup  generators are used for this purpose and their individual emissions  profiles. According to an EPA final rule, starting with calendar year  2015, owners and operators of backup generators subject to EPA\u2019s  rules must annually report data on the extent to which their generators  are used for demand-response activities.", "Demand-response dependability. As demand-response activities  increase and become a larger percentage of overall system demand,  the likelihood increases that a consumer will be called upon more  often for their demand-response activities. Some stakeholders noted  that consumers may become fatigued as the number of demand- response events increases, making them less likely to reduce  electricity demand to agreed-upon levels. NERC has recently begun  taking steps to collect data about this issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retail Prices Remain Unresponsive to Market Conditions, which Poses Challenges in Wholesale Markets, Including Higher Demand and Prices", "paragraphs": ["Retail prices, which are outside of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, remain largely  unresponsive to wholesale market conditions, which poses challenges in  wholesale markets. These unresponsive retail prices limit the potential for  consumers to respond to changes in the cost of producing electricity or  prices in wholesale markets which, in turn, leaves electricity consumption  and wholesale prices higher than they otherwise would be. In our 2004  report, we reported that a barrier to demand-response activities is that  retail electricity prices generally did not vary with wholesale market  conditions\u2014such as changing demand for electricity and the cost of  serving consumers\u2014but were instead based on average electricity costs   In particular, in 2004, we concluded that retail  over an extended period.prices that did not vary with wholesale market conditions resulted in  electricity markets that do not work as well as they could, producing  prices that are higher than they would be if more consumers paid varying  prices. Since that time, others have also concluded that having a limited  number of consumers paying prices that are responsive to market  conditions may lead to higher consumer demand for electricity than would  otherwise be the case. Specifically, according to a 2008 FERC report  about demand-response activities, some stakeholders, and other reports  we reviewed, consumers paying average, unvarying prices may use more  electricity at times of the day when the cost of serving consumers is high  than they would if the price they paid reflected this higher cost of serving   More recently, some stakeholders we spoke with and reports we  them.reviewed also concluded that if consumers\u2019 electricity use is higher than it  otherwise would be, electricity prices for all consumers will also be higher.  Furthermore, two stakeholders and reports we reviewed noted that higher  levels of consumption must be served by building additional power plants  and transmission lines, which further drives up costs and ultimately retail  prices paid by consumers.", "FERC has also concluded that prices that are aligned with overall market  conditions could provide substantial benefits. For example, in a 2009  assessment of demand-response potential, FERC estimated that  forecasted peak demand in 2019 could drop by 14 percent if two types of  consumer-initiated demand-response approaches\u2014real-time prices and  critical-peak prices\u2014became the default pricing approach for  consumers. Consistent with this view, some stakeholders we  interviewed, reports by economists, and a FERC Advance Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking, reported that increasing the number of  consumers enrolled in consumer-initiated demand-response approaches,  particularly real-time pricing programs, has the potential to lower average  electricity prices for all consumers as well as provide other benefits. For  example, such an approach could eliminate \u201ccross subsidies\u201d in which  one type of consumer\u2014consumers that currently use little electricity at  high-cost times\u2014subsidizes the behavior of other consumers\u2014those that  use larger amounts of electricity at high-cost times. In addition, such an  approach could provide consumers with the incentive to make more  permanent shifts in the way they consume electricity, such as by making  changes to electricity consumption habits, including precooling buildings  prior to peak hours rather than cooling continuously throughout the day.  We also previously reported that such pricing can provide incentives for  the installation of more energy efficient equipment to replace equipment  that consumes large quantities of electricity during periods of high  demand, such as air conditioners that run during peak periods during the  summer. Such pricing may also make it cost-effective for some  consumers to invest in renewable energy technologies such as solar  panels. The times solar power can be generated often coincide with times  of peak demand, when the cost of generating electricity is higher, which  may make the use of solar panels more cost-effective when consumers  pay real-time prices.", "In particular, FERC\u2019s data indicate that 6.5 percent of retail consumers  participate in demand-response programs and approximately 2 percent in  consumer-initiated approaches such as time-of-use or real-time pricing.  Some stakeholders we spoke to told us that expanding the number of  consumers paying prices that are responsive to market conditions\u2014such  as real-time prices\u2014would be a more straightforward and less  administratively costly alternative to FERC\u2019s demand-response efforts.", "Some stakeholders highlighted the difficulties of shifting retail pricing  toward prices that more closely mirror the cost of serving consumers. For  example, representatives from a large industrial company told us that it is  difficult to manage their operations when paying prices that vary  frequently throughout the day because electricity comprises a large  portion of this company\u2019s business expenses, and frequently varying  prices make it difficult to plan production cycles. Two other stakeholders  commented that if consumers\u2019 expected cost savings from shifting their  electricity use are small, they may decide that it is not worth the effort to  shift their electricity use in response to changing prices. When making  this determination, consumers may consider the costs associated with  managing their electricity usage in response to prices that vary frequently,  including the costs of installing any needed technological infrastructure\u2014 for example, energy management control systems that allow them to  automatically respond to varying prices with preprogrammed demand- response curtailment actions.", "Efforts are under way in several areas to evaluate different ways of  pricing electricity for retail consumers with some utilities initiating pilots.  For example, Baltimore Gas and Electric completed a pilot program\u2014 converted to a permanent program in July 2013\u2014in which residential  consumers earn a bill credit for energy conserved compared with their  normal usage on days identified by the utility when energy demand is  high. Furthermore, Pacific Gas and Electric, which serves much of  Northern and Central California, began offering a critical peak pricing  program in 2008 after advanced meters had been installed. Additionally,  as a part of the DOE Smart Grid Investment Grant program, DOE is  helping to coordinate studies to assess consumers\u2019 responses to these  new approaches."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since our last report on demand-response activities in 2004, FERC has  made efforts to remove barriers to expand the use of demand-response  activities in wholesale markets, recognizing the importance of connecting  consumers\u2019 decisions about electricity consumption to the wholesale  markets FERC oversees.

However, the data FERC collects  and reports\u2014the only source of broad data we identified with detailed  information by demand-response approach\u2014have two key limitations.  First, FERC has not reviewed the scope of its data collection and  reporting efforts to determine whether they could be improved to better  reflect changes in electricity markets and participation in demand- response activities. Second, in some cases, FERC makes certain  adjustments after collecting these data but before using them in their  reports required by Congress; however, it does not fully document these  adjustments or the reasons for them.

These policies included FERC  demand-response orders that summarize FERC\u2019s review of demand- response proposals from individual Regional Transmission Organizations  (RTO), as well as FERC orders that address demand-response activities  more broadly. We also spoke with FERC officials to understand their  current approach to demand-response activities in wholesale markets,  including decisions about how to eliminate barriers to demand-response  activities in these markets. We reviewed relevant laws that outlined  requirements related to demand-response efforts for FERC and others.", "To assess FERC\u2019s efforts to collect and report data on demand-response  activities, we reviewed FERC\u2019s approach to gathering data for its  Assessment of Demand Response and Advanced Metering reports,  which involved analyzing various aspects of the data, analyzing FERC\u2019s  approach for collecting and modifying the data, and conducting interviews  with FERC officials about FERC\u2019s data collection and reporting process.", "To assess the changes, if any, in the extent of demand-response  activities in retail and wholesale markets since 2004, we reviewed and  analyzed data on demand-response activities from FERC and the Energy  Information Administration (EIA), among others. Specifically, we reviewed  FERC data on demand-response approaches and related reports,  including FERC\u2019s 2012 Assessment of Demand Response and Advanced  Metering report. Where appropriate, we used these data in our report to  provide information on how overall levels of demand-response activities  have changed over time. We also analyzed data from FERC\u2019s survey of  utility demand-response activities conducted for this 2012 assessment to  identify the primary demand-response approaches in use at the retail  level. FERC conducted a voluntary survey of utilities to gather data on  their demand-response activities and their use of advanced meters. The  response rate to FERC\u2019s survey was 59 percent. Unless otherwise noted,  the data we present in our report from FERC\u2019s 2012 report and  associated survey reflects information reported by those utilities  responding to the survey. The data do not represent the extent of  demand-response activities throughout the United States. Furthermore,  our analysis of survey results to identify the primary demand-response  approaches at the retail level may not match what was reported in  FERC\u2019s 2012 Assessment of Demand Response and Advanced Metering  report because FERC modified these data prior to publication, as we  discuss in this report. Because these modifications were not documented,  we could not verify their accuracy or relevance to our analysis. As a  result, when providing data about specific retail demand-response  approaches, we chose to report results from the original survey data  reported by the utilities, which reflect the original, unmodified survey  responses. To assess the reliability of the data, we interviewed FERC  officials and performed electronic testing of the data. We found some  elements of the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In other  cases, we were unable to determine the quality of the data and, therefore,  did not include related analyses in our report. In addition to the FERC  data, we reviewed EIA\u2019s 2011 data on retail demand-response activities.  We reviewed related documentation about these data and interviewed  EIA about their collection, and we found them to be sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. We also reviewed data collected by the North American  Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) through its Demand Response  Availability Data System. These data primarily focused on operator- initiated approaches, although a report from NERC says there are plans  to expand reporting to include additional consumer-initiated approaches  in the future. For this reason, and because the data were not categorized  in a way that aligned with the specific analysis we were performing, we  did not include them in our report.", "We also reviewed RTOs\u2019 data on the development of demand-response  activities in their region, what consumers provide demand-response  activities, and documentation on available RTO demand-response  approaches. We supplemented these data with our own analysis of data  on RTO demand-response resources available through the FERC survey  of utility demand-response activities. To analyze the FERC data, we  categorized each RTO\u2019s demand-response resources according to  whether they were designed to provide capacity, energy, or ancillary  services and confirmed these categorizations with the RTOs. In some  cases, RTO demand-response approaches had been updated or  changed by the RTOs since this information was reported to FERC.", "Additionally, FERC took various steps to modify reported categories prior  to reporting similar information in their 2012 Assessment of Demand  Response and Advanced Metering report. As previously noted, because  these modifications were not documented, we were unable to verify their  appropriateness for inclusion in our analysis. As such, for this analysis of  RTO demand-response activities, we primarily used the original survey  data reported on FERC\u2019s website. In the case of the Midcontinent  Independent System Operator data, FERC informed us that the data  reported on its website was not correct and provided us with the corrected  survey data. We interviewed FERC officials about their data and  performed electronic testing of the data, which we found sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. As a result, the data included in our report may  not always match what was reported in FERC\u2019s 2012 Assessment of  Demand Response and Advanced Metering report.", "To assess key benefits and challenges, if any, of current demand- response efforts, we conducted semistructured interviews with a  nonprobability sample of 37 diverse stakeholders with expertise on  demand-response issues from five categories: trade associations and  public interest organizations; academics and consultants; state  government, including state public utility commissions; industry, including  demand-response aggregators, large users of electricity, independent  power producers, and integrated utilities; and RTOs. (See app. II for a list  of these stakeholders). We selected these groups to maintain balance on  key issues. Often, because of business interests, these groups have  different perspectives on electricity industry issues, including demand- response activities. When possible, we used a standard set of questions  to discuss topics such as the strengths and limitations of U.S. demand- response approaches, barriers to expanding demand-response activities,  and steps the federal government should take to develop or refine  demand-response policies. However, as needed, we also sought  perspectives on additional questions tailored to these stakeholders\u2019 area  of expertise and sought opinions from stakeholders on controversial key  issues, for example, their views on how to best compensate consumers  for their demand-response activities. In addition to interviewing the  aforementioned 37 stakeholders from the five categories, we had  supplementary conversations with stakeholders who did not easily fit in  one of the previous five categories. These stakeholders had specialized  knowledge about certain aspects of the electricity industry relevant to our  study, for example, experience evaluating the competitiveness of the  FERC-regulated wholesale markets.
