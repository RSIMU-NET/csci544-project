DOD reported that as of September 2010 it had $8.4 billion worth of on-hand excess inventory, categorized for potential reuse or disposal, and $940 million worth of on-order excess inventory, already purchased but likely to be excess due to changes in requirements. Under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, GAO is required to assess DOD\u0092s implementation of the Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan (Plan) DOD submitted to Congress. GAO\u0092s objectives were to determine the extent to which DOD has (1) established and achieved targets for reducing excess inventory in the Plan, (2) made progress in implementing the overall Plan, (3) metrics to track progress in improving inventory management, and (4) identified and realized any cost savings or avoidance.

Sustained management oversight led to reductions in on-order and on-hand excess inventory in fiscal year 2010 prior to the Plan\u0092s implementation, and thus DOD may find the current targets are not meaningful in guiding improvement. Specifically, at the end of fiscal year 2010, DOD had reduced its percentage of on-order excess inventory to 5.5 percent, thereby achieving its 2014 target 4 years early. It also revised the definition and calculation of on-hand excess inventory, which resulted in DOD being below the fiscal year 2012 target of 10 percent. It is DOD policy to conduct periodic evaluations of its inventory management, and results-oriented management practices emphasize validating performance measures to ensure they remain appropriate. Without challenging, yet achievable targets, DOD\u0092s Plan will not be effective in guiding further improvement.", "DOD has made progress implementing its Plan since implementation began in late fiscal year 2010, but DOD is only 18 months into a 4-year implementation effort and many planned activities still remain. Most but not all of the progress to date has been in gathering and analyzing data, and reviewing guidance and practices. In addition, DOD has made progress in particular areas, such as developing tentative sub-categories to further clarify its existing inventory categories. Overall implementation is generally on schedule, but some of the Plan\u0092s efforts have experienced delays. Moving forward, DOD faces such challenges as adjusting demand planning to changing circumstances, and enforcing consistent implementation of guidance at the military service level.", "As part of the Plan, DOD is developing metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of its inventory management, but it has not determined if it will incorporate these metrics into guidance. This may hamper its ability to assess inventory management performance and sustain management attention on improvement. Materiel managers should evaluate and be capable of reporting on the performance of inventory management. Based on previous reporting, GAO has found that such metrics should be reportable in a consistent fashion. DOD is currently developing a portfolio of metrics that fall under five key areas: readiness, responsiveness, reliability, cost, and planning and precision. Some metrics that have been identified\u0097such as customer wait time\u0097are currently reported by DOD, while others would be new metrics that would require establishing a data source and methodology. However, the Plan does not include steps to incorporate the metrics, including their methodologies, into DOD guidance. Without guidance specifying standardized definitions, methodologies, and procedures for data collection procedures, DOD\u0092s efforts to employ metrics to monitor and evaluate inventory management performance may be hampered.", "Finally, DOD achieved about $710 million in cost avoidances reducing excess inventory in fiscal year 2010, and plans to reduce funding for the purchase of items by $365 million between fiscal year 2012 and 2016.

To ensure the department has consistent data, the  services and DLA are required, among other things, to group their  secondary item inventories into several specific categories, according to  the purpose for which they are held (see figure 1). The reporting  categories include the approved acquisition objective and three inventory  categories that exceed the approved acquisition objective\u2014economic  retention stock, contingency retention stock, and potential reutilization  stock (i.e., on-hand excess inventory). The approved acquisition objective  incorporates both materiel needed to meet the requirements objective  (i.e., the sum of stock represented by the economic order quantity, the  safety level, the repair-cycle level, and the authorized additive levels)  and 2 years of estimated future demand. DOD purchases inventory to  meet the approved acquisition objective, according to DOD officials.  Secondary item inventory that exceeds the approved acquisition objective  is categorized as retention stock or potential reutilization stock.  Retention stock includes economic retention stock, which is materiel that  has been deemed more economical to keep than to dispose of because it  is likely to be needed in the future, and contingency retention stock, which  is materiel retained to support specific contingencies. Potential  reutilization stock has been identified for possible disposal but has  potential for reutilization. Potential reutilization stock is also referred to as  on-hand excess inventory. Additionally, OSD, the services, and DLA track  on-order excess inventory, which are items for which a contract has been  awarded or funds have been obligated, but due to subsequent changes in  requirements would be categorized as potential reutilization stock upon  arrival.

Reducing the percentage of on- order excess inventory would result in less economic or contingency  retention stock being held by the department and/or less potential on- hand excess inventory that must be disposed of by the department since  there is not a need for the item. DOD reduced its percentage of on-order  excess inventory from 8.5 percent, or approximately $1.15 billion, in fiscal  year 2009 to 5.5 percent, or about $940 million, at the end of fiscal year  2010, thereby achieving its 2014 target 4 years early. The Air Force and  Navy (including the Marine Corps), as of fiscal year 2010, were below the  6 percent on-order excess inventory target for fiscal year 2014, whereas  the Army and DLA were above the target. (See figure 3 for the  percentage of on-order excess inventory for fiscal years 2008 to 2010  across DOD.)

Reducing the percentage of on-hand excess  inventory is an indicator of a more effective and efficient inventory  management system, according to DOD officials. In fiscal year 2011,  based on further analysis of the inventory data, DOD revised the  definition of on-hand excess inventory, which resulted in a reduction in its  percentage of on-hand excess from 9.4 percent, or $8.9 billion, in fiscal  year 2009 to 8.3 percent, or $8.4 billion, in fiscal year 2010, which is well  below its fiscal year 2012 target of 10 percent. DOD revised the definition  of on-hand excess inventory to exclude the projected number of  condemned items, which are unserviceable assets that are determined to  be beyond the point of economic repair during the repair process. OSD  officials stated they, in collaboration with the services and DLA, decided  that the projected number of condemnations would not be included in the  on-hand excess inventory calculation because the services and DLA have  no way to dispose of future condemned items, and therefore these items  should not be counted as on-hand excess inventory. In addition, they  stated inclusion of the condemned items would inflate the amount of on- hand excess inventory, thus DOD plans to report projected condemned  items as a separate inventory category in the future. The Army, Air Force,  and DLA are below the 10 percent on-hand excess inventory target for  fiscal year 2012, whereas the Navy (including the Marine Corps) is  slightly above the target.

A critical factor in the success of goal-setting is  developing ambitious, but realistic \u201cstretch\u201d goals that challenge the  organization to achieve performance improvements. DOD inventory  management guidance states that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Logistics and Materiel Readiness is responsible for monitoring the overall  effectiveness and efficiency of DOD\u2019s materiel management systems and  continually developing improvements.

According to DOD officials, establishing optimal  targets for excess inventory is challenging and must consider on-going  operational challenges, such as the potential impact of the reset of  military equipment returning from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the  need to meet service readiness rates. DOD\u2019s targets in the Plan were set  based on an analysis of trends in the inventory data prior to and including  fiscal year 2009. OSD officials described the process used to establish  the targets as one in which OSD, service, and DLA senior officials  reviewed inventory data trends and exercised professional judgment to  select challenging, yet achievable targets to focus the reduction of excess  inventory. When developing the Plan DOD did not know that its on-order  excess inventory target had already been met because departmentwide  inventory data is not available until approximately 6 months after the end  of the fiscal year, which meant the fiscal year 2010 data was not available  until approximately 6 months into the Plan\u2019s implementation. Furthermore,  additional analysis of the inventory data led DOD officials to make  adjustments to the definition and calculation of on-hand excess inventory,  which made the targets for on-hand excess inventory less meaningful.", "DOD officials attribute the reduction in excess inventory to increased  management oversight on the part of OSD, the services, and DLA  leadership, which was prompted by increased congressional oversight  through GAO reviews and the congressional mandate to develop a  comprehensive plan to improve inventory management.

Improving demand forecasting is  difficult because it involves materiel managers having the most up-to- date operational planning information to adequately plan the stocking  of materiel for the customer. The demand forecasting sub-plan  focuses on putting in place more automated methods for exchanging  information that can be used to improve forecasts between inventory  managers and customers, but these efforts are only in the initial  stages.", "Accelerating the use of multi-echelon modeling. DOD set a target  to use multi-echelon modeling on 90 percent of targeted inventories  by the end of fiscal year 2015. As part of its analysis, OSD, the  services, and DLA determined that its targeted inventory is defined as  that portion of the total inventory that includes inventory levels already  set using multi-echelon modeling plus opportunities for additional  application. The targeted inventory is approximately 65 percent of  DOD\u2019s inventory, or $61 billion of DOD\u2019s approximately $95 billion in  inventory for fiscal year 2010. OSD, the services, and DLA are  currently working to identify criteria and business rules for the targeted  inventory that currently uses multi-echelon modeling to be able to  develop opportunities for additional application to accelerate the use  of multi-echelon modeling.", "Implementing revised DOD guidance on retention management.  OSD, the services, and DLA have reviewed existing DOD and service  guidance for the management of on-order excess, economic retention  stock, contingency retention stock, and potential reutilization stock  and are in the process of finalizing revisions to the guidance to be  issued by the end of fiscal year 2012. However, the full  implementation of the revised guidance will occur largely within the  materiel and logistics commands of the services and at DLA. As  reported in our previous reports, existing policies and procedures to  justify and review retention decisions were not implemented  appropriately and consistently within the services and DLA. While  the collaborative review and revision of DOD guidance by OSD, the  services, and DLA was an important first step, the standardized and  effective implementation of these revised policies, once issued, in the  services and DLA will be key to achieving the desired outcomes of the  Plan.", "Fourth, sustaining senior OSD, service, and DLA leadership and  management attention through fiscal year 2015 will be important to  effectively implement the remainder of the Plan. As we noted above,  service and DLA officials told us that sustained leadership focus has been  important thus far in DOD\u2019s implementation efforts. As implementation  moves forward, addressing complex issues such as improving demand  forecasting, accelerating multi-echelon modeling, and ensuring consistent  implementation of DOD inventory management guidance will require  continued management attention and focus.

However, DOD has not made final decisions and the effort is a  work in progress. DOD officials told us that a set of comprehensive,  standardized metrics will allow OSD, the services, and DLA to assess and  balance the effectiveness and efficiency of inventory management  operations within the broader construct of the supply chain. They added  that assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of inventory operations in  isolation from the rest of the supply chain would not be prudent. Rather,  the DOD officials believe an assessment of the effectiveness and  efficiency of inventory management must be conducted more broadly and  take into account additional supply chain metrics, such as the ability of  the supply chain to support the readiness of the force in a timely manner.  Thus, OSD, the services, and DLA are working collaboratively to identify  or develop the appropriate metrics, including the data source and  methodology for producing the metrics.", "OSD, the services, and DLA are currently developing possible  departmentwide supply chain metrics, including inventory management  metrics, to monitor the performance of the supply chain.

To support the  measurement of the outcome and attributes, the supply chain metrics  group identified potential departmentwide metrics to be collected and  assessed.

Other  potential metrics, such as the \u201cnot mission capable rate for maintenance  or supply\u201d related to the readiness attribute, are reported within DOD by  other entities. On the other hand, there are metrics, such as the \u201ctiered  inventory turns\u201d metric related to the cost attribute and \u201cdemand forecast  error\u201d, for which business rules are being established for the computation  and collection of the data for the metric.", "As we recently reported, DOD has been challenged by developing  departmentwide performance measures for supply chain management,  including inventory operations.

The policy also states that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness is responsible for  monitoring the overall effectiveness and efficiency of its materiel  management systems and continually developing improvements and that  materiel managers should evaluate and be capable of reporting on the  performance of inventory management, and more broadly supply chain  operations. Based on our previous reporting, we have found that such  metrics should be reportable in a consistent fashion and used to evaluate  performance. Further, we have found establishing metrics, and  monitoring and evaluating program performance are key practices in  results-oriented-management.", "A key part of metrics being reportable in a consistent fashion is ensuring  that standardized definitions, methodologies, and procedures will be  used. The services and DLA will be relied upon to generate the data for  some of the departmentwide inventory management metrics; thus, efforts  to monitor and evaluate inventory management performance may be  hampered without standardized definitions, methodologies, and  procedures for the consistent collection of data for the metrics. In the  past, DOD has institutionalized supply chain metrics through guidance.  For example, OSD issued guidance to the services and DLA that  provided a standardized definition and procedures for measuring and  reporting the \u201ccustomer wait time\u201d metric to OSD.ensure that the services and DLA collect the data needed on a  standardized basis for the departmentwide metric so that decision makers  can evaluate performance across the department. Furthermore,  incorporating the inventory management metrics into the department\u2019s  guidance and procedures would result in the institutionalization of the  metrics and assist in sustaining a results-oriented management  framework for inventory management beyond the Plan\u2019s implementation.

Additionally, as part of the  Plan\u2019s implementation, DOD reduced the resources available to its  working capital funds to purchase secondary inventory items.Specifically, DOD reduced the departmentwide dollar value of on-order  excess inventory from fiscal years 2009 to 2010, by approximately $210  million\u2014a reduction from $1.15 billion, or 8.5 percent of total on-order  dollars, to $940 million, or 5.5 percent. With respect to on-hand excess  inventory, DOD reduced the departmentwide dollar value of on-hand  excess inventory from fiscal years 2009 to 2010, by approximately $500  million\u2014a reduction from $8.9 billion, or 9.4 percent of the total value of  the inventory, to $8.4 billion, or 8.3 percent. According to OSD officials,  reducing the percentage of on-order and on-hand excess inventory from  fiscal year 2009 to 2010 indicates that the department\u2019s focused  management efforts have started to yield cost avoidances and more  effective inventory management operations. Lower levels of on-order  excess mean that DOD is purchasing items that are needed to meet the  approved acquisition objective rather than items that will be classified as  potential reutilization stock, or on-hand excess, upon arrival. Reducing  the level of on-hand excess means that DOD is purchasing items that are  needed, retaining items as economic or contingency retention stock,  and/or disposing of items more efficiently that are no longer needed by  the department. Additionally, OSD, the services, and DLA have increased  participation in the in-storage visibility program, which allows services and  DLA to obtain consumable items from another service or DLA to prevent  the procurement of additional items. The program completed $73.8 million  lateral redistributions and procurement offsets in fiscal year 2010 and  $68.3 million in fiscal year 2011, which prevented the acquisition of  additional items.", "DOD also plans to reduce the resources available in its working capital  funds to purchase secondary inventory items by about $365 million over  fiscal years 2012 to 2016 as part of the Plan\u2019s implementation. As part of  the fiscal year 2012 budget deliberations, OSD implemented a  management decision that reduced the obligation authority for the Army  and DLA working capital funds by $39 million in fiscal year 2012. DOD  has identified further reductions of obligation authority to the respective  working capital funds for fiscal years 2013 to 2016, which are displayed in  table 5. The reductions only impact the Army and DLA because neither  met the percentage targets established for on-order excess inventory in  the Plan\u20146 percent by fiscal year 2014 and 4 percent by fiscal year  2016. According to OSD officials, these reductions in obligation  authority are intended to heighten management attention on efforts to  reduce the Army and DLA\u2019s on-order excess inventory. The Navy  (including the Marine Corps) and Air Force were below these targets;  thus, no reductions are currently planned for their working capital funds  as part of this effort.", "Since the working capital funds generally rely on sales revenue (i.e., a  military unit purchasing a spare part from the working capital fund with  appropriated operation and maintenance funds), rather than direct annual  appropriations to finance the purchase of secondary inventory items,  these reductions to obligation authority are not directly reducing the  expenditure of appropriated funds. Rather, the reductions to obligation  authority mean that the working capital fund has reduced purchase  authority for additional secondary items for the inventory, resulting in a  lower inventory replenishment rate. While these reductions will not  directly result in savings to direct appropriation accounts, OSD, Army, and  DLA officials told us that the reduction of obligation authority will require  the Army and DLA to better manage its available resources for  purchasing new secondary items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effective and efficient management of DOD\u2019s inventory is critical to  supporting the readiness of the force, and requires a balanced approach.

Based on Navy demand  forecasts, inventory that exceeded current requirements was sufficient to  satisfy several years, or even decades, of anticipated supply needs. Also,  a large proportion of the items that exceeded current requirements had no  projected demand because the Navy had not systematically evaluated the  effectiveness of its demand forecasting. Navy inventory did not align with  current requirements because (1) the Navy has not established the cost  efficiency of its inventory management, (2) its demand forecasting  effectiveness is limited and requirements for items may change frequently  after purchase decisions are made, and (3) it has not adjusted certain  inventory management practices in response to the unpredictability in  demand.

Additionally, the Air Force continued to retain unneeded  inventory with no recurring demands because it had not performed a  comprehensive assessment to revalidate the need to continue to retain  these items. Inventory not needed to support required inventory levels  can be attributed to many long-standing problems, such as decreasing  demands, retaining items used to support aging weapon systems that  have diminishing sources of supply or are being phased out of service,  and not terminating contracts for on-order items.
