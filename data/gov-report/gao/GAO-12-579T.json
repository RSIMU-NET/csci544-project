These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; application of untested updates and software patches; acquisition of equipment, software, or services from suppliers without knowledge of their past performance or corporate structure; and use of insecure delivery or storage mechanisms. These vulnerabilities could by exploited by malicious actors, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain.", "The four national security-related agencies in GAO\u0092s review\u0097the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and Defense\u0097varied in the extent to which they have addressed supply chain risks. Specifically, Energy and Homeland Security had not yet defined supply chain protection measures for department information systems and are not in a position to develop implementing procedures and monitoring capabilities. Justice has defined supply chain protection measures but has not developed implementation procedures or monitoring capabilities. Until these agencies develop comprehensive policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities, increased risk exists that they will be vulnerable to IT supply chain threats. By contrast, the Department of Defense has made greater progress: it has defined supply chain protection measures and implementing procedures and initiated efforts to monitor compliance and effectiveness.

As you know, information systems and the products and  services that support them are essential for government operations.  Federal agencies rely extensively on computerized information systems  and electronic data to carry out their operations, and securing these  systems and data is essential to protecting national and economic  security.", "As commerce has become more globalized, the supply chain for IT and  services has become increasingly complex. This complexity, in turn,  creates potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber threats,  potentially degrading the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical  and sensitive networks, IT-enabled equipment, and data. These threats  can be introduced in the manufacturing, assembly, and distribution of  hardware, software, and services and can appear at each phase of the IT  system development life cycle. In January 2012, the Director of National  Intelligence identified the vulnerabilities associated with the IT supply  chain for the nation\u2019s networks as one of the greatest strategic cyber  threat challenges the country faces. In addition, we have identified the  protection of federal information systems as a governmentwide high-risk  area since 1997.", "My testimony today summarizes the contents of our recently issued report  on IT supply chain risks, which, among other things, identified key risks  associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT  equipment, software, or services, and assessed the extent to which four  national security-related agencies have addressed such risks.preparing this statement in March 2012, we relied on the work supporting  this report. In producing that report, we analyzed federal acquisition and  information security laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines;  examined departmental policies and procedures; and interviewed officials  from four national security-related departments, the intelligence  community, and nonfederal entities. The report contains a more detailed  overview of the scope of our review and the methodology used. The work  on upon which this statement is based was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.

Each of these components may rely on one or more supply  chains. Obtaining a full understanding of the sources of a given  information system can also be extremely complex. According to the  Software Engineering Institute, the identity of each product or service  provider may not be visible to others in the supply chain. Typically, an  acquirer, such as a federal agency, will only know about the participants  directly connected to it in the supply chain. In addition, the complexity of  corporate structures, in which a parent company (or its subsidiaries) may  own or control companies that conduct business under different names in  multiple countries, presents additional challenges to fully understanding  the sources of an information system. As a result, the acquirer will have  little visibility into the supply chains of its suppliers.", "Federal procurement law and policies promote the acquisition of  commercial products when they meet the government\u2019s needs.  Commercial providers of IT use a global supply chain to design, develop,  manufacture, and distribute hardware and software products throughout  the world. Many of the manufacturing inputs required for those products\u2014 whether physical materials or knowledge\u2014are acquired from various  sources around the globe. Figure 1 depicts the potential countries of  origin of common suppliers of various components within a commercially  available laptop computer.", "The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)  establishes federal agency information security program requirements  that support the effectiveness of information security controls over  information resources that support federal operations and assets. Its  framework creates a cycle of risk management activities necessary for an  effective security program, and it assigns responsibilities to the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for providing standards and  guidelines on information security.", "In its August 2009 revision of Special Publication (SP) 800-53 (Revision  3), which provides recommended security controls for federal agencies  and organizations, NIST included for the first time a security control for  supply chain protection (SA-12). SA-12 identified several specific  measures organizations could use to provide additional supply chain  protections, such as conducting due diligence reviews of suppliers; using  trusted shipping and warehousing; and employing independent analysis  and penetration testing of IT systems, components, and products. In  addition, SP 800-53, Revision 3, includes a security control for system  and service acquisition policies and procedures (SA-1). Thus, for  systems where both controls are selected, agencies should develop,  disseminate, and review acquisition policy and implementing procedures  that help protect against supply chain threats throughout the system  development life cycle. Further, in March 2011, NIST published SP 800- 39, an approach to organizationwide management of information security  risk, which states that organizations should monitor risk on an ongoing  basis as part of a comprehensive risk management program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IT Supply Chain Presents Numerous Information Security Risks to Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal  information systems and underscores the importance of threat  assessments and risk mitigation.

However, the department was unable to provide  details on implementation progress, milestones for completion, or how  supply chain protection measures would be defined. Because it had  not defined these measures or associated implementing procedures,  the department was also not in a position to monitor compliance or  effectiveness.", "Although its information security guidance mentions the NIST control  related to supply chain protection, DHS has not defined the supply  chain protection measures that system owners should employ. The  department\u2019s information security policy manager stated that it was in  the process of developing policy that would address supply chain  protection, but did not provide details on when it would be completed.  In addition, in the absence of such a policy, DHS was not in a position  to develop implementation procedures or to monitor compliance or  effectiveness.", "The Department of Justice has defined specific security measures for  protecting against supply chain threats through the use of provisions  in vendor contracts and agreements. Officials identified (1) a  citizenship and residency requirement and (2) a national security risk  questionnaire as two provisions that address supply chain risk.  However, Justice has not developed procedures for ensuring the  effective implementation of these protection measures or a  mechanism for verifying compliance with and the effectiveness of  these measures.", "By contrast, the Department of Defense has made more progress.  Specifically, the department\u2019s supply chain risk management efforts  began in 2003 and include a policy requiring supply chain risk to be addressed early and across  a system\u2019s entire life cycle and calling for an incremental  implementation of supply chain risk management through a series of  pilot projects; a requirement that every acquisition program submit and update a  \u201cprogram protection plan\u201d that is to, among other things, help manage  risks from supply chain exploits or design vulnerabilities; procedures for implementing supply chain protection measures, such  as an implementation guide describing 32 specific measures for  enhancing supply chain protection and procedures for program  protection plans identifying ways in which programs should manage  supply chain risk; and a monitoring mechanism to determine the status and effectiveness of  supply chain protection pilot projects, as well as monitoring  compliance with and effectiveness of program protection policies and  procedures for several acquisition programs.", "In addition, the four national security-related agencies participate in  interagency efforts to address supply chain security, including  participation in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative,development of technical and policy tools, and collaboration with the  intelligence community. In support of the cybersecurity initiative, Defense  and DHS jointly lead an interagency initiative on supply chain risk  management to address issues of globalization affecting the federal  government\u2019s IT. Also, DHS has developed a comprehensive portfolio of  technical and policy-based product offerings for federal civilian  departments and agencies, including technical assessment capabilities,  acquisition support, and incident response capabilities.

Energy also expressed concern that the  recommendations are not fully aligned with the administration\u2019s initiatives  and stated that it believes policies and standards to address IT supply  chain risk management must be coordinated at the national level, not  independently through individual agencies. We agree that national or  federal policies and standards should be coordinated and promulgated at  the national or federal level. However, we also believe\u2013as intended by our  recommendations\u2014that federal departments are responsible for  developing departmental policies and procedures that are consistent and  aligned with federal guidance.
