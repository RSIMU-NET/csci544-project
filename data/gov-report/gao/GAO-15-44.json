The revisions include provisions for DCAA auditors to document (1) that access to company internal audit reports is necessary to an ongoing DCAA audit, (2) the request sent to the company, and (3) the company's response. However, based on GAO's review of selected cases, implementing the changes has been inconsistent across the agency. GAO randomly selected eight requests for companies' internal audits and compared them to the mandated requirements and DCAA instructions provided to its auditors as criteria to test whether or not the three documentation requirements had been properly recorded. None of eight cases sampled had complete records for the three required documents. The figure below shows the results of GAO's examination of the eight requests.", "DCAA's revised guidance is specific about physical safeguards for companies' internal audit information. For example, the Contract Audit Manual contains extensive guidance for physically securing proprietary information and specifies that the working papers should not include a copy of the companies' internal audit reports. However, the guidance is less specific about safeguards to prevent unauthorized use of internal audit reports; that is, using the reports for purposes other than evaluating the efficacy of internal controls or the reliability of the business systems. In particular, the guidance does not define authorized use, provide examples of authorized use, or identify a specific approach for implementing safeguards. Officials stated that plans for an electronic storage system for safeguarding companies' internal audits from unauthorized use are in process as well as guidance for using them. The planned electronic storage capability would provide limited access rights to companies' internal audit reports and thus help ensure better tracking and limit the potential for unauthorized use."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DCAA clarify its guidance and establish and monitor internal controls to help ensure that requests for company internal audits are fully documented in accordance with the act, and that the guidance defines authorized use.

As a part of its audits, DCAA  examines internal controls for those systems. DCAA\u2019s contract audit  services are intended to help ensure that prices paid by the government  are fair and reasonable and that companies are charging the government  in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, cost accounting  standards, and contract terms.

The revised guidance was also to include  guidance for implementing appropriate safeguards for company internal  audits. We assessed (1) the extent to which DCAA\u2019s revised guidance  complied with the act and whether selected requests for company internal  audit reports were documented in accordance with the requirements, and  (2) the extent to which DCAA\u2019s revised guidance contains safeguards to  help ensure that internal audit reports obtained from companies are used  only for authorized purposes.", "To address our objectives, we compared the provisions of the act to the  revised audit guidance to determine whether the revisions included  directions for documenting requests for company internal audits, the  connections to DCAA\u2019s work and the company\u2019s responses and  safeguards for the internal audits. We obtained DCAA submissions to  headquarters for 163 requests with embedded documents. The  documents included the requests, any response from the company, and  the written connection between the requested audit and DCAA\u2019s ongoing  work. We interviewed officials about the process for compiling the  documents and examined DCAA\u2019s implementing guidance. We concluded  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of selecting a  sample and determining whether the requests contained the required  information in accordance with our objectives. We selected a  nongeneralizable, random sample of 8 DCAA requests from the 163  requests DCAA sent to companies between June 1, 2013, and December  1, 2013, to examine in detail. We compared the documents provided with  each request to both the NDAA requirements and DCAA\u2019s guidance to  determine if the records contained (1) a written request for the company  audit reports, (2) a link between the work DCAA was doing and the  company report requested and (3) the company response. We  interviewed DCAA officials about changes to the Contract Audit Manual,  memorandums amplifying the requirements in the NDAA, training  provided to auditors, and any management reviews to ensure the  guidance was executed according to DCAA policy. We based our  evaluation of DCAA\u2019s documentation on standards for documentation and  supervisory review contained in generally accepted government auditing  standards (GAGAS).", "We believe the information we collected was sufficiently reliable to  provide a reasonable basis for our analysis.", "To evaluate the extent to which DCAA officials are monitoring the  execution of the guidance, we obtained management reports for two of  the semi-annual periods, January to June, 2013, and June to December,  2013. We compared the guidance in the templates provided for reporting  information about company requests with the information contained in the  spreadsheets prepared for the reports. Our analysis included checking  that the request to the company was included in the documentation; that  the request contained a clear connection between DCAA\u2019s work and the  audit and that it included how obtaining the audit would benefit DCAA\u2019s  work; we examined the documentation for evidence of a company  response and for the rationale for denying the request, if a request was  denied by the company. We determined that the electronic documentation  was reliable for the information we sought. We contacted DCAA auditors  in cases where documentation appeared lacking to determine their  understanding of the documentation required. The results of our  examination provide insights into how the regions implement the  guidance but cannot be generalized across DCAA\u2019s requests for internal  audits.", "To determine DCAA response to providing safeguards for company  internal audit reports, we compared DCAA\u2019s revised guidance to the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 requirements. We obtained memorandums  implementing the guidance and compared it to the guidance in the  Contract Audit Manual. We discussed DCAA\u2019s response to the NDAA  requirements for safeguarding company audits with DCAA officials. We  also discussed DCAA\u2019s plans to take additional steps to safeguard  company audits and discussed the timing of those plans. To obtain the  perspective of companies who have been asked or may be asked to  provide internal audit reports, we met with representatives of the  Committee on Government Business of Financial Executives International  organization and discussed company perspectives on safeguards and the  definition of authorized use.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to November 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Penny Berrier, Assistant Director,  Marycella Cortes, Jessica Drucker, Danielle Greene, John Krump, Jean  McSween, Carol T.
