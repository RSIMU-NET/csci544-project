The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Act of 2007 required the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress that addresses the vulnerabilities along the northern border, and provides recommendations and required resources to address them. The act also required GAO to review and comment on this report. In response to this mandate, GAO examined (1) the extent to which the DHS report to Congress is responsive to the legislative requirements and (2) actions that may be necessary to address northern border vulnerabilities in addition to the actions addressed in the report. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed DHS plans, reports, and other documents, and interviewed DHS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The DHS February 2008 report to Congress is not fully responsive to legislative requirements in providing information for improving northern border security. In particular, DHS provided a listing of northern border vulnerabilities and initiatives to address them, but did not include recommendations and additional resources that are needed to protect the northern border. DHS officials provided several reasons for the lack of specificity and gaps in reported information, including the fact that the component agencies' priorities for action and resources are reflected in the existing budget process, and that they had nothing further to recommend or request through this report. However, budget documents do not reflect the resources needed over time to achieve control of the northern border. The lack of this information makes it difficult for Congress to consider future actions and resources needed. DHS is developing northern border strategic plans and a risk-management process to help guide and prioritize action and resources, and fully implementing recommendations from past GAO evaluations would also provide benefit in addressing northern border security vulnerabilities. DHS is currently developing strategic plans that are intended to provide overall direction in addressing vulnerabilities in northern border security. DHS is also developing a risk-management process to assist in prioritizing efforts and resources that will provide greatest benefit to national security. DHS officials have said that the success of various pilot projects, such as DHS's testing of new technology, will likely change the level and mix of resources needed to protect the northern border. In the meantime, DHS could take action to reduce vulnerabilities by implementing recommendations made in past evaluations. DHS has implemented 11 GAO recommendations designed to improve border security, but 39 recommendations are yet to be fully addressed. Eighteen of these open recommendations were made within the last year. However, 21 recommendations for improving use of air and marine assets, improving screening processes at the ports of entry, and deploying nuclear detection equipment--which DHS and other agencies generally agreed to take action to implement--have remained open for at least 1 year and, in some cases, over 3 years. GAO believes these outstanding recommendations continue to have merit and should be implemented."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S.-Canadian border stands as the longest undefended border in the  world, covering nearly 4,000 miles of land and water, most of which is  sparsely populated with limited law enforcement presence.

Specifically, the Implementing Recommendations of  the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act) required the Secretary of  Homeland Security to submit a report within 180 days of enactment that  was to (1) address the vulnerabilities along the northern border, and   (2) provide recommendations to address such vulnerabilities, including  required resources needed to protect the border.", "The 9/11 Act also directed us to submit to Congress, within 270 days of  DHS\u2019s report, a report that reviews and comments on the DHS report, and  to provide recommendations regarding any additional actions necessary to  protect the northern border. In response to this mandate, we prepared  this report to answer the following key questions:    To what extent is the DHS report to Congress responsive to the  legislative requirements to report on ongoing initiatives to improve U.S.  northern border security, address the vulnerabilities along the northern  border, and provide recommendations to address these vulnerabilities  and required resources to protect the northern border?  In addition to the actions addressed in the report, what actions may be  necessary to address northern border security vulnerabilities?", "In conducting our work, we reviewed the DHS report structure and  content against requirements in the 9/11 Act. We also reviewed whether  the DHS report content was complete and consistent with information  provided in its key management documents including strategic plans,  performance and accountability reports, budget requests, and other  documentation produced by relevant DHS agencies. We interviewed DHS  officials from CBP, ICE, and USCG located at headquarters and Detroit,  Michigan, who had roles and responsibilities for northern border security  to obtain their perspectives on documented information. For this reason,  we also interviewed Department of Justice (DOJ) officials with the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA), which has national responsibility for  drug enforcement, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which  has national responsibility for terrorism. We selected Detroit, Michigan,  among CBP\u2019s Office of Border Patrol\u2019s (OBP) eight northern border  sectors based on factors including relative threat and vulnerabilities,  priority for resources, and demonstration site for new technology. Our  observations from the Detroit sector cannot be generalized across the  other seven sectors; however, we believe that they were sufficient for the  purposes of this report in comparing the headquarters and field  perspective. While in Detroit, we also spoke with state and Canadian  officials involved in northern border security to obtain their perspectives  on northern border security threats and vulnerabilities, DHS actions to  address them, and the effectiveness of binational and national  partnerships. To determine actions that could help address northern  border security vulnerabilities, we reviewed whether the information  reported by DHS reflected a strategic risk\u2013informed approach as required  in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 7 (HSPD-7). We also identified report recommendations for  strengthening national border security from past GAO evaluations from  fiscal years 2005 through 2008 that when fully implemented have potential  to help address northern border vulnerabilities.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2008 through November  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Annually, CBP reports making  approximately 4,000 arrests and interdicts approximately 40,000 pounds of  illegal drugs at and between the northern border ports of entry.  Historically, these numbers have been significantly lower than those of the  southwest border; however, DHS reports that the terrorist threat on the  northern border is higher, given the large expanse of area with limited law  enforcement coverage.", "DHS agencies are charged with protecting the nation and its citizens from  threats of terrorism, as shown in table 1. CBP is the lead federal agency in  charge of securing our nation\u2019s borders, and has three components with a  mission to interdict illegal contraband and persons seeking to enter  illegally at and between the land ports of entry. Two other DHS agencies,  ICE and USCG, also have key roles.

Congress has shown increasing interest in issues  surrounding security of the northern border\u2014first authorizing, and later  directing\u2014resource allocations to the northern border for personnel and  improved technology. Congress has also established various reporting  requirements in laws that are to provide updates on the status of northern  border security.

A key effort under development is an overall northern border  strategic plan that will, for the first time, take all DHS component agencies  into account in efforts to address vulnerabilities necessary for control of  the northern border. CBP did not indicate when this plan may be  completed. A second strategic plan under development will address  security vulnerabilities in the air environment, such as the inability to  detect low-flying aircraft.

Risk management is important  for strengthening homeland security resource allocations, as the nation  cannot afford to fully protect against every type of threat. Therefore, an  approach is needed that considers how best to allocate resources based on  factors such as probability and adverse consequence. The DHS goal is to  develop a risk-management process that will assess risk and inform  strategic planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes  across all of its component agencies and that will evaluate the risk- reduction effects among relevant DHS programs. However, achieving this  goal has been difficult. While risk management has been used in the  private and public sectors for decades, its application for homeland  security and combating terrorism is relatively new and without a  precedent framework.
