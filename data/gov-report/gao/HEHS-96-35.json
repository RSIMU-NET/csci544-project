Lack of such care can adversely affect their health status throughout their lives.", "In the mid-1980s, several states began using state and other nonfederal funds to develop health insurance programs for children who were caught in the uninsured gap between private insurance and Medicaid, the federal/state program that insures some low-income people. In addition to state efforts, Blue Cross/Blue Shield organizations throughout the United States developed privately funded programs to insure children. At the same time, the federal government and many states expanded eligibility for Medicaid, the primary source of insurance for poor children.", "The 104th Congress is considering legislation making the Medicaid program into a block grant, limiting the growth of program expenditures, and removing most guarantees of eligibility for coverage and requirements for states to cover services. Such restructuring could give states significantly more flexibility in how they provide insurance to children.", "In light of these developments, you asked us to examine emerging state and private efforts to insure children who are not eligible for Medicaid and whose families are not able to purchase private coverage. Specifically, you asked us to provide information on (1) enrollment, costs, funding sources, and annual budgets of these state and private programs; (2) the strategies these programs have used to manage costs while providing children access to health care; and (3) program design elements that have facilitated program implementation.", "To answer these questions, we visited six programs in five states: two privately funded programs\u2014the Alabama Caring Program for Children and the Western Pennsylvania Caring Program for Children\u2014and four state-funded programs\u2014the Florida Healthy Kids Program, MinnesotaCare, New York\u2019s Child Health Plus Program, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. We selected programs that had at least 2 years\u2019 operational experience at the time of our visit and that represented a variety of approaches in diverse geographic areas.

Children without health insurance are also less likely to be appropriately immunized\u2014an important step in preventing childhood illnesses.", "During the 1980s, employment-based health insurance\u2014the most common source of health coverage for Americans\u2014decreased. By 1993, more than 39 million Americans lacked any type of health insurance. Almost one-quarter of these people were children, despite the relative affordability of providing insurance for children.", "Uninsured children are generally children of lower-income workers. Lower-income workers are less likely than higher-income workers to have health insurance for their families because they are less likely to work for a firm that offers insurance for their families. Even if such insurance is offered, it may be too costly for lower-income workers to purchase. In 1993, 61 percent of uninsured children were in families with at least one parent who worked full time for the entire year the child was uninsured. About 57 percent of uninsured children had family income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level.", "Recognizing the need to provide insurance for children, the federal government and the states expanded children\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid, a jointly funded federal/state entitlement program. Beginning in 1986, the Congress passed a series of Medicaid-expansion laws that required states to provide coverage to certain children and pregnant women and gave states the option to expand eligibility further. Many states opted to use this approach instead of funding their own programs, because expanding Medicaid allowed them to get matching federal funds. As of April 1995, 37 states and the District of Columbia had expanded coverage for infants or children beyond federal requirements. In addition to these expansions, between 1991 and August 1995, five states implemented Medicaid demonstration waivers, some of which included coverage expansions to some uninsured children. Between 1989 and 1993, Medicaid expanded from covering 14 percent of U.S. children (8.9 million) to 20 percent (13.7 million).

Every state had substantially more uninsured children than children enrolled in one of these programs.

In 1994, these programs enrolled from 39 to 98,538 children and had budgets ranging from about $240,000 to about $71.5 million.", "In addition to state-level efforts, the private sector developed voluntary insurance programs supported through philanthropic funding. The best known of these are the Caring Programs, sponsored by 24 Blue Cross/Blue Shield organizations in 22 states. The Caring Programs, which served more than 41,000 children in 1994, ranged in size from 400 to almost 6,000 enrolled children and had budgets from $100,000 to $4.3 million.", "The four state- and two privately funded programs that we visited varied in enrollments and funding sources. They provided insurance coverage to between 5,532 and 104,248 children under set yearly budgets. Much of the state programs\u2019 funding came from state general revenues, cigarette or tobacco taxes, or health care provider taxes; counties; and foundations and other private-sector entities. The private programs each received funding from Blue Cross/Blue Shield and from private individuals and organizations.", "The programs\u2019 costs, covered services, and premium subsidies also varied. Moreover, four of the programs operated statewide, but Florida Healthy Kids and the Western Pennsylvania Caring Program for Children operated only in certain counties. (See table 1.)", "Unlike state Medicaid programs, which operate as open-ended federal/state entitlements, all the programs we reviewed operated within limited and fixed budgets. These budgets did not allow them to cover most of the uninsured children in their states. The private program budgets were limited by the amount that could be raised by corporate donors, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and individual donors. The state-funded programs had larger budgets, but they, too, were limited by the amount of funding states were willing to devote to insuring children.", "All the states in which these programs operated had more uninsured children than children enrolled in the programs.For example, New York\u2019s Child Health Plus Program represented a substantial investment for the state in children\u2019s health coverage\u2014$55 million\u2014and it had the largest enrollment: 104,248. But in 1993, New York State had almost half a million uninsured children. Other programs could only cover a small fraction of their uninsured. For example, Alabama had 156,000 uninsured children in 1993, and its Caring Program covered 5,922 in 1995\u2014only about 3 percent. MinnesotaCare had the highest ratio of enrolled children in 1995 to uninsured children in 1993: 44,689 to 76,517, or 58 percent.", "Lack of funding forced all the programs we visited (except Minnesota\u2019s) to restrict enrollment at times and to relegate children who applied for the program to waiting lists.

All six were designed to complement Medicaid coverage for children, since none enrolled children who had Medicaid coverage and most tried to steer possibly eligible children to Medicaid first.

In addition, most programs offered other benefits, such as mental health services, vision and hearing care, and prescription drugs. Three of the state- and privately financed programs also provided some dental services.

According to officials from two of these programs, the families of children who needed hospitalization could qualify for Medicaid services through medically needy spenddown provisions because of the cost of the care. Under spenddown, the cost of expensive services, such as hospitalization, is deducted from family income to determine the child\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. Pennsylvania\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program was planned to shift the costs of inpatient care to Medicaid when possible. The program covers 3 days of hospitalization, after which families are required to apply for Medicaid.

(See table 2.)", "Cost-sharing provisions varied by program. Family premium payments priced on a sliding scale based on family income as a percent of FPL were required by the four state-funded programs. Copayments for some services were required by three of the four state-funded programs and the two Caring programs. However, two state-funded programs did not require families in the lowest income range to pay any portion of the premium.", "All of the state-funded programs expected families with income that exceeded the lowest income level to pay a portion of their child\u2019s premium. However, the size of the premium varied for families with similar incomes. For example, a family with an income at 200 percent of FPL would pay at least $43 per month in Florida to enroll one child and at least $39.75 in Pennsylvania, but only $2.08 in New York.", "Some advocates expressed concern that premium contributions were too high for lower-income families in Pennsylvania and Minnesota and that high premium contributions discouraged these families from enrolling their children.

When the Healthy Kids premium dropped below $50, she reported, the number of enrollees who paid the full premium increased.", "Two state-funded programs, those in Florida and New York, covered children at any income level as long as families with income over a specified level paid the full premium cost. Although this approach enabled those programs to help any uninsured child, relatively few children were enrolled when families had to pay all of the premium. New York targeted its outreach to lower-income families, which might explain why so few full-premium children enrolled, according to one New York program official.

Programs like Pennsylvania\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the Florida Healthy Kids Program negotiated prices for their premiums assuming that the programs would attract children who would be more costly to serve than privately insured children.
