Human factors affect the operation of all of FAA\u2019s functions, including research, the acquisition of equipment, and safety. FAA\u2019s work on human factors focuses on such issues as whether equipment is designed to enhance operators\u2019 performance and minimize errors and whether the procedures used by air traffic controllers promote safe operations. For example, much of the information conveyed to pilots by air traffic controllers has been standardized to minimize the possibility of misunderstanding. (See app. I for a more complete definition of human factors and examples of how human factors have affected safety in specific situations.)", "The Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 directed FAA to augment its research on human factors and coordinate its work with that of NASA and Defense because the Congress believed that FAA did not have sufficient expertise in all areas of human factors. A report by the Office of Technology Assessment, cited in the House report on the act as the basis for the legislation, recommended that FAA allocate resources for developing its regulatory support staffs\u2019 expertise in human factors and establish a focal point for human factors within the agency.

However, we found that the Human Factors Division\u2019s ability to provide this support depends on the extent to which the associate administrators and program directors use the division. FAA does not require the division\u2014or any other unit with scientific and technical expertise in human factors\u2014to review the quality of the work on human factors performed by other FAA units or contractors. FAA does not require its administrators to seek guidance from human factors specialists, such as those in the Human Factors Division. Although the scope of our audit did not include a detailed examination of the application of human factors in acquisitions, we have previously found inadequate technical oversight in FAA\u2019s management of acquisitions. For example, in a previous review of FAA\u2019s modernization program, we found that not following the technical principles of the human factors discipline in designing equipment delayed some projects.

As a first step in ensuring that human factors are considered in acquisitions, the Human Factors Division developed a requirement in FAA\u2019s 1993 acquisition policy that all new acquisition projects include a human factors plan. Such a plan was to (1) describe how considerations of human factors should be applied and (2) document how a piece of equipment or a process should perform when operated as expected by the end-users.", "However, on April 1, 1996, in response to new legislation exempting FAA from most federal procurement statutes, FAA implemented the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System, which superseded FAA\u2019s 1993 acquisition policy. According to the initial guidance provided for this new system, human factors may be formally considered at an earlier stage in the acquisition process than previously, but this early consideration is not required.

To develop its initial objectives for research on human factors, FAA participated in a task force in April 1989, sponsored by the Air Transport Association of America. This task force identified a number of significant research topics, which FAA incorporated into the National Plan for Civil Aviation Human Factors. This plan\u2014developed by the Human Factors Division in conjunction with the Department of Defense, NASA, industry, and academia\u2014includes a framework that categorizes research on the basis of five priorities, or \u201cthrusts,\u201d and provides guidelines for initiating and managing research on human factors in aviation. (See app. II for a description of each priority and a listing of the ongoing projects under each.) Besides participating in the task force, the Human Factors Division has worked with the aviation community to develop research issues by participating in conferences and workshops. In comparing FAA\u2019s processes to the aviation community\u2019s, we found that FAA not only looks to the aviation community but the aviation community also often looks to FAA to focus attention on particular research issues. For example, FAA sponsored a national conference in 1995 on the challenge of approaching zero accidents.", "In addition, the Human Factors Division identifies research issues that the aviation community may not. For example, by managing the research sponsored by FAA units, the Human Factors Division is able to identify research needs that may apply to other FAA units and the aviation community as a whole.", "According to the Assistant Administrator, the newly created Office of System Safety will proactively seek to identify safety issues that may indicate the need for additional research on human factors. For example, this office has assumed responsibility from the Office of Aviation Safety for an ongoing project to develop methods for extracting information on human factors from FAA\u2019s existing sources of data. However, according to the Assistant Administrator, this office has not yet developed a research agenda. While staff from the office have met with personnel from the Human Factors Division, no joint activities have been established and no plans have been developed for interactions between the two units.", "Although the Human Factors Division identifies FAA\u2019s needs for research on human factors, at least one operating unit is also independently identifying and executing its own research needs. The Office of Regulation and Certification identifies research issues on the basis of its needs and determines what organization will conduct the research. Specifically, the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification has established a Human Factors Task Force to review existing literature; obtain information from avionics manufacturers, operators, and industry technical groups; and conduct simulations. The task force was not chartered to initiate research; however, it may make recommendations leading to research on human factors. The Human Factors Division was involved neither in determining the need for the task force nor in planning its work.
