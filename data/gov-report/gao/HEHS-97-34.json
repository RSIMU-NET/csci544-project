Intent on improving services for children and their families as well as reducing foster care costs, states began to reconsider their approach to child welfare. Rather than waiting until families reached the crisis stage, they began to focus more on early intervention and preventive services designed to strengthen and support families. By the early 1990s, however, the child welfare system was overwhelmed by the needs of an increasing number of at-risk families and children. States argued that additional federal funding was needed to supplement current state and federally funded programs. Therefore, to assist states in providing services designed to support families and help keep them together, the Congress enacted legislation as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) that authorized $930 million in federal funds to states over a 5-year period for family preservation and support (FPS) services. Family preservation services typically target families already in crisis whose children would otherwise be removed from home. Family support services are community-based activities intended to prevent the kinds of crises that family preservation services are aimed at alleviating. To receive federal funds for these services, each state had to submit a grant application in 1994 and a 5-year plan in 1995 that set quantifiable goals and methods for measuring outcomes.", "In response to your request concerning the status of states\u2019 use of funds for FPS services, this report describes (1) the nature and extent of states\u2019 use of federal funds for new and expanded FPS services and (2) states\u2019 plans to assess the impact of these services on children and their families and impacts identified to date. This report builds on our prior work that assessed early federal and state implementation efforts.", "To collect information on states\u2019 use of federal funds for and the impact of FPS services, we conducted a nationwide survey of state child welfare agencies; held in-depth interviews with officials in nine states and five localities; interviewed Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials in its headquarters office; and reviewed related federal and state budget, summary, guidance, planning documents, and progress reports. (See app. I for more details of our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported that states originally funded most FPS services themselves or with nonfederal funds. As the demand for services increased and available resources became more constrained, states sought additional funding from federal sources, such as Title IV-B Child Welfare Services, Title XX Social Services Block Grant, and Title IV-A Emergency Assistance. However, funding levels were still insufficient to keep pace with service needs. By the early 1990s, over half the programs we surveyed reported that they were not able to serve all families who needed services primarily due to the lack of funds and staff.", "OBRA 1993 created the Family Preservation and Support Services program under Title IV-B, Subpart 2, of the Social Security Act. Administered by HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families (ACF), OBRA 1993 authorized $930 million over a 5-year period. Through fiscal year 1997, Congress appropriated $623 million for grants to states to conduct planning activities and fund FPS services for the first time. The grants are based on each state\u2019s percentage of children receiving Food Stamps, a federal food subsidy program for low-income households. State child welfare agencies are responsible for administering the FPS program in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.", "OBRA 1993 allowed states to use up to $1 million of their grant amount for planning purposes during the first year, with no required state match. Funds used for FPS services and other allowable activities, such as additional planning or evaluation, require a 25-percent state match. The law also requires states to spend a significant portion of service dollars for each type of service, which HHS has defined as at least 25 percent each for family preservation services and for family support services. Further, state administrative costs are limited to 10 percent.", "To receive FPS funds, states submitted grant applications to HHS by June 1994 and comprehensive plans a year later. These plans were based on a needs assessment; developed with community groups; and coordinated with health, education, and other agencies that serve children and families. As required, the plans described goals that states expect to achieve by 1999 and methods that they will use to measure their progress. Federal guidance also encourages states to continue their collaborative planning activities, improve service delivery, and leverage additional funding from other sources for FPS services.", "Family preservation programs generally serve families where child abuse or neglect has occurred or where children have been identified as representing a danger to themselves or others. These families risk having their children temporarily or permanently placed outside the home in foster care, juvenile detention, or mental health facilities. Most family preservation programs provide specific services tailored to the family\u2019s needs to help ameliorate the underlying causes of dysfunction. These services may include, for example, family counseling and training in parenting skills. The intensity, duration, and packaging of services differentiates these programs from the traditional delivery of child welfare services, which also share the goal of placement prevention and family reunification. Even among family preservation programs, however, service delivery varies. In the widely used Homebuilders intensive crisis intervention model, caseworkers typically carry small caseloads of two families at a time and are available to families on a 24-hour basis for 4 to 6 weeks. In other program models, caseworkers may carry caseloads of up to 20 families, with one or two personal contacts per week for a period of 7 or more months. (See app. II for a description of various family preservation program models.)", "Family support programs include a broad spectrum of community-based activities that promote the safety and well-being of children and families. In general, the purpose is to reach families before child abuse or neglect occurs. Often provided in a community center or a school, family support programs may include services outside the traditional scope of the child welfare agency, such as health care, education, and employment. Some family support programs offer a comprehensive array of services to an entire community, including parenting classes, health clinics, and counseling. Other programs are more narrow in scope and may focus only on family literacy or provide information and referral services. Compared to family preservation, eligible participants may be more broadly or narrowly defined; for example, all families in a community or only teenage mothers in a community. In practice, the distinction between family preservation and family support services may be blurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Are Using Federal Funds for Both New and Existing Services", "paragraphs": ["The federal FPS services legislation provides states with the flexibility to meet the needs of children and families through family preservation and community-based family support services. Exercising this flexibility, states have reported choosing to fund an array of services and, in many cases, strategies for improving the ways in which services are delivered. Almost all states appear to be introducing new family preservation and family support services. Our analysis shows that states are allocating somewhat more funds to family support services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New and Expanded Services Vary", "paragraphs": ["Forty-four states reported that they used federal funds to create new family preservation programs, family support programs, or both. For example, Oregon has had one model of a family preservation program\u2014the Intensive Family Services Program\u2014since 1980; however, concerns about the high numbers of African-Americans in foster care in one community prompted this state to initiate a new family preservation program. This program is based on the Homebuilders service-delivery model but refined to better meet the cultural needs of this population.", "Although almost all the states reported starting new programs, the size and service levels of these programs vary across states and programs. Some are quite small. For example, in a low-income neighborhood in Maryland, a new family preservation component was added to a community-based substance abuse treatment program. There, $40,000 pays for one caseworker to provide family preservation services for as many as five families at a time to prevent the need to remove children from their homes while the parents are treated for substance abuse. Another new family support program in this same community provides information and coordinates communitywide activities to ensure families have knowledge of and access to all available community resources. About $75,000 is being spent for this program that plans to serve 200 persons by telephone or in-person and make 600 contacts by mail a month.", "By contrast, another community in Texas implemented a larger-scale program spending $971,000 in federal funds over the last 2 years to create a family resource center in each of three school districts. This new family support program offers an array of services at each school-based center, including parent education, counseling, adult education, childcare, some health care, and family support workers for families in need of more intensive services. As of August 1996, over 3,000 households containing 8,600 individuals had registered since the program\u2019s inception.", "In addition to introducing new programs, almost every state used federal funds to fill gaps in existing FPS services. Forty-seven states reported expanding existing family preservation services, family support services, or both by making them available to more clients within existing service areas, by adding more program sites, or enhancing programs by increasing the intensity of existing services or adding new services as illustrated by the following cases:", "Texas expanded its intensive placement prevention program to additional locations to reach new clients as well as more clients within existing service areas. This family preservation program is designed to prevent the need for placing abused and neglected children in foster care. The existing 18 service-delivery units are being expanded to 38 units and about 115 new workers are being hired to serve an additional 520 families per year.", "Arkansas expanded its Intensive Family Services program from 10 to 20 counties. This family preservation program was also enhanced by adding emergency cash assistance for participating families. This new service will enable families in crisis to address some of their immediate needs, such as covering back rent to avoid becoming homeless.", "One Maryland community enhanced a neighborhood recreation program by adding new activities and increasing its hours of operation. Community members voiced concern that the lack of recreational activities was a factor in the adolescent crime rate. This family support program is designed to give young people a safe place to congregate and recreate, especially in the late afternoon and evening hours, to keep them off the streets and away from the influence of illegal and drug-related activities.", "The likelihood of states creating new or expanding existing programs appeared unaffected by whether states had previously provided family preservation or family support services, how long states have had service dollars available, or whether service decisions were made at the state or local level. Our analysis of state survey responses showed no clear patterns regarding the circumstances that might result in states funding certain types of services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Place Somewhat More Emphasis on Family Support Services", "paragraphs": ["As the law requires, most states are spending a significant portion of their federal funds for family preservation services and family support services. Of the federal funds used for services in fiscal year 1996, states allocated an average of 56 percent to family support services and 44 percent to family preservation.", "In 1996, over half the states allocated a majority of their service dollars for family support services, as shown in table 1. Four of these states are using all their service dollars for family support activities, which is allowable as long as the state justifies this distribution.", "While every state is initiating or expanding family support services, family preservation services, or both, slightly more states are using federal funds for family support services. Forty-one states reported introducing new family support programs, while 34 states initiated new family preservation programs. Forty-three states expanded existing family support services, compared to 38 states for family preservation.", "Several reasons may explain why states have placed somewhat more emphasis on family support services. According to federal and state officials, some states had already spent considerable state or other federal funds for family preservation services and decided\u2014either at the onset or based on planning results\u2014to place greater emphasis on family support services. Further, many states delegated to counties or communities the responsibility for conducting localized planning and making service decisions. Localities were apt to be more familiar with support services and to play a larger role in program decisions than the child welfare agencies familiar with family preservation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federally Funded Services Were Implemented Within Last 2 Years", "paragraphs": ["States have had 1 to 2 years to initiate or expand family preservation and family support services, depending on how they used their first year\u2019s funds. All states spent at least a year doing collaborative community-based planning to develop their 5-year plans, in accordance with HHS guidance. Nineteen states elected to implement services while simultaneously conducting planning activities resulting in these states having had about 2 years to implement services. The majority of the states, however, began to implement federally funded services a year later, after they had completed their 5-year plans.", "For those states that have had a year to initiate or expand services, most reported that implementation of family preservation and family support services has been slower than they expected. In total, 25 states indicated being behind schedule primarily due to the magnitude and complexity of the implementation effort. Most of these states said that they experienced delays in designing or developing FPS services. Moreover, the competitive process to select communities or programs that would receive federal funds also caused delays in several states. Officials had not anticipated the time required to solicit and review proposals, respond to challenges, and award contracts. Many states also reported that an extended period of time was required to change their service-delivery system to facilitate implementation, such as training staff on procedural changes and collaborating with other service providers. In addition to these procedural factors, many states attributed their receipt of federal funds later than expected as a reason for being behind schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Activities Are Designed to Improve Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["While states appear to be using most of their federal FPS funds to initiate or expand family preservation or family support services, many states are also undertaking a variety of activities to enable the service-delivery system to serve vulnerable children and families more effectively and efficiently. According to estimates provided by each state at the time of our study, an average of 83 percent of federal funds had been spent on direct services, such as the new and expanded family preservation and family support services already described. The remaining federal dollars were used for other allowable activities, including additional planning, administration, and capacity-building such as training and technical assistance.", "Five states dedicated all their FPS funds to the provision of direct services, while 46 states used a portion of their funds for other activities as well as direct services. Thirty-eight of these states conducted activities designed to enhance the capacity of state and local agencies to provide family preservation and support services. These activities included staff training in cultural awareness or procedural changes, technical assistance to service providers, research or evaluation activities, and management information system development and improvement. For example, Arkansas held two conferences, which were attended by over 1,000 individuals, to educate the public on prevention issues, encourage collaboration among providers, and provide technical assistance and training to staff of community-based organizations. Several states contracted with universities or private research firms to conduct outcome evaluations. In Idaho, local panels were established to review closed child protection cases to identify service gaps and improvements to the service-delivery system responsible for investigating allegations of child abuse and neglect.", "In addition, 17 states reported that planning activities will continue beyond 1995. For example, Maryland is taking more time to allow its 19 local management boards representing the state\u2019s 24 counties to develop their own community-based plans. At the time of our study, the state had provided federal funds to 11 boards for localized planning. Eventually every local management board in the state will have the opportunity to develop its own plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Results and Impact Will Be Monitored in Various Ways", "paragraphs": ["Midway into this 5-year program, it is too early to identify what impact the federally funded family preservation and family support services have had on the lives of vulnerable children and their families. Several efforts, however, are underway to monitor results and assess impact. By law, states must track results and report on their progress in achieving the goals set in their 5-year plans. Some states will also conduct formal evaluations to examine outcomes and processes. To determine the impact of federally funded services, however, requires rigorous evaluation. Eleven states plan to conduct such evaluations. In addition, federal efforts are underway to assess the effectiveness of family preservation and family support services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Will Use Various Measures and Methods to Track Results", "paragraphs": ["States plan to track the results of federally funded services by using a variety of measures. At a minimum, all states report that they will track the number of children and families served and most will measure the extent to which their needs are being met. Specifically, 45 states will look for evidence of changes in parent-child relationships, family functioning, or participants\u2019 satisfaction with services delivered. Many states will also assess the well-being of children by using appropriate measures, such as the number of infants discharged from community care who receive follow-up care within 48 hours. More than half the states told us that they expect to determine the program\u2019s cost effectiveness, the efficacy of certain services for particular client groups, or both. Finally, at least 45 states plan to monitor traditional indicators of child welfare, such as the number of child abuse and neglect reports, and changes over time in one or more aspects of the service-delivery system. For example, one state plans to examine the extent to which consumers are participating in service planning groups and services are provided in conjunction with community and neighborhood organizations.", "Having set goals and measurable objectives in their 5-year plans, states are expected to annually report on outcomes and progress towards achieving these goals. At the time of this report, HHS and its contractor responsible for evaluating state implementation were reviewing states\u2019 first progress reports and expected to complete their initial analyses in December 1996. In addition, some states will conduct formal evaluations that examine processes and outcomes, in many cases in conjunction with schools of social work at state universities. For example, Kentucky has contracted with the University of Kentucky to develop an evaluation program to assess the extent to which the state\u2019s FPS services program reaches the target population, monitor the frequency of service delivery and client participation, tabulate the cost of implementing the program, and assess the extent that program goals are achieved. In Arizona, the state\u2019s evaluation will track multiple child, family, and community outcome measures over time and compare results to baseline indicators. Data sources include family questionnaires, agency reports, and worker assessments.", "State plans for monitoring and evaluating FPS programs should yield useful information on the size, nature, and outcomes of funded activities as well as changes in the well-being of communities, families, and children. Because these efforts will not necessarily confirm that the programs caused improved outcomes, 11 states plan to conduct their own rigorous evaluations\u2014even though such evaluations are not required\u2014that will yield more conclusive results. For example, a research contractor will conduct a 3-year randomized clinical trial of a home visitation program in San Diego County, California, that is based on Hawaii\u2019s Healthy Start model. Researchers will randomly assign 500 families to one of two groups\u2014about half the families will receive program services and the other families will not\u2014and evaluate the effectiveness of the program model as it is implemented in San Diego.

Each evaluation is comprised of multiple studies of mature programs\u2014initiated before the federal FPS services law\u2014that span a range of program models and methods for targeting services. At the time that we prepared this report, the research contractors were expected to begin data collection in the fall of 1996 and issue interim reports a year later.", "The family preservation evaluation is reviewing four programs that aim to prevent out-of-home placement and one program that tries to reunite foster children with their families. Two of these programs use the Homebuilders crisis intervention model, while the other three use less intensive service models. Each program evaluation is designed to assign families to treatment and control groups. Families in the treatment group receive services from the family preservation program. Families in the control group receive services that they would have received if the program was not available. Outcomes to be measured include changes in foster care placement rates, recidivism, and duration in stay, as well as family functioning and subsequent child abuse and neglect.", "The family support evaluation consists of multiple studies of eight different programs, including several comprehensive community family support programs as well as those that focus on economic self-sufficiency, family literacy, or preventing substance abuse. Five programs are being evaluated using treatment and control groups. The remaining three programs will compare families that receive program services with families in other programs or similar settings. For example, families that participate in Florida\u2019s Full Service Schools program will be compared with families in comparable schools where the program is not offered.Outcomes to be measured include family functioning, child and family well-being, instances of child abuse and neglect, and satisfaction with services delivered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Results Are Few, but Service-Delivery Approaches Have Been Affected", "paragraphs": ["Although it is too early to identify service impacts on children and families, 10 states reported that program results were available on federally funded FPS services. Most of these states collected data on the number of children and families served, changes in child abuse and childhood mortality rates, as well as changes in their approaches to delivering services. For example, Louisiana reported on the results of federally funded projects after the first year of implementation. To contribute to future planning efforts related to the configuration of family preservation and family support services in Louisiana, the evaluation described the services and population characteristics in three programs and assessed the relationship between services and short-term outcomes. In particular, the Intensive Home Based Services program, which is a family preservation program, met its goal of preventing child removal and continued maltreatment. A family support program, designed to prevent child abuse and neglect, resulted in few reports of child maltreatment even though a majority of cases had had one or two child abuse or neglect reports before receiving program services. In another example for another family support program operating at a child development center whose primary service population is teenage parents and their children, individual service needs were summarized based on participants\u2019 and workers\u2019 completion of a new needs assessment form.", "While not much is known yet about the impact of federally funded services, the legislation appears to have affected the ways in which states and localities develop and administer services for children and their families. According to federal and state officials, the primary impact to date has been to forge links between state agencies and the communities they serve. The process of developing states\u2019 5-year plans resulted in public agencies, organizations, service providers, and consumers working together for the well-being of children and families. Many states departed from their traditional method of administering child welfare services at the state level. In particular, 27 states reported distributing federal funds to counties and other local entities, such as community groups and local coalitions, to develop their own plans and make service decisions. Several states took additional steps to better identify the service needs of children and families. For example, Michigan is investing an additional $10 million in state funds to supplement federal funds and enable each of its 83 counties to participate in the process of improving services to better meet local needs. State officials credit this process with ensuring that at-risk families now have greater access to needed services and contributing significantly to the broader goal of positive system reform."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Before the enactment of OBRA 1993, FPS programs throughout the country were unable to meet the demand for services to strengthen and support families. Since then, states have begun to both initiate and expand programs of family preservation and support services to achieve the purpose of the FPS legislation. Early results indicate that these services are being offered to families and children who might otherwise have fallen through the cracks and that some programs supported with federal funds have met their goals of strengthening families and reducing child abuse and neglect. Information being gathered by states, universities, and research firms should increase our understanding of the outcomes of funded activities as well as changes over time in the well-being of communities, families, and children. Moreover, the community-based collaborative planning process undertaken seems to be having beneficial effects on the service-delivery system.
