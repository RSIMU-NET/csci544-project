For example, one district reported an average increase of two or three students per elementary school class from the prior school year.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) reported that canceled or limited military training and readiness activities could increase the number of nondeployable units, decrease surge capacity to meet additional requirements with ready forces, and lead to skills gaps.", "In some cases, program partners reported increasing reliance on other federal, state, and local funding sources, where available, to mitigate sequestration's effects on their services to the public. Certain state agencies reported that they relied on additional state funds to inspect and investigate health care facilities on behalf of CMS. However, in other cases, program partners reported that reductions in other funding sources magnified sequestration's effects on services to the public. For example, officials at 7 school districts that receive federal education grants reported that sequestration compounded prior-year reductions in state funding.", "However, GAO found in some cases the effects of sequestration could not be isolated from the effects of other changes in funding.

We asked agencies to identify the source of any information  provided and a description of any known limitations or purposes for which  the data being provided should not be used. In addition, we interviewed  agency officials from each component, including officials in budget and  management offices as well as officials in program offices. We asked  agency officials to isolate the effects of sequestration from other factors  such as operating under a continuing resolution (CR) and the rescissions  enacted in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act,  2013, to the degree possible. We recognize that these other factors could  also contribute to budget uncertainty and affect components\u2019 operations,  performance, and services to the public. We also interviewed program  partners that help carry out some of the selected components\u2019 missions  by providing services to recipients of federal funding or the general public.

In August 2011, Congress and the President  enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), amending BBEDCA.  Among other things, the BCA established the Joint Select Committee on  Deficit Reduction (Joint Committee), which was tasked with proposing  legislation to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion or more through fiscal year  2021. The absence of such legislation triggered the sequestration  process in section 251A of BBEDCA, known as the Joint Committee  sequestration, which is the subject of this report. During fiscal year 2013,  several laws changed the timing and amount of sequestration. As a result  of those changes, the President ultimately ordered a sequestration on  March 1, 2013, to achieve $85.3 billion in budget reductions. Consistent  with BBEDCA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calculated  the following percentage sequestration reductions based on the funding  level set by the CR in effect at that time:", "7.9 percent for defense direct spending,", "7.8 percent for defense discretionary spending,", "5.1 percent for nondefense direct spending\u2014other than Medicare  payments and certain health programs, which are limited to 2 percent  under BBEDCA, and", "5 percent for nondefense discretionary spending.", "BBEDCA required that the sequestration reductions ordered on March 1,  2013, be applied uniformly, across the board, to nonexempt accounts and  their sub-units, known as PPAs.

On March  26, 2013, Congress and the President enacted the Consolidated and  Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which provided full-year  appropriations to federal agencies and had the effect of reducing the  sequestered amount for fiscal year 2013 from $85.3 billion to $80.5  billion.on total sequestered amounts for programs that are funded by permanent   The final sequestered amount for fiscal year 2013 is dependent  indefinite budget authority, such as entitlement programs like Medicare  payments where obligations depend on the number of eligible  beneficiaries receiving benefits.", "Our March 2014 report found that one of the ways agencies responded to  sequestration was by using funding flexibilities to mitigate the effects of  sequestration where available.

Meanwhile, officials  at one CBP field office stated that in some instances, officers could  not inspect all cargo in the queue during their normal shift, which  meant that some cargo was not inspected until the next shift began,  which delayed the release of cargo for shipment.", "CMS reduced the frequency of certain medical facility inspections. For  example, to implement sequestration reductions, CMS reported  reducing the frequency of surveys to determine the quality of care and  compliance with federal standards at psychiatric hospitals from once  every 3 years to once every 4 to 5 years. Surveys of specialized  organ transplant centers were reduced from once every 3 years to  once every 4 to 6 years. We do not know the effect of the reduced  oversight on patient safety or the quality of care provided by the  health care facilities.  Impact Aid and Title I school districts reduced some services to  students. For example, three of the Impact Aid districts reported  having to increase class sizes. Officials from one of the districts  specifically reported an average increase of two or three students per  elementary school class from the prior school year. Meanwhile,  officials from one district that received Title I funding told us that the  loss of funding contributed to the decision to reduce the number of  reading and math specialists who provide extra instruction to students  and assist teachers in improving their teaching methods.", "PIH reduced funding for the Housing Choice Voucher program. As a  result, the number of very low-income households receiving rental  housing assistance through the program at the end of calendar year  2013 declined by about 41,000 (2.2 percent) compared to the end of  calendar year 2012 primarily due to sequestration.", "DOD reduced military training and readiness activities, such as  canceling or limiting training, which the agency reported could  increase the number of non-deployable units, decrease surge  capacity to meet additional requirements with ready forces, and lead  to skills gaps.", "In some instances, the effects of sequestration compounded other  reductions in federal, state, and local funding sources. Representatives of  a medical provider association have reported that the 2 percent  reductions to Medicare payments required by sequestration compounded  other reductions in payments. Payment reductions can result from the  annual rate setting process for providers or specific legislative actions.  Further, all of the seven Title I and Impact Aid school districts we spoke to  told us that cuts to state funding in prior years had already reduced their  budgets, which were further cut as a result of sequestration. In other  cases, program partners supplied resources, where available, to mitigate  the effects of sequestration.

Similarly, it is difficult to isolate the specific  effects of sequestration on Title I school districts because Title I funding  typically makes up a small portion of the school district\u2019s total funding  compared to state and local sources. In addition, because of the statutory  formula for Title I, a reduced Title I allocation could be a result of factors  other than sequestration, such as decreases in the formula count of  children or reduced state per pupil expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Components\u2019 Sequestration Planning and Implementation Efforts Varied and Were Hindered by Uncertainty and Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Planning for sequestration varied among the selected federal  components. Some planning efforts were more centralized and occurred  primarily at the agency level. For example, OESE and PIH largely  followed sequestration plans set by Education and HUD, respectively. By  contrast, CMS planned for sequestration primarily at the component level  by identifying certain activities as spending priorities, in consultation with  the HHS budget office. CBP headquarters generally managed planning  for the required budgetary reductions and delegated implementation  decisions affecting operations to program offices.", "In some cases where sequestration planning primarily occurred at the  component level, technical questions posed challenges. CMS faced  technical challenges in applying sequestration in accordance with the law  and changing budget parameters. Specifically, CMS had difficulty  determining all of the types of provider payments that would need to be  cut and which funding was subject to special sequestration rules.  Similarly, CBP budget officials told us that applying sequestration to fee  accounts was more difficult than other accounts due to uncertainty over  whether fee accounts would be exempt from sequestration, as well as  uncertainty about how to apply sequestration cuts to fee accounts.", "Our March 2014 report similarly found that many agencies faced  challenges in applying sequestration to certain programs, such as those  funded through user fees and trust funds. We made two  recommendations that could help alleviate some of the uncertainty for  potential future sequestrations. Specifically, we recommended that OMB  document and make publicly available its decisions regarding how  sequestration was implemented and issue guidance directing agencies to  formally document the decisions and principles used to implement  sequestration for potential future application. OMB agreed with our  recommendation and plans to publish its criteria used for making  determinations about how sequestration was implemented in its guidance  to agencies, OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and  Execution of the Budget, but did not specify when this guidance would be  available.", "In addition, uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of  sequestration limited the components\u2019 ability to provide substantive  communication to its program partners and recipients. For example, CMS  officials told us that, because sequestration took effect late in the fiscal  year, it was difficult to provide timely communication to state survey  agencies that would allow them to adequately plan their budgets.  Recipients of PIH Indian Housing Block grants told us that uncertainty  surrounding the fiscal year 2013 federal budget process presented  challenges because they did not receive the full amount of their grants  from HUD until several months into the calendar year. These findings are  consistent with our March 2014 report, which found that uncertainty over  if and when sequestration would occur limited agencies\u2019 communication  with stakeholders.", "To implement sequestration, federal agencies and components had to  analyze each budget account separately to determine its PPAs in  accordance with section 256(k)(2) of BBEDCA. Section 256(k)(2) of  BBEDCA provides that PPAs shall be identified within the appropriation  act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering the  budget account, or for accounts not included in appropriations acts, as  delineated within the most recently submitted President\u2019s Budget. We  reviewed a purposeful, nonrandom sample of five PPAs from each of the  four nondefense components. We found that agencies complied with the  criteria set forth in section 256(k)(2) in identifying each of the PPAs in our  sample.", "In some cases, certain program characteristics limited the actions  available to components for implementing sequestration. Officials from  OESE and PIH told us that they had few options for implementing  sequestration because some of their largest programs are based on  eligibility formulas\u2014established by law in some cases\u2014or the funds are  disbursed to program partners to fund various services to the public. As a  result, the component could only achieve the required spending  reductions by reducing the amount of the funds distributed to eligible  partners or recipients. Partners and recipients therefore had reduced  federal funds available for services. For example, eligibility criteria and  formulas for allocating Title I grant funds are established by law and  sequestration generally reduced the grant amounts that states and  eligible school districts would have received absent sequestration.  Similarly, CMS had little flexibility in applying sequestration cuts to  Medicare payments because, with few exceptions, under BBEDCA all  types of Medicare payments were subject to the 2 percent sequestration.  Therefore, Medicare fee-for-service providers and Medicare Advantage  and prescription drug plans had to absorb the reduction. In addition,  some agencies had legal mandates that constrained their implementation  options. For example, CBP is required to maintain a certain number of  Border Patrol agents, which limited available personnel actions.", "In cases where officials did have some discretion in applying  sequestration reductions, components reported that they had to make  trade-offs to protect higher priority activities in their resource allocation  decisions. For example, the Border Patrol did not apply the required  reductions evenly across sectors because operational demands were  higher in some sectors than others. Further, CMS chose to maintain  funding for implementation of the federal health insurance exchanges  despite the reductions. Similarly, within DOD, the military services sought  to protect training requirements for deployed and next-to-deploy forces.  To do this, DOD took actions such as canceling or limiting training for  forces not preparing to deploy in fiscal year 2014. Furthermore, similar to  our March 2014 report, case study components implemented  sequestration cuts by, for example, reducing training and travel, reducing  program management and support services, and rescoping or delaying  grants.", "Previously initiated efficiency efforts helped components absorb some of  the required reductions. For example, CBP was better positioned for  sequestration, according to officials, due to efficiencies implemented over  the past several years in response to declining budgets. Similarly,  according to CMS officials, an initiative to improve the efficiency of its  facility inspections that began in 2011 helped CMS plan for the fiscal year  2013 sequestration.", "Consistent with our March 2014 report, we found that actions components  took to mitigate the effects of sequestration on mission priorities will not  be available to the same extent, if at all, in future years. Specifically, CBP  officials told us that it will be more difficult to implement sequestration in  future years without adverse effects on their missions because actions  taken in fiscal year 2013\u2014such as reducing funding for equipment and  fuel\u2014will be difficult to replicate. CMS officials also told us that future cuts  would be more difficult to implement because, for example, carryover  balances may not be available to the same extent in future years.  Similarly, DOD used portions of available unobligated balances from prior  years to mitigate fiscal year 2013 sequestration reductions, but the  agency may have lower prior year unobligated balances available to rely  on in future years.

In addition, these case studies provide further evidence that the  uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of sequestration  hampered communication with program partners and recipients. This  uncertainty limited the abilities of states, tribes, and other partners to  effectively plan to manage their operations with limited resources. OMB\u2019s  implementation of the recommendations in our March 2014 report would  facilitate agencies\u2019 planning and implementation for a potential future  sequestration by documenting federal agencies\u2019 and OMB\u2019s decisions  and principles for planning for and implementing sequestration.

Specifically, officials from the Center for  Clinical Standards and Quality (CCSQ), which is responsible for federal  oversight of survey and certification, made policy changes that meant  certain Medicare participating medical facilities were inspected less  frequently. CMS officials told us that they made these policy changes to  ensure that state survey agencies were able to complete statutorily  required surveys. Except for frequency requirements that are mandated  in statute, CMS establishes survey frequencies for other facility types  based on available funding. For example, to implement sequester  reductions, CMS officials reported that CMS reduced the frequency of  psychiatric hospital surveys it conducts through a national contractor from  once every 3 years to once every 4 to 5 years, which officials said freed  funding for other activities. In a memorandum issued April 5, 2013, CMS  instructed state survey agencies on how to prioritize their workloads in  response to sequestration. For example, to cut down states\u2019 workload,  the operating division moved specialized organ transplant center surveys  from states to a national contractor and reduced the frequency of these  surveys from once every 3 years to once every 4 to 6 years. CMS also  instructed states not to add nursing homes to the special focus facility  (SFF) program in their state when an existing SFF nursing home has  graduated from the program or has been terminated from Medicare  participation. SFF nursing homes are poorly performing nursing homes  within each state that are subject to two on-site surveys per year instead  of one survey. As a result of the instruction not to replace SFF nursing  homes, the number of such homes nationwide decreased from 152 when  sequestration began to 62 as of March 2014, according to CMS officials.  By reducing national contracts and support services, CMS limited the  sequestration reduction of states\u2019 Medicare provider survey and  inspection funding, known as Medicare allocations, to an average of 3.2  percent rather than imposing the full reduction on states, according to  officials. We do not know the effect of the reduced oversight from state  survey agencies and national contractors on patient safety or the quality  of care provided by the health care facilities.", "Several state survey agency officials that we spoke to reported that,  because they had little time to adjust their staffing and budget plans after  CMS established their fiscal year 2013 Medicare allocations, the state  survey agencies used state funds to mitigate some of the effects of  reduced federal allocations. Specifically, officials from four of the five  state survey agencies we spoke to said they needed more than the  amount of their initial federal allocations in fiscal year 2013 and would use  state funds to cover the difference. For example, officials from one state  survey agency told us it needed more than the amount allocated for  survey activities. The officials said the state survey agency moved state  funds originally intended for other health-related activities to avoid staff  reductions that would have affected its ability to complete the statutorily  required surveys. Officials from another state survey agency told us that  as a direct result of sequestration reductions, 2013 was the first year the  state needed more than the amount allocated to it by CMS. CMS  reported that 15 of the 33 state survey agencies that had finalized their  fiscal year 2013 expenditures as of March 2014 had spent all of their  federal allocations and requested supplemental funding for fiscal year  2013, compared to 7 supplemental requests from those same 33 states in  2012. As of March 2014, CMS could not determine how much funding  would be available for redistribution. A reduction in funds available to  CMS for redistribution could create additional pressure for states in  allocating their own funds to cover survey and certification activities. For  example, two states told us they would have to cut licensure activities  funded solely by the state if CMS could not provide the supplemental  funds to reimburse the state for funds used to complete required  activities.", "The state officials we spoke to reported that they were able to complete  the highest priority surveys and complaint investigations by spending a  combination of their federal allocations and state funding.

Final payments for fiscal year 2013 will  depend on the actual numbers and types of services used by  beneficiaries during the sequestration period. Research examining the  effects of previous Medicare payment cuts suggests that providers may  attempt to offset cuts by providing more services or more expensive  services. As a result, the cuts may not produce the expected Medicare  savings.", "In addition, it is not possible to isolate the effect that the payment  reductions had on providers\u2019 revenues in fiscal year 2013 because  payments to Medicare providers were affected by a number of factors,  such as increases or decreases resulting from the annual rate-setting  process and the implementation of certain statutory provisions affecting  payments. Similarly, it is not possible to attribute any changes in  provider participation in the Medicare fee-for-service program or plan  participation in the Medicare Advantage or prescription drug programs in  2014 directly to sequestration reductions. Although CMS officials and  provider association representatives that we spoke to agreed that  isolating the effects of the 2 percent Medicare payment reductions is  difficult, provider associations reported that the reductions will be  detrimental to providers because they exacerbated other budgetary  pressures, particularly for providers that rely on Medicare payments for  large portions of their revenues. For example, some hospitals have  reported that the Medicare sequestration was one of several negative  factors affecting hospital revenues that resulted in layoffs, decreased  services, and delays in infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2013. A  physician association reported that although the isolated effects on  physicians from the first year of sequestration of Medicare payments are  not detectable, the effects will likely be greater as cuts continue in future  years and physicians face smaller Medicare payment increases and  additional responsibilities associated with Medicare participation. Based  on anecdotes of physicians\u2019 reactions to previous payment reductions,  the association officials predicted that sequestration could contribute to  shifts in physician practice away from specialties with a high proportion of  Medicare patients relative to patients with other forms of payment.  However, they noted that it is difficult to single out actions directly  responding to sequestration. How these potential changes in provider  behavior could influence Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care  remains to be seen.", "Beneficiaries were partially shielded from the payment reductions made  as a result of sequestration. The law did not allow Medicare participating  providers to pass on the payment reductions to beneficiaries. All  coinsurance and deductible amounts remained the same for  beneficiaries. However, beneficiaries would have been financially liable  for any increased cost sharing resulting from providers who provided  more services, or more expensive services, to offset the sequestration  cuts. Beneficiaries who use nonparticipating providers and receive  payments directly from CMS in order to reimburse the provider did see  those payments reduced, which required these beneficiaries to pay  more.

Officials also reported having to reduce by 7  percent grants made to states after March 1 to establish health insurance  exchanges in accordance with OMB\u2019s sequestration guidance for  programs with permanent indefinite budget authority. In fiscal year  2013, CMS awarded such grants to 25 states and the District of  Columbia, but only those amounts obligated after March 1, 2013 were  subject to sequestration, according to officials. Because sequestration  began in the middle of the year, officials told us that CMS had to achieve  the required reductions for state exchange grants by applying  sequestration to the amounts obligated in the remaining months of the  fiscal year, requiring it to reduce each grant made after March 1 by 7  percent from the expected amount. Additionally, because the state  insurance grants are structured as the only activity within their PPA, CMS  could not reallocate the sequester reductions to other activities in order to  spare the grants from the reductions.", "In contrast, CMS officials told us the operating division had flexibility to  implement reductions within the large PPAs contained in the discretionary  program management account.

For instance,  MAC funding through the program operations PPA was reduced by 2.4  percent. This reduction ended up having had no effect on MAC  operations because CMS needed less funding than expected in fiscal  year 2013 for transition costs for new MACs and the awarding of two  MAC contracts scheduled for the end of fiscal year 2013 was delayed  until fiscal year 2014 for reasons other than sequestration.

They increased their preparation for sequestration of payments in late  2011. Officials said that these early preparations helped the center  implement payment reductions quickly through the various contractors  that maintain their payment systems when sequestration occurred. In  addition, CCSQ officials told us that, beginning in 2011, officials started a  broad-based initiative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in  survey processes as they recognized a significant gap between an  increasing workload and the funding amount typically allocated for survey  and certification activity.

In particular, CMS had difficulty determining all of  the types of Medicare provider payments subject to sequestration and  which Medicare funding was subject to special sequestration rules. For  example, CMS officials initially thought that subsidies for the Program of  All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) were exempt from sequestration,  like certain Medicare low-income subsidy payments. Upon further  discussion with OMB late in the planning process, CMS determined that  these payments were not exempt and adjusted the plan payments  accordingly. Officials said the adjustments accounted for a very small  amount of PACE funding. The timing of sequestration and changing  budgetary parameters also delayed CMS\u2019s ability to make final planning  decisions. For example, CMS based its initial sequestration planning  decisions on the annualized amount set out in the continuing resolution in  effect at the time sequestration was ordered. After the Consolidated and  Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, which provided a lower  discretionary appropriation base than CMS used to calculate the  sequestration reductions, CMS officials said they had to determine how to  absorb the same amount of reductions, which then represented a larger  portion of the appropriation, in the remainder of the fiscal year.", "The timing of sequestration and related CMS guidance created  uncertainty for some stakeholders. For example, CCSQ officials told us  that they strive to limit uncertainty for states so the states can plan their  budget adequately. This was difficult in fiscal year 2013 because  sequestration took effect in March, which effectively doubled the  percentage cut because it all had to be taken in the second half of the  fiscal year. On April 5, 2013, CMS issued a memorandum informing  states about sequestration reductions and actions states should take to  implement the cuts. Although officials from several state survey agencies  we spoke to described the timing of CMS\u2019s communication regarding  sequestration as the best it could have been, they still faced challenges  adjusting their budgets. For example, one state survey agency told us it  received official notice of its allocation amount in May 2013, which left the  state very little time to plan for absorbing the cut by the end of the fiscal  year in September 2013. CMS informed providers and plans about the  Medicare payment reductions following the sequestration order in March.  In early May CMS issued additional guidance to Medicare Advantage and  prescription drug plans regarding the application of reductions for various  plan types. In this communication, CMS noted, for example, that the  agency is prohibited from interfering in payment arrangements between  plans and providers who contract with them.

These sequestration cuts affected grant recipients in different  ways and contributed to some reduced services to students. Title I is the  largest grant program administered by OESE, with grants issued to over  53,000 schools in districts nationwide in fiscal year 2013. The program  provides much of its total funding to districts serving high concentrations  of students from low-income families, to provide services to help improve  the academic achievement of students in high-poverty schools or  students at risk of academic failure (see table 6).", "For Impact Aid, many districts receive funding from this program\u2014a little  over 1,100 districts serving almost 930,000 federally connected students  nationwide in fiscal year 2013 (see figure 7).", "Effects of sequestration on school districts varied due to the timing of  funding disbursements to grant recipients. In general, Title I grant  recipients felt the effects of sequestration later than districts that received  Impact Aid grants. Specifically, the sequestration cuts affected Impact Aid  recipients in school year 2012-2013, while the cuts did not affect Title I  recipients until school year 2013-2014. This is, in part, due to when  Education disburses funding to states and school districts. Education  typically disburses Title I grants to states, for disbursement to school  districts, in July and October each year. Education disbursed some of its  Title I fiscal year 2013 funding to states in October 2012, prior to  sequestration, for school year 2012-2013. Education then applied the  entire amount of the sequestration cuts for fiscal year 2013 to the next  grant disbursement, in July 2013, for school year 2013-2014. Therefore,  the sequestration cuts did not affect the October 2012 disbursement used  for the 2012-2013 school year. In contrast, Education disbursed a  majority of the fiscal year 2013 funding for Impact Aid in October and  November 2012, during school year 2012-2013, prior to sequestration,  and applied the sequestration cuts to grant disbursements made in May  2013. According to Education officials, delaying the cuts from the 2013  sequestration for the larger state grant programs, such as Title I, enabled  recipients to plan and may have tempered some of the negative  consequences of sequestration.", "Another reason sequestration affected districts differently is that the  relative importance of Title I and Impact Aid grant funding in districts\u2019  budgets varies greatly. School district budgets are generally funded by  multiple sources and are determined by many factors, including local  taxes, state government contributions, and other federal financial support  sources. Moreover, the relative contribution of these resources varies  among school districts. As a result, the effects of grant reductions from  Education vary for grant recipients based on their respective situations,  including the availability of other resources to fill any budget gap. While  the receipt of Title I grants is widespread among districts, funds from this  program generally account for a small portion of most districts\u2019 overall  funding. Though the proportion can vary by district, for fiscal year 2010,  the most recent year for which data are available, Title I made up about 3  percent of total elementary and secondary education funding from all  sources nationwide, according to the National Center for Education  Statistics. The extent to which districts rely on Impact Aid funding also  varies, with one district\u2019s reliance as high as 88 percent of its fiscal year  2013 operating budget, according to Education data.", "In addition, five of the districts we contacted said that it is difficult to  isolate the effects of sequestration cuts solely to Title I or Impact Aid  because the districts had also experienced reductions to state funding  and to other federal programs and activities due to sequestration. These  various state and federal funding cuts the districts experienced have led  to reductions in staffing levels, transportation, and school programs, as  well as districts having to shift funding from other sources to support  programs affected by the cuts, according to district officials. For example,  officials from all of the selected districts that received Title I or Impact Aid  grants mentioned how the districts had experienced reductions to their  state funding prior to sequestration. In one case, district officials told us  that, prior to sequestration, from 2010-2012, the district had to lay off  teachers in order to balance the district\u2019s budget after the state cut  funding to education; however, additional local tax revenue allowed the  district to avoid further layoffs when sequestration occurred. Related to  reductions to other federal programs and activities, officials from one  district reported that in addition to Impact Aid, the district also  experienced funding cuts to other federal programs due to sequestration  such as special education, vocational education, Indian education, and  Title I, among others. While this district received about 25 percent of its  funding from Impact Aid, the other federal funding sources contributed an  additional 23 percent to its total budget in fiscal year 2013.

Overall,  officials thought OESE would be stronger in the long run because of the  commitment to training their staff.", "OESE officials said they followed certain priorities in implementing the  sequestration cuts to grants awarded through a competitive process. For  these grants, OESE officials said, agency regulations generally require  components to prioritize funding of existing grants over new grants. As a  consequence, officials overseeing these grant programs only awarded  new grants if there were funds remaining for the program after all of the  existing grants were funded. Officials then had the option to fund new  grants to qualified applicants remaining from the previous year. Officials  could also open a grant to new competition if there were not sufficient  numbers of qualified applicants from the previous year or if the grant  program had a new policy priority. Agency officials could not quantify how  many fewer competitive grants were issued due to sequestration. By  contrast, OESE had limited flexibility in determining how to allocate  reductions to formula grants, such as Title I or Impact Aid, because  specific eligibility criteria and formulas for allocating grant funds are  established by law and Education is required to provide funds to grantees  that meet the statutory criteria.", "As part of implementing sequestration of the Title I and Impact Aid  programs, OESE officials said they informed grantees about  sequestration by disseminating information on the potential reductions  through advocacy organizations and states. According to officials, OESE  disseminated information to grantees whenever the information became  available through a variety of means including the National Association of  Federally Impacted Schools (NAFIS), an advocacy organization  representing districts receiving Impact Aid, and the National Council for  Impacted Schools. OESE also communicated with state educational  agencies, such as through each agency\u2019s chief state school officer. In  addition, OESE officials disseminated information through Education\u2019s  relevant e-mail list. As an example of how grant recipients were informed  about sequestration, in a July 2012 letter Education informed the chief  state school officers of the potential timing of the sequestration for  formula grant programs to help the states plan for sequestration, should  the reductions occur.

HUD chose to prioritize this use of the set aside, and  used $83 million to prevent terminations, which HUD officials stated was  sufficient to prevent all terminations. To receive the supplemental  funding, PHAs had to demonstrate that they would have had to terminate  families from the program, immediately stop issuing new vouchers, and  use all their reserves to fund vouchers. HUD provided the supplemental  set-aside funding to 294 PHAs. Most PHAs we interviewed reported that  the set-aside funding was helpful, but one association of PHAs noted that  because most of the set aside was used to prevent terminations, less  funding was available for the other purposes that had previously assisted  PHAs in prior years, such as providing additional funding to PHAs  experiencing significant increases in voucher costs from unforeseen  circumstances.", "In response to sequestration, PIH increased the number of staff (from 6 to  13) assigned to its shortfall prevention team, which provides technical  assistance and other support to PHAs that are at risk of needing to  terminate families from the program.

PIH officials told us that in some cases these  actions were sufficient to prevent PHAs from having to terminate families  from the program.
