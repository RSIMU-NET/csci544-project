This increases the likelihood that projects target the right processes for improvement, choose the best target process from among alternatives, effectively implement the project, accurately assess project outcomes, and properly manage the change to the new process. However, none of the projects completed all of the steps. For example, some projects did not fully identify the causes of productivity shortfalls, leaving a risk that the project did not fix the right problem. In the course of this work, GAO found that IRS managers do not have guidance about the steps to follow in planning process improvement projects, increasing the possibility of omitting steps. A recurring issue in the four projects was that IRS's enforcement data only partially adjust for the complexity and quality of cases worked. This issue is also a problem for IRS enforcement productivity data generally. Failing to adjust for both complexity and quality increases the risk that trends in productivity will be misunderstood. For example, a decline in the number of cases closed per employee at the same time that case complexity is increasing may not be a real decline in productivity. GAO recognizes that some options for improving productivity data could be costly. However, costs could be mitigated by using existing statistical methods and IRS complexity and quality data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, as we have reported, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  has experienced declines in most of its enforcement programs, including  steep declines in audits and broad declines in its efforts to collect  delinquent taxes.  Factors we have cited as contributing to these declines  include the growth in tax returns filed each year, reallocation of  enforcement resources to improve telephone and other services to  taxpayers, the addition of new taxpayer rights and protections by the IRS  Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, decreased enforcement staffing,  and decreased enforcement productivity as measured by cases closed per  staff time.   The declines have triggered concerns that taxpayers\u2019  motivation to voluntarily comply with their tax obligations could be  undermined.", "Increasing enforcement productivity is one strategy that could help reverse  these declines.  To this end, IRS\u2019s Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE)  operating division is currently planning and has begun implementing 15  enforcement process improvement projects.  These projects aim to make  incremental improvements to enforcement processes and are distinct from  the major changes expected to result from IRS\u2019s long-term business  systems modernization effort.  Because of your concern about the declines  in IRS\u2019s enforcement programs, including the reported declines in their  productivity, you asked us to examine IRS\u2019s planning of its enforcement  process improvement projects.  Specifically, as agreed with your offices,  our objective was to assess the extent to which SB/SE\u2019s planning followed  steps consistent with both GAO guidance and the experiences of private  sector and government organizations.  Our focus was on SB/SE\u2019s planning  and development of their projects; we did not evaluate the results of any  projects because only 1 of the 15 projects had started implementation in  August 2003, when we were choosing projects to review, and that project  was too new to be evaluated.", "To assess SB/SE\u2019s planning, we needed to identify criteria--the steps to  follow in planning process improvement projects.  We developed a 20-step  framework based on both GAO\u2019s Business Process Reengineering  Assessment Guide and discussions with private sector and other  government managers with experience planning process improvement  projects.  GAO\u2019s Guide recognizes that the steps for planning process  improvement need to be adapted for the magnitude of the projects and the  particular circumstances of an organization.  To do this, we first held a  roundtable meeting with the Private Sector Council and two of its member  companies, Northrop Grumman and CNF.  We also discussed process  improvement planning with managers from the tax departments of  California, Florida, and Minnesota; and the Minerals Management Service  in the U.S. Department of the Interior.  We then used GAO\u2019s guidance and  the experiences of the above organizations to develop 20 key planning  steps appropriate for SB/SE\u2019s incremental improvement projects.  The 20  key steps, organized by project stages, are summarized in figure 1.", "The first six steps are related to an organization\u2019s decision to change a  process.  These steps help an organization to understand the extent and  causes of any weaknesses that need to be addressed.  For example, in step  1, an organization should begin investigating change by using productivity  data to define a baseline.  Productivity measures generally take the form of  a ratio of outputs to inputs.  The remaining steps in this stage refine the  organization\u2019s understanding of current performance and where the  organization wants to be.", "The next six steps help an organization develop the new, or target, process.   These steps emphasize understanding and analyzing alternatives and  planning for implementation.", "The next four steps concern an organization\u2019s implementation of the new  process.  These steps help an organization through the most difficult phase  of process improvement, where ideas about the new process are turned  into actions.  Two of these steps are related to pilot testing.  Pilot testing  allows corrective actions to be taken if needed to correct problems prior to  full implementation.  The other two steps address employee  responsibilities.", "In the next stage, an organization makes plans to assess the outcome of the  new process.  The single step in this stage ensures that an organization  makes plans early for evaluating the success the success of the new  process.  It is important to develop assessment plans prior to full project  implementation in order to ensure that the data necessary for evaluation  are collected.", "The last three steps are related to how an organization manages the change  to the new process.  Successfully managing change reduces the risk that  improvement efforts will fail due to the natural resistance to change within  an organization.", "Our 20-step framework emphasizes productivity measurement and analysis  both because the SB/SE projects focus on productivity gains and because  the managers we consulted, particularly our roundtable participants, said  that meaningful productivity data are an important foundation for design  and implementation of process improvement efforts.", "We recognized in our review that there is some judgment involved in  defining these steps and that some steps may not be appropriate on every  project.  GAO\u2019s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide notes  that the guide only provides a general framework for assessing key issues.   It says that it should not be regarded as a specific, rigid set of steps for  conducting a project because reengineering is far too situational for such a  rigid approach.  The same caveat applies to the process improvement 20- step framework we developed for this review.  Appendix I provides an  expanded discussion of each planning step we identified as appropriate for  SB/SE\u2019s projects.", "We judgmentally selected four projects to study in detail, including at least  one project in each of the three main enforcement areas that SB/SE was  revamping\u2014audits (or examinations), collection, and compliance support.   We also looked for projects that were sufficiently far along in their planning  for us to expect to see either completed steps or plans for the remaining  steps.", "For the four projects we selected, we assessed the degree to which IRS  followed our 20-step framework by first interviewing officials and  examining the extensive documentation they provided.  We then returned  to officials responsible for each project and asked for additional  information, particularly in areas where our initial assessment was that key  steps were not taken.  Where IRS officials showed us that certain steps had  been addressed, we then revised our initial assessment.  We also  recognized the need for flexibility in the application of our criteria, in that  some of the steps we identified may not necessarily be appropriate for  every project.  For instance, one project determined that completing a pilot  was not necessary; accordingly they could not adjust the process based on  the pilot, so that step was listed \u201cnot applicable\u201d in our assessment.  We  describe the development of our framework and our assessment of  selected SB/SE projects in detail in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SB/SE is one of IRS\u2019s four business operating divisions.  SB/SE is  responsible for enforcement, taxpayer education, and account services for  about 45 million taxpayers, including 33 million self-employed taxpayers  and 7 million small businesses with assets of less than $10 million.  SB/SE  also performs some collection functions for other IRS operating divisions.", "SB/SE managers told us that the reorganization of IRS in 2000\u2014including  the creation of SB/SE\u2014presented an opportunity for them to examine  enforcement-related processes from a new perspective.  Prior to this, the  agency was organized around functional and geographic lines, with  separate groups responsible for activities such as processing returns,  audits, and collection in particular areas.  The reorganization eliminated or  substantially modified this national, regional, and district structure and  established organizational units serving particular groups of taxpayers with  similar needs.  Officials told us that with the reorganization, they were now  responsible for functions that they had not controlled so directly before.   They said that there was general agreement among the managers of the  newly created division that there were opportunities to make processes  more efficient and effective, and that this led them to start several  enforcement process improvement projects.  They also distinguished  between enforcement process improvement projects, which are generally  incremental in their approach, and more far-reaching efforts to modernize  IRS and transform processes through business systems modernization and  other significant changes.  We noted in our recent Performance and  Accountability Series that IRS has made important progress in these larger  efforts but its transformation continues to be a work in progress.", "Though many of the SB/SE projects include the word \u201creengineering\u201d in  their titles, SB/SE managers agreed that process improvement projects was  a better description, given the scope of the changes these projects were  making.  As described in GAO\u2019s Business Process Reengineering  Assessment Guide, reengineering entails fundamentally rethinking how an  organization\u2019s work should be done while process improvement efforts  focus on functional or incremental improvements.   SB/SE managers  explained that they purposefully avoided technology-driven changes of the  sort under development in the IRS-wide business systems modernization  effort.  They said that their goal was to make shorter term, more SB/SE- focused changes in the meantime, while the more sweeping changes, and  their longer planning and implementation horizons, were still years away  from completion.   In this report, we refer to the 15 SB/SE efforts under  way as of November 2003 as \u201cprocess improvement projects.\u201d", "We have reported on declining enforcement trends, finding in 2002 that  there were large and pervasive declines in six of eight major compliance  and collection programs we reviewed, with the only exceptions in returns  processing and in the automated underreporter program.  In addition to  these declines, we reported on the large and growing gap between  collection workload and collection work completed and the resultant  increase in the number of cases where IRS has had to defer collection  action on delinquent accounts.  In 2003, we reported on the declining  percentage of individual income tax returns that IRS was able to examine  each year, with this rate falling from .92 percent to .57 percent between  1993 and 2002.  We also reported on enforcement productivity measured  by cases closed per full-time equivalent employees, finding that IRS\u2019s  telephone and field collection productivity declined by about 25 percent  from 1996-2001 and productivity in IRS\u2019s three audit programs\u2014individual,  corporate, and other audit\u2014declined by 31 to 48 percent.", "Improving productivity by changing processes is a strategy SB/SE is using  to address these declining trends.  As of November 2003, SB/SE had 15  ongoing process improvement projects under way, most of them in three  broad enforcement areas\u2014audit, collection, and compliance support.   Audit projects entail changes to field and office examination processes.   Collection projects include changes to automated collection programs,  field collections, and other programs.  Compliance support is the term  SB/SE uses to describe processing functions related to audit and collection  such as updating IRS information systems for the results of enforcement  work and preparing examination closing letters and liens on taxpayer  property.  Compliance support projects include changes to technical  services and case processing.", "We selected four SB/SE process improvement projects to review in detail  for this report.  Field Examination Reengineering includes changes to  preaudit processes to better identify specific issues on tax returns for  auditors to focus on, among other changes intended to improve  examination efficiency and reduce taxpayer burden.  The Compliance  Support Case Processing Redesign project seeks to centralize data entry  into online information systems that monitor the status of active audit and  collection cases and their results from many different locations with widely  variable workload to just a few with more consistent, predictable  workload.  The Collection Taxpayer Delinquent Account Support Project  involves the development of two computer models to improve setting  priorities for collections cases to assign to collections staff.  The Collection  Field Function Consultative Initiative seeks to improve timeliness on  collections cases through regular managerial involvement as cases are  being worked.

Guidance  on project planning steps, such as our 20-step framework, could help  ensure that key steps are followed more consistently.  Also, SB/SE  enforcement productivity data presented problems in that the data  available to SB/SE managers to assess the productivity of their  enforcement activities, identify processes that need improvement, and  assess the success of their process improvement efforts are only partially  adjusted for complexity and quality of cases worked."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enforcement Process Improvement Projects Included Many Key Steps but SB/SE Lacked a Planning Framework", "paragraphs": ["The planning for each of the four projects we reviewed included most of  the key steps in our process improvement framework, but none of the  projects included all of the steps.  Figure 2 presents our findings, organized  by project stages, for each of the four projects we studied.  A full circle  means a step was fully completed in project planning and a partial circle  means that only part of a step was completed.  Our basis for each \u201cno\u201d or  \u201cpartial\u201d finding is explained in appendix III.  Following figure 2, we discuss  our findings in more detail with selected examples from the four projects  we reviewed.", "The four SB/SE projects we reviewed largely included the productivity  baseline definition and process mapping steps under the \u201cDecision to  Change\u201d stage, where SB/SE had to determine whether any of its processes  should be improved.  The Field Examination Reengineering project team  and both collection project teams had baseline data showing that the time  needed to complete casework was rising and all four project teams had  extensive flowcharts mapping the details of current processes.  By helping  managers understand the strengths and weaknesses of current processes,  such information contributes to more informed decisions about which  processes to change.", "However, SB/SE did not as consistently include the complexity and quality  of work being done in productivity baselines, compare productivity data to  external benchmarks, identify root causes of productivity declines, or  measure the gap between current and desired productivity.  Weaknesses in  these steps leave SB/SE managers without information that could be useful  when making decisions about which processes to change.  For example, on  three of the four projects, productivity data were not adjusted for case  complexity and only partially adjusted for quality.  This could cause  productivity trends to be misinterpreted, leaving SB/SE at risk of trying to  redesign processes that are already working well or missing opportunities  to fix processes with potential for improvement.  Because GAO\u2019s Business  Process Reengineering Assessment Guide and our roundtable participants  stressed the importance of complete productivity data and because this  was a recurring issue we identified in our assessment of the four SB/SE  projects, we discuss the importance of adjusting for case complexity and  quality when measuring productivity in more detail in the next section of  this report.", "Another example of not consistently following our key steps in the  \u201cDecision to Change\u201d stage is found in the Field Examination  Reengineering project.  The project team sought the advice of many large,  noted organizations to benchmark its productivity.  However, the work did  not lead to measuring how SB/SE\u2019s productivity compared to others\u2019  because the team did not believe that operations in other organizations  were comparable.  Without this benchmarking, the team did not know  whether and by how much it could improve productivity by updating  operations based on the experiences of other large organizations.  Both  GAO\u2019s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide and our  roundtable participants stressed that although processes may seem unique  to government, they likely have counterparts at a process level in the  private sector.  Moreover, GAO\u2019s Guide says that looking at dissimilar  organizations can actually lead to the most fruitful improvements because  it stimulates thinking about new approaches.", "During the \u201cTarget Process Development\u201d stage, the projects we reviewed  consistently included the steps that prepare for implementation.  Planning  on all four of the projects we studied included obtaining executive support,  assessing barriers to implementing changed processes, and assessing  resource needs and availability.  The Compliance Support Case Processing  Redesign team, for example, originally identified the need for a computer  programming change to implement part of their process redesign.  When  the programming change could not be made immediately, they continued  with a manual process in order to keep the project moving forward.", "However, SB/SE less consistently included key steps in this stage related to  designing the new process.  For example, in the Collection Taxpayer  Delinquent Account Support project, SB/SE did not consider alternatives to  achieving the project\u2019s goal of identifying the best cases to assign to  collections staff.  Because options were not considered, the team ran the  risk of missing a more effective approach than the one they took.  Another   team did not design the new process based on analysis of a gap between  current and desired productivity.  It is important at this stage for projects to  include fact-based performance analysis to assess how to change processes  that are in greatest need of improvement in terms of cost, quality, and  timeliness.  By analyzing the gap between an existing process\u2019s  performance and where that performance should be, projects can target  those processes that are most in need of improvement, analyze  alternatives, and develop and justify implementation plans.  Using these  steps can increase the likelihood of determining the best new process.", "During the \u201cImplementation\u201d stage, three of the four projects we reviewed  had completed implementation plans and all three included key  implementation steps.  These steps focus on the challenge of turning  project concepts into a workable program.  For example, in the Collection  Taxpayer Delinquent Account Support project, the team clearly defined  who was responsible for updating the existing computer programs to select  cases for priority collection action and who was responsible for evaluating  the implemented process.  We also found that three of the four teams  conducted pilot tests and used their results to modify the new processes  prior to implementation\u2014steps important for ensuring that process  problems are worked out prior to project implementation.", "SB/SE was less consistent, however, in establishing employee performance  expectations for the new processes.  In the Field Examination  Reengineering project, SB/SE plans to implement changes to audit planning  steps in order to streamline audits and reduce demands on taxpayers for  additional information.  SB/SE\u2019s plan includes monitoring the deployment  of the new process using measures such as the percent of personnel  trained.  However, SB/SE\u2019s plan does not specify performance expectations  for employees or how it will measure whether its auditors are using the  new techniques properly.", "Two projects had completed plans for outcome assessments at the time of  our review. One of these, the Collection Taxpayer Delinquent Account  Support project, included an evaluation plan using available data to  develop measures of how accurately the new models were working.  The  other two projects were in the process of developing evaluation plans\u2014an  important step to ensure that the correct data are available and collected  once the change is implemented.", "Three of four initiatives incorporated change management principles  throughout their initiatives.  In the fourth, we agreed with SB/SE managers  that change management key steps were not a factor because the changes  to the method of prioritizing collection cases did not affect collections  staff.  These are key steps because successful process improvement  depends on overcoming a natural resistance to change and giving staff the  training to implement the changes.  The three project teams where change  management was a factor consistently completed all of the key steps in the  \u201cChange Management\u201d stage.", "In the course of our discussions with SB/SE managers about the steps that  their projects did and did not include, we learned that SB/SE does not have  its own guidance or framework that describes the steps to be followed in  planning process improvement projects.  SB/SE managers said that  projects had been planned and carried out without such a framework.   Contractors provided substantial assistance in designing SB/SE\u2019s process  improvement projects, and managers told us that they relied in large part  on the contractor staffs\u2019 expertise and experience in planning the projects.", "A framework laying out the steps to be followed is an important internal  control for projects such as these because it provides top managers  assurance that the steps that the organization has determined to be  important are either taken on each project or that project managers have  explained why they should be omitted.  GAO\u2019s Business Process  Reengineering Assessment Guide notes that an established framework is  important for projects in that it defines in detail the activities the project  team needs to complete and alerts the team to key issues that it must  address.  Without a process improvement framework and a consistent set  of steps to follow, IRS runs the risk of future projects also missing key  steps.  This, in turn, exacerbates the risk of projects not addressing  appropriate process problems, developing a less than optimal target  process, ineffectively implementing the project, inaccurately assessing  project outcomes, or mismanaging the change to the new process.  A  framework such as the one we developed for this report is an important  internal control tool for SB/SE managers to guard against these risks.  The  internal control is needed whether process improvement is planned by  SB/SE staff or contractors.  Such a framework may also prove useful in  other IRS units besides SB/SE.  As with the 20-step framework we used to  assess SB/SE\u2019s approach, however, any such guidelines should allow for  appropriate managerial discretion in cases where certain steps are not  relevant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Enforcement Productivity Data Only Partially Adjusted for Complexity and Quality", "paragraphs": ["The data available to SB/SE managers to assess the productivity of their  enforcement activities, identify processes that need improvement, and  assess the success of their process improvement efforts are only partially  adjusted for complexity and quality of cases worked.  Productivity  measures the efficiency with which resources are used to produce outputs.   Specific productivity measures take the form of ratios of outputs to inputs  such as cases closed or dollars collected per staff year.  The accurate  measurement of enforcement productivity requires data about the quantity  of outputs produced and inputs used that are accurate and consistent over  time and that link the outputs directly to the inputs used to produce them.", "The accurate measurement of productivity also requires good data on the  relative complexity or difficulty of the cases and the quality of the work  done by IRS staff.   Case complexity can vary with the type of tax  (employment vs. income), the type of taxpayer (individual vs. business)  and the type and sources of income and expenses.  A measure of  productivity like cases closed per staff year that shows an increase may not  indicate a real gain in efficiency if the mix of cases worked has shifted to  less difficult cases or the quality of the work has declined.  This problem of  adjusting for quality and complexity is not unique to SB/SE process  improvement projects\u2014the data available to process improvement project  managers are the same data used throughout SB/SE to measure  productivity and otherwise manage enforcement operations.", "SB/SE managers used data on the number of cases completed and the time  it takes to complete them to measure output.  Such data were usually only  partially adjusted for quality and only once were they adjusted for  complexity.  Opportunities to make more such adjustments were missed.", "An example of a complete adjustment for complexity is the Compliance  Support Case Processing Redesign team\u2019s use of a proxy for complexity.   The project illustrates both the shortcomings of SB/SE\u2019s productivity data  and the feasibility of some adjustments using other currently available  information.  The team wanted to measure the work needed to enter  examination and collection case data into the information system, holding  complexity constant, but direct measures of complexity were not available.   While developing their new process, the team knew that more complex  cases were to be assigned to higher-grade clerks.  The team used the  grade of the clerk to adjust output for complexity.  Although not a direct  measure of relative complexity, the grade level of the clerks provided  managers a means to adjust for complexity and better identify performance  increases that were due to changes in productivity by holding complexity  constant.  Such an adjustment increases the credibility of the team\u2019s  estimate that IRS would save up to 385 positions from the proposed  redesign.", "SB/SE has systems in place that measure quality against current standards  but do not account adequately for changes in standards of quality.  The  Exam Quality Measurement System (EQMS) and the Collection Quality  Measurement System (CQMS) use samples of audit and collection cases,  respectively, to determine if IRS standards were followed and compute  scores that summarize the quality of the case.   Generally, the scoring is  done on a numerical scale.  For example, EQMS uses quality scores that  range on a scale from 0 to 100.  To SB/SE\u2019s credit, most of the projects that  we reviewed used EQMS and CQMS scores in an attempt to control for  quality changes.  Unfortunately, these scores may not adequately reflect  changes in standards of quality.  For example, the IRS Restructuring and  Reform Act of 1998 placed additional documentation requirements for  certain collection actions on SB/SE collections staff, such as certifications  that they had verified that taxes were past due and that sanctions were  appropriate given the taxpayers\u2019 circumstances.  SB/SE has changed the  standards used in EQMS and CQMS to reflect the new requirements but has  not changed its quality scale to account for the new, higher level of quality  implied by the new standards.  As a result, two exams with the same quality  scores, one done before passage of the act and one after, may not have the  same level of quality.  If the way that SB/SE computes its quality scores  does not adequately reflect such changes in quality standards, an increase  in staff time needed to complete the additional requirement may be  misinterpreted as a decline in productivity.", "Opportunities exist to improve SB/SE\u2019s enforcement productivity data.   Statistical methods that are widely used in both the public and private  sectors can be used to adjust SB/SE productivity measures for quality and  complexity.  In particular, by using these methods, managers can  distinguish productivity changes that represent real efficiency gains or  losses from those that are due to changes in quality standards.  These  methods could be implemented using data currently available at SB/SE.   The cost of implementation would be chiefly the staff time required to  adapt the statistical models to SB/SE.  Although the computations are  complex, the methods can be implemented using existing software.  We  currently have under way a separate study that illustrates how these  methods can be used to create better productivity measures at IRS.  We  plan to report the results of that study later in 2004.", "We recognize that better incorporating the complexity and quality of  enforcement cases in enforcement productivity data could entail costs to  SB/SE.  Collecting additional data on complexity and quality may require  long-term planning and investment of additional resources. However, as  discussed in the previous paragraph, there are options available now to  mitigate such costs.  Existing statistical methods could be used in the short  term, with currently available data on case complexity and quality to  improve productivity measurement.  In addition, IRS\u2019s ongoing business  systems modernization effort may provide additional opportunities for  collecting data.", "Our roundtable participants stressed the benefits of productivity analysis.  They said that an inadequate understanding of productivity makes it harder  to distinguish processes with a potential for improvement from those  without such potential.
