The Federal Acquisition Regulation and OMB guidance direct federal agencies to use performance-based contracts to the maximum extent practicable when acquiring services\u2014that is, contracts with measurable performance standards and a method of assessing contractor performance against those standards. In addition, the Federal Acquisition Regulation notes a preference for firm-fixed-price contracts that minimize risk rather than other payment arrangements such as contracts that reimburse contractors for expenses. Officials from each agency said that, starting in 2009, their agencies began placing greater emphasis on using performance-based, firm-fixed-price contracts, including, for example, requiring written justification for contracts that are not performance-based. The three agencies collectively increased their use of performance-based, firm-fixed-price contracts from about 16 percent of obligations for professional service contracts in fiscal year 2009 to about 53 percent in fiscal year 2013.", "The three USDA agencies did not consistently follow regulations, policies, and guidance in overseeing the 15 professional service contracts GAO reviewed, and did not consistently assess contractor performance as required. For example, 12 of the 15 professional service contracts GAO reviewed did not include quality assurance surveillance plans to guide oversight of the contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation directs that such plans be prepared as necessary to ensure contract requirements are met. Food and Nutrition Service officials told GAO the agency is planning to make quality assurance surveillance plans a requirement for all contracts by fiscal year 2015, with compliance tracked in an internal system. As part of this effort, the agency has held training for staff on the use of such plans. Departmental Management and the Forest Service, however, do not have similar mechanisms planned or in place to help ensure that such plans are included in contracts as necessary, in part because this has not been a priority in the past. Without such mechanisms, the agencies may not be able to fully assess the quality and timeliness of the services they receive. In addition, the agencies did not consistently assess contractor performance as directed by federal regulation and guidance. OMB has established government-wide performance targets for completing these assessments, but the three agencies in GAO's review fell short of these targets in fiscal year 2013. Agency officials told GAO that contractor assessments had not been completed for all contracts in part because the agencies had not emphasized the importance of doing so. The Forest Service has developed a specific written strategy for meeting OMB's targets for contractor assessments, but neither Departmental Management nor the Food and Nutrition Service has done so. Without such strategies, it is unclear how, when, or whether Departmental Management and the Food and Nutrition Service will meet OMB's targets, and thus the government may continue to have limited contractor performance information when making future contracting decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Departmental Management and the Forest Service establish mechanisms to help ensure inclusion of quality assurance surveillance plans in contracts as necessary, and that Departmental Management and the Food and Nutrition Service develop strategies for meeting OMB's targets for contractor assessments.

Similarly, OMB  guidance emphasizes contract oversight activities such as meeting  regularly with the contractor, requiring periodic progress reports, and  regularly discussing contractor performance. The importance of  minimizing financial risk to the government from contracts was also  highlighted in a March 2009 presidential memorandum, which stated that  the federal government must have sufficient capacity to manage and  oversee the contracting process from start to finish to ensure that  taxpayer funds are spent wisely and not subjected to excessive risk.", "You asked us to review aspects of USDA\u2019s contracting for professional  services.

Generally, we selected  contracts that were among the highest in value (as measured by  obligated dollars) and that represented a mix of contract types (e.g., firm- fixed price and labor hour) and covered a variety of professional services  (e.g., marketing and human resource assistance). We selected contracts  that were awarded between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2012, to  allow time for oversight activities to have taken place for each contract.  Because we used a nonprobability sample, the results are not  generalizable but provide examples of USDA\u2019s contract types and  oversight activities. For these 15 contracts, we reviewed contract  documents provided by agency officials and interviewed the agencies\u2019  cognizant contracting officers and contracting officer\u2019s representatives to  obtain information on the agency\u2019s oversight practices. In addition, to  determine the extent to which the agencies had completed contractor  performance assessments, we reviewed data from the Past Performance  Information Retrieval System. Because this system does not distinguish  between professional service contracts and other contracts for goods or  services, our analysis of the three agencies\u2019 completion of performance  assessments encompasses all contracts, not just professional service  contracts. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed agency  documents and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report.

OMB guidance  from 1998 notes that a performance-based contract emphasizes that all  aspects of an acquisition should be structured around the purpose of the  work to be performed as opposed to the manner in which the work is to  be performed or broad, imprecise statements of work that preclude an  objective assessment of contractor performance. Performance-based  contracts are intended to (1) ensure that contractors are given freedom to  determine how to meet the government's performance objectives,  (2) achieve appropriate performance quality levels, and (3) ensure that  payment is made only for services that meet these levels.", "In addition, the Federal Acquisition Regulation notes a preference for  firm-fixed-price contracts rather than other payment arrangements such  as contracts that reimburse contractors for expenses. OMB has likewise  encouraged the use of fixed-price contracts, in keeping with a 2009  presidential memorandum that stated: \u201chere shall be a preference for  fixed-price type contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts shall be used  only when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its  requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract.\u201d Fixed- price contracts are generally seen as less risky to the government  because the contractor, rather than the government, assumes the  financial risk if there is a cost overrun. Overall, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation gives the following order of preference for professional service  contract types: (1) contracts that are both performance based and firm- fixed price; (2) contracts that are performance based but not firm-fixed  price; and (3) contracts that are not performance based.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation states that in general, each contract  file shall include documentation to show why the particular contract type  was selected. If the contract is not firm-fixed price, the document should  include an analysis of why the use of another type is appropriate,  rationale and reasoning essential to support the contract type selection,  an assessment of the adequacy of government resources that are used  for contracts that are not firm-fixed price, and a discussion of the actions  planned to minimize the use of contracts that are not firm-fixed price in  the future.

The contracting officer has authority to enter into, administer, and  terminate contracts and has the overall responsibility for ensuring the  contractor complies with the terms of the contract. As part of his or her  responsibilities, the contracting officer selects a contracting officer\u2019s  representative, who assists in the technical monitoring and day-to-day  administration of a contract. The Federal Acquisition Regulation states  that for contracts that are not firm-fixed price, the contracting officer shall  designate and authorize the contracting officer\u2019s representative in writing  and specify the extent of the contracting officer\u2019s representative\u2019s  authority; the designation documents are also to be furnished to the  contractor. OMB guidance also emphasizes the importance of defining  the contracting officer\u2019s representative\u2019s roles and responsibilities, noting  that representatives should be notified of their role in a written letter that  lists specific duties and tasks; this letter is to be signed by the contracting  officer.", "Contracting officer\u2019s representatives are often selected based on their  knowledge of the program that is contracting for the service rather than  their contracting expertise, and they are to receive training in their duties.  For example, an information technology support contract may have an  information technology specialist serving as the contracting officer\u2019s  representative because of that person\u2019s knowledge of the subject matter.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires contracting officer\u2019s  representatives to be qualified by contracting training and experience  commensurate with the responsibilities to be delegated, and OMB  guidance establishes specific training and experience requirements for  contracting officer\u2019s representatives. Generally, the role of the  contracting officer\u2019s representative can be either part-time or full-time, and  it is often a collateral duty.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation and OMB guidance address other  aspects of contract oversight as well. For example, both the Federal  Acquisition Regulation and OMB guidance direct that contracts include a  quality assurance surveillance plan as necessary to ensure that the  contractor\u2019s service meets contract requirements. The Federal Acquisition  Regulation states that the quality assurance surveillance plan should  specify all work requiring surveillance and the surveillance method.  Similarly, OMB guidance states that quality assurance surveillance plans  should provide a systematic, structured method for the contracting  officer\u2019s representative to evaluate services and products contractors are  required to furnish, focusing on the quality of the contractor\u2019s work. We  have found in the past that such plans are critical to assessing the quality  and timeliness of the products and services produced by contractors.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation and OMB guidance also direct  agencies to complete assessments of contractor performance. Such  assessments include, for example, the quality of the product or service  provided, the contractor\u2019s adherence to the contract schedule and ability  to control costs, business relations, small business utilization, and  management of key personnel. The federal government can then use  these assessments to assist it in selecting contractors for future work.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires agencies to submit past  performance assessments electronically into the Contractor Performance  Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); assessments are automatically  transmitted into the Past Performance Information Retrieval System,  where they are available government-wide for 3 years after the contract  performance completion date. For contracts or orders that exceed a  certain threshold, the Federal Acquisition Regulation generally requires  agencies to evaluate the contractor\u2019s performance at least annually and  at the time the work is completed.", "In a March 2013 memorandum, OMB set government-wide performance  targets for completing contractor performance assessments, with the aim  of achieving 100 percent compliance by fiscal year 2015.

As noted earlier, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and OMB  guidance direct federal agencies to use performance-based contracts to  the maximum extent practicable when acquiring services, and the Federal  Acquisition Regulation states that performance-based, firm-fixed-price  contracts are preferred.

For example, officials told us that a contract based on  specific tasks rather than results, such as a contract for human resource  support services that includes hiring and administrative assistance,  should not be performance based. Likewise, when the Forest Service  changed its financial software system, the agency used a labor-hour  contract rather than a firm-fixed-price contract because it did not know  how much time implementation of the new system would take and thus  could not determine a reasonable firm-fixed price in advance.", "OMB, Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies; Subject: Improving  Government Acquisition (Washington, D.C.: July 29, 2009). when using professional service contracts.

As of fiscal year 2013, Departmental Management directs its  contracting officers to provide written justification in the contract file if the  contracts are not performance based, according to agency acquisition  operating procedures. In addition, according to agency officials, a team  lead or contracting chief must review and sign off on a checklist from the  contracting officer that states whether an explanation for contracts that  are not performance based or are not firm-fixed price was included in the  contract file. Similarly, at the Food and Nutrition Service, the head of  contracting activity designee signs off on any contracts that are not firm- fixed price, and agency data indicate the vast majority of obligations for  professional service contracts are now for performance-based and firm- fixed-price contracts\u2014nearly 90 percent in fiscal year 2013.", "The Forest Service likewise is encouraging performance-based and firm- fixed-price contracting through training and other efforts, including moving  its service contracts with larger obligated dollar amounts to lower-risk  contracting types, according to a headquarters official. In its contracting  procedures, the Forest Service requires that a rationale be provided if a  contract is not performance based or firm-fixed price. Forest Service  officials told us that using firm-fixed-price contracts instead of contracts  that reimburse contractors for labor hours has saved the agency millions  of dollars since fiscal year 2011. For example, one headquarters official  estimated that changing a contract with a travel help desk from labor  hours to firm-fixed price has resulted in a savings of $1 million per year.

In addition, the Forest Service has  increased its emphasis on contractor assessments since fiscal year 2013,  raising the completion rate for required assessments from about  24 percent in April 2013, when the agency first started tracking  compliance, to about 36 percent at the end of September 2013, according  to agency data; as noted, the agency\u2019s compliance rate was about  66 percent as of August 2014. Forest Service officials told us that the  agency has recently been able to focus on improving completion of  contractor assessments because the agency has finished a contracting  initiative in another area, freeing up resources that can be devoted to this  effort.", "In addition, the Forest Service has developed a specific written strategy  for meeting OMB\u2019s compliance targets for contractor assessments. The  Forest Service\u2019s strategy was prepared in response to USDA\u2019s 2013  request that each agency within the department develop a plan detailing  steps to improve reporting. Some of the steps included in the Forest  Service plan were to appoint and train regional staff tasked with  responsibilities related to contractor assessments and create a tracking  spreadsheet to provide weekly updates on CPARS activity. Moreover, the  Forest Service included compliance with contractor assessments among  its goals in a recently updated strategic plan. However, unlike the Forest  Service, neither Departmental Management nor the Food and Nutrition  Service has a strategy for meeting OMB\u2019s targets. According to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, strategies for  meeting agency performance goals are an important part of sound  program management. Without such a strategy, it is unclear how, when,  or whether Departmental Management and the Food and Nutrition  Service will increase their contractor assessment compliance to the  extent laid out in those targets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USDA\u2019s Departmental Management, Food and Nutrition Service, and  Forest Service have all shown improvement in recent years in selecting  lower-risk types of contracts for professional services and overseeing  those contracts. For example, the three agencies have made it a priority  to increase their use of performance-based, firm-fixed-price contracts and  have increased the percentage of obligated dollars used for these types  of contracts. The agencies have also taken steps to improve contract  oversight, as evidenced by all three agencies developing templates for  quality assurance surveillance plans. Nevertheless, additional  improvements in contract oversight could better position the agencies to  ensure that the government gets what it is paying for under these  contracts. For example, while several agency officials we spoke with  recognized that including a quality assurance surveillance plan in the  contract was a best practice for overseeing contracts, and we have  previously reported on the importance of these plans, neither the Forest  Service nor Departmental Management has a mechanism in place to  ensure that these plans are included in contracts as necessary. The  absence of quality assurance surveillance plans can limit the agencies\u2019  oversight over the quality and timeliness of the services provided. In  addition, while OMB has cited the importance of completing contractor  performance assessments and has established targets for doing so,  neither Departmental Management nor the Food and Nutrition Service  has developed strategies to meet OMB targets. Without such strategies,  these agencies may continue to fall short of OMB\u2019s goals, and the  government may continue to have limited contractor performance  information when making future contracting decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the oversight of contracts for professional services and help  ensure that federal contracting officials have complete and timely  information about the performance of contractors, we recommend that the  Secretary of Agriculture take the following two actions:", "Direct the Head of Contracting Activity for Departmental Management  and the Chief of the Forest Service to put mechanisms in place to  help ensure that quality assurance surveillance plans are included in  contracts as necessary.", "Direct the Head of Contracting Activity for Departmental Management  and the Administrator for the Food and Nutrition Service to develop  strategies for meeting the targets OMB has established regarding the  percentage of contracts for which contractor performance  assessments are completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA for review and comment.

To obtain additional insight into selection of preferred contract  types and other preferred contracting practices, we also reviewed our  reports that discuss the application of these practices by various  agencies, as well as relevant federal internal control standards. We also  interviewed the head of contracting (or a designee) for each of the three  agencies to identify agency processes and procedures for selecting  contract types and overseeing contracts.", "To assess the extent to which USDA\u2019s Departmental Management, Food  and Nutrition Service, and Forest Service used preferred contract types,  we obtained and analyzed data from the government\u2019s Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation for the 5 most recent fiscal  years\u20142009 through 2013. We included those contracts coded in the  system as \u201cprofessional, administrative, and management support  services\u201d (referred to in the system as product service code \u201cR\u201d). In some  cases, there may be overlap across various product service codes  because individual contracts may encompass activities covered by  multiple service codes. Because of possible subjectivity in agency  officials\u2019 selection of product service codes for contracts, obligated  amounts for professional service contracts in this report are approximate.  To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed agency documents  and interviewed officials, and while our report notes questions about the  accuracy of some of the elements in the database, we found the data to  be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We then compared  the information we obtained from the Federal Procurement Data System- Next Generation, as well as our interviews of agency officials, to the  regulations, policies, and guidance we reviewed on preferred practices for  selecting contract types to assess the extent to which the agencies  followed regulations, policies, and OMB guidance in selecting contract  types.", "To assess the extent to which the three agencies followed federal  regulations, agency policies and guidance, and OMB guidance in  overseeing contracts, we selected from the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation a nonprobability sample of 15 professional  service contracts for further review\u20145 from each of the three agencies  included in our review. Generally, we selected contracts that were among  the highest in value (as measured by obligated dollars) and that  represented a mix of contract types (e.g., firm-fixed price and labor hour)  and types of services contracted (e.g., marketing and human resource  assistance). We selected contracts that were awarded between October  1, 2008, and September 30, 2012, to allow time for oversight activities to  have taken place for each contract. Because this was a nonprobability  sample, the results are not generalizable but provide examples of USDA\u2019s  contract types and oversight activities. For these 15 contracts, we  reviewed contract documents provided by agency officials and  interviewed the agencies\u2019 cognizant contracting officers and contracting  officer\u2019s representatives to obtain information on selection of contract  type. In two cases, the contracting officers and contracting officer\u2019s  representatives assigned to the contracts were no longer with USDA; in  those cases, we met with other officials identified by the agency as  knowledgeable about these contracts.", "We also identified preferred contract oversight practices by reviewing the  relevant regulations, policies, and guidance indicated above, and by  reviewing our past reports discussing the use of these practices. We  then reviewed contract documents from the 15 contracts in our  nonprobability sample and interviewed cognizant contracting officers,  contracting officer\u2019s representatives, and other officials to obtain  information on the use of contract oversight practices. In addition, to  determine the extent to which the agencies had completed contractor  performance assessments, we obtained and analyzed data from the Past  Performance Information Retrieval System as of August 1, 2014.  Assessments are available in this system for 3 years after the contract  performance completion date, except for construction and architect- engineer contracts, for which data are available for 6 years after the  contract performance completion date. Because this system does not  distinguish between professional service contracts (that is, contracts  coded under product service code \u201cR\u201d) and other contracts for goods or  services, our analysis of the three agencies\u2019 completion of performance  assessments encompasses all contracts in the database, not just  professional service contracts. To assess the reliability of these data, we  reviewed agency documents and found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. We then compared the information we  obtained from our review of the 15 contracts in our sample, our interviews  of agency officials, and our analysis of data from the Past Performance  Information Retrieval System, to the regulations, policies, and guidance  we reviewed on preferred practices for overseeing contracts to assess the  extent to which the agencies followed regulations, policies, and OMB  guidance in overseeing contracts.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
