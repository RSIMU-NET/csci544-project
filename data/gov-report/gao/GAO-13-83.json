Annual appropriations bills have consistently provided NDF with three key authorities that it has used to carry out its activities. First, NDF has the authority to undertake projects notwithstanding any other provision of law. NDF has used this authority to fund projects in countries, such as North Korea, where U.S. assistance is prohibited by U.S. sanctions and other legal restrictions. Second, NDF has the authority to undertake projects globally. NDF has used this authority to fund projects in numerous regions around the world, in contrast with other U.S. nonproliferation programs, which have historically focused on countries in the former Soviet Union. Third, NDF's appropriations do not expire within a particular time period, enabling NDF to carry over balances from year to year not designated for specific projects. However, NDF has not determined appropriate levels for these balances, which increased significantly in the past few years. Additionally, NDF has sometimes taken many years to close projects, including those where work was never started or was suspended, and has not established criteria to determine when inactive projects should be closed and unexpended resources made available for other projects. As a result, NDF funds may be tied up for years in inactive projects, precluding the funds' use for other projects.", "State has never conducted a program evaluation of NDF. In February 2012, State developed a policy requiring bureaus to evaluate programs, projects, and activities, and outlined the requirements for these evaluations. As part of this policy, State required bureaus to submit an evaluation plan for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 that identified the programs and projects they plan to evaluate. However, the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation (ISN), which oversees NDF, did not include NDF in its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 evaluation plan. State currently lacks information that could be used to conduct a program evaluation and to improve NDF's management of the program. Project close-out reports are critical to the process of closing out a project and identifying lessons learned, but NDF project close-out reports do not contain information that could enable NDF to better manage its program. For example, not all closeout reports address the results of the project. NDF uses e-mails and face-to-face meetings to communicate lessons learned without documenting them. Established standards suggest that these should be transferred to a database of lessons learned for use in future projects and activities, an action State officials said they are considering taking. NDF has also produced a project management guide to encourage project managers to use standard procedures and write close-out reports, but does not require the use of this guide. In addition, the guide does not detail a format for project managers to use in preparing their close-out reports or list the information that project managers must address. NDF officials said they plan to develop standard operating procedures to address these issues, but had not done so as of November 2012."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State (1) develop a methodology for determining the amount of carryover reserves needed to meet program requirements, (2) develop guidance for determining when inactive NDF projects should be closed out, (3) conduct periodic program evaluations of NDF, and (4) establish requirements for the types of information to be included in project close-out reports.

Congress  created the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) in 1992 to  support U.S. government efforts to combat such threats. Since then, the  Department of State (State), which manages the program, has used NDF  to fund a variety of nonproliferation and disarmament projects. These  projects have included the shutdown of chemical weapons facilities, the  transfer of highly enriched uranium to secure locations, the construction  of border security facilities, and the destruction of stockpiles of ballistic  missiles. NDF has funded projects in a range of countries around the  globe and has also supported work by international organizations, such  as the International Atomic Energy Agency. Congress has provided NDF  with various legal authorities to increase its ability to carry out  nonproliferation and disarmament projects, as opportunities arise. State  officials have noted that these authorities provide NDF a level of flexibility  in carrying out its mission that is uncommon among U.S. government  programs. According to State, NDF has made it possible for the U.S.  government to respond rapidly to unanticipated or unusually difficult, high- priority nonproliferation and disarmament opportunities. While NDF has  taken on high-profile projects in locations significant to U.S. interests,  such as North Korea and Libya, questions have been raised about how  NDF has used its legal authorities, including its authority to carry over  funds into future fiscal years, and the extent to which it is effectively  implementing its activities.", "This report examines (1) State\u2019s use of NDF authorities in developing and  implementing NDF projects and (2) the extent to which State has  conducted a program evaluation of NDF and used this information to  improve program performance.

We also analyzed  NDF project data on funding amounts, locations, objectives, and time  frames for fiscal years 1994 through 2012. We assessed both the program  and project data and found them sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  Additionally, we reviewed NDF project documentation, such as project  proposal summaries, approval memos, and congressional notifications to  obtain additional information on NDF projects. To identify NDF\u2019s key legal  authorities, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations. To assess the  extent to which State has evaluated NDF, we met with State officials from  the Bureaus of Budget and Planning and International Security and  Nonproliferation (ISN), and reviewed project close-out documentation for a  judgmental sample of 23 project close-out reports\u201414 of which we  selected, and 9 of which State selected. In selecting our sample, we  considered only projects that NDF had closed out since the beginning of  fiscal year 2007. Our selection criteria included project cost, location, and  type. State selected its projects using similar criteria; however, State did  not limit itself to projects that were closed out. For example, State selected  some projects for which work was completed, but the project was not yet  officially closed out. For all 23 project close-out reports, we assessed the  types of information contained in these reports, and the degree to which  they could be used to provide needed information for evaluations and  improve NDF\u2019s management of the program. In reviewing the  documentation for the projects State selected, we determined that the  inclusion of these projects in our analysis did not alter our overall findings  and thus did not compromise the independence of our work.

The Glenn Amendment triggers U.S. sanctions if  the President determines that a nonnuclear country (as defined by the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty) has detonated a nuclear explosive  device.", "NDF also requested the use of its notwithstanding authority to  overcome a restriction that the Foreign Assistance Act would have  imposed on a project in Iraq. The Act restricts U.S. assistance to  countries that have severed diplomatic relations with the United  States and which have not entered into a new bilateral assistance  agreement once diplomatic relations have resumed. At the time of the project, there were concerns regarding the status of the United  States\u2019 bilateral agreement with Iraq.", "In addition to using its notwithstanding authority to bypass restrictions on  U.S. assistance to particular countries, NDF has in some cases also used  its notwithstanding authority to overcome laws and regulations pertaining  to contracting and acquisitions. For example, NDF used its  notwithstanding authority on some contracts to overcome Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) competition requirements, according to a  2004 State Inspector General report. Additionally, a 2009 National  Academies of Science report examining options for strengthening and  expanding DOD\u2019s CTR program noted that, because of its  notwithstanding authority, NDF is not subject to contracting requirements,  including the FAR, which CTR must follow. The report noted that this  ability may allow NDF to undertake certain projects more quickly and at  less expense than CTR. However, according to State officials, NDF has  not typically used the program\u2019s notwithstanding authority to bypass  federal contracting laws and regulations. State officials said that, while  NDF has almost always relied on sole-source bids, rather than a  competitive bidding process, it primarily selected contractors to implement  projects using existing flexibilities in the law and regulations available to  all agencies. For example, State officials stated that NDF has relied on  provisions in the FAR that permit sole-source contracts in situations  where there is an urgent and compelling need.", "In addition to competition requirements, some NDF officials stated that  NDF may use its notwithstanding authority to bypass other types of  acquisition requirements, such as \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions.

NDF\u2019s geographic authority allows it to  fund projects outside the states of the FSU if the Under Secretary for  Arms Control and International Security makes a determination that it is in  the national security interest of the United States to do so. NDF\u2019s  authority to fund projects globally since the program\u2019s start in 1994 is in  contrast to the authorities of some other U.S. nonproliferation programs.  For example, DOD\u2019s CTR program was not authorized to fund any  projects outside the FSU until the passage of the Fiscal Year 2004  Defense Authorization Bill and continued to face various restrictions on  conducting work outside the FSU until 2007. In addition, as we reported in  December 2011, many of DOE\u2019s Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation  programs, which originated in the early 1990s following the dissolution of  the Soviet Union, have focused primarily on improving nuclear security in  Russia. The NDF Director stated that, while NDF has been used to  supplement projects in the FSU or to fill emergency gaps, its primary  emphasis has always been on other parts of the world.", "Since 1994, NDF has used its geographic authority to fund projects in  Central and South America, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern and  Western Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. As shown in  figure 5, NDF has funded projects in several different countries since the  beginning of fiscal year 2007, including Afghanistan, Egypt, Kazakhstan,  North Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It has also funded a limited  number of projects in the United States, including the construction of  training facilities at DOE\u2019s Hazardous Materials Management and  Emergency Response site in Washington State for the purpose of training  foreign nationals.", "Over the life of the program, Congress has consistently granted NDF no- year budget authority in annual appropriations bills. This authority makes  NDF appropriations available for obligation until expended, rather than  requiring them to be obligated within a particular time period, such as a  fiscal year. This authority has allowed NDF to carry over balances across  multiple fiscal years that it has not designated for specific projects. NDF  considers money to be designated for a specific project and no longer  available for use on other projects at the point when it notifies Congress  of its intent to fund the project, unless NDF renotifies the funds for the  purpose of another project. NDF\u2019s carryover balances have increased  over time and are at historically high levels. Figure 6 provides an  overview of NDF\u2019s various categories of funding and how NDF  accumulates carryover balances. In addition, NDF\u2019s no-year budget  authority allows it to close projects and apply the unexpended funds to  future projects; however, NDF has sometimes delayed in closing out  some projects for many years, including projects where no work ever  occurred or was suspended. Until projects are closed, any unexpended  project funds are not reported as part of NDF\u2019s carryover balances. As a  result, NDF\u2019s carryover balance is likely understated.", "NDF\u2019s carryover balances have grown significantly in the past few years  to historically high levels. NDF\u2019s carryover balance peaked at the end of  fiscal year 2009 at $122 million in unnotified funds, which were carried  over into fiscal year 2010 as shown in figure 7. Unnotified funds include  funds never designated for a project, as well as any unobligated and  unexpended project funds that once again become available as unnotified  funds when a project is closed. Before the end of fiscal year 2009, NDF\u2019s  balance carried over into the next fiscal year had been $10 million or  higher three times since the program began in fiscal year 1994 and had  never been higher than $22 million. NDF\u2019s carryover balance was $86  million at the end of fiscal year 2012.", "NDF has not established a formal means of determining the amount of  money it needs to carry over from year to year to respond to  unanticipated nonproliferation and disarmament opportunities.According to the Assistant Secretary of State for International Security  and Nonproliferation, State management is aware of the growth in NDF\u2019s  carryover balances and is committed to spending them down as  opportunities consistent with the mission of NDF arise.", "In the past several years, increases in NDF\u2019s annual appropriations from  levels in earlier fiscal years, as well as the initiation of work on a smaller  number of projects, have contributed to NDF\u2019s increased carryover  balances. As shown in figure 7 above, NDF\u2019s appropriation was never  more than $30 million before fiscal year 2005 and was only higher than  $20 million in one fiscal year. However, from fiscal years 2005 through 2012, NDF\u2019s appropriation has been $30 million or more every year. NDF\u2019s appropriation reached a high of $118 million in fiscal year 2009,  which included $77 million in a supplemental appropriation. NDF also  initiated a limited number of projects in the past 2 years. For example, it  initiated only one new project in fiscal year 2012 and no projects in fiscal  year 2011. In total, NDF notified Congress of 24 projects from fiscal years  2007 through 2012, compared with 63 projects from fiscal years 2001  through 2006. In part, NDF officials stated that the decline in the number  of projects initiated was caused by the creation of other U.S. government  programs that are now able to fund various activities from their own  budgets that might have previously required NDF funding. For example,  NDF officials noted that NDF previously funded certain types of export  control assistance activities that State\u2019s Export Control and Related  Border Security Assistance program is now able to fund and implement.  However, NDF officials noted that while NDF has initiated a smaller  number of projects in fiscal years 2007 through 2012, many of the  projects it has initiated have involved significantly larger amounts of  notified funds than in fiscal years 2001 through 2006. For example, NDF  had only one project with over $10 million in notified funds in fiscal years  2001 through 2006, while it had 11 projects with over $10 million in  notified funds in fiscal years 2007 through 2012.", "NDF\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2013 was $30 million.", "Other U.S. government programs also receive no-year money and have  the ability to carry over balances from year to year. We have previously  reported on efforts by some of these programs to determine appropriate  carryover balance amounts. For example, in contrast with NDF, DOE\u2019s  National Nuclear Security Administration has established thresholds for  the carryover balances of its Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation  programs. These threshold amounts are based upon specified  percentages of the total funds available to each of the Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation programs in a given fiscal year. As we reported in  December 2011, if programs\u2019 carryover balances exceed these  thresholds, they will trigger additional scrutiny by the National Nuclear  Security Administration as to whether the carryover balances are  appropriate to meet program requirements.", "NDF also maintains a significant amount of funds that it notified to  Congress in the past for projects, but has not yet obligated. Of the 32  active NDF projects initiated in fiscal year 2010 or earlier, 25 percent of  the total notified funds have not yet been obligated. This represents more  than $66 million in notified but unobligated funds. As some NDF projects  take many years to complete, NDF does not necessarily obligate all funds  early in their implementation. However, of the 32 active NDF projects  initiated in fiscal year 2010 or earlier, we identified 5 projects for which  less than 25 percent of the notified funds had been obligated.", "Because NDF\u2019s funding is no-year money, NDF can close projects for  which it has never started work, or has suspended work, and apply the  unexpended funds to future projects. However, NDF has not established  guidance for determining when it should close out inactive projects. As a  result, NDF funds may be tied up for years in projects where no work is  occurring, precluding the funds\u2019 use for other projects. For example, NDF  maintains over $24 million in unobligated funds from a $25 million project  in North Korea that it notified to Congress in fiscal year 2008. NDF has  not obligated any of the funds for this project since North Korea expelled  International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and U.S. monitors from  the country in April 2009 and work on the project was abruptly halted.

Of the 61 projects NDF has closed out since the beginning of  fiscal year 2007, 16 were cancelled projects for which less than 20  percent of the notified funds were ever obligated and expended.

To support NDF in accomplishing its mission, U.S. law has  provided NDF with an unusual degree of flexibility in how it manages its  resources and conducts its work. While the critical nature of NDF\u2019s  mission provides a strong rationale for such flexibility, it also increases  the need for State to effectively manage its program resources to ensure  that NDF is achieving its intended results. However, State has not taken  the necessary steps to do so. For example, unlike some programs, NDF  lacks a formal process for determining how much carryover balance it  needs to maintain in reserve to meet unanticipated program  requirements. Without such a process, NDF cannot know to what extent  its carryover balances, which have increased in the past few years to  historically high levels, may be exceeding its unanticipated funding needs.  In addition, NDF has taken years to close some projects, delaying the  availability of unexpended funds for other projects and likely understating  NDF\u2019s carryover balances. A methodical process for determining NDF\u2019s  needed carryover balances and for closing projects could help ensure  that NDF\u2019s budget requests accurately reflect program needs.  Additionally, NDF lacks a process to identify and incorporate lessons  learned into future projects. State has never performed a program  evaluation of NDF in its 18-year history to determine lessons learned for  better designing projects that contribute to U.S. nonproliferation goals.

To gain additional information on the  reliability of data in FIMS, we met with a private contractor conducting a  review for NDF under the supervision of the State\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General. The scope of the contractor\u2019s work included a review of the  reliability of FIMS data. On the basis of the information we obtained, we  determined that the FIMS data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We analyzed NDF program-wide data to determine program  appropriations, commitments, obligations, and carryover balances for  fiscal years 1994 through 2012. We analyzed NDF project data to  determine project funding amounts, locations, objectives, and time frames  for fiscal years 1994 and 2012. Additionally, we reviewed NDF project  documentation including project proposals, approval memos, and  congressional notifications, for all NDF projects initiated since the  beginning of fiscal year 2007 to assess the types of projects NDF has  funded and how it used its authorities in developing and implementing  these projects. To gain additional information on NDF projects, we also  reviewed State press releases, speeches by State officials, and fact  sheets describing NDF activities.

To gather additional  information on NDF\u2019s authorities and how it develops and implements  projects, we conducted a series of interviews with NDF officials and also  met with officials from other agencies that proposed or implemented NDF  projects, including the Departments of Defense and Energy. We also  interviewed officials from the Office of Management and Budget to gain  additional information on NDF\u2019s budget planning process.

We also obtained copies of State\u2019s  February 2012 evaluation policy and March 2012 evaluation guidance, as  well as a copy of ISN\u2019s April 2012 bureau evaluation plan. NDF officials  described their project close-out reports as evaluations, but based on our  discussion with State ISN and Budgeting and Planning officials, our  review of GAO reports discussing evaluations, and State\u2019s February 2012  evaluation policy, we determined that NDF\u2019s project close-out reports fit  more closely the standard of a monitoring report. GAO defines  evaluations as individual, systematic studies that are conducted  periodically or on an as-required basis to assess how well a program is  working. State\u2019s evaluation policy notes that in addition to assessing the  progress of a program, project, or activity, evaluations go beyond  monitoring to identify the underlying factors and forces that affect the  implementation process, as well as the efficiency, sustainability, and  effectiveness of the program or project and its outcomes. As such, State\u2019s  policy draws a clear distinction between evaluation and monitoring. As  previous GAO reports, State, and other organizations have noted,  evaluations require a measure of independence, which can be promoted  in several ways, including entrusting the evaluation to an outside research  and evaluation organization or fostering a professional culture that  emphasizes the need for rigorous and independent evaluations. By  comparison, State defines monitoring as a continual process designed to  assess the progress of a program, project, or activity. The Project  Management Body of Knowledge Guide notes that project close-out  documentation consists of formal documentation indicating the  completion of a project or phase of a project. For all these reasons, on the  basis of our analysis of NDF\u2019s project close-out reports, we made the  determination that NDF\u2019s project close-out reports better fit the standard  of a monitoring report than an evaluation. While project close-out reports  serve a different purpose from evaluations, based on our review of the  Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide and NDF\u2019s Project  Management Guide, we determined that we could assess the project  close-out reports to determine their usefulness in enabling NDF to  improve its management of the program. For this purpose, we obtained a  judgmental sample of 23 project close-out reports\u201414 of which we  selected and 9 of which State selected. In selecting our sample, we chose  only to consider projects that NDF had closed out since the beginning of  fiscal year 2007\u2014of which there were 61\u2014in order to ensure that all  close-out documentation was completed for the projects. Our selection  criteria for our sample included project cost, location, and type. For  example, we selected a variety of projects from all four categories of  projects that NDF funds\u2014destruction and conversion, safeguards and  verification, enforcement and interdiction, and education and training.  State selected its projects using similar criteria; however, State did not  limit itself to projects that were closed out. In some cases, State selected  projects where work was completed, but the project was not yet officially  closed out. In reviewing the documentation for the projects State  selected, we determined that these projects were broadly similar to the  ones that we selected and the inclusion of these projects in our analysis  did not alter our overall findings or compromise the independence of our  work. To conduct our analysis of the close-out reports, we developed a  list of key terms, such as \u201cresults,\u201d \u201ccompletion,\u201d and \u201clessons learned.\u201d  Our inclusion of these terms was based on our analysis of project  management standards, which note the importance of the project close- out process in the project management cycle and the importance of  obtaining information about the results of the project and lessons learned.  We also included other terms such as \u201ccost,\u201d \u201ctimeliness,\u201d \u201con time,\u201d  \u201creturn on investment,\u201d and \u201cappropriateness of using NDF funding.\u201d We  included these terms because NDF officials told us that NDF and the NDF  Review Panel include these criteria in determining a project\u2019s suitability  for NDF funding. Because NDF does not have any requirement to use a  standard terminology in its reports, we used a dictionary to obtain other  synonyms of these terms as well. We examined each of the project close- out reports to determine the presence of these key terms. We also  examined each of the project close-out reports to determine the author,  content, and format. We did this on the basis of discussions with NDF  officials, who told us that they had established an expectation that NDF  project managers complete a project close-out report and had developed  a project manager\u2019s guide that contained a checklist. While NDF does not  have a requirement for project reports to be written in a standard format,  we determined that the close-out reports that we had examined varied  widely in their content and format and concluded that such variety could  make it more difficult for evaluators to extract key information from these  reports. After completing our initial review, the lead analyst submitted the  results of his work and the methodology used to two additional levels of  review. These reviewers were asked to validate the methodology and  results. The sample of 23 project close-out reports cannot be generalized  to the entire population of NDF project reports for the period in our review.  We also reviewed NDF\u2019s Project Management Guide to determine the  extent to which NDF has established specific requirements or guidance  regarding how project close-out reporting should be conducted. To obtain  the list of 11 similar missile destruction and conversion related projects,  we conducted a word search of NDF\u2019s projects using the key terms  \u201cmissiles\u201d and \u201crockets.\u201d", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2012 through  November 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
