Earlier work by GAO indicated that Medicare's payment for certain outpatient drugs is substantially higher than providers' acquisition costs. Concerns have been raised about Medicare's payment for blood clotting factor. GAO was asked to compare provider costs of purchasing clotting factor with Medicare's payment for it and to identify costs to providers associated with delivering clotting factor."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Medicare's payment for clotting factor, like other outpatient drugs, is 95 percent of the average wholesale price (AWP), a price established for each drug by its manufacturer. Medicare's payment is substantially more than the actual acquisition costs of hemophilia treatment centers (HTC) and homecare companies, which provide a majority of Medicare beneficiaries with clotting factor. Most HTCs obtain prices from manufacturers that are 35 to 48 percent below AWP by participating in a federal program that guarantees them low prices. Homecare companies obtain prices that range from 22 to 40 percent below AWP. Providers incur additional costs associated with delivering clotting factor that are not separately reimbursed by Medicare. GAO estimates that these additional costs in 2000 and 2001 ranged from $0.03 to $0.08 per unit sold by HTCs. (Hemophilia patients use an average of 78,000 units of clotting factor annually.) GAO did not receive enough data from homecare companies to estimate their costs. Delivery costs are generated in inventory management, specialized refrigerated storage, shipping, and the provision of ancillary supplies such as needles, syringes, and tourniquets to patients."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, Medicare\u2019s outpatient expenditures for blood clotting factor  totaled about $105 million, or more than 2 percent of total Medicare  spending on all covered outpatient drugs and biologicals. Blood clotting  factor is a biological used by persons with hemophilia to prevent  uncontrolled internal bleeding that could result in disability or death. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that  approximately 18,000 Americans, nearly all male, have hemophilia and  about 1,100 of these individuals are Medicare beneficiaries.", "Medicare\u2019s payment for clotting factor, like other outpatient drugs and  biologicals, is 95 percent of the average wholesale price (AWP). Often  described as a \u201csticker price\u201d or \u201clist price,\u201d AWP is established for each  drug by its manufacturer. Medicare\u2019s AWP-based payment has recently  come under scrutiny. In 2001, we reported that providers were able to  purchase certain drugs at prices significantly less than the payment they  received from Medicare. Although providers contended that this  overpayment was necessary to compensate for underpayment for other  services, we concluded that Medicare should not rely on potential  overpayments for some services to offset potential inadequate payments  for other services.", "The method of delivery of clotting factor has implications for Medicare  payment. Most outpatient drugs covered by Medicare are administered in a  physician\u2019s office. When a beneficiary visits a physician in order to receive  a drug, the physician receives one payment from Medicare for the drug  and another payment through the physician fee schedule for administering  the drug. Clotting factor, however, is generally not administered in a  physician\u2019s office. Medicare pays clotting factor providers, mainly  hemophilia treatment centers (HTC) and homecare companies, solely for  the drug. These providers generally purchase clotting factor products  directly from the manufacturers, rather than from drug wholesalers, and  deliver them directly to the very small hemophilia population.", "Because clotting factor products were not included in our 2001 report, you  asked us to evaluate whether Medicare\u2019s payment for clotting factor is  higher than its acquisition cost and to identify and describe any aspects of  the production and delivery of clotting factor that may relate to how  Medicare payment should be determined. In this report, we (1) describe  characteristics of the clotting factor delivery system, (2) compare provider  costs of purchasing clotting factor with Medicare\u2019s payment for it, and   (3) identify any costs to providers associated with delivering clotting  factor and furnishing related services to Medicare beneficiaries with  hemophilia.", "To conduct this study, we obtained data on the hemophilia population  from CDC. We analyzed the most recent data available from the Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) on HTC clotting factor  acquisition prices obtained through a federal discount program. We also  analyzed data on clotting factor acquisition prices from two large, national  homecare companies. In addition, we analyzed acquisition price data  provided to us by an HTC association for seven HTCs that had purchased  clotting factor outside the federal discount program. We also analyzed  related data on clotting factor prices from the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare. We  analyzed data on provider delivery costs for four HTCs, which we obtained  from a representative of an HTC association, and for two large, national  homecare companies, which we contacted directly. We interviewed  officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of  Inspector General (OIG), two patient advocacy organizations, four of the  six clotting factor manufacturers, two wholesalers, and several additional  HTCs and homecare companies. Our work was performed from February  through December 2002 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. See appendix I for more detailed  discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The two most common types of hemophilia are a deficiency in clotting  factor VIII, hemophilia A, and a deficiency in clotting factor IX, hemophilia  B. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the amount  of the clotting factor present in the blood. People with severe hemophilia,  for example, have less than 1 percent of the normal level of clotting factor  VIII or IX. The level of clotting factor deficiency contributes to the risk  that a particular bleeding episode poses to an individual. In individuals  with severe hemophilia, bleeding into the joints and adjoining tissues can  occur spontaneously, without an actual injury. Persons with mild  hemophilia usually experience prolonged bleeding only after surgery or a  major trauma, such as a head wound."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hemophilia Is Treated with Clotting Factor", "paragraphs": ["Historically, people with hemophilia relied on high-volume transfusions of  whole blood or plasma for treatment. These treatments, however, did not  provide enough clotting factor to stop serious bleeding and could be  performed only in a medical facility. With the introduction in the 1960s of  concentrated clotting factor products that could be infused at home,  hemophilia began to be more effectively and conveniently treated.", "Early clotting factor products were produced from human plasma.  Recombinant clotting factor products, which are genetically engineered or  cloned, were introduced in the 1990s to reduce the risk of blood-borne  infections. New manufacturing processes and safety protocols have also  reduced the risk of infections to individuals using plasma clotting factor  products. Because recombinant products are not derived from human  plasma, they are generally considered the current treatment of choice,  although many older individuals continue to use plasma products. There is  not enough recombinant clotting factor manufactured to treat all  individuals with hemophilia.", "Both plasma and recombinant clotting factor are biological substances  that differ in many respects from conventional, chemically synthesized  drugs. For example, biologicals such as clotting factor are derived from  living sources, so the concentration and potency of the original source  material can vary. Furthermore, biologicals cannot be manipulated during  the manufacturing process in a way that produces a consistent and precise  yield of product. As a biological product, clotting factor is susceptible to  microbial contamination and sensitive to environmental conditions, such  as temperature.", "Individuals with hemophilia generally self-infuse clotting factor. Clotting  factor can be infused on demand, when a bleeding episode occurs, or for  prevention, known as prophylactic use. By self-infusing, individuals can  avoid waiting for care at a medical facility. Timely infusion relieves short- term pain and swelling and helps prevent chronic joint disease, which  results from recurrent bleeding into the joints. Prophylactic infusions can  be intermittent, such as before major surgery, or continuous, to prevent  uncontrolled bleeding over time. Continuous prophylactic infusion is  generally confined to younger individuals to prevent prolonged bleeding  episodes and long-term complications. Physicians prescribe a dosage of  clotting factor units that is based on the nature of treatment. Generally,  younger and smaller individuals are prescribed lower quantities of clotting  factor than older and larger individuals.", "Because people infuse clotting factor in large doses, a substantial quantity  is used annually in the United States. Total clotting factor use is about 1  billion units per year. Although the average annual use of clotting factor  VIII for a person with hemophilia A is 78,000 units, individual use varies  widely. In any given year, approximately 23 percent of individuals with  hemophilia use no clotting factor at all, while a very small percentage of  individuals may use more than 500,000 units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Medicare Beneficiaries with Hemophilia", "paragraphs": ["According to CDC estimates, 6 percent of the hemophilia population, or  about 1,100 individuals, are Medicare beneficiaries. The average age of a  Medicare beneficiary with hemophilia is 53, nearly three decades older  than the average age of the total hemophilia population, which is 24. In  addition, Medicare beneficiaries with hemophilia show higher rates of  chronic joint disease and two viral infections, hepatitis C and human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV), than the general hemophilia population.  Because clotting factor products were not available when most Medicare  beneficiaries were young, they typically experienced prolonged and  repeated bleeding episodes, a situation that in vulnerable joint areas leads  to the destruction of joint tissues. As a result, 28 percent of Medicare  beneficiaries with hemophilia have chronic joint disease, compared to 14  percent of the general hemophilia population. Also, because many  Medicare beneficiaries began using clotting factor products before the  blood supply was tested for hepatitis C and HIV and before recombinant  products were available, beneficiaries have high rates of infection with  those viruses: 60 percent have hepatitis C and 45 percent have HIV. For the  total hemophilia population, the rates of hepatitis C and HIV infection are  39 and 24 percent, respectively.", "The Medicare beneficiary subpopulation and overall hemophilia  population do not differ, however, in terms of the frequency of disease  type or severity of clotting factor deficiency (see table 1). Also, the annual  use of clotting factor among Medicare beneficiaries and the overall  population with hemophilia is similar."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Small Number of Providers Buy Clotting Factor Directly from Manufacturers", "paragraphs": ["A small number of providers and manufacturers are involved in the  clotting factor market.

Approximately  half the HTCs, 67 out of 137, can furnish clotting factor and related  ancillary supplies to individuals they treat.", "Homecare companies are the main source of clotting factor for individuals  who do not obtain their clotting factor from HTCs. There are several large  national homecare companies, as well as smaller regional companies.  Homecare companies ship drugs and related ancillary supplies directly to  individuals with chronic conditions. While homecare companies do not  provide physician services to their patients, they may provide nursing  services, patient education, community outreach, and case management.

(See fig. 1  for a depiction of the clotting factor market.)", "Shortages of particular clotting factor products occur periodically.  Because the six manufacturers run at capacity, a decrease in production  by any one reduces availability of a particular product and strains the  general clotting factor supply. Increasing clotting factor production in  response to a shortage is difficult. Manufacturing clotting factor takes an  average of 6 months; opening an additional plant can take several years. In  2001, there was a severe shortage of recombinant clotting factor VIII when  production problems at one manufacturer occurred concurrently with a  routine maintenance shutdown by another. Many individuals were unable  to obtain recombinant products at that time, causing them to rely on  plasma clotting factor, straining its supply as well.

Due to its  complex dosing protocols and biological properties, clotting factor  requires considerable inventory management. Because the number of units  of clotting factor prescribed is determined by an individual\u2019s size and  treatment needs, each prescription is specific to the individual. However,  manufacturers sell vials of clotting factor in only three standard  concentrations: 250, 500, or 1,000 units per vial. Furthermore, the  unpredictability involved in manufacturing a biological substance like  clotting factor results in manufacturers\u2019 inability to predetermine the  precise concentration of clotting factor in a particular vial; they can only  predict its concentration within 10 percent of the standard concentration.  Therefore, a small-sized vial may be labeled anywhere from 225 to 275  units, and a large-sized vial may be labeled anywhere from 900 to 1,100  units. Managing clotting factor inventory requires more staff time than  managing the inventory of conventional drugs, in large part due to the  variations across individual prescriptions and the variable concentrations  in individual vials.", "Inventory management is further complicated by product recalls as well as  shortages. If a specific product or concentration is not available as a result  of a product recall or shortage, the provider must allocate additional staff  time to consult with an individual\u2019s physician to determine an alternate  plan of clotting factor treatment until the preferred product is available  again. One provider we spoke with said that product recalls of clotting  factor occur more often than for other drugs because of sensitivity to the  possibility of blood-borne infection resulting from the use of clotting  factor. In 2001, there was one recall of a clotting factor VIII and one recall  of a clotting factor IX product.", "Clotting factor providers also incur costs associated with storing and  shipping clotting factor. Providers order tens of thousands of units of  clotting factor a year for each patient. Because clotting factor must be  refrigerated to prevent spoilage, the high volume of clotting factor stored  by providers requires large temperature-controlled areas with sources of  backup power. The shipment of clotting factor also involves special  arrangements. Glass vials of clotting factor must be securely wrapped to  prevent breakage and then packed with coolants. Providers ship the  products using overnight delivery services that track and monitor the  product along the delivery route to ensure that it is delivered to the  individual\u2019s door at a specific time.

AMP reflects the average price paid to a manufacturer  by a purchaser for a drug, excluding 340B prices, other federal prices, and  sales to hospitals and health maintenance organizations. Because of the  limited number of provider types involved in the clotting factor market,  the exclusion of 340B prices from AMP calculations, and the small market  share of distributors, AMP is a satisfactory proxy for homecare acquisition  prices.
