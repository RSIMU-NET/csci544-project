As you know, the F-35  Lightning II provides key aviation capabilities to support the National  Defense Strategy. It is DOD\u2019s most costly weapon system, with  sustainment costs for the United States alone estimated at more than $1  trillion. The F-35 is also DOD\u2019s most ambitious weapon system, with three  military services and many foreign nations purchasing the F-35 for their  militaries. While production continues to ramp up, as of October 2019,  there were more than 435 U.S. and international F-35 aircraft in operation  at 19 sites, with more than 3,300 aircraft expected to be fielded through  the life cycle of the program.", "We have published a series of reports examining both DOD\u2019s acquisition  and its sustainment of the F-35. My statement today will focus on  sustainment. Sustainment involves the activities necessary to operate  aircraft after they are fielded\u2014such as maintenance, supply chain  management, training, and engineering support. Sustainment costs  typically comprise about 70 percent of a weapon system\u2019s life-cycle cost.  In particular, we have reported on significant challenges that DOD faces  in sustaining a growing F-35 fleet. As a result of these challenges, F-35  performance has not met warfighter requirements. Mission capability\u2014 that is, the percentage of total time when the aircraft can fly and perform  at least one mission\u2014was 52 percent from May through November 2018,  as compared with a warfighter minimum requirement of 75 percent.  Further, although the United States is purchasing the F-35 for its  advanced capabilities, during that same time period, full mission  capability\u2014or the percentage of time when the aircraft can perform all  tasked missions\u2014was about 27 percent, as compared with a warfighter  minimum requirement of 60 percent.", "Today I will highlight three F-35 sustainment challenges DOD has  encountered related to: (1) the supply chain; (2) the Autonomic Logistics  Information System (ALIS), which supports supply-chain management,  maintenance, and other processes; and (3) long-term planning. I will also  summarize our recommendations related to these issues that DOD has  not fully implemented.", "This statement is based on our body of work issued from 2014 through  2019 addressing F-35 acquisition, sustainment, affordability, ALIS,  operations, and global supply chain. To perform our prior work, we  analyzed DOD plans, program guidance, and F-35 performance; and we  interviewed DOD, military service, and contractor officials at the  headquarters\u2019 level and at many military installations that house F-35  aircraft. The reports listed on the Related Products Page provide more  details on the scope and methodologies we used to carry out our prior  work, including data reliability assessments.", "We conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Faces Substantial Supply Chain Challenges", "paragraphs": ["First, DOD is facing substantial supply chain challenges that are hindering  the readiness of the F-35 fleet. Specifically, spare parts shortages  throughout the F-35 supply chain are contributing to F-35 aircraft being  unable to perform as many missions or to fly as often as the warfighter  requires.", "The F-35\u2019s unique supply chain is central to DOD\u2019s strategy to sustain the  growing fleet. Rather than owning the spare parts for their aircraft, the Air  Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, along with international partners and  foreign military sales customers, share a common, global pool of parts.  This construct for the F-35 supply chain was intended to ease the  logistical burden and provide economies of scale for the military services  and international partners; however, the global pool does not have  enough spare parts. Specifically, from May through November 2018, F-35  aircraft across the fleet were unable to fly about 30 percent of the time  due to parts shortages, as compared with a program target of 10 percent.", "Below is pictured an F-35B aircraft conducting training aboard a ship.", "Our work found that several factors contribute to these parts shortages,  including F-35 parts that are breaking more often than expected, and  DOD\u2019s limited capability to repair parts when they break. Specifically, as  of April 2019, the F-35 program was failing to meet four of its eight  reliability and maintainability targets\u2014which determine the likelihood that  the aircraft will be in maintenance rather than available for operations\u2014 including metrics related to part removals and part failures. For instance,  we reported at that time that the special coating on the F-35 canopy that  enables the aircraft to maintain its stealth had failed more frequently than  expected, and the manufacturer was unable to produce enough canopies  to meet demands.", "These reliability challenges are exacerbated by DOD\u2019s limited capability  to repair broken parts at the military depots. The capabilities to repair  parts are currently 8 years behind schedule. DOD originally planned to  have repair capabilities at the depots ready by 2016, but as we reported  in April 2019, the depots will not have the capability to repair all parts at  expected demand rates until 2024. As a result, the average time taken to  repair an F-35 part was more than 6 months, or about 188 days, for  repairs completed between September and November 2018\u2014more than  twice as long as planned. At that time, there was a backlog of about 4,300  spare parts awaiting repair at depots or manufacturers.", "We have also reported on other challenges that DOD faces related to its  supply chain, including challenges in supporting deployed F-35 aircraft  around the world, in clarifying how scarce parts will be distributed, in  establishing a plan for a global supply chain network, and in maintaining  accountability for spare parts. Figure 2 depicts many of these and other  challenges that DOD faces related to the F-35 supply chain.", "DOD has not fully implemented seven of our recommendations related to  its supply chain challenges:", "Revise sustainment plans: In October 2017, we reported that DOD\u2019s  reactive approach to planning for and funding the capabilities needed  to sustain the F-35 resulted in significant readiness challenges\u2014 including delays in the establishment of part repair capabilities at the  depots\u2014and placed DOD at risk of being unable to leverage the  capabilities of the aircraft it had purchased. We recommended that  DOD revise its sustainment plans to ensure that they include the key  requirements and funding needed to fully implement the F-35  sustainment strategy.", "Conduct a comprehensive review of the F-35 supply chain: While  DOD had ongoing efforts to increase the availability of spare parts, we  found in April 2019 that DOD would likely continue to face challenges  because the program was not planning for the quantity of parts  necessary in its spare parts projections to meet warfighter  requirements. Simply purchasing more F-35 parts may not be a viable  solution for DOD, given the affordability concerns the program faces.  These complex problems necessitate a comprehensive approach by  DOD, or it is at risk that the F-35 will not be able to conduct the full  range of intended missions. We recommended that DOD conduct a  comprehensive review of the F-35 supply chain to determine what  additional actions are needed to close the gap between warfighter  requirements for aircraft performance and the capabilities that the F- 35 supply chain can deliver, in light of the U.S. services\u2019 affordability  constraints.", "Develop a process to modify the afloat and deployment spare  parts packages: DOD purchases certain packages of F-35 parts  years in advance to support aircraft on deployments, including on  ships\u2014called afloat and deployment spare parts packages. In April  2019, we reported that continued modifications to parts and aircraft  can make such packages out-of-date by the time F-35 units deploy,  and that the F-35 program did not have a process and funding in  place to change out mismatched parts. This could put the military  services at risk of not having the parts they need to support future  deployments. We recommended that DOD develop a process to  modify afloat and deployment spare parts packages, to include  reviewing the parts within the packages to ensure that they match  deploying aircraft and account for updated parts demand, and aligning  any necessary funding needed for the parts updates.", "Mitigate risks related to operating and sustaining the F-35 in the  Pacific: In March 2018, we issued a classified report on DOD\u2019s initial  transfer of F-35s to a Marine Corps base in Japan that, among other  things, described the warfighting capabilities the F-35 brought to the  Pacific and assessed operational challenges the Marine Corps faced.  In April 2018, we publicly reported on the recommendations from this  classified report, including our recommendation that the Marine Corps  assess the risks associated with key supply chain-related challenges  related to operating and sustaining the F-35 in the Pacific, and that it  determine how to address those risks.", "Revise the business rules for prioritizing scarce F-35 parts: In  April 2019, we reported that there was uncertainty about how the  program will prioritize scarce F-35 parts among global participants.  While the F-35 program had developed a set of business rules, those  rules lacked clarity and detail. Absent comprehensive business rules,  the F-35 program could face challenges in transparently allocating  parts to support competing U.S. and international requirements. We  recommended that DOD revise the business rules for the prioritization  of scarce F-35 parts across all program participants so as to clearly  define the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, the process  for assigning force activity designations, and the way in which  deviations from the business rules will be conducted.", "Complete a detailed plan for the establishment of the global  network for moving F-35 parts: In April 2019, we reported that  DOD\u2019s networks to move F-35 parts around the world to the United  States and international participants were immature. Because the F- 35 program did not fully recognize the complexity of establishing a  global network for moving F-35 parts, this network is now several  years behind schedule and there is risk that it will not be fully capable  to support an expanding fleet. We recommended that DOD complete  a detailed plan for the establishment of the global network for moving  F-35 parts that outlines clear requirements and milestones to reach  full operational capability, and that includes mechanisms to identify  and mitigate risks to the F-35 global spares pool.", "Clearly establish how DOD will maintain accountability for F-35  parts: In April 2019, we reported that in its rush to field aircraft and its  heavy reliance on the prime contractor, DOD had not consistently  followed DOD guidance for property accountability. Simply put, DOD  did not have records of all the F-35 spare parts it had purchased;  where those parts were located; and how much the military services  had paid for them. We recommended that DOD issue a policy  consistent with DOD guidance that clearly establishes how DOD will  maintain accountability for F-35 parts within the supply chain, and  identify the steps needed to implement the policy retrospectively and  prospectively.", "DOD concurred with these recommendations and has made some  progress in addressing them, including issuing a revised life cycle  sustainment plan in January 2019. In addition, DOD has taken actions to  increase the availability of spare parts, such as efforts to improve the  reliability of parts and incentivize manufacturers to repair parts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Autonomic Logistics Information System Remains Immature", "paragraphs": ["Second, DOD continues to face challenges with the F-35\u2019s Autonomic  Logistics Information System (ALIS). ALIS is a complex information  technology system supporting operations, mission planning, supply-chain  management, maintenance, and other processes. It is intended to provide  the necessary logistics tools to F-35 users as they operate and sustain  the aircraft. For supply chain management, for example, ALIS is  supposed to automate a range of supply functions\u2014including updating  the status of parts, generating supply work orders, and communicating  critical data about parts.", "However, we reported in April 2019 that these capabilities were immature,  resulting in numerous challenges and the need for maintainers and  supply personnel at military installations to perform time-consuming,  manual workarounds in order to manage and track parts. We reported  that one Air Force unit estimated that it spent the equivalent of more than  45,000 hours per year performing additional tasks and manual  workarounds because ALIS was not functioning as needed. In our prior  work we identified several challenges associated with ALIS, including the  following examples (see table 1).", "We have made six recommendations since 2014 to help DOD address  ALIS-related challenges. DOD generally concurred with these  recommendations. It addressed two by developing a plan that prioritizes  ALIS risks and creating a training plan for ALIS. However, DOD has not  taken action on four of our recommendations. These are:", "Establish a performance-measurement process: In September  2014, we reported that ALIS had experienced recurring problems,  including user issues and schedule delays, and was a risk that could  adversely affect DOD\u2019s sustainment strategy. But we found that DOD  did not have a process to determine and address the most significant  performance issues with ALIS based on user requirements, which  could limit its ability to effectively and efficiently address performance  issues and identify root causes of those issues. We recommended  that DOD establish a performance-measurement process for ALIS  that includes, but is not limited to, performance metrics and targets  that (1) are based on intended behavior of the system in actual  operations and (2) tie system performance to user requirements.", "Incorporate cost-estimating best practices: In April 2016, we  reported that DOD\u2019s $16.7 billion life cycle cost estimate for ALIS was  not fully credible since DOD had not performed key analyses as part  of the cost-estimating process. We recommended that DOD conduct  uncertainty and sensitivity analyses consistent with cost-estimating  best practices.", "Ensure that future cost estimates use historical data: In April  2016, we also reported that DOD\u2019s ALIS cost estimate was not fully  accurate because DOD did not use historical cost data, including  actual cost data from ALIS and data from other comparable programs.  We recommended that DOD ensure that future estimates of ALIS  costs use historical data as available and reflect significant program  changes consistent with cost-estimating best practices.", "Test the operation of the F-35 when disconnected from ALIS: In  March 2018, we issued a classified report on DOD\u2019s initial transfer of  F-35s to a Marine Corps base in Japan that, among other things,  described the warfighting capabilities the F-35 brought to the Pacific  and assessed any operational challenges the Marine Corps faced.  In April 2018, we publicly reported on the recommendations from this  classified report, including our recommendation that the F-35 program  test operating the F-35 disconnected from ALIS for extended periods  of time in a variety of scenarios, to assess the risks related to  operating and sustaining the aircraft, and determine how to mitigate  any identified risks.", "We are currently conducting a review of ALIS, assessing how DOD is  managing current and future issues related to the system. We plan to  complete this review in early 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Critical Information to Effectively Plan for Long-term F-35 Sustainment", "paragraphs": ["Third, at the core, DOD\u2019s current sustainment challenges have largely  resulted from insufficient planning. We have found that DOD lacks  information about the technical characteristics and costs of the F-35,  which will impair its ability to plan for the long-term sustainment of the F- 35 fleet.", "The current F-35 sustainment strategy states that the primary contractor  will provide logistics support for the aircraft. In October 2017, we  reported that while DOD planned to enter into 5-year, fixed-price,  performance-based contracts with the prime contractor in the next few  years, DOD did not have full information on F-35 technical characteristics  or costs to enable it to effectively negotiate those contracts. Specifically,  certain technical aspects of the aircraft remained immature or uncertain,  including reliability measures that are lagging behind operational  requirements. As previously discussed, in April 2019 we reported that  the F-35 program was still not on track to meet its targets for four out of  eight reliability and maintainability metrics, and that the program had not  taken adequate steps to ensure that those targets would be met. DOD  officials told us that there would be inherent risk in signing a long-term,  performance-based contract before reliability and maintainability data  were more fully known, as those data would influence how much aircraft  performance should cost.", "In addition, DOD did not have full visibility into the actual costs of some  key sustainment requirements that are considered cost-drivers within the  program, such as the actual costs of parts and repairs. Thus, DOD had  relied on projected parts reliability and pricing to formulate cost estimates.  Actual costs of sustainment requirements can change significantly from  initial projections. For instance, we reported that, between the program\u2019s  2014 and its 2015 estimates, the costs of initial spare parts over the life  cycle increased by $447 million. The lack of cost information continues to  be a challenge for DOD, as we reported in April 2019. DOD officials  have stated that they need to know actual costs in order to improve both  their confidence in the estimates and their understanding of how cost is  related to performance.", "Below is pictured an F-35A aircraft being refueled.", "Further, DOD lacks the technical data from the prime contractor needed  to fully understand the technical characteristics of the F-35 aircraft and  enable potential competition of future sustainment contracts. Technical  data include the blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, instructions,  and other documentation required to adequately produce, operate, and  sustain weapon systems. Technical data are critical for weapon systems  such as F-35 aircraft, as they provide DOD with the information  necessary to support the fleet. In April 2019, we found that challenges  related to readiness and costs were driving DOD to begin to develop an  option for DOD-led supply chain management as a potential alternative to  the performance-based contracts through which the prime contractor  would provide logistics support. The DOD-led option would require the  department to obtain significant amounts of technical data on F-35 parts  from the manufacturers of those parts; however, at that time DOD was  facing challenges in obtaining the needed data.", "DOD has not fully implemented 10 of our recommendations related to  these issues:", "Develop a long-term Intellectual Property strategy: In September  2014, we reported that DOD had not identified all of the technical data  it needs from the contractor, and at what cost, to enable competition  of future sustainment contracts, which put the program at risk of not  having the flexibility to make changes to its sustainment strategy. We  recommended that DOD develop a long-term Intellectual Property  strategy to include, but not be limited to, the identification of current  levels of technical data rights ownership by the federal government  and all critical technical data needs and their associated costs.", "Assess whether the program reliability and maintainability  targets are still feasible: In April 2019, we reported that the F-35  program continued to fall short of meeting performance targets for half  of its reliability and maintainability metrics. Program officials said that  those targets need to be reevaluated to determine more realistic  performance targets, but they had not taken action to do so. We  recommended that DOD assess whether the program\u2019s reliability and  maintainability targets are still feasible, and revise accordingly.", "Identify specific and measurable reliability and maintainability  objectives: In April 2019, we reported that the F-35 program\u2019s plan  for improving reliability and maintainability did not address the four  under-performing metrics. Specifically, the guidance the program has  used to implement this plan does not define specific, measurable  objectives for what the desired goals for F-35 reliability and  maintainability performance should be. As long as these metrics  continue to fall short, the military services may have to settle for  aircraft that are less reliable and more costly to maintain than  originally planned. We recommended that DOD identify specific and  measurable reliability and maintainability objectives in its guidance.", "Link reliability and maintainability improvement projects to the  associated objectives: In April 2019, we reported that the F-35  program had not aligned its planned reliability and maintainability  improvement projects with reliability and maintainability goals, which  could put the program at risk of not meeting those goals. We  recommended that DOD identify and document in guidance which  reliability and maintainability improvement projects will achieve the  identified objectives.", "Prioritize funding for reliability and maintainability improvement:  In April 2019, we reported that the F-35 program office had estimated  potential life-cycle cost savings of more than $9.2 billion from  implementing the reliability and maintainability improvement projects  in its plan, but had not prioritized or dedicated funding in its budget  necessary to carry out the projects. As a result, projects had been  prematurely suspended or delayed. We recommended that the F-35  program office prioritize funding for the reliability and maintainability  improvement plan.", "Re-examine the metrics DOD will use to hold the contractor  accountable: In October 2017, we reported that DOD might not be  using the appropriate performance metrics under trial performance- based agreements to achieve desired outcomes or hold the contractor  accountable for performance. We recommended that DOD re- examine the metrics that it will use to hold the contractor accountable  under the fixed-price, performance-based contracts, to ensure that  such metrics are objectively measurable, are fully reflective of  processes over which the contractor has control, and drive desired  behaviors by all stakeholders.", "Delay entering into multi-year, fixed-price, performance-based  contracts: In October 2017, we reported that DOD was moving  quickly toward negotiating longer-term performance-based contracts  without a sufficient understanding of the actual costs and technical  characteristics of the aircraft, which put DOD at risk of overpaying for  sustainment support that is not sufficient to meet warfighter  requirements. We recommended that, before DOD enters into multi- year, fixed-price, performance-based contracts, it ensure that it has  sufficient knowledge of the actual costs of sustainment and technical  characteristics of the aircraft at system maturity.", "Obtain comprehensive cost information for F-35 spare parts: In  April 2019, we reported that DOD did not have comprehensive cost  information for individual F-35 spare parts, and that it faced  challenges in obtaining this information from the prime contractor.  This lack of cost information impedes DOD\u2019s ability to develop a  complete understanding of the costs for the F-35 system and to  effectively negotiate with the prime contractor for sustainment support.  We recommended that DOD develop a methodical approach to  consistently obtain comprehensive cost information from the prime  contractor for F-35 spare parts within the supply chain.", "Formalize a methodology for recording military service funds  spent on F-35 parts: In April 2019, we reported that the military  services could not track the funds that they had spent for the  purchase of F-35 spare parts to the actual parts on their financial  statements, thereby hindering DOD\u2019s financial improvement and audit  readiness efforts. We recommended that DOD complete and  formalize a methodology for the U.S. services to use in recording on  their financial statements the funds spent on F-35 parts within the  global spares pool.", "Clearly define the F-35 supply chain management strategy: In  April 2019, we reported that DOD was caught between two distinct  sustainment concepts\u2014the program\u2019s official contractor-provided  logistics support construct and DOD\u2019s effort to develop options for  DOD-led supply chain management. Until DOD clearly defines its  strategy for managing the F-35 supply chain in the future, the F-35  program will lack the certainty and unity of effort necessary to  meaningfully improve supply chain performance and reduce costs.  We recommended that DOD clearly define the strategy by which it will  manage the F-35 supply chain in the future and update key strategy  documents accordingly, to include any additional actions and  investments necessary to support that strategy.", "DOD concurred with all of these recommendations. Seven of the  preceding recommendations were made earlier this year, and we  recognize that it will take time for DOD to implement them. However,  DOD\u2019s attention to each of these recommendations is important to  improving its long-term sustainment planning.", "In summary, DOD\u2019s costs to purchase the F-35 are expected to exceed  $406 billion, and the department expects to spend more than $1 trillion to  sustain its F-35 fleet. Thus, DOD must continue to grapple with  affordability as it takes actions to increase the readiness of the F-35 fleet  and improve its sustainment efforts to deliver an aircraft that the military  services and partner nations can successfully operate and maintain over  the long term within their budgetary realities. DOD\u2019s continued attention to  our recommendations will be important as it balances these goals. We will  continue to monitor DOD\u2019s efforts to implement our recommendations.", "Chairmen Garamendi and Norcross, Ranking Members Lamborn and  Hartzler, and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my  prepared statement.
