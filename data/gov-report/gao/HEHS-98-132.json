This represents a significant change in policy toward many immigrants who had generally been eligible for public benefits on the same basis as citizens. The act is designed to ensure that available public benefits do not provide an incentive for immigration and that immigrants entering this country be self-reliant. Title IV, as amended,made immigrants ineligible for certain federal welfare benefits and gave states options to provide or restrict immigrants\u2019 access to other federal, state, and local benefits. In addition, the law specifies different eligibility for immigrants depending upon whether they entered the country before enactment of the legislation on August 22, 1996. Immigrants to this country before the act are referred to as \u201cpre-reform immigrants\u201d in this report; those entering after the act are referred to as \u201cnew immigrants.\u201d", "The act, which we call the welfare reform law, restricts immigrants\u2019 eligibility for key federal programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Food Stamp program. Generally, the law allows no new immigrants to receive TANF and Medicaid benefits during their first 5 years in the United States. In addition, the law allows the states the option of denying TANF and Medicaid eligibility to most pre-reform immigrants as well as to new immigrants after 5 years of U.S. residency. Although the law originally barred immigrants from receiving SSI benefits, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reinstated these benefits for pre-reform immigrants already on the rolls and for those who are now or become blind or disabled. New immigrants, however, with some exceptions cannot receive SSI benefits.", "In addition, a recent legislative change has restored eligibility for some immigrants who lost eligibility for federal food stamps. The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-185)\u2014 signed into law on June 23, 1998\u2014restores food stamp eligibility effective November 1, 1998, to pre-reform immigrants who are receiving benefits or assistance for blindness or disability, younger than 18, or aged 65 and older as of August 22, 1996, and others. The welfare reform law, however, still bars most pre-reform and new immigrants from receiving federally funded food stamp benefits. In addition to the program restrictions, the law requires some sponsors of new immigrants to sign legally binding contracts\u2014affidavits of support\u2014agreeing to financially help the new immigrants.", "Concerned with the restrictions imposed by the welfare reform law and their impact on immigrant children and families, you asked us to address the following: the options states chose regarding TANF and Medicaid benefits for immigrants and state-funded assistance available to new immigrants during the 5-year bar; for restricted federal programs, SSI, and food stamps, the number of immigrants, including children, whose federal benefits have been terminated, and the state-funded assistance available to them; and the major implementation issues and challenges state agencies face in administering the provisions changing welfare assistance to immigrants.", "Although immigration policy affects the states in many ways, our review focused specifically on states\u2019 responses to the welfare reform changes for immigrants. Generally, this report describes states\u2019 responses before the legislative changes of June 1998 that restored eligibility for federal food stamps to some immigrants as of November 1, 1998. To obtain information on the benefits that the 50 states and the District of Columbia provide to pre-reform and new immigrants, we reviewed national studies and summaries of state legislative changes that focused on immigrants and welfare reform restrictions. We conducted fieldwork in 3 of the 10 states where most immigrants reside\u2014California, Washington, and New Jersey\u2014and one locality within each of those states\u2014San Francisco, Seattle, and Essex County\u2014to collect more detailed information on states\u2019 responses. In addition, to determine implementation issues concerning the welfare reform changes to benefits for immigrants, we spoke with federal officials of each program, state and local officials during our site visits, and immigrant advocacy groups. Our work was conducted between June 1997 and May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["From the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935 until the welfare reform law of 1996, the immigration status of those lawfully admitted for permanent U.S. residence did not preclude these individuals from eligibility for welfare benefits. Welfare reform changed this by substantially restricting pre-reform and new immigrants\u2019 access to federal means-tested benefits. Table 1 details the program eligibility changes for immigrants under the major federal welfare programs. As a result of these changes, pre-reform immigrants remain eligible for some benefits. New immigrants are ineligible for federal benefits during their first 5 years of U.S. residency, until they become naturalized citizens, or unless they have an immigration status excepted from the restrictions.", "The welfare reform law allows states to decide whether pre-reform immigrants retain eligibility for federal TANF and Medicaid and whether new immigrants can apply for these programs after a mandatory 5-year bar. As originally passed, the welfare reform law generally eliminated immigrants\u2019 eligibility for SSI and food stamps. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reinstated SSI eligibility for pre-reform immigrants already receiving benefits and allowed pre-reform immigrants who are or become blind or disabled to apply for benefits in the future. New immigrants, however, generally cannot receive SSI and food stamp benefits unless they meet certain exceptions or become citizens. These exceptions appear in table 1, which shows that the exception of allowing benefits to those who can be credited with 40 work quarters only applies to new immigrants with 5 years of U.S. residency. The welfare reform law also specifies federal programs from which an immigrant cannot be barred.", "The recent legislative change has restored food stamp eligibility, effective November 1, 1998, to pre-reform immigrants receiving benefits or assistance for blindness or disability, younger than 18, or aged 65 and older as of August 22, 1996. The law also restores eligibility to certain Hmong or Highland Laotian tribe entrants lawfully residing in the United States, regardless of their date of entry, and extends the eligibility period for refugees and asylees from 5 to 7 years after entering the country.", "In addition to restricting immigrants\u2019 eligibility for welfare benefits, the 1996 welfare reform law revised requirements for those sponsoring immigrants\u2019 entry into the United States. Under welfare reform, an immigrant sponsored by a relative must have the sponsor sign an affidavit of support promising to provide financial assistance if needed. In addition, to better ensure that sponsors will be financially able to help the immigrants they have sponsored, the new law requires that sponsors have incomes equal to at least 125 percent of the federal poverty level for the number of people that they will support, including themselves, their dependents, and the sponsored immigrant and accompanying family members. Moreover, to address concerns about the enforceability of affidavits of support executed before welfare reform, the new law specifies that each affidavit must be executed as a legally binding contract enforceable against the sponsor by the immigrant, the U.S. government, or any state or locality that provides any means-tested public benefit. The affidavit is enforceable until the sponsored immigrant naturalizes, is credited with 40 work quarters, permanently leaves the country, or dies.", "In addition to requiring legally enforceable affidavits, the law extends a sponsor\u2019s responsibility to support immigrants by lengthening the time a sponsor\u2019s income is attributable to a new immigrant if the immigrant applies for welfare benefits. Some federal programs previously mandated this attribution, called deeming; however, the sponsor\u2019s income was generally included for only the first 3 or 5 years of an immigrant\u2019s residency. The law now requires states to deem a sponsor\u2019s income in federal means-tested programs until the immigrant becomes a citizen or can be credited with 40 work quarters. The welfare reform law also gives states the option of adding deeming requirements to state and local means-tested programs.", "The new support and deeming requirements are intended to ensure that immigrants rely on their sponsors rather than public benefits for aid, that the sponsors have the financial capacity to provide aid, and that sponsors are held accountable for helping immigrants they have agreed to support. This way, unless a sponsor suffers a financial setback, an immigrant should be less likely to need or receive public benefits.", "In addition, the welfare reform law requires states to implement new procedures to verify an alien\u2019s status when determining eligibility for federal public benefits. The states have 2 years after the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issues final regulations to ensure that their verification procedures comply with the regulations. The procedures include verifying individuals\u2019 status as citizens or aliens, which information the states use in determining individuals\u2019 eligibility for federal public welfare benefits, including grants, contracts, or loans provided by a federal agency or appropriated U.S. funds.

A provision in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-18) made it possible for the states to purchase federal food stamp coupons to provide nutrition assistance to individuals, including immigrants, made ineligible for federal food stamps. According to Washington state officials, allowing the states to purchase federal coupons saves the states the expense of creating their own voucher programs and makes the program more seamless to recipients and grocery store merchants. States are required to pay USDA the value of the benefits plus the costs of printing, shipping, and redeeming the coupons.", "The majority of the states replacing lost federal food stamps, however, allow eligibility only to certain immigrant categories.
