More than half of the state systems have been challenged since 1989.", "Since the 1960s, federal education funds have been allocated to areas with high levels of need for additional educational services, such as compensatory education or bilingual education. During the 1980s this need increased as the nation\u2019s school-age population became increasingly poor, racially and ethnically diverse, and at risk of school failure. Successfully educating at-risk populations depends, in part, upon adequate and equitable funding. Schools have been addressing the needs of at-risk children through a variety of compensatory and education reform efforts, some of which use federal education funds.", "The largest single federal elementary and secondary education grant program to local school districts\u2014$6.7 billion in fiscal year 1996\u2014is title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. The purpose of title I is to improve the educational opportunities of educationally deprived children by helping them succeed in regular programs, attain grade-level proficiency, and improve achievement in basic and more advanced skills. As reauthorized by P.L. 103-382 in October 1994, these title I educational services may be financed by four funding formulas for this common purpose. The four formulas cover basic grants, concentration grants, targeted grants, and Education Finance Incentive Program grants. The 1994 legislation, for the first time, authorized funding for the Education Finance Incentive Program beginning in fiscal year 1996, although no funding was specified in fiscal year 1996 appropriations for that program or for targeted grants. (See app. I for a description of these grant programs.)", "Many complex policy and technical issues surround policymakers\u2019 decisions about whether to provide title I funding through the Education Finance Incentive Program formula in future years.

In our June 1994 correspondence, we identified potential weaknesses in the proposed measures of effort and equity used in the title I program. In addition, Members of Congress have also called for improvements in these measures. Consequently, you asked us to provide a more in-depth analysis of these measures and provide options for improving them. Specifically, this report examines the measures now included in title I\u2019s Education Finance Incentive Program to reflect state fiscal effort for education and equity in per pupil spending, proposes several options for improving these measures, describes the characteristics of states with higher levels of effort and equity under both the current definitions and the options we developed, and proposes alternative ways the options we developed could be used in allocating funds under the Education Finance Incentive Program.", "For our evaluation of the effort and equity factors, we reviewed the relevant school finance literature and consulted with school finance experts. On the basis of this review, we developed the following criteria to assess the quality of the effort factor. The effort factor should (1) include an indicator of states\u2019 ability to pay that is comprehensive, reflecting all sources of potential revenue-raising capacity states may use to fund education; (2) avoid using indicators that are not directly related to state fiscal effort; and (3) provide a direct incentive for increased effort.", "To assess the quality of the equity factor, we adopted the following criteria: (1) the measure of spending disparities should be comprehensive, (2) the measure of students\u2019 needs should be as comprehensive as possible, (3) spending differences should be adjusted for differences in purchasing power across school districts, and (4) the equity factor should provide an incentive for states to further reduce spending disparities.", "We consulted with experts to review the measures and options we formulated.

Education is the largest single expenditure category in state budgets, accounting for about 20 percent of total state spending in fiscal year 1994. Elementary and secondary schools receive most of their funds from state and local revenues. Federal aid has mainly focused on providing services to educationally disadvantaged children through categorical, program-specific grants. In school year 1992-93, state and local shares of total education spending were roughly equal, estimated at 45.6 percent ($113 billion) for states and 47.4 percent ($118 billion) for local educational agencies (LEA). The federal share was 6.9 percent ($17 billion).", "Although most of the activities promoting equity in education take place within states, the federal role in supporting equity has been discussed since the 1960s, when concern was voiced over states\u2019 inappropriate use of federal funds intended to improve equity on behalf of disadvantaged children. In summer 1993 the Senate held hearings on the federal role in school finance equalization. Subsequently, the Congress amended ESEA to further help disadvantaged children by improving the targeting of title I funds to local education agencies and schools with relatively high levels of poor students.", "Title I is a federal program that provides remedial education services to low-achieving students in high-poverty elementary and secondary schools. Title I funds are intended to supplement, not supplant, local and state education funding. Until ESEA was amended by the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act (IASA) of 1994, title I grants to local education agencies were distributed under two formulas\u2014the basic grant formula and the concentration grant formula. In an effort to increase the amount of aid going to the neediest children, between 1988 and 1994 the statute required that 10 percent of the appropriations to LEAs were to be distributed using the concentration grant formula. That formula generally allocated funds only to those LEAs in counties where eligible children equaled either at least 6,500 or 15 percent of the total population aged 5 through 17. The rest of the appropriation was distributed under the basic grant formula (which is based on numbers of poor school-age children multiplied by a cost factor reflecting a state\u2019s per pupil spending).", "In 1994, the Congress sought to provide greater targeting of title I aid although opinions varied as to the best way of doing it. In the end, IASA made some technical changes to the basic and concentration grants and added two more title I funding streams\u2014targeted grants and the Education Finance Incentive Program. The targeted grant formula may use money appropriated for title I in excess of the fiscal year 1995 level. Targeted grants are similar to basic grants except that poor and other children counted in the targeted formula are assigned weights based on the county\u2019s or LEA\u2019s child poverty rate and the number of poor school-age children. This formula generally reflects the recommendations for using weighted pupil formulas in title I made by the Commission on Chapter 1, the RAND Corporation, and GAO. Under the targeted grant formula, the higher the poverty rate or number of poor children in the county or LEA, the higher the title I grants per formula child.", "The 1994 reauthorization of title I included an effort and equity bonus\u2014additional dollars\u2014through a new Education Finance Incentive Program to encourage states to have more equitable education finance systems. Although part of title I, this program is funded separately. The 1994 reauthorization authorized $200 million for the Education Finance Incentive Program for fiscal year 1996. As of July 1996, however, no funding has been appropriated. (See app. I for more background information related to title I and appropriation issues.)", "The Education Finance Incentive Program defines effort as the ratio of state spending for elementary and secondary education per pupil to the per capita income of state residents. The effort factor, however, can be no less than 95 percent and no more than 105 percent of the national average. Per capita income is used as a proxy for a state\u2019s ability to pay for education spending. Thus, the effort factor measures each state\u2019s actual spending as a percentage of its ability to spend.", "The equity factor measures the variation in per pupil spending across a state\u2019s districts divided by the state\u2019s average per pupil spending. Additional weight is given to the number of poor pupils to reflect the higher cost of educating these children. The equity factor is subtracted from 1.3 for use in the allocation formula."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Effort Measures", "paragraphs": ["One of the strengths of the effort factor used in the Education Finance Incentive Program is that it considers a state\u2019s ability to pay when determining the level of effort. However, the current effort factor could be improved for three reasons. First, its measure of ability to pay\u2014per capita personal income\u2014is not as comprehensive as another that is available: total taxable resources (TTR). Second, because its measure of spending, which is per student, is related to a measure of ability to pay which is per capita, the factor penalizes states with high proportions of school-age children. Third, the effort factor does not adequately reward states for improving their level of effort over time.", "The effort factor\u2019s measure of ability to pay is not as comprehensive as it could be because per capita income excludes many taxable resources that states are able to use for financing education. To the extent these additional sources of funding capacity are not equally available in all states, the per capita income measure overstates the funding capacity of some states and understates it for others.", "The current effort factor also penalizes states with high percentages of school-age children in their populations. It measures the ratio of state spending, expressed on a per pupil basis, and state funding capacity, expressed on a per capita basis. This calculation introduces the percentage of the state\u2019s school-age population into the measure of state effort. The effect is to inappropriately penalize states with a high percentage of school-age children because the percentage of a state\u2019s population that is school-age is unrelated to its level of effort.", "Moreover, the current effort factor could more effectively encourage states to increase their level of effort over time by (1) including a bonus based on rate of increase or decrease in effort over time and (2) eliminating the current requirement that the effort factor be at least 95 percent and no more than 105 percent of the average effort of all states. A fiscal incentive, or bonus, would reward states for increasing their level of educational effort over time, rather than rewarding only those that already have high effort. The 95-percent floor undermines the incentive for low-effort states to increase their effort in funding elementary and secondary education. Under current law, states with very low effort may increase their level of effort considerably, yet receive no additional dollars.", "Two of the three alternative effort factors we developed include a bonus based on the rate of increase or decrease in effort over time, in addition to other modifications we have made to address the potential drawbacks of the current effort factor (see app. III). One of these two alternatives also eliminates the requirement that the effort factor be at least 95 percent and no more than 105 percent of the average effort of all states.", "Table 1 compares the characteristics that define the current measure of effort in title I with the measures we propose as options A, B, and C. Option B is more comprehensive than option A because it considers both the current level of effort and the change in effort for each state over time. Option C is the same as option B, except that the effort factor is not constrained by the current requirement to be between 95 and 105 percent of the average effort.

The measure of student needs, however, only explicitly takes into account the greater needs of one type of pupil\u2014those who are poor\u2014in determining per pupil expenditures.

Each considers both the current level of equity a state has achieved and the recent progress the state has made toward achieving equity in education spending. To the extent possible within the limitations of the data currently available, we took into account differences in student needs related to numbers of students who were poor, had limited English proficiency, or had disabilities. Whether policymakers prefer option E or option G depends on their interest in measuring variation in spending levels for all school districts in the state (option E), or focusing on a state\u2019s ability to bring low-spending school districts up to the median (option G).

They stated that the Education Finance Incentive Program formula has a devastating impact on targeting because of a combination of factors, including (1) states with low fiscal effort tend to be high-poverty states with fewer resources, (2) the equity factor draws funds away from some high-poverty states while benefiting some low-poverty states, and (3) the incentive formula allocates funds based on the total number of school-age children rather than numbers of poor children.", "Regarding the Department\u2019s first point (that states with low fiscal effort tend to be high-poverty states), we found that although this was true using the current effort measure, it is not true using the measures of effort we developed.

We did find, however, that states with high levels of variation in income levels and poverty rates across their districts did less well using the current equity measure than states with lower levels of variation; our equity measure options ameliorated this problem somewhat.", "With regard to the third point (that the incentive formula allocates funds based on the total number of school-age children rather than on the number of poor children as in the other title I formulas), we agree that this is true with the current formula. In our draft report, however, one of the three allocation alternatives we identified uses numbers of poor, rather than all, school-age children as a basis for allocating funds under the Education Finance Incentive Program. We have also added a fourth allocation alternative that uses numbers of poor children. Both of those allocation alternatives would target more dollars for poor states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia\u20148 of the 10 poorest states\u2014than would the targeted grant formula.", "The Department also stated that the report sidesteps the issue of whether the Education Finance Incentive Grant formula can be expected to provide a meaningful incentive for states to change their school funding systems.

This fourth alternative allocation formula based on the number of poor school-age children also includes this unconstrained effort option as well as an unconstrained equity option.

(4) How can the options we developed be used in alternative ways to allocate funds under the Education Finance Incentive Program?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of title I\u2019s effort and equity factors using criteria we developed after reviewing the literature and consulting with experts. On the basis of our review of the literature and consultation with experts, we developed alternative effort factors for possible use in the Education Finance Incentive Program using a universe sample of school district data from the Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for school year 1991-92. School district spending data were collected by the Bureau of the Census for NCES. We also developed alternative equity factors that include two different measures of spending disparities and consider differences in purchasing power across a state\u2019s school districts. See appendixes III and IV for a description of the methods used to produce the alternatives for the effort and equity factors for title I\u2019s Education Finance Incentive Program. To the extent possible within the limitations of the data currently available, we took into account differences in student needs related to numbers of students who were poor, had limited English proficiency, or had disabilities. We also developed illustrative state allocations under current and alternative title I Education Finance Incentive Program formulas as well as under the targeted grant formula (see app. V)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring Effort", "paragraphs": ["The effort factor in the Education Finance Incentive Program provides additional title I aid to those states with education spending relative to their ability to pay that is higher than other states.

TTR takes into account all income produced within a state, whether received by residents or nonresidents, or retained by business corporations. TTR is a more comprehensive indicator of taxable resources than personal income alone, in part because it also considers income produced in a state but received by nonresidents.", "In our alternative effort factors, we consider both spending and ability to pay per student, rather than spending per student and ability to pay per capita, as the current law does. The ability to pay per student is a better measure of a state\u2019s ability to finance educational services for students than ability to pay per capita. Moreover, using ability to pay per capita, rather than per student, results in lower Education Finance Incentive grants for states with high proportions of school-age children\u2014those states usually intended to benefit from education-related grants.", "In one of the alternatives we developed, option B, we increase the level of the reward to states that increase their level of effort over time. For example, two states may have the same level of effort in the current year. But while one state increased its level of effort from the previous year, the other state decreased its level of effort. In the first of the alternatives we present, option A, these two states would have the same effort factor because they each currently have the same level of effort\u2014as would happen under current law. In the second alternative, option B, the state that increased its level of effort from the previous year would have a higher score than the state that decreased its level of effort. Option C is similar to B but without the limits of 0.95 and 1.05, so that low-effort states would have a greater incentive to increase their effort.", "The details of the three alternative effort factors we developed are as follows. The first alternative, which we refer to as option A, is based on state and local funding for elementary and secondary public education (kindergarten through grade 12) divided by the state\u2019s TTR. To develop an index, we divided the state figure by a comparable figure for the nation as a whole. This effort index, as is the case for the current law index, is limited to no less than 0.95 and no more than 1.05. Option A is based on data for school year 1992-93.", "The second alternative, which we refer to as option B, is an index that also considers the rate of change in effort over time. We determined the rate of change in effort over time by comparing option A with a similar effort factor for the previous school year, 1991-92. For example, if the state\u2019s effort factor was 1.01 under option A, and it had improved by 3 percent from the previous year, under option B its effort factor would be 1.01 multiplied by 1.03 (1 plus 0.03), or 1.04. In contrast, if the state\u2019s effort factor was 1.01 under option A, but its effort had decreased by 3 percent from the previous year, under option B its effort factor would be 1.01 multiplied by 0.97 (1 minus 0.03) or 0.98. Again, the factors were limited within the bounds of 0.95 and 1.05.", "The third option we developed, option C, is similar to option B in that it provides an additional incentive for change over time. In addition, option C eliminates the lower limit of 0.95 and the upper limit of 1.05. We allowed only half of the index to vary, however, because otherwise the gap between the extremes would be too wide. In other words, option C equals 0.5 multiplied by an unconstrained effort factor, plus a constant of 0.5.

The particular statistical measure used to determine the level of spending disparities in each state under current law is the coefficient of variation (COV). The COV is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean. Assuming a normal distribution, approximately two-thirds of all school districts will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, or average. For example, if the state\u2019s average per pupil spending is $6,000 and the standard deviation is $2,000, then approximately two-thirds of districts in the state will be spending between $4,000 and $8,000 per pupil. However, average spending levels vary greatly from state to state. To provide fair comparisons across the states, each state\u2019s standard deviation is divided by its average spending level. Using this example, the COV is $2,000 divided by $6,000 or 0.33.", "In addition to defining the measure of equity as the COV, the law specifies that the COV should be weighted by the number of poor children in each school district for each state. The Congressional Research Service has pointed out that \u201cthe effect of the additional weighting for poor children is that expenditure disparities in favor of LEAs with relatively large numbers of poor children would reduce a State\u2019s measured COV, while expenditure disparities in favor of LEAs with relatively low numbers of poor children would increase a State\u2019s COV.\u201d", "To provide a simplified example of how weighting might work, assume a state has two school districts\u2014one with only poor students and another with no poor students. Also assume that the per pupil spending is the same for the two districts, except that 40 percent more funding per poor student is provided to fund additional services. Such a state would appear to have a significant spending disparity. However, a weighted COV takes into account the differences in student needs.", "In the current law, the 1.4 weighting per poor student stems, in part, from title I, which authorizes an additional 40 percent in per pupil spending to provide services to educationally disadvantaged children in high poverty areas. However, appropriations for title I have generally been less than half of what is authorized. As a result, in a recent study, researchers used 1.2 as a weighting for poor students.", "The law also contains a number of other adjustments that take into account complexities arising from various types of LEAs (for example, elementary, secondary, and unified), extremely small LEAs, and other factors. Under current law, separate COVs are used for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. A statewide COV is then determined by calculating a weighted average based on the number of weighted students (that is, counting poor students as 1.4) for each type of district occurring within the state. Some states have only unified school districts serving students from kindergarten through grade 12; other states have elementary, secondary, and unified school districts.

Another measure of equity, the McLoone Index, focuses on equity for school districts that spend less than the median. This index is the ratio of the sum of expenditures for districts below the median to what the expenditures in these districts would be if they were able to spend at the median level per pupil.

For example, if one district in a state has many pupils that are poor, have limited English proficiency, or otherwise need special educational services, it may be appropriate for the state to provide more aid for that district than for districts without high proportions of these at-risk pupils. Therefore, it may be necessary to make adjustments to consider that one district has greater student needs by weighting its students according to their need for additional services. If, for example, the cost of educating a student with limited English proficiency is, on average, 20 percent more than the cost of educating a student without additional needs, these students would then be weighted 1.2. If the district were able to spend at the level needed to cover these additional services, its expenditures per weighted pupil would show that it was spending at a level comparable with districts with fewer students with additional needs.", "We chose to use a set of weights developed for the NCES report, Disparities in Public School District Spending: 1989-90, that takes into account differences in student needs across school districts. The researchers assigned students with disabilities a weight of 2.3 because the cost of educating such children is generally 2.3 times the cost of educating children who do not need special educational services, although the cost of educating children with specific types of disabilities varies widely. The report used weights of 1.2 for children from poor families or those who have limited English proficiency. This additional 0.2 weighting for students in poverty stems from an estimate based on the average title I allocation per student divided by average revenues per student. The rationale for using a weight of 1.2 for children with limited English proficiency is based on an expectation that they will need additional educational services, comparable with those for poor children, although school districts may generally spend less than this currently.", "We also consulted with the Congressional Research Service on the issue of whether to use 1.2 or 1.4 as a weight for the number of poor children and those with limited English proficiency. While the current equity measure uses the higher weight of 1.4 to adjust for the greater needs of poor children, it does not adjust for the greater needs of other students needing additional services, such as students with disabilities or limited English proficiency. But because we were taking into account the additional costs associated with educating these students and because there may be some double counting, that is, students may be weighted twice if they are both poor and have limited English proficiency (or have disabilities and limited English proficiency), we decided the weight of 1.2 was more appropriate in this case.

If each district spends $4,000 per pupil, district B will not be able to provide the same level of services to its students as district A. Therefore, to provide greater comparability, we adjusted the spending levels of the various districts to take into account differences in purchasing power reflected in the cost of hiring and retaining teachers.", "We used a teacher cost index recently developed for the National Center for Education Statistics. While an index that examines differences in the cost of living is also available by district, we believe that the NCES teacher cost index is better suited to our purpose of providing comparability across districts because it considers the purchasing power of districts in determining personnel-related costs, a major cost to school districts. Our focus is on the district\u2019s ability to provide comparable educational services to its students, rather than on whether teachers\u2019 salaries are adequate given the cost of living in their area.", "Not all costs, however, vary within the state. For example, the costs of books, instructional materials, and other supplies and equipment tend to vary little within a state or, for some items, the nation. Therefore, we used the teacher cost index to adjust only the portion of expenditures generally estimated to be related to personnel costs.

We used weights of 1.2 for poor students and those with limited English proficiency, and 2.3 for students with disabilities, rather than the weighting of 1.4 for only poor students as in the current measure of equity. We also used a teacher cost index to adjust for purchasing power differences across school districts. Like the current measure, we subtracted this adjusted COV from 1.3 so that the two measures are comparable. We limited this measure, along with three of the other four we developed, so that no state\u2019s measure is less than 0.95 or more than 1.3.

This limitation affected few states and resulted in relatively minor changes.", "Option E is a variation of option D that takes into account a state\u2019s improvement in equity over time, from school year 1989-90 to school year 1991-92. First we calculated a factor similar to option D, using 1989-90 data, and determined the rate of change from 1989-90 to 1991-92. We then multiplied option D by 1 plus the rate of change. Thus, for example, if the state\u2019s equity factor improved by 3 percent over that time, option E would yield a 3-percent increase in the factor over option D. If a state\u2019s level of equity decreased by 3 percent, option E would be 3 percent lower than option D. For example, if a state currently had an equity factor of 1.10 under option D and it improved by 3 percent, option E would be equal to 1.10 multiplied by 1.03, or 1.13. If, instead, it decreased by 3 percent over this time, option E would be equal to 1.10 multiplied by 0.97, or 1.07.", "We also developed two options, F and G, based on the McLoone Index, which measures the extent to which the state brings up the expenditures of those districts spending below the median. Option F is based on the McLoone Index and includes the same adjustments for differences in student needs and purchasing power across a state\u2019s school districts. Under the current law, states that are fully equalized receive a score of 1.30; states that are fully equalized using the McLoone Index receive a score of 1.00. To ensure that the equity factors we developed were comparable with the current equity factor, option F is equal to the adjusted McLoone Index plus 0.30. (The 0.30 is determined by subtracting 1.00 from 1.30.) In this way, states that are fully equalized would receive a score of 1.30, just as they currently do under the existing equity factor.", "We also developed an equity factor based on the McLoone Index that takes into account the rate of change in equity over time, which we refer to as option G.

Both issues are still relevant.", "The measure currently used to determine the level of equalization in per pupil spending in the Impact Aid program, the Federal Range Ratio, is the difference in per pupil expenditures between two districts\u2014a high-spending district (95th percentile) and a low-spending district (5th percentile)\u2014divided by the per pupil expenditure of the low-spending district. One major drawback of this measure is that it does not consider spending in a majority of each state\u2019s school districts; it only considers spending in two of the state\u2019s school districts (at the 95th and 5th percentiles). Consequently, two states with fairly different spending patterns may have similar Federal Range Ratio scores.

For example, some states provide additional funds to take into account the greater needs of some types of students (such as those who are poor or have limited English proficiency or disabilities) or some types of districts (such as those in sparsely populated areas). On the one hand, not including such funds is a strength of the way that equalization is measured because states that contribute additional funds to high-need areas are not penalized for these greater spending disparities.

First, the measure of spending disparities may be misleading. Second, the way in which states treat districts in high-need areas is not fully addressed.
