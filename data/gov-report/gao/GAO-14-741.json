These experts acknowledged that the flood was primarily due to extreme rain in eastern Montana in May and June 2011. The experts agreed that no existing forecasting tools could have accurately predicted these extreme rainstorms more than a week in advance. One of the experts also said that the Corps would have needed several months to release enough water from the reservoirs to have sufficient space for the runoff that occurred in 2011, and predicting an extreme runoff year that far in advance is beyond the current state of science. Moreover, the experts agreed that the Corps appropriately followed the drought conservation procedures in the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System Master Water Control Manual (Master Manual), which sets out policies for managing the river. The experts agreed that the Corps does not need to change the Master Manual in response to the 2011 flood or subsequent drought. However, some of the experts noted that if the Corps develops improved forecasting tools, it might be useful to evaluate whether changes to the Master Manual would help the Corps to act on information from the new tools.", "The experts suggested that improving data systems and introducing new runoff forecasting techniques could improve the Corps' ability to make release decisions in less extreme events than the 2011 flood. These data systems\u2014such as streamgages, weather radar, precipitation gauges, soil moisture monitoring, and monitoring for snow on the plains\u2014are not managed by the Corps, but by other federal and state agencies, which creates challenges beyond the Corps' control. The experts agreed that probabilistic forecasting techniques\u2014which correct for unknown initial conditions using statistical techniques and provide a range of potential outcomes and their likeliness\u2014could help the Corps manage risks better than their current methods that create one forecast estimate. One of the experts said that probabilistic methods could provide greater benefits, such as higher water supply reliability, increased flood protection and hydropower production, and easier implementation of variable flows to create fish and wildlife habitats. Probabilistic techniques are currently used by New York City to support reservoir releases to manage flood risk and meet water quality goals without adding expensive new filtration equipment. Corps officials said that they have not considered using probabilistic techniques in the Missouri River basin because they are not sure the benefits would outweigh the difficulty of creating the models or explaining the new methods to their stakeholders.", "During both the flood and drought, the Corps communicated with Missouri River stakeholders in a variety of ways, which most stakeholders GAO spoke with said were effective. Most stakeholders were generally satisfied with the Corps' communication, saying that the information they received from the Corps was timely and sufficient for their purposes. Most stakeholders had at least one suggestion on how the Corps could improve communication; however, there was little consensus on any one suggestion. A few stakeholders suggested that the Corps hold separate conference calls to discuss sensitive response-related issues. Corps officials said that they would consider this in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Corps evaluate the pros and cons of incorporating new forecasting techniques into its management of the Missouri River reservoirs.

Between 1933 and 1964,  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) built six dams and reservoirs  on the mainstem of the Missouri River. The Corps\u2019 Missouri River Basin  Water Management Division manages these dams and reservoirs for  eight authorized purposes: navigation, flood control, irrigation,  hydropower, municipal and industrial water supply, water quality,  recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat. To manage the river, the Corps  uses the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System Master Water  Control Manual (Master Manual), which was last updated in 2006. The  Master Manual describes the river, dams, and reservoirs; identifies key  data from other agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and  Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); describes the Corps\u2019  methods for creating forecasts of the amount of runoff flowing into the  reservoirs; and sets out the policies and procedures under which the  Corps operates in making decisions about water releases from the dams.", "In 2011, large amounts of snow and extreme rains along the Missouri  River led to the highest runoff levels since recordkeeping began in 1898  and prompted the Corps to release a record volume of water from the  dams to prevent the dams from being overtopped, which could have  caused catastrophic dam failure. These high runoff levels and high water  releases caused significant flooding and damage along the river from  Montana to Missouri and disruption that affected farms, homes,  businesses, industries, public infrastructure, and transportation networks.  According to the Corps\u2019 After Action Report, the flood costs borne by the  Corps were approximately $1 billion, including direct flood damages,  response activities during the flood fight, and subsequent repair  activities. After the flood, both 2012 and the spring of 2013 were dry,  leading to drought conditions in parts of the Missouri River basin and  causing the Corps to reduce releases from the dams to conserve water.  The Corps\u2019 release decisions and communication during the recent flood  and drought affected stakeholders with interests in the management of  the river\u2014including navigators, municipalities that draw drinking water  from the river, farmers who use river water for irrigation, and  conservationists seeking to protect fish and bird habitats.", "You asked us to review the Corps\u2019 release decisions and communication  with stakeholders during the 2011 flood and subsequent drought.

Specifically, we reviewed relevant  laws and related documents that guide the Corps\u2019 release decisions,  including the Master Manual. We reviewed documents produced or  commissioned by the Corps that describe the details of the Corps\u2019 release  decisions during the flood and drought. We also reviewed reports by  NOAA, the National Weather Service (NWS), USGS, and other agencies  describing the recent flood and drought, as well as existing data collection  and forecasting systems in the Missouri River basin. In addition, we  worked with the National Academy of Sciences to convene a group of  nine experts for a 2-day meeting in February 2014. We asked this group  of experts to discuss the Corps\u2019 data, forecasts, and release decisions  during the recent flood and drought (See app. I for a list of the experts  and the questions discussed during the 2-day meeting).

This reservoir system is  the largest in the United States and contains about 73.1 million acre-feet  (MAF) of water storage capacity. A majority of the system\u2019s storage  capacity is in the three upstream reservoirs\u2014Fort Peck Lake, Lake  Sakakawea, and Lake Oahe.

This zone is intended to maintain  downstream river flows, although at lower levels, even in a succession  of dry years. When the basin is not experiencing a drought, this zone  is designed to be full when the runoff year begins on March 1. During  times of drought, water from this zone is used to support the  aforementioned authorized purposes, though at lower levels.", "The Annual Flood Control and Multiple Use Zone provides storage  space for spring and summer runoff that can be used throughout the  year to support all authorized purposes. The Master Manual sets a  goal of having this zone empty on or about March 1 of every year, so  any water that is stored here during the spring and summer is meant  to be released prior to the start of the next runoff season, which is  approximately March 1.", "The Exclusive Flood Control Zone is only used to store floodwaters in  extreme and unpredictable floods and is emptied as rapidly as  downstream conditions permit.", "The eight authorized purposes of the system have different water needs,  and the Master Manual addresses each of these purposes (see table 1).", "In addition, some of the Corps\u2019 reservoir management is related to  compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Two  bird species nest along the river from May to August: the endangered  least tern and threatened piping plover. Releases from Gavins Point, Fort  Randall, and Garrison dams have been modified to accommodate these  bird species by adapting releases to prevent, as much as possible,  inundation of bird nests along the river. In addition, one endangered fish  species, the pallid sturgeon, lives in the Missouri River. For the pallid  sturgeon, the Master Manual calls for two \u201cpulses\u201d of water (temporary  higher releases) from Gavins Point dam in the spring to mimic the higher  spring river flows that occurred prior to the construction of the mainstem  reservoirs. The last spring pulse was implemented in 2009; pulses were  cancelled in 2010 and 2011 due to high water levels downstream.

According to USGS data and an October 2012 report by  the Corps assessing post-flood vulnerabilities, loss of streamgages in  the basin has reduced available information about streamflows. For  example, according to USGS data, operation of 79 streamgages in  the Missouri River basin has been discontinued in the last 10 years;  this represents about 9 percent of the streamgages in the basin.", "Soil Moisture. The October 2012 Corps\u2019 vulnerability report and a  December 2011 Independent Technical Review Panel commissioned  by the Corps indicate that data on soil moisture in the Missouri River  basin is currently limited. The October 2012 Corps\u2019 vulnerability  report recommended that soil moisture be measured at predefined  locations in plains states. Data on soil moisture can indicate how  much of the precipitation that falls can be expected to run off into the  reservoir system. For example, if soils are dry then precipitation is  more likely to soak into the soil than to runoff into nearby rivers or  streams.", "Plains snowpack. Three reports have recently identified limitations in  plains snowpack data: the October 2012 Corps\u2019 vulnerability report,  the December 2011 Independent Technical Review Panel Report, and  a May 2012 assessment of forecasting during the Missouri River flood   For example, the May 2012 NWS report noted that the  by the NWS.National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC)  provides modeled information on snow-water equivalent, but that  observational data in the basin are sparse and not always  representative of basin-wide conditions.", "Precipitation. The May 2012 assessment of NWS forecasting also  noted that precipitation gauge and radar data on precipitation in the  Missouri River basin were insufficient during the flood.", "Agencies have begun taking steps to address some data limitations. For  example, in response to the December 2011 Independent Technical  Review Panel Report, the Corps worked with officials from NOAA and  NRCS, among others, to develop an interagency proposal, released in  February 2013, to create a snowpack and soil moisture monitoring  system in the plains. Under the proposal, the agencies would (1)  enhance existing climate stations with snow depth and soil moisture  sensors; (2) install new climate stations in the basin to enhance existing  coverage; (3) enhance NOHRSC airborne surveys; (4) identify and train  volunteer or part-time hires to conduct manual snow sampling; and (5)  fund state coordinator positions in Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota,  South Dakota, and Wyoming to coordinate snow surveys and other snow  data networks at a state level. The Water Resources Reform and  Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014, enacted into law in June 2014,  included a requirement that the Secretary of the Army, in coordination  with other specified agencies, develop this type of monitoring system in  the Upper Missouri River Basin. In addition, NWS has developed a new  technology, the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor system, which integrates  information from NWS, Canadian, and other radar systems with on-the- ground precipitation gauge information and model data to provide better  estimates of precipitation. According to NWS officials, the Multi-Radar  Multi-Sensor system is also capable of mitigating some gaps in radar  coverage by extending the effective range of radar-based precipitation  estimates from individual radars. According to NWS officials, this  technology will be implemented nationwide by the end of 2014.", "According to Corps documents and officials, the Corps uses hydrologic  data as an input to forecasts used to manage the reservoir system. The  Corps runs two key forecasts to generate information for basin  stakeholders and to make reservoir release decisions.", "Monthly forecast. On a monthly basis, or more frequently as needed,  the Corps produces a forecast of the expected annual runoff for the  remainder of the calendar year. This forecast takes into consideration  current basin conditions, such as soil moisture and snowpack, as well  as long-range weather outlooks and historical trends. The Corps  produces a \u201cbasic\u201d forecast, and then adjusts that forecast by a  predetermined percentage to generate \u201cupper basic\u201d and \u201clower basic\u201d  forecasts to create a range of potential runoff conditions. According to  Corps officials, the upper and lower basic forecasts are designed to  be approximately one standard deviation away from the basic forecast  and cover approximately 80 percent of the likely variation in expected  runoff based on an analysis of historic runoff records. Each month,  these runoff forecast estimates are used as input to the 3-week  forecast, which forecasts reservoir inflows, releases, storage levels,  and hydropower generation, among other things. According to Corps  officials, this forecast is used by basin stakeholders to make business  decisions that are affected by reservoir releases. For example, the  Western Area Power Administration, which is responsible for  marketing all the hydropower generated by the six dams, makes  power purchase decisions based on this forecast. In addition, the  Corps makes some reservoir release decisions based on the monthly  forecast, particularly to move water between the six reservoirs to  adjust to current weather conditions or support downstream uses.", "Three-week forecast. On a weekly basis, or more frequently as  needed, the Corps produces a forecast of reservoir inflows, outflows,  storage, and power generation over the next 3-to-5 weeks. According  to Corps officials, this model uses \u201cwater on the ground\u201d information\u2014 specifically streamflows and reservoir levels\u2014combined with  information from the basic monthly forecast. Officials said this is the  primary model they use to set daily and weekly reservoir releases and  that they try not to deviate significantly from projected releases at Fort  Peck and Garrison dams in this forecast, unless there are unusual  circumstances. Adjustments at the other four dams are routinely made  to respond to changing conditions on the ground, such as rainfall  below the reservoir system.", "The Corps\u2019 current runoff forecasts are deterministic, meaning that the  models create a single forecast based on the existing hydrologic data.  Although the monthly runoff forecast also includes the upper basic and  lower basic conditions, these are still deterministic because they are  generated by using a multiple of the basic forecast. However, according  to NOAA documents, error can be introduced into deterministic forecasts  when initial hydrologic conditions are not fully known. According to NWS  officials, a different type of forecasting\u2014called probabilistic forecasting\u2014 attempts to account for uncertainty in the forecast by, for example, using  statistical techniques to simulate multiple, slightly different initial  conditions. These officials said that probabilistic forecasts provide a range  of potential outcomes and their likeliness. Probabilistic techniques are  used extensively in weather forecasting both for routine forecasts and for  more rare events such as hurricanes, according to NWS officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 2011 Flood and 2012 and 2013 Drought", "paragraphs": ["Annual runoff into the Missouri River reservoir system can vary  significantly from year to year (see fig. 3).

Snowpack generally accumulates in the  mountains of Montana and Wyoming throughout the winter, peaking in  mid-April and then providing runoff as it melts through May and June.  As of March 1, 2011, the mountain snowpack was slightly above  average at about 110 percent of normal (see fig. 4). However, late  April and May were extremely wet and cold, and mountain snowpack  continued to build to record levels in many areas.

The Corps continued increasing releases throughout April and May,  reaching 50,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) on May 9 and surpassing the  previous high release rate of 70,000 cfs (set in 1997) on May 29. Release  rates increased particularly fast between late May and late June, when  releases peaked at about 160,000 cfs, more than double the previous  high release rate; 160,000 cfs is about the amount of water from two  Olympic-sized swimming pools going past a single point in 1 second.

For example, Missouri had its seventh  driest year, Iowa had its 11th driest year, and South Dakota had its 13th  driest year.", "Drought intensity, as defined by the U.S. Drought Monitor, increased from  January through July of 2012, at which point moderate and severe  drought conditions were present in southern Montana, western South  Dakota, western Nebraska, and Wyoming. Conditions worsened during  the summer, and by October 2012, extreme and exceptional drought  conditions were present across Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, and  western Iowa.

The  December 2011 Independent Technical Review Panel Report reached a  similar conclusion.

The Corps worked on MRAPS for 2 years before it was  defunded by Congress in fiscal year 2011 appropriations.experts thought that an examination of the purposes was warranted, in  part, because of the number of reservoir regulation decisions made for  the purpose of navigation. Another of the experts cautioned, however,  that such a study might also open the idea of operating the Missouri River  to benefit stakeholders outside the basin, such as navigators along the  lower Mississippi River. This expert said that the navigation on the  Mississippi River is a $1.2 billion industry and, in some years, could  benefit from flow support from the Missouri River. He pointed out,  however, that such an action could use a significant amount of water from  the reservoirs, perhaps to the detriment of current authorized purposes.

The experts said  that historical streamflow records can also help modelers describe how  flow conditions persist in streams, which enables them to create  probabilistic forecasts of possible future river flows. As previously  mentioned, USGS data indicates that about 9 percent of streamgages in  the Missouri River basin have been discontinued in the last 10 years.  USGS officials said that streamgages are often discontinued due to  funding shortages, either at USGS or from the cooperative partner  agencies which help fund the streamgages. According to USGS officials,  the Corps provides funding for 264 of the 892 streamgages in the  Missouri River basin. According to Corps officials, when their support for  streamgages is reduced, they prioritize saving downstream streamgages  on tributaries with more than one streamgage because downstream  streamgages capture more of the river\u2019s flow. Corps officials said that  under normal circumstances, losing data from upstream streamgages is  not a serious problem, but that during a flood it can become a major  challenge. For example, during the 2011 flood, the sole streamgage on  the Judith River\u2014a Missouri River tributary that runs through central  Montana\u2014was destroyed when the bridge it was attached to was washed  away. Without streamflow data on the Judith River, the Corps had to  estimate the Judith River flows, which resulted in less accurate  information.", "USGS officials said that they do their best to maintain the integrity of the  streamgage network.

However, one of the experts who participated in  our meeting said that the current cooperative funding model relied on by  USGS to support most of the streamgages makes it a challenge to  maintain the network since the cooperative partners may have other  priorities. For example, USGS officials told us that one reservoir manager  in Illinois pulled funding for a streamgage and used the money to build an  outhouse.

For example, this expert noted that areas  approximately 30 miles north of Pierre, South Dakota, have relatively poor  radar coverage. Weather radar data is supplemented by precipitation  gauge data, such as through the volunteer Community Collaborative  Rain, Hail and Snow (CoCoRaHS) Network. However, the experts said  that the basin is sparsely populated, which limits the pool of volunteer  observers, potentially making it more difficult to collect the data needed to  supplement the weather radar network. Corps officials said that the  CoCoRaHS Network can compensate for gaps in the radar coverage, and  few stakeholders are seeking to expand the radar network. NWS officials  agreed that radar coverage was poor in the northern and western parts of  the basin, such as southeastern Montana and central South Dakota.  However, NWS officials told us that they do not currently have plans to  expand radar coverage because current off-the-shelf radar does not have  the same capabilities as the NWS\u2019s current system. Integrating off-the- shelf radars into the system would be difficult, and building radars that  match the capabilities of the current system would be expensive,  according to these officials.

Two of the  experts indicated that probabilistic forecasting techniques could also  improve the Corps\u2019 ability to make release decisions in extreme events.  Experts who participated in our meeting agreed that probabilistic  forecasting techniques could help the Corps manage risks and make  decisions in the face of uncertainty. One of the experts said that these  techniques are useful for communicating risk information\u2014such as the  risk of severe excesses or deficiencies of water\u2014to the public and public  officials. Another of the experts said that probabilistic techniques could  allow the Corps to provide increased benefits to the system. These  benefits could include higher reliability of water supply without increasing  flood risk, increased flood protection, small increases in hydropower  production, and easier implementation of variable river flows to create  and maintain specific fish and wildlife habitats.", "The primary type of probabilistic forecasting techniques discussed by  experts who participated in our meeting was ensemble forecasting.  Ensemble forecasting combines multiple forecasts to generate a sample  of potential future weather developments. The individual forecasts, called  ensemble members, can be created either using several different models  in concert or multiple runs of the same model with slightly different initial  conditions. These forecasts are then compared to determine how much  agreement there is between the various ensemble members. Some of the  experts said that ensemble forecasts can help forecasters correct for both  uncertainty about initial conditions and uncertainty about the how a model  is constructed, which are common causes of forecasting error. One  method of generating ensemble forecasts that the experts said could be  potentially useful in the Missouri River basin is the Hirsch method. This  method uses correlations between 1 month\u2019s streamflow and the previous  month\u2019s flow to generate ensemble members, since flow conditions from  the previous month generally persist into the next. For example, Hirsch  model forecasts examine the historical statistical relationships between  streamflow in March and streamflow in April since March\u2019s conditions  persist into April. When this relationship exists, it allows for forecasts with  less variance and uncertainty compared with other methods, leading to  more accurate forecasts.", "Another way experts who participated in our meeting suggested that the  Corps could incorporate ensemble modeling into its forecasts would be to  leverage the existing ensemble streamflow forecast created by the NWS  Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS). The AHPS forecasts  use ensemble streamflow predictions to determine the chances of a river  exceeding minor, moderate, or major flood levels over the next 90 days.  One of the experts noted that the current AHPS forecast locations in the  Missouri River basin are not located where the Corps likely needs them to  be to have enough information to make their decisions. NWS officials told  us that they produce probabilistic forecasts at 465 AHPS forecast  locations in the basin but that none of these locations are along the  mainstem of the Missouri River because probabilistic forecasting along  the mainstem would require integrating the Corps\u2019 reservoir management  procedures into the NWS probabilistic models. One of the experts said  the Corps could overcome this challenge by identifying statistical  relationships between the existing AHPS locations and the locations that  the Corps would want to use for decision making and conduct a pilot  project to see how useful these statistical relationships would be for  reservoir management decisions. This expert said that this pilot effort  would not be a difficult undertaking and could be accomplished for  roughly $100,000, but the Corps would need to coordinate closely with  NWS.", "According to experts who participated in our meeting, reservoir managers  in several basins throughout the United States currently use probabilistic  techniques to manage reservoirs. For example, reservoir managers in the  Occoquan River basin (which provides drinking water to Fairfax County,  Virginia) successfully used Hirsch method forecasts in the 1970s to  support implementation of drought mitigation measures that were less  onerous than were thought necessary based on their deterministic  forecasts. In 2009, the New York City Department of Environmental  Protection (DEP) began developing a tool that incorporates both Hirsch  method and NWS forecasts to help manage drinking water reservoirs that  serve 9 million residents of the city and surrounding areas, as well as  other competing demands on the system, such as release requirements  on the Delaware River, flood control, and recreational fisheries. DEP  officials said that a similar tool could help the Corps better manage other  reservoir systems, such as along the Missouri River. DEP officials said  the tool, which cost about $8 million, was developed in stages: in late  2010, it included modeling based on the Hirsch method and, in November  2013 it incorporated NWS hydrologic ensemble forecasts. DEP officials  said the tool uses these ensemble forecasts to model potential reservoir  management scenarios to meet water quality goals\u2014such as reducing  the amount of sediment in the city\u2019s drinking water\u2014without having to  install expensive new water filtration plants. DEP officials also said the  tool supports reservoir operations decisions, including preemptive  releases in advance of large storm events to create space in the  reservoirs and releases to support downstream communities. DEP  officials said the tool is more effective than their previous method of  forecasting, which, much like the Corps\u2019 Missouri River forecasting, used  historical data and runoff volume calculations. DEP officials said that  ensemble forecasts have been effective in modernizing management of  their reservoir system by reducing uncertainty and helping them to better  assess risk and make informed decisions, and that similar systems could  help the Corps make risk-based decisions about reservoir releases  informed by real probabilities.", "Corps officials told us that they have not considered using probabilistic  techniques, such as the Hirsch method or NWS forecast products, in the  Missouri River system because they are not sure the benefits would  outweigh the difficulty of creating the models or explaining the new  methods to their stakeholders. Corps officials told us that deterministic  forecasts are easy to maintain and simpler to explain to stakeholders than  probabilistic methods. These officials also said that their current methods  work well in all but the most extreme events and are a more efficient use  of their limited staff resources. Corps officials said that assigning  probabilities to their current runoff forecast could give them and their  stakeholders more certainty about the likelihood that a very high or very  low runoff year will develop. However, the Corps would nonetheless have  to select one of the forecasts on which to base their real-time operations.  This would, in effect, require the application of the same engineering  judgment that is used in their deterministic forecast, according to Corps  officials. In addition, Corps officials said that Missouri River basin  stakeholders who see the results of the Corps models would face similar  challenges, but they would not have the years of engineering expertise to  determine how to act on a range of potential very high or very low  releases with the same likelihood of occurrence. Furthermore, Corps  officials said that basing system operations on probabilistic forecasts  would require changes to many of their current operational procedures,  and thus changes to the Master Manual.", "However, experts who participated in our meeting agreed that Corps  should investigate probabilistic techniques. Some of the experts said that  the Corps can achieve better outcomes for the basin using probabilistic  techniques than their current methods. One of the experts noted that  using probabilistic techniques can help the Corps focus on the risks of  flood and drought in less extreme years than 2011, which may help to  increase the benefits to basin stakeholders from the six mainstem dams.  The experts also agreed on the importance of evaluating any new  forecasting methods using hindcasting, which uses historical weather and  stream information to determine how effectively a given forecasting  approach would have predicted past events. One of the experts said that  hindcasts are a powerful tool for showing the Corps and their  stakeholders that a new probabilistic forecasting model would have  provided useful information in the past, will be able to provide useful  information in the future, and that changes to operating rules based on  the ensemble forecasts would create win-win outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Were Generally Satisfied with Corps\u2019 Communication during the Flood and Drought", "paragraphs": ["During both the 2011 flood and the subsequent drought, the Corps  communicated with Missouri River stakeholders in a variety of ways,  which most stakeholders we interviewed said were effective.

In addition, we reviewed the documents that the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) uses to guide their release decisions,  including the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System Master Water  Control Manual (Master Manual) (last updated in 2006) and the Annual  Operating Plans for 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013. We also  reviewed documents produced or commissioned by the Corps that  describe the details of the Corps\u2019 release decisions during the flood and  drought, including \u201cSummary of Actual 2011 Regulation,\u201d \u201cSummary of  Actual 2012 Regulation,\u201d and the December 2011 Independent Technical  Review Report. In addition, we reviewed National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  documents about existing hydrologic data collection systems and National  Weather Service (NWS) documents about weather and flood forecasts  during 2011. We conducted a technical review of the December 2011  Independent Technical Review Report and the NOAA Climate  Assessment Report to ensure that the methodologies used were  appropriate to support the conclusions reached. We also interviewed  Corps officials at the Missouri River Basin Water Management Division  who are responsible for making release decisions and conducted a site  visit to the Oahe project in South Dakota to gather information about dam  operations and water levels during the 2011 flood.", "To obtain expert views on the Corps\u2019 information and release decisions,  we convened a meeting of experts to discuss these issues. This meeting  was held at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in February 2014,  and staff at NAS assisted in identifying experts for the meeting. To  identify the experts appropriate for this meeting, NAS staff solicited  nominations from: current and former members of the NAS Water  Science and Technology Board; current and former members of the  Water Science and Technology Board study committees; select members  of the NAS and the National Academy of Engineering; National Research  Council staff; and other experts. Experts were selected based on  knowledge of: (1) reservoir operations and river basin system modeling  (both in the United States and abroad); (2) weather conditions and  forecasts, and river stage forecasting, specifically in the Missouri River  system; and (3) modeling of the relationship between precipitation and  runoff; and Corps operational decisions. The experts identified by NAS  included individuals with a broad set of viewpoints and knowledge,  including experts from federal and state government agencies, the private  sector and consultants, academia, and retired federal water and  engineering experts. The range of the experts\u2019 expertise included  reservoir system operations and modeling, hydrology and hydraulics, civil  engineering, meteorology, rainfall-runoff modeling, and Corps reservoir  operations.", "The nine experts were evaluated for conflicts of interest. A conflict of  interest was considered to be any current financial or other interest that  might conflict with the service of an individual because it (1) could impair  objectivity and (2) could create an unfair competitive advantage for any  person or organization. All potential conflicts were discussed by NAS and  GAO staff. The nine experts were determined to be free of conflicts of  interest, and the group as a whole was judged to have no inappropriate  biases. See appendix I for a list of the experts and the questions  discussed during the 2-day meeting.", "The 2-day expert meeting began with a 1-hour presentation by the Chief  of the Missouri River Basin Water Management Division and an  opportunity for the experts to ask questions. After questions, the Corps\u2019  representative left the meeting and experts began discussing the Corps\u2019  data, forecasts, and release decisions. The meeting was recorded and  transcribed to ensure that we accurately captured the experts\u2019  statements, and we reviewed the transcripts as a source of evidence. We  analyzed the transcripts to identify key statements the experts made  regarding the Corps\u2019 data, forecasts, and release decisions. We sent  these statements, via e-mail, to each of the experts to ensure that they all  agreed with our characterization of the findings of the 2-day meeting. We  received replies from all nine experts generally agreeing to the  statements and making some additions and clarifications, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "To obtain stakeholders\u2019 views of the Corps\u2019 communication during flood  and drought, we used a standard set of questions to interview a  nonprobability sample of 45 stakeholders in the Missouri River basin. We  identified these stakeholders based on our preliminary interviews and  sought to include organizations from each of the seven states included in  our review and related to the eight authorized purposes of the Missouri  River reservoir system. For example, to obtain perspectives related to  flood control, we identified communities of different sizes along the river  and interviewed officials from those communities responsible for  emergency management and public works. These local communities  included cities as large as Kansas City, Missouri (more than 450,000  people), and as small as Fort Pierre, South Dakota (roughly 2,000  people). We also spoke with state emergency management agencies in  each of the seven states. Similarly, to obtain perspectives related to  navigation, we interviewed a barge operator, a terminal operator, and  nonprofit organizations that advocate for navigation along the Missouri  River. In addition, to obtain perspectives related to fish and wildlife, we  interviewed an official at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service active in  addressing endangered species in the Missouri River basin and state  officials involved in fish and wildlife issues from each of the seven states.  See table 6 for a complete list of the stakeholders we interviewed about  the Corps\u2019 communication efforts.", "To obtain the views of these 45 agencies and organizations, we  developed a structured interview guide that included questions about the  Corps\u2019 mode of communication with stakeholders (for example, via e- mail, phone, or letter), and how effective that communication was during  the recent flood and drought. We conducted two pretests of the  questionnaire and made appropriate changes based on these pretests.  We used the structured interview guide to obtain the views of these  organizations either via phone or, in cases where the respondent  preferred, via e-mail. We analyzed the responses to provide insight into  organizations\u2019 views on the Corps\u2019 communication during the flood and  drought. These stakeholder interviews provide key insights and illustrate  opinions concerning Missouri River basin issues; however the results of  our interviews cannot be used to make generalizations about all views. In  some cases, interview questions were skipped, as appropriate. For  example, some stakeholders did not interact with the Corps during the  drought, and we did not ask these stakeholders questions about the  Corps\u2019 communication during that time.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Vondalee R.
