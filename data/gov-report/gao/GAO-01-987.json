A full-funding grant agreement (FFGA) establishes the terms and conditions for federal participation, including the maximum amount of federal funds available for the project, which cannot exceed 80 percent of its estimated net cost. The grant agreement also defines a project\u2019s scope, including the length of the system and the number of stations; its schedule, including the date when the system is expected to open for service; and its cost. To obtain a grant agreement, a project must first progress through a local or regional review of alternatives, develop preliminary engineering plans, and obtain FTA\u2019s approval for final design.", "TEA-21 requires that FTA evaluate projects against \u201cproject justification\u201d and \u201clocal financial commitment\u201d criteria contained in the act.  FTA assesses the project justification or technical merits of a project proposal by reviewing the project\u2019s mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost-effectiveness, and operating efficiencies.  In assessing the stability of a project\u2019s local financial commitment, FTA assesses the project\u2019s finance plan for evidence of stable and dependable financing sources to construct, maintain, and operate the proposed system or extension.

Before TEA-21 was enacted, FTA had already taken steps to revise its evaluation process for the New Starts program because most of the evaluation requirements contained in the act were introduced by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). FTA uses the results to approve projects for the preliminary engineering and final design phases, to execute grant agreements, and to make annual funding recommendations to the Congress.  In May 2001, FTA issued its New Starts report for fiscal year 2002, which included project evaluations and ratings based upon the revised process.

FTA considers these overall ratings to decide which projects will proceed to the preliminary engineering and final design phases, be recommended for funding, and receive full-funding grant agreements (see fig. 1 for an illustration of the process).", "A project\u2019s overall rating is a combination of the project justification and local financial commitment ratings.  With respect to project justification, FTA provides individual ratings for the four criteria identified by TEA-21\u2014 mobility improvements, environmental benefits, operating efficiencies, and cost-effectiveness\u2014as well as for transit-supportive land-use policies. According to FTA, the agency also considers a variety of other factors when evaluating the project\u2019s justification, including the degree to which policies and programs are in place as assumed in the forecasts, the project\u2019s management capability, and additional factors relevant to local and national priorities. To evaluate a project\u2019s local financial commitment, FTA rates the project on its capital and operating finance plans and the local share of its costs.", "After analyzing the documentation submitted by the project\u2019s sponsors, FTA assigns a descriptive rating (high, medium-high, medium, medium- low, or low) for each of the project justification and local financial commitment criteria. (App. I summarizes the performance measures that FTA uses in applying the criteria to develop these ratings.) As figure 1 shows, once the individual criterion ratings are completed, FTA assigns summary project justification and local financial commitment ratings by combining the individual criterion ratings. In developing the summary project justification rating, FTA gives the most weight to the criteria for transit-supportive land use, cost-effectiveness, and mobility improvements. For the summary local financial commitment ratings, the measures for the proposed local share of capital costs and the strength of the capital and operating finance plans are given equal consideration. FTA combines the summary project justification and local financial commitment ratings to create an overall rating for the project of \u201chighly recommended,\u201d \u201crecommended,\u201d or \u201cnot recommended.\u201d To receive a \u201chighly recommended\u201d rating, a project must have summary ratings of at least medium-high for the project justification and local financial commitment. To receive a rating of \u201crecommended,\u201d the project must have summary ratings of at least medium. A project is rated as \u201cnot recommended\u201d when either summary rating is lower than medium.", "In preparing its New Starts proposal each year, FTA gives first preference to projects with existing grant agreements. Following that, consideration is given to projects with an overall rating of \u201crecommended\u201d or higher. However, some projects rated as \u201chighly recommended\u201d or \u201crecommended\u201d may not meet FTA\u2019s \u201creadiness\u201d test for funding; FTA uses a number of milestones to determine whether a project is sufficiently developed for a grant agreement. For example, FTA determines whether the necessary real estate has been acquired, utility arrangements have been made, and local funding sources are in place. According to an FTA official, this ensures that there are no \u201cred flags\u201d signaling that the project has outstanding issues it must address. In addition, FTA has considered the following issues in evaluating grantees: the degree to which the transit agency has a satisfactory plan to manage an existing bus fleet to ensure no degradation of service for users of the current system;   compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, including financial commitments necessary to maintain accessible service, make necessary improvements, and comply with key requirements for stations; and   compliance with air quality standards in the region.", "For its New Starts report for fiscal year 2002, FTA evaluated a total of 40 projects and provided overall ratings for 26 of these projects. Of the 26 projects that were rated, 21 were rated as \u201crecommended,\u201d 2 projects were rated as \u201chighly recommended,\u201d and 3 projects received \u201cnot recommended\u201d ratings. According to FTA, fewer projects received \u201chighly recommended\u201d ratings this year because FTA set the bar higher for such ratings.  FTA believes that fewer projects received \u201cnot recommended\u201d ratings because project officials have a better understanding of the evaluation and rating process and criteria used to assess a project\u2019s justification and local financial commitment.", "In assigning overall project ratings, FTA emphasized the continuous nature of project evaluation. Throughout the report, FTA underscored the fact that as candidate projects proceed through the final design stage, information concerning costs, benefits, and impacts will be refined. Consequently, FTA updates its ratings and recommendations at least annually to reflect this new information, changing conditions, and refined financing plans. Thus, a project that is rated as \u201cnot recommended\u201d in the fiscal year 2002 report could receive a rating of \u201crecommended\u201d or \u201chighly recommended\u201d in the fiscal year 2003 report to reflect changes in the project.  For example, in the report for fiscal year 2001, the New Orleans Canal Streetcar project received a \u201cnot recommended\u201d rating. However, this year the project received a \u201crecommended\u201d rating and was proposed for a grant agreement.

The final rule will be used as FTA considers its New Starts proposal for fiscal year 2003. The refinements in the final rule reflect public comments on FTA\u2019s proposed rule, which was issued in April 1999. Comments on the proposed rule were accepted through July 1999. A total of 41 individuals and organizations provided comments. Comments were submitted on virtually every aspect of the proposed rule, but most centered on four key issues: the measure of cost-effectiveness, the continued use of a no-build and Transportation System Management (TSM) alternative for evaluation purposes, the overall project rating, and the measure for mobility improvements.", "Twenty-three comments were received on FTA\u2019s use of the historical \u201ccost per new rider\u201d measure to indicate the cost-effectiveness of a proposed project.  The consensus of the commenters was that the focus on new riders ignores benefits provided to other riders, which may bias the measure against cities with \u201cmature\u201d transit systems, where the focus of a proposed project may be to improve service, not attract new riders. In response, the final rule replaced the \u201ccost per new rider\u201d measure with a new measure of \u201ctransportation system user benefits.\u201d According to FTA, this measure is based on the basic goals of any major transportation investment\u2014to reduce the amount of travel time and out-of-pocket costs that people incur for taking a trip (i.e., the cost of mobility). This approach de-emphasizes new riders by measuring not only the benefits to people who change modes but also benefits to existing riders and highway users.", "The need to evaluate a New Starts project against a no-build and TSM alternative was also the subject of substantial public comment. Commenters believed that evaluating proposed New Starts projects against both a no-build and a TSM alternative was unnecessarily burdensome, noting that certain incremental system improvements will occur whether the New Starts project is constructed or not\u2014that is, it is no longer appropriate to view the no-build alternative as a \u201cdo nothing\u201d scenario.  In response to comments submitted on this issue and to simplify the New Starts process, the final rule eliminates the need to evaluate a proposed project against both a separate no-build and TSM alternatives. Instead, the final rule requires that the proposed New Starts projects be evaluated against a single \u201cbaseline alternative\u201d agreed upon by project sponsors and FTA. The baseline alternative involves transit improvements that are lower in cost than the proposed New Starts project, resulting in a better ratio of measures of transit mobility compared to the no-build alternative. The purpose of the baseline comparison is to isolate the costs and benefits of the proposed major transit investment.", "Comments on the overall project rating focused on the possibility that a rating of \u201cnot recommended\u201d would be misinterpreted to mean that a proposed project had no merit, resulting in the erosion of local support and funding. In response to these comments, the final rule added one- letter indicators to the \u201cnot recommended\u201d rating that explain where improvement is needed: \u201cj\u201d for project justification, \u201co\u201d for the operating funding plan, and \u201cc\u201d for the capital funding plan. Thus, in future New Starts reports, a proposed project that was found to need improvement in the capital plan would be rated as \u201cnot recommended (c).\u201d", "Finally, public comment on the proposed rule recommended that the measure for mobility improvements be refined.  The proposed measure was based on (1) projected savings in travel time and (2) the number of low-income households within a half-mile of the proposed stations.  The majority of commenters specifically addressed the measure\u2019s focus on low-income households.  Many recommended that the measure include the destinations to be served by the proposed project as well as the number of households near boarding points, arguing that a system that is located near low-income households is of little use to residents unless it can also provide access to employment and other activity centers.  The final rule added a new factor to calculate destinations for jobs within a half-mile of boarding points on the new system, complementing the existing factor that measures low-income households within a half-mile of boarding points.", "Although FTA\u2019s intent to develop performance measures to evaluate the New Starts program for purposes of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) did not generate significant comment, FTA believes that the need for them still exists. Toward that end, the final rule requires that future project applications include a two-step data collection process for determining the degree to which projects remain on schedule and on budget once commitments to fund them have been made (i.e., grant agreements have been executed); and for measuring the success of New Starts projects once they are in operation. For those New Starts projects with grant agreements, FTA will combine before and after data with planning projections to evaluate the projects in several areas, including capital costs, operating costs, and system utilization."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FTA Proposes Seven New Projects for New Starts Funding", "paragraphs": ["FTA\u2019s New Starts report and budget proposal for fiscal year 2002 requests that $1.14 billion be made available for the construction of new transit systems and expansions of existing systems through the New Starts program.

Of this amount, a total of $993.5 million would be allocated among 26 projects with existing grant agreements.  An additional $121.2 million would be allocated to seven new projects. (See fig. 2.)

In addition, FTA is proposing three other projects for funding commitments for fiscal year 2002\u2014for a total of seven projects. These three projects were not rated this year. Specifically, the Miami (South Miami-Dade Busway Extension) project plans to use less than $25 million in New Starts funds and therefore is exempt from the evaluation process.  The Chicago (Metra Southwest Corridor Commuter Rail) and Baltimore (Central LRT Double Tracking) projects were proposed for grant agreements last year and are considered \u201cpending federal commitments.\u201d According to FTA, the ratings of these two projects from last year are still valid.

For instance, the proposed San Diego County/Oceanside-Escondido Rail project received a medium- high rating in mobility improvements because it is expected to serve 15,100 average weekday boardings in 2015, including 8,600 new daily riders. According to FTA, it will also help to eliminate the heavy congestion of northern San Diego County along the Route 78 corridor, saving 700,000 hours of travel time a year compared to the TSM alternative. In addition, the high ratings for the proposed project\u2019s capital and operating financing plans reflect the solid financial condition of the transit agency and the other funding partners, as well as the sufficient projected revenue growth and contingencies.", "Five of the seven projects proposed received overall ratings of \u201crecommended\u201d or were exempt from the rating process. Most were rated medium or medium-high on the project justification and/or local financial commitment criteria. For instance, the Baltimore/Central LRT double tracking project\u2019s \u201crecommended\u201d rating was based on the project\u2019s strong environmental benefits, cost-effectiveness, and demonstrated local financial commitment. According to FTA\u2019s New Starts report, the proposed system would significantly reduce nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions and would cost $8.70 per incremental passenger. In contrast, the sponsor of a project that was not recommended for funding in 2002 estimated that the proposed project would annually increase carbon dioxide emissions by 4,360 tons and would cost $15.50 per passenger. Finally, the Baltimore project\u2019s strong financial rating reflects FTA\u2019s favorable assessment of state support of transit operating subsidies and the financial soundness of the agency\u2019s operations.", "Nineteen other New Starts projects received \u201chighly recommended\u201d or \u201crecommended\u201d ratings but were not proposed for grant agreements. One of these projects\u2014San Diego Midcoast Corridor\u2014received a \u201chighly recommended\u201d rating based on the project\u2019s strong cost-effectiveness, good transit-supportive land use, and strong local financial commitment ratings.  FTA officials told us that this project met FTA\u2019s evaluation and rating criteria as well as its \u201creadiness test\u201d but was not selected because completing the San Diego Mission Valley East LRT extension (an ongoing project) is the transit authority\u2019s top priority.  FTA also notes that the authority may not have the financial capacity to fund both projects at this time.  The other 18 projects were rated overall as \u201crecommended.\u201d Many of these projects were not proposed for grant agreements in fiscal year 2002 because they are in the early stages of development and will not be ready for final design or construction for several years.", "Finally, FTA rated three proposed projects as \u201cnot recommended\u201d primarily because of low local financial commitment summary ratings, reflecting the uncertainty of their local financial commitment or lack of committed local funding to build and operate the systems. For instance, one of the three projects received low ratings for the stability and reliability of its capital and operating finance plans, reflecting FTA\u2019s concerns about the lack of progress in the commitment of nonfederal funds and the absence of a local entity to build and operate the project. Other reasons for receiving a low financial rating included the absence of a dedicated funding source for operating the project and the uncertainty of revenue sources for the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited New Starts Funding Available for Future Transit Projects", "paragraphs": ["According to FTA, it will have limited authority to make funding commitments to New Starts projects throughout the remainder of the TEA-21 authorization period\u2014the end of fiscal year 2003\u2014if it makes funding commitments to  seven projects as proposed in fiscal year 2002.

The Los Angeles project\u2019s grant agreement, which was executed in May 1993, committed a total of $1.4 billion to the project\u2019s three segments\u2014North Hollywood, Eastside, and Mid-City.

FTA advised MTA in July 1999 that FTA no longer had funding commitments for the Eastside or Mid-City segments and that it would evaluate projects once identified for these corridors under the New Starts criteria.  However, FTA continues to reserve $647 million in commitment authority for these segments. Consequently, FTA is significantly understating its remaining commitment authority.

A total of $91 million was appropriated to this project through fiscal year 2001, leaving a federal commitment of $409 million. However, this grant agreement is currently under review due to increases in the overall costs and delays in the project\u2019s implementation schedule. In April 2001, DOT\u2019s Inspector General recommended that the Secretary of DOT hold funds and funding decisions for this project until a specific set of actions related to cost estimation, project scope, cost control, and overall financing plans had been implemented. FTA and project officials have begun implementing these actions, and FTA did not propose New Starts funding for the project in 2002. \u201cReleasing\u201d the amounts committed to one or both of these projects would significantly increase FTA\u2019s flexibility to execute grant agreements for projects ready to move forward and begin construction in fiscal year 2003 and provide funds for preliminary engineering activities.  Such action would not preclude the Los Angeles or Seattle projects from securing New Starts funding in the future. Rather, these projects would be treated like all other projects\u2014that is, they would compete in future New Starts evaluation processes to determine if they should be recommended for grant agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administration Proposes 50-Percent Cap for New Starts Funding", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s fiscal year 2002 budget recommends limiting New Starts funding to 50 percent of total project costs starting in fiscal year 2004.(Currently, New Starts funding\u2014and all federal funding\u2014is capped at 80 percent.) According to FTA, this proposal is consistent with its recent practice of seeking a local commitment of more than 20 percent in order to manage the increasing demand for New Starts funding. For example, as of February 2001, there were over 110 planning studies considering major transit capital investments, 28 New Starts projects in the preliminary engineering phase, and 13 projects in the final design stage. FTA estimates these projects would require about $80 billion in local, state, and federal funds to complete.", "According to FTA, limiting the New Starts funding to 50 percent will ensure that local governments play a major role in funding New Starts projects. Local governments will need to decide to apply either other federal funds or local funds to proposed New Starts projects based on their priorities.  An FTA official also pointed out that a 50-percent cap would allow more projects to receive New Starts funding; however, the official also acknowledged that limiting New Starts funding may prevent some projects from being developed or moving forward because of limited local funding.", "The proposed cap could affect a number of projects currently being developed.  For example, 15 of the 40 projects that were evaluated this year and currently in the final design or preliminary engineering stages plan to use New Starts funds to pay for over 50 percent of their total costs. The projected use of New Starts funds for these 15 projects ranges from 61 percent for Chicago (North Central Corridor Commuter Rail) to 80 percent for New Orleans (Canal Streetcar Spine). According to officials from several of these transit agencies, the impact of the proposed cap would vary.  For example, an official from one project stated that the project would not be able to tap into any other funding sources to account for lower than planned New Starts funding.  In contrast, an official from another project was confident that the project would be able to apply additional federal and local funds to make up for the reduced New Starts funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As FTA approaches the end of the TEA-21 authorization period, it faces funding constraints for the New Starts program.  The implementation of FTA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 New Starts proposal would reduce its remaining commitment authority by over one-half, leaving less than $500 million for new projects in fiscal year 2003.  This may not be enough to fund the 14 projects that FTA believes will be ready to begin construction in fiscal year 2003.  Because of this impending \u201cbudget crunch,\u201d it is important that FTA adopt the recommendation we made last year that it further prioritize among the projects it rates as \u201chighly recommended\u201d or \u201crecommended\u201d for funding purposes.  This would ensure that the \u201cbest\u201d projects receive New Starts funding and allow for a better understanding of why certain projects with similar ratings may receive funding while others do not.", "In addition, FTA could significantly increase its ability to make funding commitments to new projects through fiscal year 2003 and the next authorization if it adopted the practice of \u201creleasing\u201d commitment authority associated with projects for which it has withdrawn a funding commitment.  For example, although two segments of the Los Angeles project have been suspended for over 3 years, have been or will be completely redesigned, and are not likely to be ready for construction by next year, FTA continues to reserve about $650 million in commitment authority associated with the original project\u2014which significantly understates FTA\u2019s remaining commitment authority.  Similarly, when other projects with federal funding commitments do not move forward as expected, FTA needs to reconsider and adjust its commitment authority accordingly. Taking these actions would give FTA additional funding flexibility for the New Starts program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Transportation direct the Administrator of FTA to make commitment authority allocated to projects for which the federal funding commitments have been withdrawn available for all projects competing for New Starts funding.
