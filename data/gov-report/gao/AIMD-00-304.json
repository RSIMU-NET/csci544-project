The vast majority of beneficiaries\u2014about 85 percent\u2014chose to receive their benefits under the traditional fee-for-service program.Although most participating providers comply with Medicare billing rules, the inadvertent errors or intentional misrepresentations that do occur result in overpayments money owed back to Medicare.

In the second session of the 106th Congress, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1827, the Government Waste Corrections Act of 2000, which you sponsored, requiring use of recovery auditing for federal programs that directly purchase goods and services. Because Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service program pays claims to providers and suppliers for goods and services provided to beneficiaries, Medicare is excluded from the bill. Because of your concerns regarding Medicare overpayments, you asked us to answer the following questions: (1) How do HCFA and its contractors identify potential overpayments, and would techniques used by recovery auditors improve overpayment identification? (2) How well do HCFA and its contractors collect overpayments once they are identified, and would the services of recovery auditors improve HCFA\u2019s collection efforts? (3) What challenges would HCFA face if it were required to hire recovery auditors to augment its overpayment identification and collection activities?", "To address these questions, we reviewed HCFA policies and procedures, and examined its current and planned efforts to identify and collect overpayments. We also met with representatives from four HCFA contractors that process and pay claims and take steps to minimize overpayment losses. We discussed with these contractors how they identified and collected Medicare overpayments. We also obtained and analyzed financial reports from HCFA and the four contractors and examined HCFA\u2019s implementation of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). We also met with representatives of several recovery audit firms and several of their clients to determine if the techniques they use might be applicable to Medicare.", "Finally, to determine the implementation challenges HCFA might face if it were to use the services of recovery auditors, we interviewed HCFA officials and contractor, recovery auditor, and medical association representatives. We also reviewed the HHS Office of Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) and our prior work.

Hospital insurance, or Part A, covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, and hospice care, and certain home health services.

Depending on the service, HCFA pays Part A providers based on their costs, or on a prospective payment basis designed to cover the cost of providing a bundle of services related to a particular medical condition. In contrast, Part B providers are typically paid for each individual service, based on a fee schedule. To ensure that only services the statute specifies are covered, Medicare has extensive policies and rules about what constitutes covered services. It is not surprising, therefore, that providers are sometimes overpaid for their services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contractors Pay Claims and Identify and Collect Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["Medicare claims are paid by a network of private health insurance companies hired by HCFA, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Mutual of Omaha, and CIGNA.

In fiscal year 1999, fiscal intermediaries processed about 133 million claims representing $124 billion in payments, while carriers processed about 721 million claims and paid benefits of about $43 billion. Fiscal intermediaries and carriers also perform activities related to safeguarding Medicare payments. These include using prepayment computer edits to prevent potential overpayments, conducting postpayment medical reviews, determining whether other insurers should pay before Medicare, and auditing reports of providers\u2019 costs to determine if any costs are overstated or not allowed by Medicare. HCFA uses specialized contractors to supplement these program safeguard efforts.", "Claims administration contractors have principal responsibility for claims processing and administration. Specifically, they contract with HCFA to (1) receive claims; (2) judge their appropriateness; (3) pay appropriate claims promptly; (4) identify potentially incorrect or fraudulent claims or fraudulent providers, and withhold payment if justified; and (5) identify and recover overpayments. The contractors are expected to manage Medicare\u2019s funds in a fiscally responsible way, effectively address provider and beneficiary inquiries, and establish a process for handling provider and beneficiary appeals of claims decisions.", "Until the HIPAA of 1996 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP), only claims administration contractors performed program safeguard activities. Under HIPAA, HCFA has the authority to enter into contracts with a variety of firms not just insurance companies safeguard-related functions or undertake specific program initiatives to promote Medicare\u2019s integrity. For example, one such initiative is aimed at the early detection of fraudulent and abusive billing in three Midwestern states. Under MIP, HCFA has contracted with 12 firms known as program safeguard contractors (PSCs) that compete among themselves to perform program safeguard work detailed in individual task orders. These MIP contractors can subcontract with other companies that may have special expertise to help them perform particular task orders. As of June 2000, HCFA had issued a total of 10 task orders\u2014each for a defined set of program safeguard services provided over a specified time period.", "In addition to providing HCFA with new contracting authority, HIPAA provided HCFA with predictable increases in program safeguard funding. Before HIPAA, contractor program safeguard activities were funded from contractors\u2019 general program management budgets, which also covered contractors\u2019 costs for processing claims. This meant that program safeguard activities had to compete for funding with other contractor activities that might have higher priority. For example, funding system improvements to ensure that claims were paid promptly might require a shift in funding allocations, as would emergencies or new HCFA initiatives.

In some cases, clients rely exclusively on recovery audit firms to identify and collect overpayments. In other cases, they supplement their own internal capabilities with the services of recovery audit firms. These firms generally focus on overpayment identification but will also collect identified overpayments. Typically, they are paid a contingency fee based on a percentage of the overpayments that they or their clients collect. Fees vary depending on such factors as the type of overpayment involved and the degree of difficulty associated with identifying and collecting it.", "Recovery audit firms employ a variety of techniques to identify overpayments. For example, one firm may use proprietary software to analyze a large database of claims to identify potential overpayments while another may have specially trained staff review medical records for potentially inappropriately billed services.

Correct payment involves several prepayment processing steps to determine whether the claim is for covered, medically necessary and reasonable services; is provided to an eligible beneficiary; and contains a valid provider number. All claims go through a variety of computerized prepayment edits designed to ensure they are correct on their face for example, to ensure that they are not duplicate payments. In addition, many claims go through prepayment medical reviews that are either automated or performed by contractor staff. However, the tremendous volume of Medicare claims processed by each contractor makes it impractical to manually review more than a small fraction of claims prior to payment. For example, in fiscal year 1998, only about 1 in 8 claims were medically reviewed prior to payment and only about 1 in 16 underwent any type of manual prepayment review. As a result, adequate postpayment review is critical to ensuring that overpayments are identified in a timely way."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Identification of Potential Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["In conducting postpayment reviews to identify potential overpayments, contractors primarily focus on three program safeguard activities postpayment medical review, reviews and audits of cost-based reimbursement payments, and MSP reviews. These activities are described below: Postpayment medical review. Overpayments due to claims that are medically unnecessary, insufficiently documented, or for noncovered services and that were not identified through prepayment edits must generally be discovered through contractor postpayment medical review. By reviewing paid claims data, contractors identify patterns that could indicate potential abuse. For example, contractor staff may review billing patterns for certain procedure codes and find unusual increases in utilization over time or significant utilization differences among providers. Once a potential problem is identified, contractors typically sample a provider\u2019s claims and request documentation from the provider for selected claims to determine if they were paid properly or if overpayments occurred.", "Peer review organizations (PROs) are independent physician organizations located in each state that work under contract to HCFA. They conduct postpayment medical review for Medicare claims involving inpatient services.PROs are primarily responsible for ensuring that care provided Medicare beneficiaries is medically necessary, reasonable, is provided in an appropriate setting, and meets professionally accepted standards of quality. If, in the course of their reviews, the PROs discover overpayments, they are supposed to refer the cases to the appropriate fiscal intermediary for payment adjustment.", "Interim rate reviews and cost report audits. These activities are performed by fiscal intermediaries to determine whether the payments made to providers paid on the basis of their costs accurately reflect their allowable costs. Interim rate reviews allow contractors to adjust payment rates during the fiscal year after comparing a provider\u2019s interim payment rates with its previous cost information, its Medicare payments, and its audit history. These reviews may result in revisions to providers\u2019 interim payment rates for the remainder of the year if it is found that the provider was being overpaid or underpaid. Once a provider files its year-end cost report, it is reviewed and may be audited to determine whether there are overpayments or underpayments relating to the costs claimed by the provider.", "MSP reviews. HCFA officials estimate that about 8 percent of beneficiaries have medical claims that are potentially the responsibility of another health insurer, liability insurer, or workers\u2019 compensation program. MSP reviews seek to identify such primary sources of payment and recoup any primary payments made by the Medicare program. HCFA and its contractors use a variety of techniques to find MSP cases. Contractors send a questionnaire to each new beneficiary 3 months prior to their entitlement to Medicare benefits to determine if the beneficiary or spouse is employed and has group health insurance coverage. Medicare beneficiary information is also matched periodically with Social Security Administration (SSA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on employment status and earnings. If beneficiaries are identified as employed and earning less than $10,000 per year, contractors may elect not to send questionnaires to employers asking about the beneficiary\u2019s employment and health insurance coverage. In addition, some private insurance companies have agreed (voluntarily or as part of a legal settlement with HCFA) to share information on their policyholders. Finally, if a claim is submitted with certain diagnosis codes indicating traumatic or work- related injury, contractors automatically send the beneficiary a letter requesting information about a potential lawsuit, automobile liability insurance, or workers\u2019 compensation coverage. In a recent report, the HHS OIG took steps to identify beneficiaries who had other primary sources of coverage and concluded that HCFA\u2019s current MSP questionnaire and data match activities successfully identified most of the beneficiaries with other coverage that the OIG was able to identify. However, it estimated that $56 million had been paid out improperly in 1997 to certain beneficiaries who had other insurance that had not been identified by HCFA\u2019s questionnaire and data match activities.", "HCFA has contracted with a coordination-of-benefits contractor under MIP to consolidate and improve many of the MSP functions currently performed by the claims administration contractors. In addition, several claims administration contractors have taken lead roles in identifying potential MSP recoveries from nationwide class action lawsuits, such as the product liability case involving breast implants.", "Providers themselves are a major source of information on overpayments. Most providers make an honest effort to bill Medicare correctly, but when errors are discovered through their own internal reviews, our work showed that many providers notify their contractor.

While the HHS OIG estimates improper payments at the national level, the sample size does not allow HCFA to draw conclusions on contractor-specific performance. The OIG\u2019s analysis also does not take into account that an overpayment may have been identified and recovered by the contractor during its postpayment review activities.", "HCFA is developing the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing program to better evaluate individual contractor performance. When this program is implemented, an independent firm will periodically review a random sample of claims to determine if the contractors\u2019 payment decisions were appropriate. HCFA officials expect that this program will enable the agency to develop error rates specific to each contractor and for different types of benefits and providers. While the program will provide HCFA with additional data on contractor overpayment error rates, it is being designed as a management tool to identify problem areas. It will not identify specific claims beyond claims in the sample that were paid in error during the covered time period. The program will be implemented this fiscal year, beginning with the contractors that process and pay claims for durable medical equipment and supplies, and will include all claims administration contractors by the end of fiscal year 2002.

The recovery auditing techniques most applicable to the Medicare program data mining, diagnosis-related group (DRG) validation, cost report audits, and third-party liability reviewsare part of current postpayment review activities. HCFA\u2019s decision to concentrate its program safeguard resources on prepayment, rather than postpayment, activities in recent years is justified given the cost-effectiveness of error prevention. However, the result is that postpayment review activities have been reduced for some types of claims: only about 565,000 claims were subject to postpayment medical review in fiscal year 1998, compared to approximately 960,000 claims in fiscal year 1995 a drop of over 40 percent. HCFA may be missing opportunities to identify significant overpayments through postpayment activities. However, any increase in these efforts would likely require additional program safeguard funding to ensure that prepayment reviews are not decreased.", "Investment in evaluation of the most cost-effective postpayment review activities for identifying overpayments would be worthwhile.

HCFA\u2019s claims administration contractors currently use data mining and statistical analysis as part of their postpayment review activities. Since 1993, HCFA also has contracted with a specialized statistical analysis contractor to perform large-scale analysis of durable medical equipment claims. Data mining can identify many potentially inappropriate payments, but determining which ones are actual overpayments takes additional investigation. Currently, the contractors only have the resources to investigate situations in which the data indicate potential large-scale abusive practices.", "Several of HCFA\u2019s program safeguard contractors also specialize in data mining and the manipulation of large data sets.

Another program safeguard contractor is conducting data mining activities to support development of medical policies and the early detection of fraudulent and abusive billing in three Midwestern states.", "Recovery auditors also use data mining to identify overpayments for their clients. For example, in 1999 a recovery auditor under contract with a state Medicaid program subjected 3 years of paid claims to its data mining edits and identified $52 million in overpayments. These overpayments were approved for collection by an independent state review board.

Some recovery auditors validate DRGs for their clients, such as private insurers who have adopted Medicare\u2019s DRG coding system for inpatient claims. According to the representatives of one PRO, while DRG validation was an area of emphasis for PROs in the 1980s and early 1990s, this activity was not a high priority in recent years for the PROs. The PROs, rather than the claims administration contractors, review hospital inpatient DRG-based claims.", "DRG validation involves verification that a provider classified a patient within the DRG code that accurately reflects the patient\u2019s condition as described in the discharge information. According to recovery auditors, bills are sometimes miscoded because providers base their codes on the patient\u2019s medical complaints, rather than on the physician\u2019s diagnosis. DRG validation should be based on a patient\u2019s principal diagnosis and procedure code information contained in the medical record. The validation is done by staff who have been trained in applying medical coding terminology to medical records information; clinical judgment is not necessarily required. HCFA\u2019s Payment Error Prevention Program, which all PROs must undertake, recently has increased the priority they must give to reviewing hospital claims for billing accuracy as well as quality of care.However, two contractors we visited reported that they rarely, if ever, receive reports from the PROs on overpayments that the PROs have identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Review of Provider Cost Information Could Benefit Medicare", "paragraphs": ["Review of provider cost report financial information is a cost-effective way to identify overpayments. In 1999, cost report reviews and audits of providers not covered by a prospective payment system resulted in disallowing $2.7 billion, or about 10 percent of the total costs claimed by providers. However, as prospective payment systems replace cost-based reimbursement, fewer overpayments of this type will occur.We found that the two intermediaries we visited use cost report audits and rate reviews as the primary means of identifying overpayments for Part A providers. One contractor representative estimated a return of $13 saved for every dollar spent conducting the audits. Although the number of cost reports audited between 1995 and 1998 has increased, a large percentage of cost reports are still never audited by HCFA\u2019s contractors. For example, in fiscal year 2000, HCFA expects contractors to audit only about 12 percent of the cost reports submitted by home health agencies and 25 percent of those submitted by single-facility hospitals. It can take up to 2 years after the end of the provider\u2019s fiscal year to reach a final settlement on the provider\u2019s costs that are allowable by Medicare. So, even though HCFA is changing its payment methods, cost report audits and rate reviews will continue to be important program safeguards for several years. HCFA\u2019s financial auditors estimated that if all cost reports submitted by providers not under prospective payment had been fully audited, HCFA might have been able to identify an additional $600 million in fiscal year 1999 overpayments.", "It is not necessary to perform a complete audit to identify overpayments. For example, contractors can conduct focused reviews that examine only certain aspects of the cost report. HCFA has encouraged intermediaries to concentrate on these focused reviews. This allows the intermediaries to stretch their audit resources by concentrating on areas yielding the most return, and increases the number of providers whose records are reviewed.", "Some fiscal intermediaries have contracted with private firms to augment their cost report audit efforts, albeit with mixed results.

GAO has long recognized that private insurance companies and employers are in the best position to routinely identify policyholders and employees who might be eligible for Medicare. Some recovery auditors have developed proprietary databases that contain insurance company enrollment information and other data that could potentially help Medicare identify beneficiaries with other health insurance. However, HCFA might not be able to access this information if the insurance companies involved were unwilling to share beneficiary data.", "One recovery audit firm we spoke with that specializes in third-party liability performs its work for 20 state Medicaid agencies.

Information on employment is reported to IRS after the fact. IRS must then prepare the employment information, which is made available for matching with Medicare beneficiary data. Contractors then confirm it by querying employers. As a result, even with current data match activities, Medicare can have paid for claims long before another liable insurer is identified. Even more time will pass before any funds can be recouped.", "Commercial insurers share information with each other on their beneficiaries to determine which beneficiaries have more than one source of insurance. It is advantageous for companies to share this information because, for some beneficiaries, an insurer will be the secondary payer. If firms do not try to coordinate their benefit payments, they may both pay as the primary payer.", "Better access to health insurers\u2019 beneficiary data could help HCFA identify MSP cases by providing more current data. However, because Medicare is generally the secondary payer to other insurers, it may not be to other insurers\u2019 advantage to share beneficiary data with HCFA. At present, insurers are under no obligation to inform HCFA that some of their policyholders are Medicare beneficiaries unless there is a court settlement requiring such data sharing. HCFA has had to pursue certain insurance companies\u2014some with related corporations that are Medicare contractors\u2014in federal civil court for refusing to pay before Medicare when the government contends that Medicare should have been the secondary payer. From 1995 to 1999, HCFA reached settlements that totaled almost $66 million in cases in which a related company was a Medicare carrier or intermediary, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Transamerica, and Travelers. As a result of these legal settlements, some major insurers have agreed to share data, but some of these settlements are about to expire. While insurers can voluntarily share data on their policyholders with HCFA, few have opted to participate, thereby reducing HCFA\u2019s ability to identify claims that are the responsibility of another insurer.", "If private insurers were required to share information on their policyholders, HCFA could more easily determine which Medicare beneficiaries had other health insurance. In the late 1980s, HCFA proposed but did not obtain legislation granting it access to private insurers\u2019 policyholder data. Insurer reporting provisions were included in the President\u2019s budget proposals for both fiscal years 2000 and 2001, but these provisions were not accepted by the Congress.

As it has sought to run the program economically, HCFA has been left with fewer and fewer dollars to pay for administering a program that has grown in volume and whose management involves increasingly complex tasks. The Congress has recognized the importance of ensuring that Medicare have adequate program safeguards in place and has developed an assured funding stream for these activities through MIP. For fiscal year 2000, $630 million was appropriated for MIP. The amounts appropriated will grow until fiscal year 2003, when funding will reach $720 million.", "However, funding dedicated to program safeguards in fiscal year 2000 is still about one-third less (on a per-claim basis) than it was in 1989. Based on estimates of the growth of trust fund expenditures, our analysis indicates that MIP funding, as a percentage of program dollars, will be less in 2003 than it is today. It will still represent little more than one-quarter of 1 percent of Medicare program expenditures.", "With this funding, HCFA and its contractors carry out a range of program safeguard activities, with an emphasis on prepayment reviews designed to prevent overpayments. If HCFA were to increase its overpayment identification activities, it likely would have to do it by curtailing other types of program safeguard activities, such as these prepayment reviews. HCFA has estimated significant returns from both its prepayment and postpayment MIP activities. While it is difficult to isolate the dollar savings attributable to a single year\u2019s funding, based on HCFA estimates for fiscal year 1999, MIP saved the Medicare program more than $17 for each dollar spent\u2014about 55 percent from prepayment activities and the rest from postpayment activities.", "Additional investment seems likely to yield additional positive returns. However, it is important that both current funding and any additional investment be spent as effectively as possible. In addition, investments in these activities should not be expanded beyond levels likely to yield positive returns. Additional information on the relative effectiveness of these activities could help guide HCFA in its allocation of funds, but precisely measuring the effect of MIP funding efforts is difficult. Savings realized today may result from activities begun several years ago. For example, postpayment activities such as medical review can be used to identify program vulnerabilities that can be addressed in the future through automated prepayment edits and manual reviews. Therefore, while their immediate return on investment can be relatively low, such postpayment activities may lead to future prepayment savings.", "Reliable information on the relative value of specific program safeguards could help HCFA target its program integrity efforts. However, at present, HCFA lacks the detailed data that can provide the best estimates of returns from specific program safeguard activities. For example, HCFA does not have information on whether automated or manual prepayment medical reviews generate the most savings. Similarly, HCFA does not know which contractors are realizing the highest return on investment from their program safeguard activities. To remedy this information gap, HCFA will implement a new Program Integrity Management Reporting system for carriers and intermediaries in fiscal year 2001. This system will be used to collect information that HCFA expects will allow it to report savings and provide details by contractor, program activity, and provider type. The system will generate monthly reports, which should allow HCFA to more closely monitor and direct their program integrity activities. HCFA plans to audit the information input into the system to verify its accuracy."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "HCFA Needs to Improve Its Collection of Overpayments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Large Percentage of Receivables Are Collected but Billions Remain Delinquent", "paragraphs": ["The results of our analysis of HCFA\u2019s accounts receivable, shown in tables 1 and 2, indicate that the amount of Medicare\u2019s identified overpayments collected increased between fiscal years 1998 and 1999, both in total and separately for parts A and B. Specifically, collections rose from $7.5 billion a 16 percent increase. in fiscal year 1998 to $8.7 billion in fiscal year 1999 At the same time, however, the value of the new accounts receivable identified increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion over the 2 years, or by 25 percent. The difference between the collection and overpayment identification rates resulted in a fiscal year 1999 ending accounts receivable balance of $7.3 billion, as over $3 billion of uncollectable accounts receivable were written off by HCFA under a special initiative to remove old debt from HCFA\u2019s accounts receivable. Further, although not shown in the table, a large percentage of the ending accounts receivable balance each year was more than 6 months delinquent\u201440 percent in fiscal year 1998 and 45 percent in fiscal year 1999.HCFA\u2019s claims administration contractors are responsible for nearly all of the collections.", "Contractors are generally able to collect many overpayments immediately, by offsetting them against current payments due. However, contractors\u2019 ability to collect Medicare overpayments is affected by a number of different factors, including the type of overpayment, the promptness with which the overpayment was identified, and whether the provider is still in business and participating in Medicare. These factors are discussed below.", "Type of overpayment. We found that contractors were much more successful in collecting overpayments identified in cost report audits and medical reviews than those identified through MSP activities. In fiscal year 1998, for example, less than 10 percent of MSP receivables nationally were collected, versus about 62 percent of non-MSP receivables. This low rate of MSP collections is not surprising for several reasons. First, contractors are only required to send one demand letter to the responsible party requesting payment of MSP overpayments, whereas up to three demand letters are sent on other types of receivables. Second, other insurers often dispute that they are responsible for payment. Third, MSP collection rates are also affected by potential conflict of interest or lack of diligence: the claims administration contractors may themselves be responsible for payment and may not be quick to collect on those receivables. For example, in 1999, HCFA hired a private accounting firm to review Medicare accounts receivable at 15 contractors. At one contractor, the firm identified 91 MSP overpayments more than 6 months old totaling $290,000 that the contractor\u2019s private operations owed Medicare but had not yet repaid.", "Prompt collection of overpayments and provider participation in Medicare. Contractors have not always followed procedures that require prompt efforts to collect overpayments they identify. This affects their ability to collect what becomes aging debt. For example, home health agencies (HHA) are required to submit annual reports of their Medicare costs to the fiscal intermediaries. All cost reports then go through a settlement process that may identify overpayments.At one contractor, we identified several cases in which the contractor did not conduct timely cost report settlements. The contractor was 2 years late in settling one HHA\u2019s cost report and, in another case, a cost report settlement that should have occurred in 1996 did not take place until late 1999. Collections are even more difficult when providers terminate their Medicare participation. For example, in a recent GAO report regarding overpayments due from 15 HHAs in Texas that closed between October 1997 and July 1999, we found that HCFA had collected $5.3 million, or about 7 percent of the $73 million due from the closed agencies.", "Legal proceedings. When a provider has filed for bankruptcy, the contractor\u2019s collection activities are subject to review and approval of the bankruptcy court. Whether any of the bankrupt provider\u2019s Medicare overpayments are eventually collected depends on the results of the bankruptcy proceedings. Contractors\u2019 collection abilities are also affected when providers who owe the program money are under investigation by the HHS OIG or involved in litigation with the Department of Justice. In such cases, contractors must suspend their collection efforts until resolution occurs. A substantial amount of overpayments cannot be collected because the debtors are involved in bankruptcy proceedings or litigation. According to HCFA, $845 million in overpayments cannot be collected because they are protected under bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, $147 million cannot be collected because of litigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA\u2019s Success in Collecting Delinquent Debt Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Debt that the contractors cannot collect is referred to HCFA for collection. However, we found that contractors do not always refer debt in a timely way. Even when debt is referred appropriately, we found that the age and type of debt HCFA receives makes it difficult to collect. In addition, HCFA\u2019s recording and tracking systems are unreliable, further complicating collection efforts.", "HCFA\u2019s low rate of collection for transferred debt is attributed in large part to the age and type of debt HCFA receives. HCFA regional office staff informed us that this debt is difficult to collect due to such factors as provider bankruptcy or closure. In addition, it is generally recognized by HCFA and contractor representatives that the longer an overpayment is outstanding, the less likely it is that it will be collected. At one of the intermediaries in our study, accounts receivable transferred to HCFA in fiscal year 1998 totaled $59.8 million; of that amount, HCFA collected $2.1 million as of June 2000\u2014a 3.5 percent collection rate.", "When contractors are unable to offset payment or otherwise recover an overpayment from a provider, they are supposed to refer the receivable to their respective HCFA regional offices for review. If regional office staff find that the contractor has taken all appropriate collection actions, the contractor may transfer the receivable to HCFA, which then assumes responsibility for collection through its regional offices. We found that contractors were not always referring receivables appropriately to HCFA regional offices, thus preventing it from initiating its own collection activities.", "Although contractors are supposed to refer uncollected debt to HCFA according to time frames set out by HCFA\u2019s regional offices, we found that this does not always happen. For example, one contractor we visited told us that referring receivables to its HCFA regional office was a relatively low priority because of the unlikelihood that HCFA would be able to collect them. As a result of untimely referral, the chances that HCFA could collect the debt are substantially reduced because the debt becomes increasingly delinquent.", "Another problem related to contractor referrals is inconsistent regional office guidance to contractors. We found that in one HCFA region, contractors were asked to refer receivables less than $1,000 to be written off.At another region, the referral threshold was $50 and the region made the decision whether to write off the debt or pursue collection. Within HCFA, only the regional offices have the authority to authorize the writeoff of government debt. They are allowed to exercise this authority consistent with their judgment regarding the cost-effectiveness and potential for recovery of these debts.", "Finally, we found that the various systems HCFA regional offices used to track and report transferred receivables were neither consistent nor reliable. For example, one region provided us with current information on the status of each receivable; however, because many of the overpayments did not exceed $600, they were not included in HCFA\u2019s automated tracking system and, as a result, the information had to be compiled for us manually. Another region generated detailed computer data for its Part A receivables, including information on outstanding balances, collection activities, and notes about their collection status. However, this same region could not provide any information on the status of Part B accounts receivable due to problems with its computer files. Because of problems like these, HCFA does not have reliable data on how well it collects debt transferred to it by contractors.", "Ineffective tracking and reporting systems may also result in receivables being recorded in error. For example, in our report on the identification and collection of overpayments from closed HHAs, we noted that a contractor made a $76.9 million keypunch error when entering overpayment information into one of HCFA\u2019s central overpayment recording systems. Further, we noted that ineffective management of Medicare accounts receivable was found to be a consistent problem in HCFA\u2019s financial statement audits for fiscal years 1996 through 1999.The fiscal year 1998 audit, for example, disclosed deficiencies in nearly all aspects of HCFA\u2019s accounts receivable activity including the lack of an integrated financial management system to track overpayments and their collections, as well as inadequate procedures for ensuring that receivables were valid. HCFA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 financial statement audit report noted that despite significant improvements, controls over accounts receivable continued to be a material weakness.HCFA has plans to replace its fragmented accounts receivable tracking and reporting systems with a single integrated one, but this will not be implemented until September 2001 at the earliest. In March 2000, we made a number of recommendations to the HCFA Administrator to improve financial management and accountability of the Medicare program, including that HCFA develop a comprehensive financial management improvement strategy.", "HCFA agreed with our recommendations and committed itself to aggressively address shortcomings in its financial management of Medicare. For example, in an effort to clean up its financial records in preparation for its fiscal year 1999 financial statement audit, HCFA initiated a one-time project to write down its oldest delinquent receivables. This effort resulted in HCFA\u2019s and its contractors\u2019 writing off delinquent receivables that were at least 6 years old. Over $3 billion was written off by HCFA and its contractors in fiscal year 1999. Receivables less than 6 years old, however, remain on the financial records; whether they are collectable remains in question."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA Slow to Implement DCIA", "paragraphs": ["DCIA mandates that HCFA and other federal agencies refer all eligible debt over 180 days delinquent to the Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for collection activities. In 1999, Treasury granted a waiver for HHS to continue to service certain debts including MSP debt and debt related to unfiled cost reports and to be designated as a debt collection center for that purpose.Within HHS, the Program Support Center is the Treasury-designated debt collection center.As such, it is responsible for attempting to collect referred debt related to MSP or unfiled cost reports, and for referring all other types of Medicare debt to the Treasury for collection. At Treasury, collection can be attempted through Treasury\u2019s offset program and various other debt collection tools, such as referral to private collection agencies.Although the act is now over 4 years old, HCFA has not fully implemented DCIA and will not be referring all eligible receivables until the end of fiscal year 2002, at the earliest, because of the work involved in certifying that the debt amount is correct and still outstanding.", "To improve management of its accounts receivable, HCFA analyzed its debt, performed a one-time writeoff of very old debt, and established two pilot projects to refer eligible debt to the Program Support Center. To address the issue of aging receivables, HCFA wrote off all debt that it determined could not be offset and that was more than 6 years old, and referred the remainder of the 6-year-old (or older) debt to the Program Support Center for collection. This was done in preparation for its annual financial statement audit.", "As mentioned earlier, HCFA\u2019s objective for its two pilot projects was to develop a process for contractors to expedite the transfer of eligible Part A debt to the Program Support Center. HCFA concentrated its pilots on older, high-value Part A debt rather than newly eligible delinquent debt. One pilot deals with MSP debt valued at more than $5,000 or more and is up to 6 years old, while the other pilot deals with non-MSP debt, primarily related to cost report audits, of $100,000 or more. Under the pilots, contractors record eligible delinquent debt in a HCFA central office database that is used to transmit the debt to the Program Support Center for collection. Before they refer this debt to the Program Support Center, contractors must validate it by reviewing records and ensuring that the debt is still uncollected and that the debt balance is correct. Validation is necessary because HCFA\u2019s systems for recording and tracking overpayments are unreliable. In addition, contractors must seek to collect the receivable by issuing a demand letter that indicates that nonpayment will result in referral to the Program Support Center.", "HCFA plans to expand its non-MSP pilot to all of its intermediaries and carriers by October 2000; the time frame for expanding the other pilot is uncertain. However, even under its planned efforts, certain types of eligible debt will be excluded. For example, HCFA has established a $600 threshold for transferring non-MSP debt and tentatively plans to continue with its $5,000 threshold for MSP debt, even though the Program Support Center will accept any eligible debt over $25. This leaves a large amount of almost half of all Part B delinquent debt, for example with no avenue for collection beyond the contractors\u2019 current techniques. This also means that delinquent debt newly eligible for transfer below these thresholds will not qualify for referral. HCFA officials told us that they selected the $600 and $5,000 thresholds in part because they do not have the resources necessary to validate the large volume of aged, delinquent debt below these amounts. However, collection industry statistics as well as Treasury\u2019s collection experience to date have shown that collection rates are generally higher on debts with smaller dollar balances and debts that are less delinquent.", "The Program Support Center and Treasury use many standard collection techniques in their debt recovery efforts, such as attempting to locate debtors that have ceased operations, issuing demand letters, and reporting information to credit bureaus. They also refer debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, and to Treasury\u2019s offset program, where certain federal agency payments can be offset to satisfy claims. To assist them, both the Program Support Center and Treasury contract with private collection agencies that are paid contingency fees for their collection efforts. For example, for their collection services, the Program Support Center retains 15 percent of the amount collected and the remainder is returned to the Medicare Trust Funds. HCFA is not charged for debt that has been transferred but cannot be collected.", "It is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of Treasury and the Program Support Center in collecting Medicare debt transferred to them.

For providers still in the Medicare program, claims administration contractors can simply withhold funds from future payments. Other collections by both the contractors and recovery auditors depend on the debtor\u2019s sending a check.

Recovery auditors are typically paid a contingency fee by private-sector clients, based on a percentage of the identified overpayments collected. One of the advantages of using recovery auditing services on a contingency fee basis is that additional appropriations are not needed to pay these organizations because the payment comes out of recoveries. However, HCFA and medical associations believe that providers view contingency fees as a \u201cbounty\u201d system that can damage the constructive partnership between Medicare and its providers. The contingency fee is a strong incentive to identify and collect overpayments and may lead to inappropriate identification and collection efforts by recovery auditors. A HCFA official noted that providers have raised a similar concern about the very modest reward available under HIPAA to beneficiaries who uncover fraud.", "Instead of paying recovery auditors on a contingency fee basis, HCFA could compensate them in ways similar to the ways it pays PSCs, including firm- fixed-price or cost-plus-award-fee contracts. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a predetermined payment to the contractor. Payments are not subject to adjustment based on the contractor\u2019s costs; in fact, there are strong incentives for the contractor to control costs. A cost-plus-award-fee contract provides for reimbursement of actual costs and can include incentives for efficiency or performance. HCFA is using each type of contract in its PSC task orders.

They also expressed concern that the claims administration contractors would need to divert staff from their normal activities to provide recovery audit staff with information about the claims administration contractors\u2019 operations, including local medical policies that define the conditions under which the contractor will pay for certain services. Recovery auditors would need to understand the local medical policies when making determinations on whether the claims were paid properly.

Representatives from one recovery auditing organization noted that initial identification of physician overpayments often involves computer analysis of claims data, not a review of medical records.

With its recent emphasis on prepayment review, HCFA is justifiably spending much of its limited program safeguard funds on identifying erroneous or improper claims before they are paid. However, thousands of these claims are paid nonetheless, and if not identified during postpayment reviews, they ultimately are lost in a program that can ill afford the financial drain on the trust funds. In an effort to tackle its outstanding overpayment problem, some have suggested that HCFA use the services of recovery auditors to supplement its program integrity activities.", "We attempted to identify any techniques or tools used by recovery auditors that could also benefit HCFA. While recovery audit firms we met with have achieved results on behalf of their private insurance and Medicaid clients, their techniques are similar to HCFA\u2019s current postpayment tools. That is not to say that Medicare could not benefit from a stronger focus on postpayment activities to identify additional overpayments. While we believe that HCFA\u2019s effort to balance prepayment and postpayment activities is sound, more could be done to safeguard Medicare if additional resources were available.", "Since its enactment, HIPAA has provided HCFA with increased and assured funding for program safeguards, but funding is still less than what was available in 1989 on a per-claim basis. While this funding is due to increase in the next several years, it will only keep pace with expected growth in program expenditures and amounts to little more than one-quarter of 1 percent of program expenditures. According to HCFA estimates, more than $17 is saved for every $1 invested in safeguarding Medicare through MIP. We believe that HCFA must target any new resources to the activities most likely to result in the greatest payoff. We understand that HCFA is developing a process to determine the return on its prepayment and postpayment activities broken down by contractor and activity which, when completed, should give it greater ability to perform this targeting.", "For its MSP activities, HCFA could more effectively identify beneficiaries who have other primary insurance coverage if insurers were required to share information on their enrollees. HCFA has had difficulty gaining insurers\u2019 cooperation and has had to sue a number of them to enforce MSP requirements. If insurers were required to share enrollee information with HCFA, HCFA could match more current data, and in a more efficient manner, than its present data matches. However, such a step would require congressional action.", "In regard to collecting overpayments once they have been identified, we found that HCFA\u2019s claims administration contractors do a fairly good job when providers\u2019 current payments can be offset to collect previous overpayments. However, HCFA\u2019s delinquent receivables are a continuing problem. The longer debt ages, the more difficult it is to collect. HCFA\u2019s practice of offsetting overpayments with future payments gives it leverage that accounts for much of its collection success, but this option is typically not available on older debt, because the provider may no longer be in business, be participating in Medicare, or even be located.", "We believe HCFA could collect more of its older debt if it fully implemented the DCIA. HCFA is not transferring all its eligible debt to HHS\u2019 Program Support Center in a timely manner. Under its two pilot projects, HCFA is focusing on transferring some Part A debt of significant value that may be as old as 6 years; its plans to expand the pilots to all contractors will still exclude debt that falls below HCFA\u2019s minimum thresholds. While in some cases the cost of validating debt may exceed the amount collected, this may be more applicable to very old debt that requires more extensive validation efforts than to newly eligible debt. It does not seem reasonable to wait until the end of fiscal year 2002 at the earliest to transfer all eligible debt, as HCFA plans. Rather, transferring delinquent debt as soon as it becomes eligible could result in a greater payback to Medicare; the sooner it is transferred, the more likely that Treasury or the Program Support Center will be able to collect.
