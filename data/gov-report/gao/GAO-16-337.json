The rates declined from an estimated 9.8 cases per 100 full-time workers in 2004 to 5.7 in 2013. However, these rates continued to be higher than rates for manufacturing overall. Meat workers sustained a higher estimated rate of injuries and illnesses than poultry workers, according to DOL data. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluations and academic studies have found that workers continue to face the hazardous conditions GAO cited in 2005, including tasks associated with musculoskeletal disorders, exposure to chemicals and pathogens, and traumatic injuries from machines and tools.", "DOL faces challenges gathering data on injury and illness rates for meat and poultry workers because of underreporting and inadequate data collection. For example, workers may underreport injuries and illnesses because they fear losing their jobs, and employers may underreport because of concerns about potential costs. Another data gathering challenge is that DOL only collects detailed data for those injuries and illnesses that result in a worker having to take days away from work. These detailed data do not include injuries and illnesses such as musculoskeletal disorders that result in a worker being placed on work restriction or transferred to another job. Further, DOL does not have complete injury and illness data on meat and poultry sanitation workers because they may not be classified in the meat and poultry industry if they work for contractors. Federal internal control standards require agencies to track data to help them make decisions and meet their goals. These limitations in DOL's data collection raise questions about whether the federal government is doing all it can to collect the data it needs to support worker protection and workplace safety."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that DOL improve its data on musculoskeletal disorders and sanitation workers in the meat and poultry industry.

Typically,  the animal is brought to the meat or poultry plant and taken to the kill floor  area, where the slaughter occurs. Workers and machines behead and  eviscerate the animal, among other things, after which it is chilled for  several hours. FSIS inspectors ensure that the carcass meets federal  food safety standards. Workers and machines next process the carcass  and may break it into small portions that can be transported directly to  supermarkets. Slaughter and processing of meat and poultry require  workers to perform a high number of repetitive motions.

To supplement its  enforcement efforts, OSHA offers cooperative programs to help  employers prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities in the workplace.  OSHA conducts inspections in response to imminent danger, fatalities,  catastrophic events such as hospitalizations, and worker complaints, and  also selects worksites for programmed inspections based on injury  incidence rates, previous citation history, or random selection. OSHA is  directly responsible for setting and enforcing these standards for private  sector employers, including meat and poultry plants, in 29 states, the  District of Columbia, and 4 U.S. territories. The remaining 21 states and  1 territory have assumed responsibility for workplace safety and health  under an OSHA-approved state plan. These \u201cstate-plan states\u201d adopt and  enforce their own standards (which must be \u201cat least as effective\u201d in  providing safe and healthful employment as the federal standards).", "The OSH Act and OSHA\u2019s regulations require covered employers to  prepare and maintain records of certain injuries and illnesses sustained  by their workers. Specifically, non-exempt employers are required to  record information about every work-related death and each new work- related injury or illness that results in loss of consciousness, days away  from work, restricted work or transfer to another job, or medical treatment  beyond first aid. OSHA has established three different forms for  employers to record injuries and illnesses: the Form 300 Log of Work- Related Injuries and Illnesses (log), the Form 301 Injury and Illness  Incident Report (incident report), and the Form 300-A Summary of Work- Related Injuries and Illnesses. For each recordable injury or illness, the  employer must record specified information on the log, including the  worker\u2019s name, job title, date of injury or illness, a brief description of the  injury or illness, and, if applicable, the number of days the worker was  away from work, assigned to restricted duties, or assigned to another job  as a result of the injury or illness. Employers must also classify the injury  or illness according to categories provided on the OSHA log. These  categories include injury, skin disorder, respiratory condition, poisoning,  hearing loss, and \u201call other illnesses.\u201d In addition to the log, for each case  employers must prepare an incident report, which includes descriptive  information about the case, including details about the injury or illness,  how it occurred, and the treatment provided. Finally, employers are also  required to prepare a summary of all injuries and illnesses annually,  which is to be posted at the workplace. Although these three forms are  not routinely provided to OSHA, they must be kept for 5 years and  provided upon request in certain circumstances, such as during an OSHA  inspection or in response to BLS\u2019s SOII. In addition, all covered  employers, including those exempt from the routine recordkeeping  requirements, must report all work-related fatalities to OSHA within 8  hours and all work-related in-patient hospitalizations, amputations, or  losses of an eye within 24 hours.", "With respect to federal employers, such as USDA, each federal agency is  generally required to establish and maintain a comprehensive and  effective occupational safety and health program that is consistent with  OSHA\u2019s standards.

In calendar year 2013, there were an  estimated 159.3 cases per 10,000 full-time meat and poultry workers,  compared to an estimated 35.9 cases for manufacturing overall. To  better understand illness rates, OSHA classifies total recordable cases of  illnesses into five categories, such as skin diseases and respiratory  conditions, which BLS reports per 10,000 workers. In the meat and  poultry industry, illnesses accounted for over one-fourth of all reported  injury and illness cases in calendar year 2013. According to BLS\u2019s  website, working conditions can be difficult in the meat and poultry  industry because workers are exposed to hazards that may lead to an  injury or an illness.

USDA inspectors at plants we visited told us injuries  and illnesses among inspectors vary, depending on whether they work in  a meat or poultry plant. Specifically, inspectors told us that compared to  inspectors in poultry plants, inspectors in meat plants sustain more cuts  or lacerations because they make several cuts during hog and cattle  inspections, while poultry inspections generally do not require any cuts to  animal carcasses.

Similarly, in a 2014 health hazard evaluation of a poultry plant, NIOSH  found 41 percent of participants worked in jobs that had levels of hand  activity and force above the American Conference of Governmental  Industrial Hygienists threshold limit values. In a 2008 NIOSH health  hazard evaluation of a turkey plant, NIOSH found that hanging and  unloading racks of turkey franks (hot dogs) during processing increased  the risk of musculoskeletal disorders due to awkward postures, repetitive  motions, and heavy lifting. According to the evaluation, in raw and  cooked production, workers hung and removed franks from racks on 50- inch metal rods weighing up to 38 pounds, and reported discomfort in  their backs and shoulders. NIOSH\u2019s recommendations included job  redesign and job rotation from lifting to non-lifting tasks to alleviate these  hazards.

Workers told  us new hires receive video training on hazards and personal  protective equipment, and acknowledge receipt of this training by  signing an attestation document. Some meat and poultry workers told  us the training is not always adequate. A hog plant worker said  supplementary training should be provided on the job and at slower  line speeds to ensure workers know how to do their jobs properly.  One study we reviewed found that when workers in Nebraska and  Iowa hog plants used an alternative method to accomplish a task,  such as using different equipment, or performed a task in a different  location within the plant, it was associated with increased risk of  lacerations. The authors recommended expanded training and  evaluation of tool sharpening procedures.", "Line speed: High line speeds resulting from increased automation and  other factors may exacerbate hazards, according to plant workers and  worker advocacy groups. In 2013, 15 stakeholder groups petitioned  OSHA and USDA, asking OSHA to establish a \u201cwork-speed\u201d  workplace safety and health standard\u2014a regulation that would set the  number of animals or products processed per minute on a production  line in relation to staffing levels\u2014to protect workers in the meat and  poultry industry. The petition also requested that USDA and OSHA  ensure that worker safety be protected in any rulemaking related to  line and work speeds in this industry. USDA acknowledged receipt of  the petition in 2013 and officials told us the agency made several  changes to the poultry inspection final rule that addressed some of the  issues in the petition, namely not increasing the maximum  evisceration line speed in young chicken plants. In 2015, OSHA  denied the petition and cited limited resources as its reason for not  conducting a comprehensive analysis and rulemaking. Plant  workers told us that meat and poultry plants are primarily concerned  with production, and employers do not want the line to slow down  even when the plant is understaffed. Industry officials we met with  disagreed. According to representatives of a meat industry trade  association, staffing is typically increased when line speed increases,  and it is important to staff the line so that plant workers and USDA  inspectors can accomplish all work tasks effectively. According to  NIOSH officials, increasing line speed and workers may increase the  risk of \u201cneighbor cuts\u201d due to workers\u2019 close proximity. OSHA and  NIOSH officials told us line speed\u2014in conjunction with hand activity,  forceful exertions, awkward postures, cold temperatures, and other  factors such as rotation participation and pattern\u2014affects the risk of  both musculoskeletal disorders and injuries among workers. NIOSH  examined the effect of increased evisceration line speed on worker  safety at one plant in a 2014 health hazard evaluation, but the agency  could not draw conclusions about its impact. Specifically, NIOSH  stated in a 2014 letter to USDA that it could not draw conclusions on  line speed and safety because the amount of time between the first  and second visits (10 months) was not sufficient for a change in  workers\u2019 health to appear and the manner in which the plant modified  the production lines resulted in no change in exposure to risk factors  for musculoskeletal disorders for any individual worker, among other  things. NIOSH stated that the plant\u2019s consolidated evisceration lines  resulted in a reduction of the number of birds processed because the  plant combined two separate lines at 90 birds per minute into one line  operating at approximately 170 birds per minute. In a 2015 health  hazard evaluation, NIOSH found hand activity and force above  recommended levels, as noted above, and after the evaluation the  plant automated several jobs; however, the agency concluded that  musculoskeletal disorder risks remain for many workers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOL Faces Challenges Gathering Data on Injury and Illness Rates Because of Industry Characteristics and Inadequate Data Collection", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Meat and Poultry Worker Vulnerability and Employer Practices May Contribute to Underreporting of Injuries and Illnesses", "paragraphs": ["Workers and employers may underreport injuries and illnesses in the  meat and poultry industry because of worker concerns over potential loss  of employment, and employer concerns over potential costs associated  with injuries and illnesses, according to federal officials, worker advocacy  groups, and studies. As a result, the injury and illness rates discussed in  the previous section may not reflect complete data. In 2009, we reported  on concerns about underreporting across all industries, including  discrepancies between BLS\u2019s annual survey used to calculate injury and  illness rates and other data such as medical records. Due to concerns  about reporting and also in response to findings and recommendations  from our work in 2005 and 2009, OSHA undertook its Injury and Illness  Recordkeeping National Emphasis Program. For this program, OSHA  inspected recordkeeping and reporting accuracy in a nongeneralizable  sample of over 300 establishments, primarily in industries with high  average rates of injuries and illnesses. A 2013 analysis of data from this  program indicates that OSHA identified reporting errors at establishments  it inspected, but the prevalence of underreporting cannot be determined  based on these data. While OSHA and BLS recognize that  underreporting exists, the extent is unknown.", "Underreporting continues to occur in the meat and poultry industry,  according to worker advocacy groups and selected OSHA hazard alert  letters we reviewed. Some meat and poultry workers may be less likely  to report injuries and illnesses because of their vulnerable status as  undocumented or foreign-born workers, according to federal officials and  representatives of worker advocacy groups we interviewed. About 28.7  percent of meat and poultry workers were foreign-born noncitizens in  2015 compared to about 9.5 percent of all manufacturing workers,  according to CPS data. The meat and poultry industry has been a  starting point for new immigrants, as many jobs require little formal  education or prior experience, according to a meat industry trade  association. According to an OSHA official, worker advocacy groups, and  plant managers at one plant we visited, some employers in the meat and  poultry industry recruit refugees\u2014in part, to replace undocumented  workers\u2014and some companies hire prison labor. Further, according to  data from BLS, the meat and poultry industry had an hourly mean wage  of $12.50 per hour in 2014 and an annual mean wage of $26,010. While  above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, these wages are just  above the 2014 federal poverty guidelines for a family of four.  Workers  who face economic pressures or have a tenuous immigration status may  fear job loss or deportation if they report or seek treatment for work- related injuries and illnesses, according to federal officials and worker  advocacy groups. For example, a community-based doctor told us that  soon after he approved some injured meat workers\u2019 work restriction  requests, they returned and asked him to send a note to their workplace  to end their work restriction because their employer had threatened to fire  them if they could not do their jobs. Language barriers can also make it  difficult for some of these workers to communicate about and report  injuries, according to a worker advocacy group. In addition, NIOSH  officials told us that in some cultures someone who reports an injury or  illness is considered weak.", "Some meat and poultry industry employers may not record worker injuries  and illnesses because of certain disincentives, according to federal  officials and representatives of worker advocacy groups we interviewed.  We previously found that generally, employers may not record workers\u2019  injuries and illnesses because of disincentives such as fear of increasing  their workers\u2019 compensation costs or jeopardizing their chances of being  awarded contracts for new work. Federal officials and representatives of  worker advocacy groups we interviewed told us that some employers in  the meat and poultry industry may underreport workplace injuries to keep  workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums low. In addition, some  employers may underreport to avoid triggering OSHA inspections or  promote the image of a safe workplace, according to a worker advocacy  group and managers at one plant we visited. At one meat plant we  visited, workers recalled incidents in which supervisors told injured  workers they were not hurt and to go back to work rather than report their  injury. NIOSH officials and a worker advocacy group attribute some  underreporting in the meat and poultry industry to lack of paid sick leave,  which may cause injured or ill workers to stay on the job so they can get  paid. For example, some poultry plants use point systems to track sick  days and may penalize workers for taking too many, according to worker  advocacy groups. A former meat worker who was injured on the job told  us he was suspended for three days after taking time off from work to  recover and was later terminated. Workers and representatives of worker  advocacy groups told us these systems discourage workers from  reporting their injuries and illnesses. OSHA officials also expressed  concerns that employer-sponsored safety programs with incentives\u2014 such as those that offer rewards for no injuries over time\u2014may pressure  meat and poultry workers to not report work-related injuries and  illnesses.", "Plant health units, which provide certain types of medical assistance to  workers with injuries and illnesses at some plants, may also discourage  reporting of injuries and illnesses, according to OSHA and worker  advocacy groups. In an effort to maintain a clean safety record and  avoid recording injuries in their OSHA logs, some plant health units may  repeatedly offer first aid treatments\u2014for example, compresses and over- the-counter painkillers and ointments\u2014rather than refer workers to a  doctor, according to two OSHA hazard alert letters, worker advocacy  groups, and workers we interviewed.  We were told about multiple  incidents in which meat and poultry workers were punished for visiting the  health unit too often or ignored by heath unit staff when they sought  further medical care. For example:  In 2014, OSHA sent a hazard alert letter to a poultry plant,  recommending that the plant voluntarily take steps to improve its  medical management practices. In the letter, OSHA identified  practices that were contrary to good medical practice for managing  work-related MSDs, including prolonged treatment by nursing station  staff without referral to a physician. The letter included one example in  which a worker made over 90 visits to the nursing station before  referral to a physician.", "In 2015, OSHA sent a hazard alert letter to another poultry plant, also  recommending voluntary improvements to the plant\u2019s medical  management practices. The letter noted that based on OSHA\u2019s  investigation, it appeared that the plant used its first aid station to  prevent injuries from appearing on the plant\u2019s OSHA log, such as by  not referring workers to a physician for evaluation or treatment when  appropriate.", "One worker told us that after he fell off a platform, the health unit  provided ice and denied his request to be referred to a physician for x- rays. When he received an x-ray several days later, it confirmed that  he had a fracture.", "A representative of a worker advocacy group told us about an incident  in which a nurse gave a worker with an injured wrist some cream and  sent him home. The worker sought medical treatment on his own,  which confirmed that he had a fractured wrist.", "Meat and poultry industry representatives said underreporting is not a  major issue, although some employers may not understand all of the  reporting requirements. A meat industry trade association we interviewed  noted that they organize seminars on reporting requirements and  encourage employers to record all incidents in order to document  improvement and avoid OSHA citations. Industry group representatives  also stated that the decline in injury and illness rates discussed above is  due in part to increased automation and industry efforts to enhance plant  safety. OSHA officials concurred that increased automation in the industry  has positively affected safety in limited areas of meat and poultry plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Lacks Information That Could Help It Address Meat and Poultry Workers\u2019 Musculoskeletal Disorders", "paragraphs": ["DOL lacks key information about MSDs in the meat and poultry industry  because of the way it gathers information on these conditions. It is  particularly challenging to gather data on MSDs because the gradual  nature of these injuries makes it harder for workers to recognize and  report them, according to experts and worker advocacy groups. As  discussed earlier, existing federal data and health hazard evaluations  suggest that MSDs in the meat and poultry industry are common and can  be disabling. In 2013, the incidence rate of MSDs that resulted in at least  1 day away from work was an estimated 39.2 cases per 10,000 workers  in the meat and poultry industry overall and 25.2 cases per 10,000  workers in the poultry industry, according to BLS\u2019s SOII. The 2013  incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome\u2014an MSD\u2014for cases that resulted in  days away from work in the meat and poultry industry was an estimated  4.1 cases per 10,000, compared to 2.1 cases per 10,000 for  manufacturing overall. A 2015 health hazard evaluation of a poultry  plant by NIOSH found that over one-third of the workers who participated  in the study had evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. A 2014 NIOSH  health hazard evaluation of poultry plant workers found that over two- thirds of workers interviewed reported experiencing pain, burning,  numbness, or tingling in their hands over the preceding 12 months and  that over half reported pain, aching, or stiffness in their backs during the  same timeframe (see fig. 8).", "OSHA and worker advocacy groups have also documented the  debilitating effects of MSDs. OSHA reports, for example, that MSDs can  be painful and disabling, and may cause permanent damage to  musculoskeletal tissues.", "Despite these concerns, DOL lacks information about MSDs in the meat  and poultry industry because of how the data are collected. Specifically,  BLS\u2019s annual SOII only collects injury and illness details\u2014such as the  type of injury or illness\u2014on cases that result in workers having to take  days off from work. For example, the survey does not collect detailed  information on MSDs that resulted in a worker being placed on work  restriction, transferred to a different job, or continuing in the same job  after medical treatment, making it more difficult to identify and track these  MSDs. From 2011 to 2013, BLS conducted a pilot study, for which the  SOII was modified to collect data for six selected industries (including  food manufacturing) on the case circumstances and worker  characteristics for cases where the worker was placed on work restriction  or transferred to a different job. This pilot study found many of the MSDs  occurring in the food manufacturing industry\u2014which includes the meat  and poultry industry\u2014result in the worker being transferred to other jobs  or restricted from activity in a current job without days away from work.  For each calendar year from 2011 through 2013, the BLS study found  that far more MSD cases in the food manufacturing industry resulted in  job transfer or restricted work than in days away from work. For example,  in 2013, the most recent data available, there were about 13,000 cases  with job transfer or restricted work in this industry, compared to about  6,000 with days away from work.", "The OSHA log, which employers use to respond to BLS\u2019s SOII, also does  not specifically classify recorded injuries or illnesses as MSDs. For each  injury or illness recorded on the log, OSHA requires employers to check  off a column indicating whether it is an injury or one of four specified  types of illnesses: skin disorder, hearing loss, poisoning, or respiratory  condition. Otherwise, the employer is to check \u201call other illnesses\u201d (see  fig. 9). However, the OSHA log does not include a place where employers  can check off whether a recorded injury or illness is an MSD. Such  information would only be included in the incident report, which is  maintained by the employer and generally not sent to OSHA or BLS.  Attempting to compile MSD data using individual incident reports would  be difficult.", "A former OSHA official said the agency added these columns to the log  because OSHA determined that tracking these particular conditions was  important to overseeing worker safety and health. Having these columns  enables OSHA to more easily distinguish specific illnesses and conditions  from other recorded cases.", "Before 2001 the OSHA log included a column for \u201crepeated trauma\u201d  cases, which included some, but not all, MSDs, as well as some non- MSD cases such as hearing loss. OSHA revised its recordkeeping  regulations in 2001 and replaced this column with two, one column for  MSDs and another for hearing loss. However, the MSD column never  went into effect, and in 2003, the agency deleted the MSD column after  determining the column was not necessary or supported by the record.  Some public commenters had also expressed concern that the column  was not necessary, did not clearly define MSDs, and imposed a  paperwork burden. Because the column was deleted, the current OSHA  log does not specifically classify MSDs, although MSDs must be recorded  as injuries or illnesses on the log if they meet the criteria in OSHA\u2019s  recordkeeping regulations. In 2010, OSHA again proposed a rule that  would have required employers to check off in a separate column on the  OSHA log whether an already-recorded injury or illness was an MSD,  stating that information generated from the column would improve the  accuracy and completeness of national occupational injury and illness  statistics, provide valuable industry-specific information to assist the  agency in its activities, inform workers and employers, and would not be  cost-prohibitive. However, the Department of Labor Appropriations Act,  2012 prohibited any funds from being used for the MSD column proposed  rule. The prohibition was extended by the 2013 appropriations act, but  was not included in subsequent appropriations. Since then, OSHA has  not attempted to add an MSD column to the OSHA logs.", "OSHA officials told us that it is vital to have accurate data on MSDs in the  meat and poultry industry, and OSHA stated in its 2010 proposed rule to  add a column to track MSDs that data from the column would assist the  agency in targeting its inspections, outreach, guidance, and enforcement,  among other things. BLS officials told us it would be a significant  improvement if there were data that would quantify the extent of MSDs,  as current data collection methods fall short. Although they stated they  did not see a need for a column, representatives of trade associations for  the meat and poultry industry we interviewed agreed that tracking MSDs  at the plant level helps employers prevent and respond to these  injuries. More MSD data would be helpful to OSHA and researchers,  and a column on the OSHA injury log dedicated to MSDs could also make  it simpler for employers to calculate their MSD rates, according to  representatives of worker advocacy groups. Currently, employers must  examine numerous entries in their OSHA injury log to calculate these  rates. According to CDC, the first step in addressing health issues such  as injuries is obtaining a full understanding of the extent of the problem.  Federal internal control standards also call for accurate and timely  recording to accomplish agency objectives. Without improving data on  MSDs, BLS\u2019s statistics on these conditions will remain limited and  OSHA\u2019s efforts to oversee employers and ensure workplace safety and  health will continue to be hindered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Lacks Information on Injury and Illness Rates of Meat and Poultry Sanitation Workers", "paragraphs": ["DOL does not know the extent to which injuries and illnesses occur  among meat and poultry sanitation workers\u2014who may be employed  directly by a plant or work for a separate contract sanitation company\u2014 because of how data on these workers are collected. Although they  labor in the same plants and under working conditions that can be as  hazardous as those of production workers, in 2005 we found sanitation  workers employed by contract sanitation companies were not classified  by BLS in the SOII as working in the meat and poultry industry. We  concluded that OSHA, as a result, was not considering all injuries and  illnesses at a plant when selecting plants to be inspected because some  worker injuries and illnesses were not included in OSHA logs at those  sites. We recommended that DOL require certain plants to provide OSHA  with worksite-specific data of injuries and illnesses of workers employed  by contract cleaning and sanitation companies so these data could be  included in the rates OSHA uses to select plants for inspection. DOL  did not implement this recommendation, citing a decision it had already  made against requiring employers in the construction industry to collect  contract worker data because of the burden to that industry, among other  things.", "DOL has not taken action to improve data on sanitation workers, despite  continued concerns expressed by OSHA about how sanitation work by  both plant employees and contracted workers is one of the most  hazardous occupations in the industry. Many sanitation workers work  overnight during a plant\u2019s \u201cthird shift\u201d and are responsible for cleaning  floors, machinery, and all product contact surfaces throughout the plant to  comply with USDA requirements. Workplace hazards for sanitation  workers employed directly by plants and those employed by contract  sanitation companies include potential exposure to electrical, mechanical,  hydraulic, and other sources of energy and potentially harmful chemicals.  In 2013, for example, a 41-year-old sanitation worker was killed when he  fell into an industrial blender at a meat plant, according to a fatality  investigation report by the Oregon Fatality Assessment and Control  Evaluation program of the Oregon Institute of Occupational Health  Sciences. In 2015, according to an OSHA citation, a sanitation worker at  a poultry plant lost two of his fingertips when a machine he was cleaning  was mistakenly turned on. Two weeks later at the same plant, according  to the same citation, a 17-year-old sanitation worker lost part of his leg  when he was caught in a machine that lacked safety mechanisms.", "Another challenge in tracking injury and illness rates among sanitation  workers is that even for those workers directly employed by meat and  poultry plants (as opposed to those working for a contractor), the plants  use different occupational titles for these workers on their OSHA logs.  Employers record the injured workers\u2019 job titles on their OSHA log, then,  in its SOII, BLS codes these data using a standardized system. BLS  officials told us that under this system these workers\u2019 occupations may be  listed as \u201cjanitors and cleaners,\u201d \u201ccleaners of vehicles or equipment,\u201d or  other occupational categories such as \u201cproduction workers-all other\u201d or  \u201cfood processing workers-all other.\u201d As a result of using these various  occupational titles, which may cover regular production workers as well,  DOL is not able to determine which injuries and illnesses pertain to meat  and poultry sanitation workers.", "According to BLS, it also may not be possible to gather separate injury  and illness data on those meat and poultry sanitation workers who are  employed by contract sanitation companies. Under OSHA\u2019s  recordkeeping requirements, either the contract sanitation company or  the plant may be required to track these workers\u2019 injuries, depending on  which entity is providing day-to-day supervision. As a result, injury and  illness data for these workers in BLS\u2019s SOII may be coded according to  their employer\u2019s industry\u2014janitorial services, for example\u2014and would  therefore not be captured in injury and illness rates for the meat and  poultry industry. Officials at four of the six plants we visited told us that  the contract sanitation company they work with maintains the injury log for  these workers. Officials at one contract sanitation company told us that  both they and the plants with which they contract keep OSHA logs, and  that the data the company sends to BLS from its OSHA log are coded  under the \u201cjanitorial services\u201d industry. BLS officials told us that it may  not be possible to require contract sanitation companies to identify the  industry of the companies they contract with because many of these  companies provide services to a wide variety of businesses.", "As a result of how DOL gathers information on meat and poultry  sanitation workers\u2019 injuries and illnesses, OSHA has little data to work  with when determining how to oversee these workers\u2019 safety and health.  Federal internal control standards call for agencies to track data to help  them make decisions and meet their goals. According to OSHA,  inaccurate data can lead to misleading conclusions regarding incidence,  trends, causation, and effectiveness of abatement strategies. Because of  limitations in the BLS data on injuries and illnesses of workers in meat  and poultry plants, OSHA cannot fully assess the extent to which it is  fulfilling its worker safety mission or successfully carrying out its  enforcement and other activities. In addition, the agency may not be  doing all it can to ensure sanitation workers are protected from workplace  hazards.", "Several new developments may make it easier for OSHA to obtain more  data on sanitation workers at meat and poultry plants. As of January  2015, employers covered by federal OSHA are required to report all work- related in-patient hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye  directly to OSHA within 24 hours. Previously, OSHA received more  limited information on amputations and hospitalizations through direct  employer reports. Reports on such cases involving meat and poultry  sanitation workers may provide OSHA with additional details on injuries to  this population. In addition, in October 2015, OSHA initiated two regional  emphasis programs for the poultry industry in the southern United States.  These programs\u2014along with an ongoing regional emphasis program on  poultry industry sanitation workers in the same region\u2014mean OSHA will  conduct more poultry plant inspections and gather more data on risks to  sanitation and other workers, a former OSHA official told us.", "OSHA may also be able to work with NIOSH to gather information about  sanitation worker injuries and illnesses. NIOSH officials told us that they  recently were able to conduct studies in other industries because OSHA  had negotiated their access after issuing citations. OSHA officials agreed  that NIOSH reports could be useful to their inspections. NIOSH\u2019s last  health hazard evaluation of meat and poultry sanitation workers was  conducted in 2002. At that time, NIOSH examined the use of sanitizing  agents, such as bleach, in a meat processing plant, and analyzed their  connection to respiratory disorders among five sanitation workers in that  plant. All five sanitation workers reported symptoms consistent with  known irritant effects of bleach, such as throat irritation and burning or  stinging eyes, and the symptoms disappeared when the use of bleach  was discontinued. Since then, NIOSH has not conducted any additional  health hazard evaluations on meat and poultry sanitation workers, since  they must rely on plant management, workers, or worker representatives  to request a health hazard evaluation. However, NIOSH can also self- initiate studies on occupational safety and health issues and may conduct  studies in response to requests from federal, state, or local agencies.  In the absence of additional studies on meat and poultry sanitation  workers, both OSHA and NIOSH may be missing an opportunity to learn  more about the nature and extent of sanitation worker injuries and  illnesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While overall injury and illness rates have decreased since our last report,  meat and poultry workers continue to face worksite hazards that put them  at risk of severe and lasting injury. Obtaining complete information about  injuries and illnesses in the meat and poultry industry continues to be a  challenge that affects DOL\u2019s ability to calculate accurate rates and ensure  safe and healthy workplaces. Recent OSHA inspections suggest that  more injuries occur than are reported, although the extent of  underreporting is not known, and vulnerable workers such as immigrants  and noncitizens may fear for their livelihoods and feel pressured not to  report injuries. Our findings raise questions about whether the federal  government is doing all it can to ensure it collects the data it needs to  support worker protection and workplace safety. Strengthening DOL\u2019s  data collection on worker injuries and illnesses is the first step towards  achieving that goal. Collecting accurate and complete data on MSDs is  particularly important, because these disorders are common among this  workforce and can be severe and debilitating. However, OSHA does not  have a cost-effective method for distinguishing MSDs from other recorded  cases, hindering OSHA\u2019s efforts to ensure workplace safety and health. In  addition, OSHA and BLS continue to face challenges determining the  rates of injury and illness among meat and poultry sanitation workers.  Until DOL is able to gather more complete data on sanitation workers in  these plants, it does not have an accurate picture of total injuries and  illnesses in the meat and poultry industry, and it cannot know how to best  protect these sanitation workers. New developments provide an  opportunity for DOL to learn more about the injuries and illnesses  suffered by these workers and to develop ways to better track them.

The  CFOI is a federal-state cooperative program that has been implemented  in all 50 states and the District of Columbia since 1992. According to BLS,  the CFOI program uses diverse state, federal, and independent data  sources to identify, verify, and describe fatal work injuries to ensure  counts are as complete and accurate as possible. CFOI compiles a count  of all fatal work injuries occurring in the United States during the calendar  year. Fatal injury counts exclude illness-related deaths unless precipitated  by an injury event. As previously stated, in 2011 the classification  systems and definitions of some data elements changed, and this change  may not allow comparing CFOI data within specific fatality categories to  previous years. Therefore, we reported total fatalities over a 10-year  period rather than annual totals within each major fatality category.", "To assess the reliability of BLS SOII and CFOI data, we reviewed  documents related to the data sources, such as BLS\u2019s Handbook of  Methods, and we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about these  data. We found that SOII and CFOI data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes in generally reporting estimated incidence rates of injuries and  illnesses in the meat and poultry industry and manufacturing overall,  describing injuries and illnesses, and reporting total fatalities in the meat  and poultry industry.", "We also obtained and reviewed fiscal year 2014 workers\u2019 compensation  data from USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to describe  the injuries, illnesses, and hazards experienced by inspectors in meat and  poultry plants. USDA\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation data includes injuries and  illnesses from workers who filed a workers\u2019 compensation form. A  limitation of this data source is that workers\u2019 compensation data likely  undercounts injuries and illnesses. To assess the data\u2019s reliability, we  interviewed agency officials, reviewed documentation on FSIS\u2019s workers\u2019  compensation program, and checked the data for discrepancies. We  found the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We reviewed literature from peer-reviewed journals, Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health (NIOSH) health hazard evaluations, and OSHA guidance  documents on factors that affected injury and illness rates and hazards in  the meat and poultry industry since we last reported.", "We conducted a literature search for studies that examined factors  affecting injury and illness rates, as well as hazards in the meat and  poultry industry. Based on our literature review, we reported  information from four peer-reviewed studies. To identify studies from  peer-reviewed journals, we conducted searches of various databases,  such as Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest and requested  suggestions from officials we interviewed. We further limited our  review to studies on meat and poultry workers only; therefore, we  excluded any studies that made comparisons between workers in the  meat and poultry industry and other industries. From this review, we  identified 19 studies that appeared in peer-reviewed journals between  2005 and 2015. Of the 19 studies, we excluded two studies that  summarized findings from two NIOSH health hazard evaluations that  we had previously obtained and reviewed. We noted that 8 of the 17  studies relied on a community-based approach to obtain participants  rather than recruiting them directly from plants. These studies focused  exclusively on a subset of the worker population within the meat and  poultry industry, namely women and Hispanic or Latino poultry  workers in North Carolina. We included observations from 1 of the 8  studies, which focused on Hispanic poultry workers, but we noted  study limitations in the report. We included findings from 3 of the other  9 studies: (1) a study on a neurological disorder experienced by  workers in three hog plants that illustrated hazards related to animals,  (2) a study on lacerations in meatpacking describing hazards related  to machines and tools, and (3) a study on laceration injuries  experienced by meat and poultry workers employed by 10 companies  representing 22 poultry plants and 8 pork plants to illustrate factors  that may affect injury and illness rates in the meat and poultry  industry.", "We identified and reviewed eight NIOSH health hazard evaluations  published from 2007 to 2015 that describe various hazards in poultry  plants, as well as factors that may affect injury and illness rates in this  industry. NIOSH officials told us the agency has not conducted  similar evaluations in meat plants to those it conducted in poultry  plants because the agency has not received any requests to do so.  Findings from NIOSH evaluations we reviewed are not generalizable  to illustrate hazards in all poultry processing plants in the United  States.", "We reviewed OSHA guidance documents on hazards in meat and  poultry plants, including OSHA\u2019s e-Tool for poultry processing which  details workplace hazards by job task in the poultry industry.", "To examine the challenges DOL may face in gathering data on injury and  illness rates in this industry, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations, as well as OSHA documentation. We also reported BLS data  and reviewed documentation on musculoskeletal disorders (MSD),  including a pilot study on cases involving job transfer and work restriction  from data collected from 2011 through 2013. We obtained and analyzed  data on worker demographics from the Current Population Survey (CPS),  jointly sponsored by BLS and the Census Bureau, from March 2015, the  most recent data available. We assessed the reliability of CPS data by  reviewing documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency officials,  and performing electronic data testing, and determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Because the CPS estimates are  based on probability samples, they are subject to sampling error. For the  CPS estimates in this report, we estimated sampling error and produced  confidence intervals using the methods provided in the technical  documentation of CPS\u2019s March 2015 supplement. To report wages of  meat and poultry workers, we used estimates of average annual and  monthly wages for slaughterers and meat packers (Standard  Occupational Classification code 513023) in the animal slaughtering and  processing industry (NAICS 31161) and their associated relative-standard  errors from BLS\u2019s Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey data  from May 2014. We used the relative-standard errors to calculate 95  percent confidence intervals for estimates derived from BLS\u2019s OES  survey data. We found the BLS and CPS data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. We interviewed OSHA officials\u2014including officials from all  10 regional OSHA offices\u2014and FSIS and NIOSH officials. We also  interviewed Georgia Tech Research Institute staff who conducted  research on sanitation workers in the poultry industry to learn about  hazards faced by sanitation workers in the meat and poultry industry.  Moreover, to describe challenges in gathering data on sanitation workers,  we reviewed a 2002 NIOSH evaluation on sanitation workers and  interviewed one sanitation company that provides cleaning services in the  meat and poultry industry. Of the two other sanitation companies we  approached, one declined to meet with us and other company did not  respond to our request.", "To respond to both objectives, we interviewed representatives from  stakeholder groups and visited several meat and poultry plants. We  identified and interviewed 13 stakeholder groups (unions, worker  advocacy groups, and industry trade organizations) with sufficient  knowledge about worker safety in the meat and poultry industry, in part  based on previous work as well as referrals from other stakeholder  groups. We also reviewed information obtained from these groups. These  stakeholder groups were the American Federation of Government  Employees/National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, the  Government Accountability Project, Legal Aid of North Carolina, the  National Chicken Council, the National Council for Occupational Safety  and Health, the National Turkey Federation, Nebraska Appleseed, the  North American Meat Institute, Oxfam America, the Southern Poverty  Law Center, Student Action with Farmworkers, the United Food and  Commercial Workers International Union, and the U.S. Poultry and Egg  Association. We attended a meat industry conference on worker safety,  as well as a worker safety conference organized by the National Council  for Occupational Safety and Health. Finally, we visited six meat and  poultry plants\u2014selected to cover a mix of species (chicken, turkey, hog,  and cattle) and states (Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Virginia),  as well as union and non-union plants and two plants that were part of the  FSIS pilot project\u2014where we met with plant management, USDA\u2019s FSIS  management and inspectors, and plant safety and health staff. We also  met with current and former workers, who were selected either by unions,  worker advocacy groups, or plant managers. The information gathered in  these interviews is not generalizable to all plants or workers. To assess  DOL\u2019s efforts based on the information gathered in interviews and site  visits, we used federal internal control standards that call for agencies to  track data and to undertake accurate and timely recording to accomplish  agency objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to April 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
