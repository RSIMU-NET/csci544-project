Reported financial management problems included (1) unreliable financial  information driven by widespread weaknesses in agency internal controls  over financial reporting and obsolete and inefficient agency financial  management systems and (2) financial reporting practices that did not  accurately disclose the current and probable future cost of operating,  permit adequate comparison of actual costs among executive branch  agencies, or provide the timely information required for efficient program  management.", "For example,  in 1988, we reported on internal control problems such as  the Department of Defense being unable to account for hundreds of  millions of dollars in advances paid by foreign customers for equipment,  weak controls permitting things such as over $50 million in undetected  fraudulent insurance claims paid by the Federal Crop Insurance  Corporation, millions of dollars in interest penalties because agencies  paid 25 percent of their bills late, and over $350 million in lost interest  because agencies paid their bills too soon.", "In 1990, Congress mandated financial management reform through  enactment of the CFO Act. The CFO Act was the most comprehensive  and far-reaching financial management improvement legislation enacted  since the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950. The CFO Act  established a Controller position at the government-wide level and a CFO  position for each of the agencies identified in the act (referred to as the  CFO Act agencies), provided for long-range planning, and began the  process of preparing and independently auditing federal agency financial  statements.

We have also reported information  security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. To address  information security challenges surfaced by federal agency audits,  Congress enacted the Federal Information Security Management Act of  2002 and its successor, the Federal Information Security Modernization  Act of 2014.

Based  on the preliminary results from our ongoing review, we have identified  several opportunities for enhancements that could help ensure that the  CFO Act reaches its full potential.  1.  To help ensure uniform responsibility, enhance strategic decision- making, and correct inconsistencies across government, amend  agency CFO\u2019s statutory responsibilities to ensure that they include all  of the responsibilities necessary to effectively carry out financial  management activities. Currently, responsibilities vary across  agencies and do not include all key responsibilities that CFOs should  possess.  2.  To help ensure continuity in agency financial management operations  when CFO vacancies occur, establish appropriate statutory  responsibilities for deputy CFOs. This would minimize the effects of  inevitable turnover in CFO positions.   3.  Based on the maturity of federal financial management, extend the  reporting frequency of the government-wide and agency-level  financial management plans from annually to at least every 4 years  (with timing to match the Government Performance and Results Act  reporting requirements). In addition to the current government-wide  financial management plan requirements, the plans should include  actions for improving financial management systems, strengthening  the federal financial management workforce, and better linking  performance and cost information for decision-making. The  government-wide plan should also include key selected financial  management performance-based metrics. It is our view that OMB and  Treasury should consult with the CFO Council, the Chief Information  Officer Council, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and  Efficiency, GAO, and other appropriate financial management experts  in preparing the government-wide plan.  4.  To provide more complete and consistent measurement of the quality  of agencies\u2019 financial management, require OMB to develop, in  consultation with the CFO Council, key selected performance-based  metrics to assess the quality of an agency\u2019s financial management,  and changes therein. Examples of potential metrics include the  number of internal control deficiencies, the number of internal control  deficiencies corrected during the year, and the number of  Antideficiency Act violations.The metrics should be included in the  government-wide and agency-level financial management plans  discussed above and agencies\u2019 performance against the metrics  reported in the annual status reports. Also, consider requiring auditor  testing and reporting on the reliability of each agency\u2019s reported  performance against the metrics.  5.  To reasonably assure that key financial management information that  an agency uses is reliable, require agency management to (1) identify  key financial management information, in addition to financial  statements, needed for effective financial management and decision- making and (2) annually assess and report on the effectiveness of  internal control over financial reporting and other key financial  management information. Also, consider requiring auditor testing and  reporting on internal control over financial reporting and other key  financial management information.", "We provided a draft of the progress and opportunities for enhancements  to OMB, Treasury, and OPM. OPM provided technical comments. OMB  and Treasury generally agreed with enhancements 1 and 2, regarding  CFOs\u2019 and deputy CFOs\u2019 statutory responsibilities. OMB generally  disagreed with enhancement 3, regarding preparation of government- wide and agency-level financial management plans, stating that  developing government-wide plans poses an administrative burden and is  no longer relevant in light of the current state of financial management.  However, we believe that a complete and integrated government-wide  plan could help to ensure continuity in direction and a comprehensive  understanding of the status and financial management challenges across  government. Eight of the 10 financial experts we interviewed stated that  without a government-wide financial management plan, the government  lacks a clear strategic direction and agency improvement efforts may not  appropriately address government-wide priorities.", "For enhancement 4, regarding performance metrics for agencies\u2019  financial management, OMB generally disagreed, stating that it would be  difficult to develop additional metrics that would apply to all agencies. We  recognize the challenges in developing the metrics but continue to believe  that a limited number of key metrics can be developed to effectively  assess the quality of agencies\u2019 financial management. For enhancement  5, regarding identifying key financial management information and  assessing, reporting, and auditing internal control, Treasury generally  agreed and OMB generally disagreed, noting that no action is needed  and these controls are adequately addressed under existing initiatives  and the enterprise risk management program contained in OMB  guidance.

Most experts agreed that standardizing the  CFO portfolio across agencies would promote standardized financial  management training and education and consistent skill sets across  agencies, both at the executive and staff levels.", "The CFO Council and CIGIE have identified turnover of agency CFOs,  even during the same administration, as a significant challenge. They  also stated that major financial management improvement initiatives can  take years to fully implement and realize, often outlasting the average  tenure of a political appointee to a CFO position. With frequent CFO  turnover and potentially lengthy intervals between official appointments,  long-term planning and leadership continuity can be affected because  career deputy CFOs, who frequently serve as acting CFOs during CFO  vacancies, do not always have the same breadth of responsibilities as  CFOs. Deputy CFOs can be better prepared to act for CFOs when there  are vacancies if appropriate responsibilities are established for deputy  CFOs. In our survey to CFOs and deputy CFOs, 17 of 24 respondents  stated that the deputy CFO position should include all, most, or many of  the same responsibilities as the CFO position. Additionally, some  respondents to our survey replied that it is important for the deputy CFO  to be able to step into the CFO position should there be a vacancy.

The OMB plans and status reports were to be submitted to  Congress to enable comprehensive congressional oversight.", "Since it issued the 2009 report, OMB has neither prepared nor submitted  to Congress the annual 5-year government-wide plans as required by the  CFO Act. Instead, OMB stated that it is meeting the intent of the  requirement by providing information in the President\u2019s Management  Agenda (PMA), in the annual government-wide consolidated financial  statements, and in documents placed on Performance.gov and the CFO  Council\u2019s website. For the consolidated financial statements, the  information is included in a section in the Management\u2019s Discussion and  Analysis (MD&A) entitled Financial Management. This section discusses  several of the priorities and accomplishments in financial management for  the prior and current fiscal years and in some cases discusses goals for  the next fiscal year.", "In addition, according to OMB, financial management elements are being  considered in implementing the 2018 PMA.

The others  are being managed by executive steering committees comprising CFO  Council\u2013approved members. While the various MD&A Financial  Management sections, the PMA, and other OMB documents contain  relevant information about improvements in financial management, these  documents do not provide a complete and integrated financial  management strategy for making continued improvements and for  reporting on the administration\u2019s accomplishments in a comprehensive  manner.", "In 2019, OMB proposed eliminating the CFO Act requirement for a  separate comprehensive plan, arguing that this change would provide it  with flexibility to report information that is most relevant to financial  management in a manner that is most efficient. However, having a  complete and integrated financial management plan would help to  address long-standing, costly, and challenging concerns in financial  management in a strategic, comprehensive, efficient, and cost-effective  manner. Eight of the 10 financial experts we interviewed stated that  without a government-wide financial management plan, the government  lacks a clear strategic direction and agency improvement efforts may not  appropriately address government-wide priorities. To hold people  accountable and facilitate congressional oversight, a complete and  integrated financial management plan should include the resources  required and measure progress through interim milestones with  completion dates. Several experts also stated that they believe that a  government-wide plan should be done every few years instead of  annually, but that the status report could continue to be prepared  annually.

In December 2004, OMB  issued A-123, Appendix A, Internal Controls over Financial Reporting,  which provided a methodology with which agency management could  assess, document, and report on internal control over financial reporting.  It emphasized management\u2019s responsibility for establishing and  maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Appendix A  required CFO Act agency management to annually assess the adequacy  of internal control over financial reporting, provide a report on identified  material weaknesses and corrective actions, and provide separate  assurance on the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s internal control over  financial reporting. The CFO Council subsequently issued the  Implementation Guide for Appendix A in 2005.", "In 2018, OMB reported that since the issuance of OMB Circular No. A- 123\u2019s Appendix A, federal agencies have made substantial progress in  improving their internal controls over financial reporting. OMB referred to  this as a rigorous process for agencies to separately assess internal  control over financial reporting.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2018, however, OMB no longer requires such a  process. On June 6, 2018, OMB issued an updated Appendix A,  Management of Reporting and Data Integrity Risk. The revised Appendix  A integrates internal control over reporting, along with internal controls  over operations and compliance, in an overall assessment of the  agency\u2019s internal control. This reporting guidance includes internal control  over financial reporting as well as over other financial and nonfinancial  information. It also requires that agencies develop and maintain a data  quality plan that considers the risks to data quality in federal spending  data required by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) and any controls that would manage such risks in accordance  with OMB Circular No. A-123. Further, agency senior accountable officials  are required to certify each quarter, among other things, that their data  submissions under the DATA Act are valid and reliable. However, the  appendix does not require a separate management assessment of  internal controls over the reliability of federal spending data. As we  previously reported, there are significant data quality problems related to  the completeness and accuracy of DATA Act data.", "In addition, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996  (FFMIA) requires CFO Act agencies and their auditors to determine  whether agency financial management systems comply substantially with  federal financial management systems requirements. However, such  systems requirements are focused on preparing agency financial  statements and do not generally include system requirements related to  other key financial management information (e.g., performance  information and cost information) needed for management decision- making. We have expressed concerns about the adequacy of financial  management systems requirements contained in the Treasury Financial  Manual. In our survey of CFOs and deputy CFOs, most (20 of 24)  respondents said that ensuring data quality of financial information was  somewhat, very, or extremely challenging.", "Without (1) identifying all key financial management information needed  for effective financial management and decision-making, (2) separately  assessing and reporting on the effectiveness of internal control over  financial reporting and other key financial management information, and  (3) independently assessing such controls, management may lack  reasonable assurance of the reliability of such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government-Wide Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Improper payments have consistently been a government-wide issue,  despite efforts to reduce them. Since fiscal year 2003, cumulative  improper payment estimates have totaled about $1.5 trillion.

OMB stopped reporting a  government-wide improper payment estimate in fiscal year 2017.  According to OMB, it stopped reporting a government-wide estimate  because program-by-program improper payment data were more useful.  However, we believe that the aggregation of improper payment estimates  is essential for transparency as without such the extent and magnitude of  the government-wide improper payments is not readily available to key  decision makers. As such, we support a key provision in the Payment  Integrity Information Act of 2019\u2014a bill which has passed the Senate\u2014 to require OMB to report a government-wide improper payment estimate  amount. Implementing this provision would be a positive step in  determining the overall progress the federal government is making in the  improper payment area.", "The federal government also needs to reasonably assure that agencies  take appropriate actions to reduce improper payments. For example, in  supplemental appropriations acts providing disaster relief funds in 2017  and 2018, Congress mandated an oversight framework for these funds by  requiring federal agencies to submit internal control plans to Congress,  based on OMB guidance. However, in June 2019, we reported that OMB  lacked a strategy for ensuring that federal agencies provide sufficient,  useful plans in a timely manner for oversight of disaster relief funds. As a  result, we found that selected agencies did not submit their disaster aid  internal control plans timely. The plans also lacked necessary information,  such as how the selected agencies plan to meet OMB guidance and  federal internal control standards. Such a strategy could help provide  Congress some assurance that agencies will establish effective and  efficient controls over disaster aid.", "The federal government also needs to reasonably assure that states,  local governments, and nonprofit organizations take appropriate actions  to reduce their improper payments of federal funds. For example, OMB  recently revised its compliance supplement for Medicaid to enable  auditors, as part of the single audit of all federal financial assistance that  a state received or administered, to test beneficiaries for eligibility for the  program.

Serious financial management problems at the Department of  Defense (DOD) have prevented its financial statements from being  auditable. DOD\u2019s strategy for achieving a clean opinion on its financial  statements and improving overall financial management has shifted  from preparing for audit readiness to undergoing financial statement  audits and remediating audit findings. In a positive development, DOD  underwent an audit of its entity-wide fiscal year 2018 financial  statements, which resulted in a disclaimer of opinion issued by the  DOD Office of Inspector General (OIG). The DOD OIG also reported  20 material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,  contributing to its disclaimer of opinion.", "DOD has acknowledged that achieving a clean audit opinion will take  time. However, it stated that over the next several years, the  resolution of audit findings will serve as an objective measure of  progress toward that goal. DOD will need to develop and effectively  monitor corrective action plans to appropriately address audit findings  in a timely manner. Partially in response to our recommendations,  DOD recently developed a centralized database for tracking the audit  findings, recommendations, and related corrective action plans.  2.  While significant progress has been made over the past few years,  the federal government continues to be unable to adequately account  for intragovernmental activity and balances between federal entities.  Federal entities are responsible for properly accounting for and  reporting their intragovernmental activity and balances in their entity  financial statements. When preparing the consolidated financial  statements, intragovernmental activity and balances between federal  entities should be in agreement and must be subtracted out, or  eliminated, from the financial statements. OMB and the Department of  the Treasury (Treasury) have issued guidance directing component  entities to reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances with their  trading partners and resolve identified differences. In addition, the  guidance directs the CFOs of significant component entities to report  to Treasury, their respective inspectors general, and GAO on the  extent and results of intragovernmental activity and balance  reconciliation efforts as of the end of the fiscal year.  3.  The federal government has an ineffective process for preparing the  consolidated financial statements. Treasury, in coordination with  OMB, has implemented several corrective actions during the past few  years related to preparing the consolidated financial statements.  Corrective actions included improving systems used for compiling the  consolidated financial statements, enhancing guidance for collecting  data from component entities, and implementing procedures to  address certain internal control deficiencies. However, the federal  government\u2019s systems, controls, and procedures were not adequate  to reasonably assure that the consolidated financial statements are  consistent with the underlying audited entity financial statements,  properly balanced, and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles.", "Further, significant uncertainties, primarily related to achieving projected  reductions in Medicare cost growth, and a material weakness in internal  control prevented us from expressing an opinion on the sustainability  financial statements.", "We, in connection with our audits, and agency auditors, in connection  with their audits, have identified numerous deficiencies underlying the  above weaknesses and have provided recommendations for corrective  action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Improve Financial Management Systems", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has made unsuccessful efforts to implement new  financial management systems, most notably at DOD, the Internal  Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, and the  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2014which have spent  billions of dollars on failed systems.
