GAO's September 2016 report on wildlife trafficking focused on supply side activities ( GAO-16-717 ). This report focuses on demand side activities and examines, among other things, (1) what is known about the demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products in the United States and in Asia and (2) actions agencies are taking to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products in the United States and in Asia.

The Department of the Interior's (Interior) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has seized a variety of wildlife at U.S. ports, such as coral for aquariums, conch meat for food, seahorses for medicinal purposes, and crocodile skin for fashion items. In China and Southeast Asian countries, reports and officials have identified seizures and consumption of illegally traded wildlife products such as rhino horn, elephant ivory, pangolins (shown below), turtles, and sharks, among others, used for purposes such as food, decoration, pets, or traditional medicine.", "U.S. agencies are taking actions designed to reduce demand for illegal wildlife, including building law enforcement capacity and raising awareness, but disagreement on roles and responsibilities has hindered some combating wildlife trafficking (CWT) activities in Southeast Asia. FWS inspects shipments in the United States and facilitates law enforcement capacity building with partner nations overseas. The Department of State (State) conducts diplomatic efforts, some of which contributed to a joint announcement by China and the United States to implement restrictions on both countries' domestic ivory trade. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) works with local organizations abroad to support programs intended to reduce wildlife demand, strengthen regional cooperation, and increase law enforcement capacity. Several other agencies also contribute expertise or resources to support various demand reduction activities. Certain practices can enhance and sustain collaborative efforts, such as establishing joint strategies, defining a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. GAO found that agencies applied the first two practices but could improve with regard to agreement on roles and responsibilities in Southeast Asia. For example, although the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking Implementation Plan designates various Task Force agencies to lead or participate in achieving CWT strategic priorities, it does not define specific roles and responsibilities at the working level. Agencies have different views on roles and responsibilities in Southeast Asia. According to some officials, this disagreement resulted in inappropriate training activities and hindered U.S. cooperation with a host nation. More clearly defining roles and responsibilities would enhance agency collaboration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Interior, State, and USAID work to clarify roles and responsibilities for staff collaborating on combating wildlife trafficking efforts in Southeast Asia.

As we have previously reported, such  practices include establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies,  defining and articulating a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and  responsibilities. In addition, we conducted fieldwork at the Port of Miami, Florida, and interviewed U.S. government officials at this location to  obtain insights on U.S. government activities. We selected the Port of  Miami because it has been the site of large-scale CWT operations, and  agency officials identified Miami as a hub for wildlife trade and an  illustrative example of U.S. government CWT operations.

FWS and NOAA may seize wildlife products for a variety of reasons that include import, export, or sale of endangered or threatened species  protected under U.S. laws and regulations. For example, FWS may  seize a shipment due to invalid documentation needed to clear the  shipment. From 2007 to 2016, the top 10 wildlife shipments\u2014by species  or species group\u2014seized nationally by FWS were coral, crocodile, conch,  deer, python, sea turtle, mollusks, ginseng, clam, and seahorse.

Various factors influence  the number of seizures at any given time or in any location such as the  level of illicit trade and the level and efficacy of enforcement efforts. For  example, as part of their enforcement, both NOAA and FWS conduct  inspections of shipments at U.S. ports. In some cases, they conduct  targeted inspections that may be based on information they have about a  particular species or market, which may influence detection and seizures  of illegal products. NOAA and FWS officials indicated that they can  increase their enforcement efforts by targeting investigations on specific  species or products. This additional effort may result in the seizure of  more shipments than would be made using routine inspection processes.", "In 2016, the NGO WildAid published a baseline survey conducted by  KRC Research to inform a public awareness campaign effort with FWS.

According to NGO officials we met with in Vietnam and China, consumers  purchase illegal wildlife products as a status symbol or to demonstrate  wealth. Wildlife is considered to be expensive and exotic in these  countries, and there is conspicuous consumption in some areas,  according to State officials in Vietnam and an FWS attach\u00e9. UNODC  reports that a survey of 18 restaurants\u2014 identified as high end by  UNODC\u2014 in Vietnam found that all of these restaurants sold pangolin  meat. UNEP and INTERPOL describe a similar phenomenon of a culture  of conspicuous consumption for wildlife products that indicate wealth.  These organizations report that buyers place higher value on illegal  wildlife products when they are considered rare and uncommon and thus  drive up prices for illegal wildlife.

In prior work, we  defined collaboration broadly as any joint activity that is intended to  produce more public value than could be produced when the  organizations act alone. We also identified practices that can enhance  and sustain collaborative efforts, including establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies, defining and articulating a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and responsibilities.", "We found that agencies applied some collaboration mechanisms but also  have an opportunity to improve on agreeing on roles and responsibilities.  For example, the White House established a joint strategy, the National  Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, in 2014. The strategy lays out  guiding principles and strategic priorities for U.S. efforts to stem illegal  trade in wildlife. In Southeast Asia, the U.S. embassy in Malaysia\u2019s  Integrated Country Strategy articulates mission goals and objectives for a  coordinated effort among all U.S. agencies and includes prevention of  illegal wildlife trafficking as a key activity, according to officials. In  addition, U.S. missions in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal,  Thailand, and Vietnam are developing CWT-specific country strategies,  according to officials.", "Agencies also defined and articulated a common outcome, outlined in the  National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking Implementation Plan  (Implementation Plan). The Implementation Plan states that success  relies on agencies working in concert to carry out the objectives, which  include strengthening enforcement, reducing demand for illegally traded  wildlife, and building international cooperation. Under three strategic  priorities, the Implementation Plan identifies 24 objectives and ways to  measure progress for each. In Southeast Asia, State and USAID officials  told us that they work toward those shared outcomes. In particular, they  stated that to achieve the shared outcome of reducing demand for wildlife  products, they cooperated on raising public awareness. For example,  State collaborated with USAID in Vietnam to implement Operation Game  Change, a 2015 awareness-raising effort designed to inform the  Vietnamese public about wildlife trafficking issues. In addition, to achieve  the common outcome of strengthening law enforcement capacity, USAID  is partnering with State, FWS, and DHS and other nongovernmental  actors to implement the Reducing Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of  Endangered Species program, which aims to increase enforcement  capacity at ports of entry in Vietnam and other countries.", "The Implementation Plan designates various U.S. agencies to lead or  participate in achieving CWT strategic priorities, so it provides high-level  direction on agency roles. However, the Implementation Plan does not  define specific roles and responsibilities at the working level for mission  staff implementing programs and activities. Officials at some missions  reported that agreement on roles, responsibilities, and priorities facilitated  collaboration on CWT activities in some instances. For example, an FWS  attach\u00e9 in the region told us that there has been effective collaboration  between FWS, State, and ICE HSI due to agreement on roles and a  shared understanding of key law enforcement terms and responsibilities.  In Thailand, FWS and ICE HSI officials told us that they share information  on cases, and FWS and State officials indicated that they have jointly  conducted a variety of capacity-building activities across the region. State  officials at ILEA in Bangkok attributed their successful regional  collaboration with FWS to a mutual understanding that CWT capacity  building is a responsibility that should be prioritized. State officials in  Cambodia indicated that their Embassy CWT Interagency Working Group  has been a forum for discussion among agencies in Cambodia to  collaborate on CWT roles and activities. The working group has a  designated lead agency and provides a forum to prevent or resolve  potential differences in points of view among the agencies.", "However, some officials also reported instances of disagreement on roles  and responsibilities that they said led to bad outcomes. For example, at  the mission in Bangkok, Thailand, which coordinates CWT activities  across the Southeast Asia region, agencies\u2019 disagreements on roles and  responsibilities have resulted in the delivery of inappropriate training  activities and interference with U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign  government, according to some officials. Specifically, FWS, State, and  ICE HSI have disagreed with USAID on the roles and responsibilities that  USAID implementing partners play with regard to law enforcement  activities. USAID officials stated that they entrust their implementing  partners to conduct law enforcement training and believe they sufficiently  involve their U.S. agency counterparts. However, FWS, State, and ICE  HSI officials believe that due to their law enforcement responsibilities  specifically related to strengthening host countries\u2019 antiwildlife trafficking  enforcement efforts, they should be consulted and involved to a greater  degree on activities directly related to such efforts.", "In Thailand, a USAID implementing partner\u2019s lack of collaboration with  U.S. law enforcement entities resulted in inappropriate training activities,  according to some officials. Officials from FWS, ICE HSI, and an NGO  told us that a CWT course conducted by a USAID implementing partner in  Thailand was inappropriate due to a focus on ambush and military tactics,  which are not suitable for the park rangers that received the training. In  addition, another training course conducted in Thailand was not tailored  for that country\u2019s landscape, according to a U.S. official, who explained  that the Thai officers receiving the training would be unable to apply its  lessons locally due to differences in terrain. FWS and ICE HSI officials  stated that they were not sufficiently consulted prior to the training and,  although they have provided feedback to USAID about these issues, they  expressed concern that USAID had not fully considered the feedback.  USAID officials indicated that training on ambush or military tactics would  not have been allowed, and they have no evidence it occurred. USAID  officials also stated that they were unaware of training that was not  properly tailored and that host countries generally praised training that  was provided by its implementing partner.", "FWS and State officials in Thailand also told us that agencies\u2019 and  implementing partners\u2019 efforts to share information on wildlife crime with  foreign governments have been fragmented due to disagreements about  roles. For example, USAID\u2019s implementing partners and FWS separately  approached foreign government entities to provide information or support  during a recent law enforcement seizure of wildlife products. According to  State and FWS officials in Thailand, while USAID\u2019s implementing partner  has a role in providing information that can support CWT activities, U.S.  agencies in-country are responsible for official engagement on law  enforcement matters and, therefore, should take the lead in  communicating with host governments, particularly in criminal  investigations.", "According to USAID officials, USAID and its implementing partners share  this responsibility and have a role to play. USAID officials told us that they  were aware of the difference in views and acknowledged that there may  have been instances in which an implementing partner overstepped.  USAID officials further explained that they have made an effort to address  this particular issue by changing its implementing partner as well as  changing their CWT program structure from a cooperative agreement to a  contract so that USAID has more oversight and control. The new  implementing partner also brought in a law enforcement expert to help  ensure that training and related activities will be appropriate, according to  USAID officials. In addition, the new USAID program specifies that  coordination with other agencies is required, and USAID conducted a  regional workshop in March 2017 to serve as a mechanism for  coordination.", "However, even after this conference, officials indicated that some  agencies still had not agreed on the appropriate balance for how  implementing partners should collaborate with U.S. law enforcement on  criminal investigations. According to State and FWS officials, differences  in agency views of their roles have hindered U.S. efforts to cooperate with  a foreign government and confuse foreign government officials who may  not realize that an implementing partner is not a U.S. government agency  and thus does not have the same authority. USAID officials indicated that  they were unaware of instances where its implementing partner interfered  with U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign government.", "Our work has shown that although collaborative mechanisms differ in  complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain key features, including  clarity of roles and responsibilities. For example, our work also notes that  agreement on roles and responsibilities helped agencies determine who  will lead a collaborative effort, clarify who will perform specific tasks,  organize joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision making. In  addition, we have previously reported that key issues agencies should  consider whether participating agencies have clarified the roles and  responsibilities of participants in collaborative efforts and whether  participating agencies have agreed to a process for making and enforcing  decisions. Some U.S. missions in Southeast Asia are developing CWT- specific country strategies, which could provide a platform for the Task  Force to give additional guidance on roles and responsibilities of mission  staff engaged in CWT efforts in the region.

However, it was  beyond the scope of this review to determine the reliability of the  underlying data. Many of these reports depend heavily on seizure data,  which have limitations.

Overall, we determined the data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of identifying wildlife products seized between fiscal years 2007  and 2016. Data on seizures may not be indicative of underlying trends in  trade and consumption, as they are dependent upon factors such as  enforcement and techniques used by those importing the goods.

As we have previously reported, such  practices include establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies,  defining and articulating a common outcome, and agreeing on roles and  responsibilities. In addition, we conducted fieldwork at the Port of Miami  and interviewed U.S. government officials at this location to obtain  insights on U.S. government activities. We selected the Port of Miami  because it has been the site of large-scale CWT operations, and agency  officials identified Miami as a hub for wildlife trade and an illustrative  example of U.S. government CWT operations. We also conducted  fieldwork in China and Vietnam, where we visited rescue centers and  interviewed host government officials and NGO representatives.", "To examine the extent to which FWS, State, and USAID are assessing  the effectiveness of their CWT activities, we selected programs to  analyze, spoke with agency officials, and reviewed documentation from  the programs selected.

Specifically for  State, programs must have been identified by its Bureau of International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs as a discrete activity that  contributed to CWT and must have been at least 3 months into  implementation. Specifically for USAID, programs must have (or have  had) funding greater than $1 million. To assess agency monitoring  practices, we analyzed agency guidance on monitoring and examined  selected programs as illustrative examples of how agencies applied their  own guidance. To assess evaluation practices, we assessed a USAID  midterm evaluation against key elements to determine quality. Two  social science analysts independently assessed this evaluation using the  same criteria, methods, and procedures that we developed for  GAO-17-316. The analysts met and reconciled any initial differences in  their assessments.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to October 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Photographs Related to Combating Wildlife Trafficking in the United States and Asia", "paragraphs": ["The following photographs (see fig. 8-26) were taken by GAO staff during  field visits to Miami, Florida; Beijing, China; Hong Kong; Bangkok,  Thailand; and Hanoi, Vietnam.
