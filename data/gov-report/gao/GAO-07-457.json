The International Labor Organization (ILO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have sought to monitor forced labor and prison conditions in Burma by allowing victims to voice their complaints without interference from the regime. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and ICRC seek to assist populations in conflict areas near Burma's border with Thailand. International organizations also attempt to provide food to vulnerable populations, promote local economic development, improve health conditions, and strengthen the Burmese educational system. For example, several UN entities provide assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and drug abuse, as well as to improve reproductive health. Burma's military regime has blocked or impeded activities undertaken by many international organizations in Burma over the past 3 years. In 2004, the regime distanced itself from these organizations and began adopting increasingly restrictive policies. In 2006, it published formal guidelines to restrict international activities in Burma. These guidelines, which have yet to be fully implemented, contain provisions that UN officials consider to be unacceptable. The regime's restrictions have had the greatest impact on international efforts to monitor prison conditions, investigate claims of forced labor, and assist victims of ethnic conflict. The regime has blocked ICRC efforts to monitor prison conditions and, until recently, ILO efforts to address forced labor. The regime has also restricted UNHCR and ICRC efforts to assist populations living in areas affected by ethnic conflict. To a lesser degree, the regime has impeded UN food, development, and health programs by restricting their ability to (1) move food and international staff freely within the country and (2) conduct research needed to determine the nature and scope of some of Burma's problems. Despite these restrictions, several international organization officials told us they are still able to achieve meaningful results in their efforts to mitigate some of Burma's humanitarian, health, and development problems. We asked the Department of State and officials of international organizations to comment on a draft of this report. State commented that the draft report was thorough, accurate, and balanced. The United Nations' country team for Burma did not dispute our specific findings regarding the regime's restrictions but expressed concern that that we had not noted that it had achieved \"a significant opening of humanitarian space on the ground.\" We believe that this statement is not consistent with information provided to us earlier by UN officials, who stated that conditions in Burma had deteriorated since the 2004 purge within the regime.

With a per capita national income level below those of neighboring  Bangladesh and Laos, Burma suffers from high infant and maternal  mortality rates, epidemic-level HIV/AIDS infections, and widespread  production of illegal drugs. Burma\u2019s isolation is largely the result of  policies pursued by a succession of authoritarian military regimes that  have ruled the country since 1962. According to the U.S. government,  these regimes are responsible for Burma\u2019s mismanaged economy, human  rights abuses, use of forced labor, human trafficking, and military  campaigns against ethnic minority groups. During Burma\u2019s last election in  1990, Burmese citizens voted to oust the regime in favor of the National  League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi. However, the regime  confined her and many other League members, and continued to rule  despite international condemnation of its actions. The regime\u2019s repressive  policies have prompted the United States and other Western nations to  end their foreign aid programs to Burma and enact a range of sanctions.", "In 2006, the Burmese regime announced new restrictions on international  organizations operating in Burma.

The  current regime took power in 1988. In Burma\u2019s last election in 1990,  Burmese citizens voted to oust the regime in favor of the National League  for Democracy. The regime confined the League\u2019s leader (Aung San Suu  Kyi) and many of the League\u2019s members, and continued to rule Burma  despite international condemnation. As of September 2006, the regime was  holding more than 1,100 political prisoners under conditions that State has  described as \u201charsh.\u201d  Amnesty International reported that the regime has  subjected Burmese political prisoners to torture and ill-treatment that has  resulted in the deaths of some prisoners. The regime has also condoned  the use of forced labor and taken military action against ethnic groups  living in areas within Burma. According to the U.S. government, Burmese  campaigns against ethnic minorities in conflict regions may have displaced  as many as 500,000 persons. Due in part to the country\u2019s widespread  violations of human rights, The Fund for Peace ranked Burma among the  world\u2019s top 20 most unstable countries, while Transparency International  ranked Burma 1.9 on a corruption scale ranging from 0 (highly corrupt) to  10 (highly clean).", "Burma is also one of the world\u2019s most impoverished countries. In 2006, the  UN Development Program (UNDP) ranked Burma 130 out of 177 countries  in its annual human development index based on economic and social  indicators. The U.S. government has ranked Burma\u2019s per capita gross  domestic product 186 out of 229 countries and territories\u2014below those of  neighboring Bangladesh and Laos. Both infant and maternal mortality  rates are high in Burma. Humanitarian needs are particularly acute in the  border areas that have been afflicted for many years by conflict and  instability, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  HIV/AIDS has become a generalized epidemic, with approximately 1.3  percent of the population suffering from the virus. According to UN  officials, the quality of education in Burma has been declining from  formerly high levels. Low educational attainment is depriving many  Burmese children of a good start in life and significantly lowering their  income opportunities and productivity as adults, according to the United  Nations. The weak education system also has long-term implications for  the country\u2019s ability to develop. According to the most recent World Bank  data available to the public, the regime spent less during 2001 and 2003 on  health and education in terms of percentage of gross domestic product  than Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Laos, which are other low-income  nations in the region. Burma has also emerged as a leading opium and  methamphetamine producer and a source of human trafficking, according  to the U.S. government.", "The regime\u2019s leadership and policies have undergone shifts since it took  power. Beginning in 1989, the regime began signing cease-fire agreements  with some of Burma\u2019s ethnic groups. In 2002, it released the winner of the  1990 election. In 2003, Burma\u2019s newly appointed Prime Minister began  offering the United Nations expanded opportunities to address some of  Burma\u2019s problems. However, the regime subsequently renewed military  activities against minorities along Burma\u2019s border with Thailand,  reconfined the winner of the 1990 election, and, after purging the Prime  Minister from power in October 2004, issued new restrictions on  international organizations in Burma. In November 2005, the regime  announced that it was moving Burma\u2019s capital from Rangoon to Nay Pyi  Taw, which is more than 200 miles from the Rangoon headquarters offices  of international organizations working in Burma (see fig. 1).", "The regime\u2019s actions have prompted the United States to impose a variety  of sanctions. The United States has banned the importation of Burmese  goods, the export of financial services and arms by U.S. persons to Burma,  and new U.S. investment in Burma. It has barred high-ranking Burmese  officials from visiting the United States. The United States also proposed a  UN Security Council resolution that would have called upon the regime to  cease attacks on civilians in ethnic minority areas and begin a substantive  political dialogue that would lead to a transition to democracy. In  addition, it has supported UN resolutions on Burma, such as those passed  by the UN General Assembly in response to the human rights situation in  Burma. According to State, U.S. objectives for Burma include the release  of political prisoners, the start of a credible and inclusive national  reconciliation process, the ending of forced labor and attacks on civilians,  and increased access for UN organizations and nongovernmental  organizations.", "While several other nations have imposed sanctions on Burma, China has  strengthened its ties with that country. Australia, Canada, and the  European Union have joined the United States in imposing some form of  sanctions against the regime, according to State. In contrast, China has  increased its commercial presence in Burma, emerged as Burma\u2019s largest  single source of imports (about 30 percent in 2005), and become a strong  market for Burmese exports. In addition, the current Burmese Prime  Minister visited Beijing in February 2006 and signed agreements with  Chinese officials that will provide Burma with grants and concessionary  loans.", "Burma has also become increasingly isolated from the World Bank, the  Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. The  World Bank reported that it has not approved any new loans to Burma  since 1987 and has no plans to resume its program. Burma is currently in  arrears to the World Bank and has not enacted economic and other  reforms. The Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary  Fund have not made new loans to Burma since the 1980s.", "The United Nations and several international organizations have become  an important source of outside assistance to the country. UN entities  informed us that they had spent about $218 million in Burma from 2002  through 2005. In 2005, more than 70 percent of these funds were spent by  UNDP, the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Program  (WFP), as shown in figure 2. Of the remaining agencies, the UN World  Health Organization (WHO) informed us it spent about $4.9 million in  Burma during 2005, while UNHCR and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA)  informed us they had each spent about $4.3 million.

The official contrasted the current regime\u2019s  policies with those of the former Prime Minister, who expanded  opportunities for UNDP to work in previously closed parts of Burma.", "The current regime\u2019s policies have particularly affected efforts by UNHCR  to assist displaced persons in the southeast region near the border with  Thailand. UNHCR officials told us that UNHCR operating conditions in the  southeast region near the border had deteriorated sharply in 2005.  Previously, according to UNHCR, the agency had been developing plans  for the anticipated repatriation of thousands of refugees from the Thai side  of the border, with the support of the Prime Minister in assessing the  region\u2019s capacity to support returning refugees. These conditions, along  with the prospects for a political settlement between the regime and a  Karen organization, changed after the Prime Minister\u2019s removal. The  regime\u2019s Ministry of Interior initially ignored UNHCR\u2019s efforts to restart  discussions before reassigning UNHCR to a less influential ministry. More  importantly, the resumption of military operations in the area convinced  UNHCR that conditions were no longer conducive to the return of  refugees.", "The regime has also resisted UNHCR\u2019s subsequent efforts to assist  communities on the Burmese side of the border that have been affected by  the displacement of persons within the area. UNHCR officials told us that  restrictions on UNHCR\u2019s access to several areas have impeded the  agency\u2019s efforts to improve its fragmented understanding of the  population\u2019s needs and its capacity to address them. The regime, which  denies that internally displaced persons are in the region, has not allowed  UNHCR to access certain border areas that it does not control. While  UNHCR has been allowed to implement certain \u201cquick impact\u201d projects  (such as the building of schools and bridges) in some 300 villages, UNHCR  considers these projects to be only a first step toward fulfilling its  protection objectives. Because regime officials closely monitor these  projects, UNHCR staff cannot easily meet with villagers to improve  UNHCR\u2019s understanding of the problems facing internally displaced  persons. A senior UNHCR official in Burma told us that UNHCR does not  want to jeopardize its already limited access to the region or to put the  local population at risk by holding public meetings on protection issues.", "The regime has halted ICRC\u2019s efforts to assist and protect civilians in  conflict areas over the past 2-1/2 years. ICRC staff informed us that the  regime began restricting ICRC\u2019s access to conflict areas after October  2004. ICRC staff also told us that regime authorities had begun demanding  that representatives of the Union Solidarity Development Association  accompany ICRC teams in certain conflict areas. ICRC staff stated that  allowing regime representatives to do so would compromise the  independence of ICRC\u2019s role in these areas. ICRC staff estimated that  between 2002 and October 2006, regime actions reduced the scope of  ICRC\u2019s assistance and protection effort by 90 percent. The regime then  ordered ICRC to close its five field offices in Burma, including those that  served as bases for ICRC conflict area teams. ICRC stated that the  closures will make it impossible for it to carry out most of its assistance  and protection work for civilians in the conflict areas. According to State  and ICRC officials, the regime has since allowed ICRC to reopen the field  offices but has not allowed ICRC to resume humanitarian assistance  programs out of the offices. The regime now insists that ICRC follow strict  guidelines that do not allow space for independent movements by teams  as in the past, according to a senior ICRC official in Burma.", "Several other international organizations reported similar difficulties in  sensitive regions of Burma. FAO staff reported that local police had barred  them from traveling to villages in Shan State to question people regarding  food supplies.

A senior WFP official told us that WFP has not always been  able to deliver food on schedule because regime officials have required 3  to 5 months to approve food shipments and because regional military  commanders have not always been available to approve food deliveries  upon their arrival. As a result, he stated, WFP had been unable to deliver  several months\u2019 worth of food to students and their families in the  northern parts of the Rakhine State during the 2005 school year. In  addition, he informed us that WFP had been unable to deliver 20 percent  to 30 percent of its planned food shipments during 2005.

According to UN officials, the Burmese  regime typically requires non-Burmese staff of UN entities and other  international organizations to obtain travel permits to visit project sites.  Officials of eight of the nine UN entities that provide humanitarian, health,  and development assistance in Burma told us that the regime requires at  least 3 to 4 weeks\u2019 advance notice to authorize travel. An official of the  remaining entity told us that it is required to provide 2 weeks\u2019 notice.  These officials said that the additional time it takes to apply for travel  permits impedes the planning and monitoring of projects through field  visits and reduces the scope of their activities. In August 2006, the acting  UN Resident Coordinator informed the Minister of National Planning and  Economic Development that with regard to internal travel, \u201cUnnecessary  and time-consuming procedures impede us from providing assistance in a  timely manner.\u201d", "Moreover, the regime\u2019s internal travel restrictions contributed to a major  setback to international efforts to fight three diseases in Burma. The  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria had agreed to  provide $98.4 million over 5 years, beginning in 2005. However, in 2005 the  fund terminated its program in Burma after the regime instituted new  travel clearance procedures that would have impeded international staff  travel to project sites. In announcing its decision to terminate the program,  the fund cited the adverse impact that the new travel restrictions would  have had on its ability to ensure that the program was properly managed.", "Some UN international staff also reported they have been hindered by the  regime\u2019s requirement that they be accompanied by their regime  counterparts when they travel in Burma, although others noted that the  requirement has some benefits. One official said that counterparts had  prevented her from meeting with project beneficiaries in private. Another  stated that his organization has faced the challenge of finding government  counterparts to accompany international staff when they need to travel.  However, four UN officials noted that Burmese technical experts had  facilitated their travel and access and provided input to their work.", "In addition, officials of three UN entities reported difficulties in obtaining  permission for experts located outside Burma to visit sites in that country.

WHO has reported with concern that Burma\u2019s  deteriorating statistics on health are not reliable and that Burma lacks a  plan to develop a nationwide health information system. Officials working  for other UN entities in Burma\u2019s health sector expressed similar concerns.  UN officials also criticized Burmese statistics on education.

The UNCT commented that our draft report did not describe a  significant opening of humanitarian space in Burma. The UNCT\u2019s letter  is not consistent with the information and assessments provided to us  by UNCT members and NGO officials during our October 2006  fieldwork in Burma. At the time, UNCT and NGO officials provided  numerous examples of how Burmese restrictions had impeded their  activities (including UNHCR\u2019s recent efforts in the Thai border region)  and a senior UN official in Burma informed us that the \u201chumanitarian  space\u201d in Burma was dwindling.
