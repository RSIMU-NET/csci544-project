In particular, since the system was updated in August 2015, C-TPAT staff have identified instances in which the Portal 2.0 system incorrectly altered C-TPAT members' certification or security profile dates, requiring manual verification of member data and impairing the ability of C-TPAT security specialists to identify and complete required security validations in a timely and efficient manner. While the focus of CBP's staff was initially on documenting and addressing Portal 2.0 problems as they arose, the staff have begun to identify root causes that led to the Portal 2.0 problems. For example, CBP staff cited unclear requirements for the system and its users' needs, coupled with inadequate testing, as factors that likely contributed to problems. In response, CBP staff have outlined recommended actions, along with timeframes for completing the actions. The staff stated that they will continue to work on identifying and addressing potential root causes of the Portal problems through 2017. C-TPAT officials told us that despite the Portal 2.0 problems, they have assurance that required security validations are being tracked and completed as a result of record reviews taking place at field offices. However, these field office reviews were developed in the absence of standardized guidance from C-TPAT headquarters. While the current validation tracking processes used by field offices do account for security validations conducted over the year, standardizing the process used by field offices for tracking required security validations could strengthen C-TPAT management's assurance that its field offices are identifying and completing the required security validations in a consistent and reliable manner.", "CBP cannot determine the extent to which C-TPAT members are receiving benefits because of data problems.

However, on the basis of GAO's preliminary analyses and subsequent data accuracy concerns cited by C-TPAT program officials, GAO determined that data contained in the Dashboard could not be relied on for accurately measuring C-TPAT member benefits. Also, CBP has likely relied on such questionable data since it developed the Dashboard in 2012, and, thus, cannot be assured that C-TPAT members have consistently received the benefits that CBP has publicized. C-TPAT officials stated that they are analyzing the Dashboard to finalize an action plan to correct the data concerns. It is too soon to tell, though, whether this process will fully address the accuracy and reliability issues.

Balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the free flow of  commerce remains an ongoing challenge for the public and private  sectors alike.", "CBP has implemented several programs as part of a layered, risk- informed approach to supply chain security. The Security and  Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) established a  statutory framework for key programs within CBP\u2019s layered security  strategy that previously had not specifically been required by law. One  such program, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C- TPAT), began in November 2001 and is a voluntary program in which  CBP officials work with private companies to review and validate their supply chain security practices, as well as the security practices of the  companies or entities in their global supply chains, to ensure they meet a  set of minimum security criteria defined by CBP. In return for ensuring  their supply chain security practices meet CBP\u2019s minimum security  criteria, C-TPAT members are eligible to receive various benefits, such as  reduced scrutiny or expedited processing of their U.S.-bound shipments.  According to C-TPAT officials, as of September 2016, there were 11,490  C-TPAT members, whose collective shipments have accounted for over  half of all cargo by value entering the United States in recent years.", "We previously reviewed and reported on the C-TPAT program in 2008.  At that time we found that, among other things, CBP faced challenges in  verifying that C-TPAT members\u2019 security practices met CBP\u2019s minimum  criteria, and CBP\u2019s records management system did not identify interim  processing dates that would enable management or others to determine  CBP\u2019s compliance with program requirements. We recommended that  CBP improve the security validation process, enhance its records  management system, and identify opportunities to establish performance  measures for improving supply chain security.

In  particular, this report addresses the following questions:  1.  To what extent is CBP meeting its security validation responsibilities?  2.  To what extent are C-TPAT members receiving benefits?", "To address the first objective, we requested data from C-TPAT\u2019s Portal  2.0, the data system designed to maintain C-TPAT program data\u2014such  as members\u2019 certification, security validation, and revalidation records\u2014 with the intent of reviewing the data to determine CBP\u2019s timeliness and  completeness in meeting its security validation responsibilities. However, based on discussions with C-TPAT managers, as well as staff members  responsible for maintaining the Portal 2.0 system, we determined that  data from the system were not reliable because of functionality problems,  as discussed in more detail later in the report. We also obtained and  reviewed CBP documentation describing Portal 2.0 system requirements,  its development, the nature of Portal 2.0 problems C-TPAT staff have  experienced, and actions that CBP staff are taking to address these  problems. Further, we conducted interviews with officials from the C- TPAT program and CBP\u2019s Office of Information Technology at CBP  headquarters, as well as C-TPAT field office directors, supply chain  security specialists (hereafter referred to as \u201csecurity specialists\u201d), and  their supervisors at three of C-TPAT\u2019s six field offices in Los Angeles,  California; New York, New York; and Houston, Texas. These interviews  provided us with additional information about the Portal 2.0 problems and  the extent to which the problems have affected the security specialists\u2019  efforts to (1) determine which C-TPAT members are due for security  validations or revalidations, (2) conduct those security validations or  revalidations, and (3) document the results. While the information  gathered from these site visits cannot be generalized to all C-TPAT field  office directors and security specialists, they provide insights into the  nature of the validation process and use of Portal 2.0 in conducting  security validations. We reviewed documentation and interviewed agency  officials to determine how C-TPAT officials assured that security  validations were identified and conducted, as needed, following the Portal  2.0 system problems that occurred in 2015. We also gathered information  on how C-TPAT headquarters officials solicit and review the field office  director security validation submissions and compared this process to  best practices on control activities, information, communication, and  monitoring as identified in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. We then reviewed CBP and C-TPAT\u2019s efforts to test Portal  2.0 prior to deploying it and to address Portal 2.0 problems that have  arisen since it was deployed in August 2015. Finally, we interviewed a  representative from the Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations  to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (COAC) and a nongeneralizable  sample of trade industry association officials and C-TPAT members  selected to reflect a variety of different C-TPAT member industry types  (e.g., importers, highway carriers) to obtain their perspectives on security  validation and revalidation procedures; as well as any potential areas for  improvement for the C-TPAT program.", "To address the second objective, we obtained and analyzed data  compiled by CBP on examination rates, hold rates, and average  processing times of cargo shipments from C-TPAT members as  compared to cargo shipments from non-C-TPAT members covering fiscal  years 2011 through 2015, the 5 most recent fiscal years for which these  data were available. In analyzing these data, we discovered that they  were not reliable for the purpose of reporting on the actual benefits  received by C-TPAT members, which we discuss in more detail later in  the report. After determining that the data were not reliable, we  interviewed cognizant CBP staff to explore the extent to which C-TPAT  officials had determined the causes of the data reliability issues and had  devised solutions. We compared the evidence we compiled to criteria on  effective information management practices identified in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, leading project  management practices identified in the Program Management Institute\u2019s  A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, and  requirements of the SAFE Port Act. In addition, we reviewed information  describing C-TPAT benefits for which C-TPAT does not systematically  gather data because the benefits are difficult to quantify\u2014such as access  to C-TPAT security specialists\u2014as well as information on efforts to  potentially expand benefits provided to C-TPAT members. We  supplemented our data analyses and document reviews with testimonial  evidence gathered through interviews with C-TPAT officials at CBP  headquarters, as well as C-TPAT field office directors, supervisory  security specialists, and security specialists at the three C-TPAT field  offices mentioned earlier. We also interviewed officials in CBP\u2019s Office of  Information Technology to discuss how C-TPAT benefit data were  compiled, as well as officials from the trade industry associations and C- TPAT members mentioned above to discuss their views on C-TPAT  program operations and benefits.

In particular, while the intended purpose of transitioning from  Portal 1.0 to Portal 2.0 in August 2015 was to improve functionality and  facilitate communication between security specialists and C-TPAT  members, a series of problems arose as a result of this transition that  have impaired the ability of C-TPAT staff to identify and complete  required C-TPAT member certification procedures and security profile  reviews in a timely and efficient manner. For example, C-TPAT field office  directors, supervisory security specialists, and security specialists we met  with identified numerous instances in which the Portal 2.0 system  incorrectly altered C-TPAT members\u2019 certification or security profile dates.  In particular, when C-TPAT officials transferred responsibility for some C- TPAT members\u2019 accounts from one security specialist to another, those  members\u2019 certification dates were sometimes incorrectly changed. These  altered dates, in turn, have interfered with security specialists\u2019 ability to  properly identify and track which member companies are due for an  annual security profile review.", "In addition to the impact they have had on the daily responsibilities of  security specialists, Portal 2.0 problems also made it more difficult for C- TPAT managers to complete the C-TPAT program\u2019s 2016 annual work  plan for assigning responsibilities for member security validations and  revalidations to its security specialists. C-TPAT managers have typically  relied on data from Report Builder, a reporting module within Portal, to  develop annual work plans. However, in November 2015, C-TPAT staff  had difficulty using Report Builder to access historical data from Portal 1.0  that were to have migrated to Portal 2.0 regarding C-TPAT members that  were due to have security validations or revalidations conducted in 2016.  As a result, the initial 2016 work plan did not have accurate data on the  number of C-TPAT members due for security validations or revalidations.  In addressing this issue, C-TPAT\u2019s Director pointed out that while the  Portal is intended to facilitate the ability of security specialists to perform  their responsibilities, each security specialist is experienced and is not to  rely solely on the Portal to complete his or her job responsibilities. So, to  complete the 2016 work plan, C-TPAT managers implemented a  requirement for security specialists in each of C-TPAT\u2019s six field offices to  manually review documentation, such as prior security validation reports,  for each of their assigned members (approximately 80 to 100 members  per security specialist) to verify or correct the certification and security  validation dates recorded in Portal 2.0 and to ensure that the 2016 work  plan identified all members due for security validations or revalidations in  2016. C-TPAT officials then used the information gathered through these  additional manual steps to update and correct the 2016 work plan.", "Further, security specialists we met with told us that they had difficulty  saving and submitting security validation reports to C-TPAT managers in  a timely manner because of Portal 2.0 problems. Instead of submitting the  validation reports directly through the Portal, security specialists told us  they sometimes had to prepare draft security validation reports offline and  copy and paste information section by section in order for Portal 2.0 to  accept and save the security validation reports. While these alternate  means of verifying validation responsibilities and mitigating Portal 2.0  problems have generally allowed security specialists to complete their  required annual security profile reviews and validations, the security  specialists stated that these work arounds are time consuming and have  necessitated the use of overtime. The C-TPAT Director acknowledged the  problems her staff have experienced with Portal 2.0 and that these  problems have led to some inefficient work practices.", "Problems with Portal 2.0 have also had an adverse impact on C-TPAT  members.

C-TPAT  headquarters officials collected these spreadsheets and sent them to  TASPD managers to address. In an effort to improve coordination and  communication between C-TPAT and TASPD staff, in February 2016,  CBP officials developed a more centralized and systematic process for  documenting, prioritizing, and addressing Portal 2.0 problems as they  arise. In particular, a single C-TPAT point of contact receives a list of  Portal problems from field office security specialists, creates a work ticket  for each problem, and works with TASPD staff to prioritize those work  tickets and group them into batches. TASPD staff then attempt to identify  the causes of the batched Portal 2.0 problems and test the proposed fixes  with input from the end users (primarily security specialists and C-TPAT  field office directors) to ensure the problems are corrected during 2 to 3  week intervals called \u201csprints.\u201d C-TPAT field office staff we met with told  us that while these sprints have generally resolved the originally-identified  problems, the fixes have, at times, created new problems that affected  the accuracy of data and the usability of certain Portal 2.0 features.

The  officials stated that the Dashboard\u2019s requirements are dated, and that  new requirements need to be verified and tested. They further stated that  because of competing priorities, CBP staff have not completed  verification, user acceptance testing, or periodic data checks. C-TPAT  officials noted, though, that C-TPAT and TASPD staff are in the process  of analyzing data contained in the Dashboard to finalize an action plan to  correct the data concerns. It is too soon for us to assess whether this  process will fully address the Dashboard accuracy and reliability issues.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  program management should use quality information to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives. Specifically, management is to obtain relevant data  from reliable internal and external sources based on identified information  requirements. These sources should provide data that are reasonably  free from error and bias and represent what they purport to represent.  Also, management should process data into quality information. Quality  information is to be, among other things, appropriate, current, complete,  and accurate. In addition, the SAFE Port Act requires CBP to extend  benefits, which may include reduced examinations of cargo shipments, to  Tier II and Tier III C-TPAT members. As mentioned earlier, the 2014 C- TPAT Program Benefits Reference Guide also cites reduced examination  rates for C-TPAT importers compared to non C-TPAT importers as a  benefit of the program. Further, project management criteria established  by the Project Management Institute state that it is necessary to establish  project objectives and outline a plan of action, via a project schedule with  major milestones, to obtain those objectives.", "Because the data contained in the Dashboard cannot currently be relied  upon, CBP is not able to determine the extent to which C-TPAT members  have received benefits, such as lower examination or hold rates, or  reduced processing times of their shipments when compared to non-C- TPAT members. CBP has likely relied on such questionable data since it  developed the Dashboard in 2012, and, thus, cannot be assured that C-TPAT members have consistently received the benefits that CBP has  publicized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other C-TPAT Member Benefits Are Difficult to Quantify", "paragraphs": ["Beyond shipment examination and hold rates, and processing times, CBP  does not gather data on its other stated C-TPAT member benefits. There  are a variety of reasons for this, including the inherent difficulty in being  able to quantify certain benefits that are more qualitative in nature, such  as having access to security specialists; or are difficult to meaningfully  quantify across ports because of the many differences that exist in  infrastructure from port to port. C-TPAT officials explained that, although  these other benefits are difficult to measure, they are of value to C-TPAT  members. The C-TPAT officials acknowledged that while the C-TPAT  program might be able to gather and track quantifiable data on some  additional benefits\u2014such as increased mitigation of monetary penalties  for C-TPAT members\u2014given the Portal 2.0 and Dashboard data  accuracy and reliability issues (as described earlier), they plan to focus  first on identifying and correcting these data issues for those benefits  currently tracked rather than trying to quantify and track other current  member benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP is Considering Additional C-TPAT Member Benefits and a New Metric", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the C-TPAT member benefits listed earlier, CBP staff are  working with trade industry partners and the COAC, to identify and  explore potential new benefits, as well as a metric for quantifying potential  cost savings for members. Trade industry officials we met with generally  spoke positively of the C-TPAT program and of CBP staffs\u2019 efforts in  sharing information and listening to their concerns and suggestions for  enhancing the program. However, some trade industry officials we met  with have also expressed the desire for C-TPAT to improve and add  member benefits. In response to suggestions from members of the trade  community, C-TPAT staff said that they are considering some additional  benefits, such as the following:  Advanced Qualified Unlading Approval (AQUA) Lane: The AQUA  Lane pilot is a joint partnership between the C-TPAT program, sea  carriers, and world trade associations at select U.S. ports with the goal of  reducing the amount of time that the carriers must wait for releasing their cargo. At these pilot ports, select C-TPAT member vessel carriers, who  qualify under a set of predetermined requirements, are allowed to  offload\u2014but not release\u2014cargo containers arriving at one of the pilot  ports prior to CBP officials clearing the vessel carrier for release. AQUA  Lane was initially piloted at the ports of Oakland, California; Port  Everglades, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Baltimore, Maryland.  According to C-TPAT officials, the pilot has been well received by sea  carriers, who have expressed interest in seeing the program expanded to  other domestic sea ports. In response, CBP announced a phased  expansion of the AQUA Lane program, adding six ports in September  2016, an additional 10 ports in December 2016, with final implementation  to all remaining seaports to be completed in early 2017.", "Trusted Trader Program: The Trusted Trader Program is a CBP-led  collaborative effort being tested that aims to enhance information sharing  between government agencies regarding importers\u2019 efforts to enhance  supply chain security and comply with trade requirements. As this  program is expanded, one goal is to reduce redundancies in processing  steps, as well as in the vetting and validation procedures of the C-TPAT  and ISA programs. For example, under the Trusted Trader Program, CBP  may conduct C-TPAT supply chain security and ISA trade compliance  validations jointly, reducing time and resources that member companies must invest in these processes. However, the program has received  mixed reactions from members of the trade industry with whom we met.  While some members of the trade industry spoke favorably of the Trusted  Trader Program, other members questioned whether the program\u2019s  benefits offered sufficient incentives compared to the costs and  administrative requirements.", "Cost Savings Benefit Metric: CBP is in the process of reviewing a  metric regarding the cost savings derived by C-TPAT members as the  result of a reduced rate of shipment examinations. This metric was  proposed by a C-TPAT member in the summer of 2015 and accepted by  DHS consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act.  CBP began gathering data for this metric during fiscal year 2016;  however, C-TPAT officials noted that they need to revisit the integrity of  the supporting data that would be used in this metric as a result of the  concerns we and C-TPAT officials have raised before CBP can pursue  implementing such a metric."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CBP\u2019s risk-informed approach to supply chain security focuses on  ensuring the expeditious flow of millions of cargo shipments into the  United States each year, while also managing security concerns. It is  critical that CBP manages the C-TPAT program in a way that enhances  the security of members\u2019 global supply chains, while also providing  benefits that incentivize program membership. A lack of reliable data has  challenged CBP\u2019s ability to manage the C-TPAT program effectively. In  particular, problems with the C-TPAT program\u2019s updated Portal 2.0 data  system that began in August 2015 have impaired the ability of C-TPAT  staff to identify and complete required security validations in a timely and  efficient manner. While C-TPAT field offices have implemented  procedures for ensuring that required security validations are identified  and completed, these procedures are varied because C-TPAT  headquarters has not developed standardized guidance for its field offices  to follow. Taking steps to standardize C-TPAT field offices\u2019 efforts to track  required security validations could strengthen C-TPAT management\u2019s  assurance that its field offices are identifying and completing the required  security validations in a consistent and reliable manner. Further, because  the data contained in the Dashboard cannot be relied upon, CBP is not able to determine the extent to which C-TPAT members are receiving  benefits, such as lower examination or hold rates, or reduced processing  times of their shipments when compared to those for non-C-TPAT  members. Finally, because CBP has likely relied on such questionable  data since the Dashboard was developed in 2012, it does not have  reasonable assurance, consistent with federal internal control standards,  that C-TPAT members have consistently received the benefits that CBP  has publicized.

Application and eligibility: An entity submits an application for C-TPAT  membership that includes corporate information (e.g., company size  and location), a supply chain security profile, and an agreement to  voluntarily participate in the C-TPAT program. In completing the  supply chain security profile, the entity is to conduct a comprehensive  self-assessment of its supply chain security procedures or practices  using the C-TPAT minimum security criteria for its specific business  type, such as importer, highway carrier, or customs broker. The  application is assigned to a supply chain security specialist to be  reviewed to determine if the applicant meets C-TPAT eligibility  requirements for its business type.  2.  Vetting: Once a security specialist determines an applicant is eligible  for C-TPAT membership, the security specialist is to conduct research  as part of the vetting process. Vetting involves a review of the entity\u2019s  compliance with Customs laws and regulations; as well as any  violation history to identify information that might preclude C-TPAT  membership. Once any issues are resolved to U.S. Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) satisfaction, the entity can move on to the  certification stage.  3.  Certification: After vetting, a security specialist is to conduct a detailed  review of the entity\u2019s security profile, looking for any weaknesses or  gaps in security procedures or practices, to determine whether  minimum security criteria for that entity\u2019s business type are  adequately addressed. This review is to be completed and the  application approved or rejected within 90 calendar days from the  date the entity submits its security profile. If the security specialist  approves the security profile, the entity is certified as a C-TPAT  member and is eligible to begin receiving benefits.  4.  Validation: Once certified, a security specialist is to conduct a  validation of the security measures outlined in a certified member\u2019s  security profile to ensure that they are reliable, accurate, effective,  and align with CBP\u2019s minimum security criteria. As provided for in the  Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port  Act), a member\u2019s initial security validation is to be completed within 1  year of certification, to the extent practicable. During the validation  process, the assigned security specialist is to meet with the member\u2019s  representatives to verify that the supply chain security measures  contained in its security profile are in place as described. If the  member is an importer operating a global supply chain, the security  specialist is to visit the member\u2019s domestic site and at least one  foreign supply chain partner\u2019s site (e.g., a manufacturer who supplies  goods). C-TPAT management and the security specialist assigned to  a member are to identify potential sites to visit based on research of  the member\u2019s business history, import transportation modes, facility  locations, and other factors. To initiate the security validation, the  assigned security specialist is to provide the member a site visit  agenda and documents to help the member prepare for the visit, such  as a validation checklist. Upon completion of the security validation  process, the security specialist is to prepare a final validation report to  present to the member. The report may include recommendations to  improve security practices, as well as any required actions the  member is to take to conform to CBP\u2019s minimum security criteria. The  security validation report is also to address whether the member  should continue to receive program benefits; and, if an importer or  exporter, whether additional benefits are warranted.  5.  Annual reviews and revalidations: Once a security specialist validates  a C-TPAT member\u2019s security practices, the member company is to  undergo a review of its eligibility status, vetting, and certification  processes on an annual basis. This involves having the member  perform an annual self-assessment\u2014essentially an update of its  security profile\u2014that provides the member with an opportunity to  review, update, or change its security procedures, as needed.  Security specialists are to annually certify completion of these  member self-assessments. Each C-TPAT member is to undergo a  security revalidation not less than once every 4 years after its initial  validation, as determined by C-TPAT and in accordance with the  SAFE Port Act. A security revalidation calls for a security specialist to conduct updated document reviews and on-site visits to a member  and at least one of its foreign supply chain partners to ensure  continued alignment with C-TPAT\u2019s minimum security criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Christopher Conrad (Assistant Director),  Adam Couvillion (Analyst-in-Charge), David Alexander, Christine  Broderick, Charles Bausell, Dominick Dale, Dorian Dunbar, Tyler  Mountjoy, Heidi Nielson, Nina Thomas-Diggs, and Eric Winter all made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
