As a result, FDA has little assurance that companies comply with food labeling laws and regulations for, among other things, preventing false or misleading labeling. Specifically: (1) FDA does not have reliable data on the number of labels reviewed; the number of inspections, which include label reviews, has declined. For example, of the tens of thousands of foreign food firms in over 150 countries, just 96 were inspected by FDA in 11 countries in fiscal year 2007--down from 211 inspections in 26 countries in 2001. (2) FDA's testing for the accuracy of nutrition information on labels in 2000 through 2006 was limited. FDA could not provide data for 2007. (3) Although the number of food firms in FDA's jurisdiction has increased, the number of warning letters FDA issued to firms that cited food labeling violations has held fairly steady. (4) FDA does not track the complete and timely correction of labeling violations or analyze these and other labeling oversight data in routine reports to inform managers' decisions, or ensure the complete and timely posting of information on its Web site to inform the public. (5) In addition to its official recalls database, FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has continued to waste resources on a second recall database that FDA had agreed to eliminate in 2004, as GAO had recommended. FDA has reported that limited resources and authorities challenge its efforts to carry out its food safety responsibilities--these challenges also impact efforts to oversee food labeling laws. FDA's Food Protection Plan cites the need for authority to, among other things, collect a reinspection user fee, accredit third-party inspectors, and require recalls when voluntary recalls are not effective. Stakeholders from health, medical, and consumer groups identified actions they believe will mitigate misleading labeling and help consumers identify healthy food. Several stakeholders support a simplified, uniform front-of-package symbol system to convey nutritional quality to consumers. The United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Netherlands have developed voluntary nutrition symbols, while the European Commission has proposed requiring front-of-package labeling of key nutrients."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Two thirds of U.S. adults are overweight, and the incidence of childhood  obesity and diabetes has been rising. In an effort to reverse these growing  public health problems, medical professionals are encouraging Americans  to eat healthier, more nutritious foods. In 2005, the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  issued Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These guidelines and the food  guide pyramid, developed by USDA to visually convey the guidelines and  other nutrition information, help policy makers design and implement  nutrition-related programs. Federal agencies must promote this guidance  in carrying out federal food, nutrition, or health programs; meals served  under the school lunch program must be consistent with the guidance. This  guidance provides science-based dietary direction for consumers to limit  their sugar, fat, and salt; eat more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and  monitor portion size. According to the guidance, a healthy diet reduces the  risk for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes,  and stroke\u2014all major causes of death and disability in the United States.", "Food labels contain information to help consumers who want to follow the  dietary guidance and to make healthy food choices that best fit their dietary  needs. Within HHS, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible  for administering federal food labeling requirements, in accordance with  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended. This act prohibits  labeling that, among other things, is false or misleading or fails to list the  amounts of certain nutrients. When industry, consumer groups, or others  believe that certain types of food labeling information is false or  misleading, or that changes to requirements are needed for public health,  or for other reasons, they may request or formally petition FDA to issue  regulations or guidance to address the problem.", "FDA oversees industry compliance with the food labeling requirements as  part of its food oversight mission. FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and  Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)\u2014one of its six mission centers\u2014is responsible  for food, cosmetics, and related products. Within CFSAN, the Office of  Nutrition, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements publishes regulations and  guidance on food labeling and provides policy interpretations for  overseeing compliance with statutes and regulations that, among others  things, prohibit false or misleading labeling. FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory  Affairs (ORA) undertakes inspections and enforcement activities for all  FDA centers.", "FDA\u2019s guidance for inspecting domestic or foreign food firms\u2014such as  manufacturers, processors, and other food-handling businesses\u2014directs  investigators to focus primarily on food safety issues and to review the  labels on at least three products during every food safety inspection. To  augment its inspection capacity, FDA contracts with states to carry out  food safety inspections, following FDA guidance. When FDA inspects food  shipments entering the United States from a foreign country, it may also  review food labels. To test for the accuracy of labeling information,  investigators may send samples of domestic or imported food to FDA  laboratories for analysis. FDA also may follow up on complaints from  consumers, consumer groups, individual firms, industry groups, or others  who believe they have identified food that violates FDA\u2019s labeling  regulations.", "FDA has a number of tools for responding when food labeling violations  are identified. It may ask companies to voluntarily recall any food that has  already entered the distribution chain. FDA may also send a warning letter  to a firm, which is a notice that enforcement actions may be forthcoming if  corrections are not made; according to FDA guidance, warning letters are  used for serious violations. For less serious violations, FDA may send an  untitled letter, which is an informal communication that corrective actions  are needed. At any point, FDA may hold a regulatory meeting with the firm  to resolve a labeling violation or work with a firm to obtain voluntary  compliance. When violations are not corrected, FDA may initiate actions to  seize and remove the food from the marketplace (a seizure) or enjoin a firm  from continuing a practice that violates food labeling statutes and  regulations (an injunction). For food imported from a foreign country, FDA  may issue an import refusal to prevent a shipment with a serious labeling  violation from entering the United States. FDA may also release a shipment  \u201cwith comment\u201d\u2014that is, allow the shipment with a labeling violation to  enter the United States with notice to the importer that subsequent  shipments might be refused entry if the violation is not corrected. In  addition, FDA maintains an \u201cimport alert\u201d list to detain entries of foreign  foods that appear to have significant recurring or unusual violations.", "In January 2007, we added federal oversight of food safety to our   High-Risk Series, which is intended to raise the priority and visibility of  government programs that are in need of broad-based transformation to  achieve greater economy, efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, and  sustainability. In particular, we have noted that federal expenditures by  FDA and USDA for food oversight have not been commensurate with the  volume of foods regulated by the agencies or consumed by the public. In  November 2007, a report for FDA\u2019s Science Board\u2014FDA Science and  Mission at Risk\u2014pointed out the erosion in FDA\u2019s science base and the  inadequacy of FDA\u2019s information technology infrastructure. The report  cited numerous management challenges that have contributed to FDA\u2019s  inability to fulfill its mission and that cannot be addressed with available  resources. Also in November 2007, FDA issued its Food Protection Plan:  An Integrated Strategy for Protecting the Nation's Food Supply (Food  Protection Plan), which recognized the need for several changes to ensure  the safety of the nation\u2019s food supply and identified new authorities needed  to implement the new strategy, such as the authority to charge user fees for  certain reinspections. In a May 2008 letter (the May 2008 resource needs  assessment), FDA\u2019s Commissioner identified the resources needed in broad  categories to, among other things, begin implementing the Food Protection  Plan to protect against new and emerging threats to food safety. We have  testified that FDA\u2019s plan is a good first step, but pointed out that it does not  provide a clear description of resources and strategies that Congress will  need to assess the likelihood of the plan\u2019s success. Also, with respect to  making the most of resources, in May 2008 we issued a special publication  entitled Federal User Fees: A Design Guide, which presented various ways  to design user fees to encourage greater efficiency, equity, and revenue  adequacy and to reduce the administrative burden on the agency and  payers of the fees.", "You asked us to examine (1) FDA\u2019s efforts to ensure that domestic and  imported foods comply with food labeling requirements, including those  prohibiting false or misleading labeling; (2) the challenges FDA faces in its  efforts to administer and enforce food labeling requirements; and (3) the  actions stakeholders from health, medical, and consumer organizations  believe are needed to mitigate the effects of food labeling practices they  consider misleading and to help consumers identify healthy food.", "For this report, our definition of \u201cfood\u201d includes conventional food, dietary  supplements, infant formula, and medical food; we excluded animal feed,  which the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes in its definition  of food. We did not independently determine whether particular food labels  were false or misleading; the examples we cite are food labels that FDA or  a health, medical, industry, or consumer group characterized as false or  misleading. We also did not evaluate how efficiently FDA used its resources  or the impact of changing priorities; nor did we compare FDA resource  trends with other federal agencies. To examine FDA\u2019s efforts to ensure that  domestic and imported foods comply with food labeling statutes and  regulations, we analyzed FDA\u2019s and CFSAN\u2019s plans and reports; guidance  and regulations; and data on labeling-related oversight, enforcement,  recalls, warning letters, and complaints. Regarding data for labeling-related  oversight, we analyzed the food establishments or facilities (which we call  firms) inspected for 7 fiscal years (2001 through 2007); nutrition labeling  samples for 7 fiscal years (2000 through 2006); warning letters and  enforcement actions related to imports for 6 fiscal years (2002 through  2007); and seizures and injunctions for 10 fiscal years (1998 through  2007)\u2014the periods for which reliable and comparable FDA data were  available. To identify challenges, we reviewed FDA reports and testimonies  and analyzed funding and staffing data for FDA, CFSAN, and ORA for   10 fiscal years (1998 through 2007) and the Office of Nutrition, Labeling,  and Dietary Supplements, which began maintaining comparable data in  1999, for 9 fiscal years (1999 through 2007). We also reviewed FDA  oversight and enforcement authorities and court rulings regarding FDA  labeling. For comparison, we examined similar information for USDA\u2019s  Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC), which also oversee and enforce requirements related  to food labeling. For stakeholder positions, we analyzed the views of  health, medical, consumer, and industry groups obtained from interviews  and documents, such as reports and petitions. We assessed the reliability of  the data used in this report and found it to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes used. We conducted this performance audit from January 2007  through September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  Appendix I contains more detailed information on our objectives, scope,  and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, prohibits the  \u201cmisbranding\u201d of food, which includes, among other things, labeling that is  false or misleading. In 1990, Congress amended the act to mandate that  certain nutrition information be provided on packaged foods in a specified,  standardized format\u2014only recently have other countries, such as Canada,  initiated mandatory nutrition labeling. The act, and FDA regulations  implementing it, require food labels to include nutrient, ingredient, and  other important content information that consumers can use to make  healthy dietary choices, and to avoid allergens (such as peanuts) and other  ingredients (such as sulfites) that can cause life-threatening reactions in  people who are sensitive to them. For example, the act and FDA\u2019s  regulations, with some exceptions, require that food labels include the  following:  a Nutrition Facts panel that identifies the serving size; the number of  servings per container; the number of calories per serving; and the  amount of certain nutrients, such as fiber, vitamins, fat, and sodium;   an ingredients list that identifies the product\u2019s ingredients by their  common or usual names, in order of predominance by weight;   the required information in English; and  a declaration of the source (e.g., tree nuts) of major allergens.", "Figure 1 depicts an example of a Nutrition Facts panel from FDA\u2019s  regulations illustrating nutrition information and visual display.", "The act and FDA regulations also require that health claims\u2014that is, claims  characterizing the relationship of certain nutrients to a disease or a health- related condition\u2014on food labels be authorized by FDA. For example, a  main dish that contains 140 milligrams (mg) or less of sodium per 100  grams may be labeled with the claim that \u201cdiets low in sodium may reduce  the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many factors,\u201d  provided there are no nutrients in the food at levels that would disqualify it  from making this claim. In regulations, FDA has authorized the use of  claims for 12 relationships between a nutrient and a disease or health- related condition.", "For purposes of compliance, with certain exceptions, a food is subject to  enforcement action under FDA regulations if the number of calories or the  amount of certain nutrients, such as fat and sugar, is more than 20 percent  over the amount declared in the Nutrition Facts panel. The Institute of  Medicine established the reference nutrient values that FDA used (along  with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans) to establish the daily values for  nutrients on the Nutrition Facts panel. In addition, for compliance and  enforcement purposes, the amount of certain nutrients naturally occurring  in the food must be at least equal to 80 percent of the value declared on the  label; the amount of added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods must be  at least equal to the amount shown on the panel. According to FDA, these  variations are allowed because, for naturally occurring nutrients, values  cannot be precisely controlled and depend on weather and soil conditions,  among other variables; in addition, values will vary because different  laboratories use different methods and testing devices.", "FDA\u2019s procedures for handling a product complaint require staff to obtain  sufficient information from the complainant to evaluate the complaint and  determine if it requires follow-up. Also, the complaint is to be documented  in the Field Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS).  For a food-labeling-related complaint, the information documented in  FACTS should include, among other things, any injury, illness, or adverse  event that was reported as having occurred as a result of incorrect labeling,  and any follow-up actions. Complaints of significant illness or injury must  receive immediate and thorough follow-up, while follow-up on those  complaints that do not involve injury or illness may be deferred until the  next scheduled inspection of the responsible firm, which may be in a few  weeks, months, or several years.", "Similarly, FTC authorities prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in  or affecting commerce, including false or misleading advertising of food  products. In some cases, FDA and FTC have certain overlapping  jurisdiction for regulating food advertising, labeling, and promotion.

In addition, FDA has done no random sampling since the 1990s, when some  compliance rates varied considerably from the amount identified on the  Nutrition Facts panel. From fiscal years 2000 through 2006, FDA collected  targeted samples of 868 domestic products and 783 imported products for  tests of compliance with nutrition labeling regulations. FDA was unable to  provide information on samples taken and test results for fiscal year 2007  because, according to an agency official, the person who analyzed those  data had retired from FDA.", "According to FDA officials, investigators often selected samples because  they noticed obvious labeling violations, such as a candy bar with a  Nutrition Facts panel that did not identify any fat or sugar. As table 2  shows, about 21 percent and 28 percent, respectively, of the domestic and  imported foods tested were in violation.", "The number of samples of imported food FDA has tested for accuracy of  nutrition labeling does not relate to the volume of imports or the rate of  violations in products from a given country, as table 3 shows.

According to FDA\u2019s  analysis of these products, 87 percent (in 1994) and 91 percent (in 1996) of  the nutrients were within the allowable range. However, compliance rates  varied significantly for a few nutrients. For example, in 1994 and 1996,  respectively, 48 percent and 47 percent of the samples were not within the  allowable range for vitamin A; 48 percent and 12 percent of the samples  were not within the allowable range for vitamin C; and 32 percent and 31  percent of the samples were not within the allowable range for iron.

Furthermore, FDA, in  accordance with Freedom of Information Act requirements, makes these  letters available on its public Web site. However, we found several  problems with FDA\u2019s public dissemination of warning letters that call into  question the accuracy of its numbers. For example, we tested the reliability  of this database and found that it was missing over 220 warning letters.  When we brought the missing letters to their attention, FDA officials told  us they posted them. Although FDA officials assured us that the database  was complete and accurate, in February 2008 and later, we found duplicate  letters in the database as well as additional letters that had been issued  during fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Therefore, the number of warning letters  posted on FDA\u2019s Web site for fiscal years 2002 through 2007 may be  different from the number shown in figure 3. In April 2008, FDA officials  told us they were continuing to work on the database and to discuss  potential process improvements to help ensure that all letters are posted.", "In fiscal year 2001, FDA had issued nearly twice as many warning letters for  all violations than in 2002. FDA officials attributed the decrease in warning  letters, in part, to new policies that transferred the approval of warning  letters from FDA centers and districts to the Office of Chief Counsel. FDA  officials told us that the target turnaround time for issuing a warning  letter\u2014the elapsed time between the day officials identify the violation,  either through an inspection, laboratory test, or illness outbreak  investigation, and the day FDA issues a warning letter\u2014is about 4 months.  This is a nearly fourfold increase over the 30-workday target time we  reported in February 2005. A longer lag time to issue a warning letter  increases the number of days for which consumers may consume the  misbranded food before FDA posts these serious problems on its Web site.", "In addition, FDA estimated that it has sent one third as many untitled  letters\u2014correspondence citing violations that FDA deems as not  warranting a warning letter\u2014as warning letters. We did not assess untitled  letters because FDA did not centrally track the letters in a database, nor did  it maintain copies centrally until fiscal year 2008. Regarding regulatory  meetings, FDA could not tell us how many were held because these  meetings are handled exclusively by the district offices and are not  centrally tracked.

On February 3, 2006, FDA obtained a consent decree of  permanent injunction against Natural Ovens Bakery, Inc., for allegedly  introducing misbranded foods, including dietary supplements, and  misbranded and unapproved drugs into interstate commerce and for  causing foods to become misbranded.

As shown in table 7, during  fiscal years 2002 through 2007, Canada also had the most food labels  reviewed (45,377) and lowest rate of import refusals (2.6 percent) where a  labeling violation was cited, while Australia had the fewest label reviews  (697) and the highest rate of import refusals (14.3 percent) where a labeling  violation was cited.", "Import alerts: As of January 28, 2008, FDA gave us information on active  import alerts for 64 food products that officials characterized as labeling  violations. For example, FDA issued import alerts for several different  types of biscuits imported from India that did not use the common or usual  name for ingredients. Once a product is on the import alert list, FDA does  not remove it until the firm appears to have corrected the violation,  according to FDA officials.

For example, FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health  has the authority to collect and retain user fees from firms for reviewing  and approving premarket applications for medical devices. The center uses  the fees to offset the costs of reviewing and approving these applications  and to increase staffing levels. In its Fiscal Year 2009 Justification of  Estimates for Appropriations Committees for FDA, HHS proposed a  reinspection user fee on food industry firms that fail to meet important  manufacturing and food safety requirements. This fee would cover the full  cost of reinspections and the associated follow-up work. We have  presented various ways to design user fees to encourage greater efficiency,  equity, and revenue adequacy and to reduce the administrative burden on  the agency and payers of the fees. For example, the extent to which a  program is funded by user fees should generally be guided by who  primarily benefits from the program. If a program primarily benefits the  general public (e.g., national defense), it should be supported by general  revenue, not user fees; if it primarily benefits identifiable users, such as  customers of the U.S. Postal Service, it should be funded by fees; and if a  program benefits both the general public and users, it should be funded in  part by fees and in part by general revenues.

As  we testified in May 2008, FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health  has accredited third-party organizations to conduct voluntary inspections  of foreign firms that manufacture medical devices, and these third parties  completed six inspections in 4 years.

FDA acknowledged in 1993 that clarifying the  definition of \u201cnatural\u201d would abate some of the complaints that the  term\u2019s use is misleading. More recently, FDA noted that it lacks  resources to undertake a rulemaking to revisit the definition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With its current approach to oversight and enforcement, FDA cannot be  assured that food firms are complying with labeling requirements. In light  of the resource constraints and many responsibilities that FDA has  reported, it is especially important that FDA start by making better use of  the tools and data it has available. However, FDA\u2019s use of warning letters  and enforcement actions have at best held steady, despite increased  responsibilities. FDA is not using the information that it has to inform  managers\u2019 decisions on setting priorities and allocating resources. FDA  does not maintain in an accessible format, or analyze in routine reports,  information it has on such areas as labeling violations discovered during  inspections, the results of tests on the accuracy of labels, warning letters,  recalls, and import refusals. Moreover, although information on whether  and how labeling violations are addressed is critical for effectively  overseeing the labeling program. FDA does not (1) centrally maintain  information on regulatory meetings and (2) know whether field offices are  applying the same criteria for meetings and whether meetings are effective.", "While FDA posts information for the public on its Web site\u2014such as  warning letters, import refusals, and import alerts\u2014it does not ensure that  the information is complete and posted promptly. As a result, the public  may not have the information needed about products in violation of the law  to inform their purchase decisions. Furthermore, CFSAN has continued to  expend resources maintaining a duplicative data system for food-related  recalls, which it agreed to eliminate in 2004. We reiterate our prior  recommendation that FDA should eliminate this system.", "Going forward, to better administer and enforce labeling requirements,  FDA has begun to pursue several authorities that are available to other  centers within FDA and other regulatory agencies. In particular, CFSAN  does not have the authority to charge user fees, accredit third-party  inspectors, or require recalls for most food. As a result, CFSAN is not as  well positioned as other programs that have these authorities to carry out  its responsibilities. FDA\u2019s Food Protection Plan recognized the need for  additional resources and new authorities, to ensure the safety of the  Nation\u2019s food supply. However, as FDA proceeds in seeking new authorities  it will need to ensure that any it chooses to pursue are designed and  implemented efficiently and appropriately and, in particular, that any user  fees it develops are well-designed and based on best practices and sound  criteria, such as that specified in GAO\u2019s Federal User Fees: A Design  Guide. In addition, any FDA program for accrediting third parties would  likely benefit from lessons learned in another FDA-accredited third-party  program. Moreover, as we have previously testified, while FDA\u2019s plan is a  good first step, it does not contain a clear description of resources and  strategies. Congress will need those details to assess the likelihood of the  plan\u2019s success.", "Finally, the many issues stakeholders raised about label information that  they believe confuse consumers compete for FDA\u2019s attention and  resources. Nonetheless, FDA has information on the approaches that U.S.  industry and other countries are taking to give consumers simplified  nutrition information at a glance with front-of-package symbols. However,  given FDA\u2019s competing priorities and its minimal progress in addressing  misleading labeling thus far, collaboration with other federal entities and  stakeholders could afford an opportunity for FDA to better leverage  resources to pursue front-of-package labeling or other initiatives for  minimizing consumer confusion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner, FDA, take the following seven  actions: Ensure that labeling office managers have the information they need to  oversee compliance with food labeling statutes and regulations by  maintaining, in a searchable format, data on food labeling violations,  including the type of violation and information about corrective actions  taken or, if no action was taken, the reason why;   analyzing violation data in routine management reports; and  tracking regulatory meetings related to food labeling violations and  analyzing whether regulatory meetings are an effective use of resources.", "Ensure that the public has timely access to information on food labeling  violations that may have serious health consequences by requiring all of the  centers and offices to post on FDA\u2019s public Web site, within a specified time  frame, key information, such as all warning letters; statistics on serious  enforcement actions (e.g., import refusals) by country, type of food, and the  problem found (e.g., undeclared allergen); and information (e.g., product  identification and exposure symptoms) on violations that FDA classifies as  serious.", "Better leverage resources to carry out food safety and other regulatory  responsibilities, including administering and enforcing labeling  requirements, by  providing Congress with specific, detailed information on the new  statutory authorities identified in the Food Protection Plan, such as the  authority to charge user fees, accredit third-party inspectors, and  mandate food recalls, with specific information on how these  authorities would help achieve its mission;  posting on FDA\u2019s public Web site periodic updates of the status of  implementation of the Food Protection Plan, including goals achieved  and time frames for completing the remaining work; and  collaborating with other federal agencies and stakeholders experienced  in nutrition and health issues, to evaluate labeling approaches and  options for developing a simplified, empirically valid system that  conveys overall nutritional quality to mitigate labels that are misleading  to consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.

It commented, however, that the report  inappropriately references food labeling as part of its food safety mission,  although it acknowledges that there may be some aspects of food labeling  that can affect the safe use of food. That notwithstanding, FDA directs  investigators to review at least three labels during food safety inspections.  Moreover, food labeling responsibilities are part of FDA\u2019s statutory mission,  and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and FDA\u2019s regulations set  out FDA\u2019s labeling responsibilities. FDA also stated that within its overall  public health mission, it has a multitude of competing priorities.

However, as we discuss in this report, FDA\u2019s target time for issuing warning  letters and posting them is 4 months after violations are found. Providing  information that is complete and timely can help the public avoid  potentially dangerous food and make healthy food purchase decisions. The  draft we sent to FDA for comment recommended that FDA post all recalls  to its public Web site in a timely manner. We eliminated recalls from this  recommendation because, in technical comments, FDA told us that the  recalls in CFSAN\u2019s unofficial database that we thought were missing from  RES were the result of coding differences.

Two are aimed at helping FDA keep the Food Protection Plan on track by  (1) providing specific, detailed information to Congress on how the new  authorities in the Food Protection Plan will help FDA achieve its mission  and (2) posting periodic updates on the status and time frames for  implementing the plan on FDA\u2019s public Web site. FDA stated that the plan  was designed to address food safety and defense concerns, although some  of the actions presented in it may have some bearing on food labeling  issues. It was not our intent to suggest that the plan\u2019s primary focus was on  food labeling; we have clarified this in the report.

Shalala Ruling", "paragraphs": ["The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) amended the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include provisions that govern  the use of health claims on food labeling. For conventional foods, the NLEA  requires that any claim that expressly or by implication characterizes the  relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related condition must be  authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (delegated to  FDA) through a regulation. Under the NLEA, FDA may authorize a health  claim for a conventional food if it determines, based on the totality of  publicly available scientific evidence, that there is \u201csignificant scientific  agreement\u201d among experts\u2014qualified by scientific training and experience  to evaluate such claims\u2014that the claim is supported by such evidence.  Although the NLEA also provided for the use of health claims in dietary  supplement labeling, Congress did not require dietary supplement health  claims to be subject to the same statutory procedures and standards as  conventional food health claims. Instead, dietary supplement health claims  were to be subject to procedures and standards established in regulations  issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (delegated to FDA).", "In 1991, FDA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register, proposing  the implementation of the statutory procedures and standards for health  claims for conventional food, and proposing to adopt those same  procedures and standards for dietary supplement health claims. However,  before the rule could be finalized, Congress passed legislation that  generally prohibited FDA from implementing the NLEA with respect to  dietary supplements until December 15, 1993. Therefore, in January of  1993, when FDA adopted the final rules for health claims for conventional  foods, it did not finalize rules for dietary supplement health claims.  However, 1 year later, after the prohibition of implementation of NLEA for  dietary supplements had expired, FDA adopted a rule that subjected  dietary supplement health claims to the same general requirements that  applied to conventional foods. Under those rules, any person wanting to  include a health claim on a conventional food or dietary supplement label  must petition FDA for authorization before including the claim on the label.  If FDA determines, based on the totality of publicly available information,  that there is significant scientific agreement in support of that claim, it will  authorize its use by issuing it in regulation.", "FDA\u2019s health claim regulations for dietary supplements were the subject of  several lawsuits in the 1990s. In a case known as Pearson v. Shalala, the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the First  Amendment does not permit FDA to prohibit a potentially misleading  health claim on the label of a dietary supplement, unless FDA considers  whether a disclaimer on the product\u2019s label could negate the potentially  misleading nature of that claim. Specifically, the court stated that although  inherently or actually misleading information in food labeling or  advertising may be prohibited, potentially misleading information cannot  face an absolute prohibition. Instead, potentially misleading information  may be regulated only if those regulations directly advance a substantial  government interest, and offer a reasonable fit between the government\u2019s  goals and the means chosen to accomplish those goals. The court found a  substantial interest in protecting the public health and preventing  consumer fraud. However, it found that FDA\u2019s regulation requiring health  claims to be supported by significant scientific agreement did not directly  advance the interest in public health, and, even though the regulations  directly advanced the interest in preventing consumer fraud, the fit  between the goals of the regulations and the means employed\u2014an outright  ban without the possibility of a disclaimer\u2014was not reasonable.", "Following the decision in Pearson, FDA announced its plan to respond,  stating that it would deny, without prejudice, all petitions for the use of  dietary supplement health claims that did not meet the significant scientific  agreement standard while the agency conducted and completed a  rulemaking to reconsider the procedures and standards governing such  claims. Then, according to FDA, once a rule was finalized, the agency  would revisit the petitions it had denied. However, in 2000, citing concerns  over additional First Amendment challenges, FDA announced plans to  modify that policy. FDA stated that it would continue to approve dietary  supplement health claims that met the significant scientific agreement  standard, but it would exercise its enforcement discretion and not take  action against dietary supplement health claims that failed to meet the  standard under certain circumstances. Specifically, upon the submission of  a valid petition for preapproval of a dietary supplement health claim, if  FDA did not find significant scientific agreement, but, in evaluating the  weight of the evidence, did find that the scientific evidence in support of  the claim outweighed the scientific evidence against it, and consumer  health and safety were not threatened, the agency would inform the  petitioner of conditions under which the agency would refrain from taking  enforcement action against the health claim. If the scientific evidence  against the health claim outweighed the scientific evidence in support of it,  FDA would deny any use of the health claim.", "Then, in 2002, the agency announced the availability of guidance, updating  its approach to implementing the Pearson decision. In large part, the  procedures remained the same; however, FDA included health claims for  conventional foods under the procedures, even though the Pearson case  directly addressed only dietary supplements. FDA stated that it believed  that such a move would precipitate greater communication in food labeling  and thereby enhance public health. In addition, FDA stated that including  health claims for conventional foods in its enforcement discretion policy  would help avoid further constitutional challenges. Subsequently, in 2003,  FDA announced the availability of two new guidance documents describing  interim procedures that, among other things, addressed a then recent U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia decision that found the weight of  the evidence standard that FDA first articulated in guidance in 2000 was  inappropriate. According to the district court in that case, FDA should  evaluate qualified health claims based on the presence of \u201ccredible  evidence,\u201d not the weight of the evidence. The 2003 guidance documents  set forth new procedures for qualified health claims for conventional foods  and dietary supplements. Specifically, qualified health claim petitions  would be evaluated using an evidence-based ranking system that would  rate the strength of the publicly available scientific evidence. A claim  would be denied if there was no credible evidence to support it. Otherwise,  based on the competent and reliable scientific evidence in support, a claim  would be assigned to one of four ranked levels\u2014the first level being  \u201csignificant scientific agreement among qualified experts\u201d and the  remaining three levels being for claims supported by some lower level of  credible evidence. Each of the three categories not ranked as supported by  significant scientific agreement would correspond to one of three  standardized qualifying statements (i.e., disclaimers). So long as the  qualified health claim bore the appropriate language, met other applicable  health claim regulations, and adhered to criteria established in FDA\u2019s letter  of enforcement discretion in response to the petition, FDA would exercise  its enforcement discretion and refrain from acting against the health claim.", "In November of 2003, FDA published an Advance Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking, recognizing the need to establish transparent, long-term  procedures that have the effect of law. In that announcement, FDA  presented several regulatory alternatives: (1) incorporate the interim  procedures and evidence-based ranking system we have previously  discussed into regulation; (2) subject health claims to notice-and-comment  rulemaking, as before Pearson, but reinterpret the \u201csignificant scientific  agreement\u201d standard to refer to the evidence supporting the claim being  made, instead of the underlying substance-disease relationship; or (3) treat  qualified health claims as outside the NLEA and regulate them on a  postmarket basis (i.e., pursue the product as misbranded if the health claim  renders the label false or misleading because the claim lacks  substantiation). FDA does not plan to work on this proposed rulemaking  this year. In May of 2006, FDA issued guidance concerning FDA\u2019s  implementation of qualified health claims process. In that guidance, FDA  reaffirmed the 2003 interim procedures and stated that \u201cFDA is currently  considering various options regarding the development of proposed  regulations related to qualified health claims,\u201d and \u201c\u2026n the meantime,  the agency plans to review qualified health claim petitions on a case-by- case basis.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Food and Drug Administration", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Health and  Human Service\u2019s (HHS) letter dated August 19, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. FDA commented that the report did not place food labeling in the  appropriate context, given FDA\u2019s overall public health mission and  competing priorities. We believe the food labeling responsibilities are  part of that mission. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  specifically describes FDA\u2019s mission to include protecting the public  health by, among other things, ensuring that \u201cfoods are safe,  wholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled.\u201d FDA also commented that  the report failed to account for all the varied initiatives that FDA and  HHS have undertaken to fight obesity and ensure that foods are labeled  in a manner that fosters consumer education and healthy choices. The  subject of this report is food labeling, not obesity. With respect to  labeling initiatives to help consumers make healthy food choices, the  report identifies several areas where stakeholders believe that FDA  falls short.  2. Although FDA said that it does not consider food labeling part of its  food safety mission, it does include reviewing labels as a required step  in a food safety inspection. Also, overseeing industry compliance with  labeling requirements is part of FDA\u2019s food oversight responsibilities  and labeling laws help consumers ensure that the food they buy is safe  for them eat. That said, since FDA made this distinction, we revised the  wording in some places in the final report. 3. FDA took issue with the report\u2019s frequent references to the Food  Protection Plan. FDA stated that the plan was developed to address  food safety and defense, although it may have some bearing on food  labeling issues. It was not our intent to suggest that the plan\u2019s primary  focus was on food labeling, and we have clarified this in the report. The  report discusses the Plan\u2019s potential to help FDA carry out its food  regulatory responsibilities and discusses certain provisions that, if  implemented, may be useful tools in monitoring and enforcing the food  labeling requirements.  4. FDA correctly noted that the report does not evaluate how efficiently  FDA used its resources or the impact of its changing priorities,  although we did examine resources for food labeling. For example, the  report provides 10 years of budget data on FDA, with detailed data for  each center, including (1) total staffing and funding, (2) the portion of  Office of Regulatory Affairs\u2019 staffing and funding for inspections and  other oversight, and (3) staffing and funding supported by user fees.  However, because FDA was not able to provide risk-based priority  plans or annual work projections for all labeling activities, we could not  determine how efficiently labeling resources were used or the impact  of changing priorities on labeling.  5. FDA contended that most misleading food labeling violations do not  present a high risk to public health. However, FDA has not conducted  the research to identify which food labels are misleading and therefore  has little or no basis for determining the health impacts of misleading  labeling violations.  6. FDA commented that it does not believe that tracking and analyzing  data and providing routine reports on food labeling violations is the  best use of its resources, given competing priorities. We maintain that  risk-based decisions, such as allocating resources effectively, must  include careful analysis of this type of data on regulatory programs.  Moreover, FDA already collects most of these data so resource  investment to generate the reports should be minimal and worth the  benefits of ensuring that managers\u2019 decisions are well-informed and  risk-based. As FDA rolls out several initiatives for improving its  information technology systems, which it states are under way, HHS  may want to provide FDA managers with training on using the systems  as management tools. 7. FDA said it agreed that being able to track any and all information that  would allow its investigators to better do their jobs would be useful to  the agency, but that data collection requires time and effort. FDA  continued, it is important to make sure that data entry does not become  so burdensome that it takes away from other investigative work.  However, as we previously noted, FDA already collects most of these  data. With a small resource investment, analyzing these data in reports  can help managers make more informed decisions.  8. FDA implied that it may not have the resources to keep data on the  public Web site up to date. However, providing consumers with  information that is timely and complete can help them avoid potentially  dangerous food and make healthy food purchases. 9. FDA commented that the report suggests in several places that the only  context in which FDA detains food is under the Bioterrorism Act, and  that that FDA has another type of detention authority that applies to  imported articles. However, the report does discuss FDA\u2019s other  detention authority under section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act. The report refers to these actions as \u201cimport refusals,\"  which is the term that FDA currently uses for these enforcement  actions. We added a footnote in the text to note this.  10. FDA's statement\u2014that its survey indicated that 70 percent of adults  said they look at the Nutrition Facts panel the first time they purchase a  food\u2014is misleading.  In that survey, 44 percent of respondents told  FDA that they \"often\" read the panel the first time they purchase a food,  and 25 percent \"sometimes\" read the panel at that time; while 31  percent \"rarely\" or \"never\" read the panel.   11. FDA commented that (1) court decisions, beginning with Pearson v.", "Shalala, hold that the First Amendment precludes FDA from  prohibiting the use of qualified health claims unless FDA can show that  the claim is inherently misleading, or if the claim is only potentially  misleading, that the use of a disclaimer would not remedy the claim\u2019s  potential to mislead, and (2) that absent consumer research or other  evidence that satisfies the criteria set by the court in Pearson v.  Shalala, FDA does not have the authority to eliminate qualified health  claims as a class of claims. We added language to the report to  acknowledge FDA\u2019s position.  12. FDA commented that, contrary to our report, FDA\u2019s 2005 and 2007  qualified health claims experiments did not find that qualified health  claims might encourage the consumption of foods with little or no  health benefits. Our report states that, according to the stakeholders  we consulted, \u201c\u2026 these claims confuse or mislead consumers and may  encourage consumption of foods with little or no health benefits.\u201d  It  then states that \u201chis view was supported by findings from 2005 and  2007 FDA studies.\u201d  This statement is consistent with FDA\u2019s findings.  According to its public Web site, those studies on qualified health  claims found  that \u201cqualifying statements \u2026 were not understood by  consumers\u201d and \u201ceven when \u2026 understood as intended, qualifying  statements had unexpected effects on consumers\u2019 judgments about the  health benefits and overall healthfulness \u2026. \u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Erin Lansburgh, Assistant  Director; Beverly Peterson, Analyst-in-Charge; Kevin S.
