GAO identified six types of payment risks associated with managed care, including four related to payments that state Medicaid agencies make to MCOs, and two related to payments that MCOs make to providers.

However,  oversight of managed care is critical to achieving these goals. Payment  risks are not eliminated under managed care; in fact, they are more  complex and difficult to oversee. While CMS has taken important steps to  improve program integrity in managed care\u2014including strengthening  regulations, developing guidance for states on provider enrollment in  Medicaid managed care, and beginning to include managed care in the  monitoring and auditing process\u2014the efforts remain incomplete, because  of delays and limited implementation. To date, CMS has not issued its  planned compendium with guidance on program integrity in Medicaid  managed care, taken steps to address known factors limiting  collaborative audits, or developed a process to help ensure that  overpayments to providers are identified by the states. Without taking  actions to address these issues, CMS is missing an opportunity to  develop more robust program integrity safeguards that will best mitigate  payment risks in managed care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations For Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to CMS:", "The Administrator of CMS should expedite the planned efforts to  communicate guidance, such as its compendium on Medicaid  managed care program integrity, to state stakeholders related to  Medicaid managed care program integrity.

Figures 6 through 9 below  illustrate the risk level stakeholders assigned to the four types of payment  risk that are associated with states\u2019 periodic capitation payments to  MCOs. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the risk level stakeholders assigned  the two types of payment risks associated with MCO payments to  providers. In some cases, stakeholders said they did not have enough  information to assign a level of risk (\u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d) or that one of the  payment risks did not apply in their state (\u201cNot applicable\u201d).", "For some payment risks, the stakeholders whose primary responsibility is  program integrity\u2014state auditors, MFCU officials, and state Medicaid  program integrity staff\u2014were more likely to assign a higher level of risk  than state Medicaid managed care officials and MCO officials who have  responsibilities both for program operation and program integrity. For  example, some of the risk levels cited in our interviews by state auditors,  MFCU officials, and state Medicaid program integrity staff included the  following:", "State auditors most frequently cited improper state capitation  payments as high risk in the state.", "Three state auditors identified duplicate state payments as high  risk.", "Just over half of all state auditors, MFCU officials, and state  Medicaid program integrity staff identified inaccurate state  capitation rates as some or high risk.", "In contrast, state Medicaid managed care officials and MCO officials were  less likely to assign high risk to payment types. Some examples include  the following:", "No state Medicaid managed care officials cited a high level of risk  for any of the six payment types.", "Two MCO officials cited a high level of risk for incorrect MCO fee- for-service payments. No other MCO officials cited a high level of  risk for any of the other payment types.", "Stakeholder views on the risk level of different payment risks are outlined  in the figures that follow.", "Improper state capitation payments may occur when the state makes  monthly capitation payments to an MCO for beneficiaries who are  ineligible for or not enrolled in Medicaid, or who have died.

Data issues could include inaccurate encounter  data, unallowable costs, overpayments that are not adjusted for in the  rate, or older data that do not reflect changes in care delivery practices  that affect MCO costs.
