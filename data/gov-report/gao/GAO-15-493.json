Such assistance has been provided through three main programs: Section 1206 and Section 1207(n), which have been used to build Yemeni capacity, and FMF, which has been used to maintain equipment provided to Yemen.", "A Senate report included a provision for GAO to review U.S. security assistance to Yemen.

In light of Yemen's currently unstable situation, security assistance programs to Yemen are temporarily suspended.", "After correcting errors in DOD data, GAO determined that at least 60 percent of the Section 1206 and 1207(n) assistance from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 was timely, but delays affected 10 of 11 projects. DOD notified Congress that all training and equipment for each project would be transferred to Yemeni security forces within DOD's established deadline of 18 months. However, DOD's data contained inaccurate information regarding when the congressional notification period ended, which clears DOD to implement these projects. The inaccurate data limit DOD's and third parties' ability to readily assess the extent to which these projects met the 18-month deadline or to report to Congress on the status of assistance projects. Specifically, after correcting errors in DOD data, GAO found that at least 60 percent of the items were transferred on time, 4 percent of the items were late, and the remaining 36 percent of items were shipped but DOD's data system did not have information on when they were transferred to Yemen. The 4 percent of late items were arrayed among 10 of 11 projects.", "DOD plans for short-term (i.e., 2 years) maintenance needs for Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects and has resumed requesting the source and amount of long-term maintenance funds. A presidential directive and DOD guidance call for long-term maintenance planning, regardless of the partner country's ability to contribute. From fiscal years 2011 through 2014, DOD requested specific information on the amount and source of anticipated U.S. maintenance funding, if any, in the Section 1206 project proposal template. The fiscal year 2015 template did not request such information, but after reviewing a draft of GAO's report, DOD provided a copy of its fiscal year 2016 template, which requests additional information on long-term maintenance plans.

To help combat AQAP, U.S.  agencies have allocated more than $500 million to Yemeni security forces  since fiscal year 2006. Much of this funding has been through the Section  1206 and 1207(n) programs. Political instability in Yemen has further  complicated U.S. efforts to combat the threats emanating out of Yemen.  In January 2015, the Houthis, a northern Shiite tribal group, consolidated  control of significant territory in Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa. In  response to growing security threats, in February 2015, the Department  of State (State) temporarily suspended operations and removed all staff  from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa. In March 2015, the Department of  Defense (DOD) removed its last remaining staff in Yemen. Security  assistance programs in Yemen are temporarily suspended.", "Given the threats emanating from Yemen and the significant U.S.  investment in assistance to Yemen, a 2014 Senate report included a  provision for GAO to review U.S. security assistance to Yemen. This  report examines (1) the disbursement of funds allocated for key security  assistance programs for Yemen since 2009, (2) the timeliness of Section  1206 and 1207(n) assistance, and (3) DOD\u2019s plans for maintaining  equipment provided to Yemen under Section 1206 and 1207(n).", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed relevant national  security strategies, key congressional legislation, and agency planning  documents related to U.S. security assistance to Yemen. We analyzed  funding data including allocations, obligations, and disbursements for  Yemen from fiscal years 2009 through 2014. We also reviewed DOD and  State documents and analyzed DOD transfer data against criteria  identified in congressional notifications. Specifically, in these  congressional notifications, DOD described the 15 fiscal year 2006-2014  Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects it intended to implement and  established an 18-month deadline for transferring all equipment and  completing all training related to the projects to Yemeni security forces.  This 18-month process begins on the date the congressional notification  period ends, which is at least 15 days after DOD notifies the designated  congressional committees, making this date essential for assessing  timeliness. During the course of our review, we found inaccuracies in  DOD\u2019s data regarding the date when the congressional notification  periods ended. We therefore used the congressional notification letters  and legislation to determine the earliest possible date that the  congressional notification period could have ended for each project. For  the transfer date, we found that DOD\u2019s data were sufficiently reliable. We  used these two dates\u2014the congressional notification period end date,  and the transfer date\u2014to determine the timeliness of transfer of Section  1206 and 1207(n) equipment. The 4 fiscal year 2014 projects had  deadlines that have not yet passed, therefore, we assessed timeliness for  the 11 fiscal years 2009-2013 Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects, which  consisted of 4,323 line items.", "We also examined plans for maintenance in Section 1206 and 1207(n)  project proposals, analyzed executed projects for the inclusion of  maintenance training and spare parts, and analyzed plans to finance and  provide future maintenance support to Yemeni security forces.

As figure 1 shows,  Yemen shares a land border with Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, and a  maritime border with a critical shipping lane connecting the Red Sea and  the Arabian Sea. The most impoverished country in the Middle East and  North Africa region, Yemen is experiencing a rapidly growing population,  which is estimated at about 25 million; increasing scarcity of natural  resources, including water; the steady decline of oil, its primary export;  extremely high unemployment; and dwindling revenues that decrease the  government\u2019s ability to fund basic operations. Moreover, Yemen is a safe  haven for the terrorist group AQAP, which has been reported as al  Qaeda\u2019s most active affiliate, and which the Commander of the U.S.  military\u2019s Central Command identified as one of the most dangerous al  Qaeda affiliates.", "Adding to these challenges, Yemen faces political instability following the  unrest of the 2011 Arab Spring, an ongoing Houthi insurgency, and a  southern separatist movement. In early 2011, mass protests began  against the 33-year regime of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, resulting in  his removal from office later that year, transferring power to his Vice  President, Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi, who was subsequently elected  president in February 2012. Since coming to power, President Hadi has  faced numerous challenges. In 2014, the Houthis, a northern Shiite tribal  group, gained control of significant territory in Yemen, which led to their  control of the capital, the seizure of key military bases, and control over  key port facilities. According to State, as of March 2015, President Hadi  had relocated to Saudi Arabia, where he continues his duties as  President. The unstable security situation led State to temporarily  suspend operations and remove all staff from the U.S. embassy in Sanaa.  Other countries have also stopped operations at their embassies.", "According to State, the overarching objective of U.S. policy in Yemen is a  successful democratic transition that promotes political, economic, and  security sector reforms that will enable the Yemeni government to  respond to the needs and aspirations of its people. National strategies  related to broad U.S. counterterrorism and security assistance goals  identify building partnership capacity as a key component of the U.S.  counterterrorism strategy. Such strategies also stress a whole-of- government approach and synchronization of U.S. efforts across  government agencies.", "Prior to the current instability, to assist in countering the AQAP threat,  since fiscal year 2006, State and DOD have collectively allocated over  $500 million in security assistance to Yemen through DOD\u2019s Section 1206  and Section 1207(n) programs and State\u2019s Foreign Military Financing  (FMF) program. As seen in table 1, these programs have various goals,  including building the capacity of military forces to conduct  counterterrorism operations. In June 2014, State and DOD began an  interagency effort to evaluate security assistance goals and priorities for  Yemen, including how to employ the funding sources available in concert  to build Yemeni security force capacity.

These  dates are needed to determine whether equipment and training is  transferred to Yemen on time.", "First, the date the congressional notification period ends is the date when  DOD begins implementing projects to meet the 18-month transfer  deadline, making it an essential starting point for assessing timeliness.  For 11 of the 15 Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects notified to Congress  from fiscal years 2009 through 2014, DOD data contained inaccurate  dates for when the congressional notification period ended, which we had  to correct in order to assess timeliness.

Further, DOD was only able to produce the documentation  needed to correct one of these dates. We confirmed that DOD did not  implement any cases prior to the legally mandated 15-day notification  period. However, the inaccurate data limit the ability of DOD and others to  effectively assess the extent to which Section 1206 and 1207(n)  assistance is transferred to Yemen on time or report to Congress on the  status of assistance projects.", "Second, in order to determine whether the process for providing  assistance met the 18-month deadline, it is essential to know when the  equipment and training finally reached the Yemeni security forces (i.e. the  transfer date). Although DOD collects data on the dates when Section  1206 and 1207(n) equipment first ships, its data systems do not contain  complete information on when the training and equipment are finally  transferred to the Yemeni security forces. Each of the 11 projects for  which we assessed timeliness contained some line items for which the  final transfer date was not documented in the data. DOD data indicated  that these items were usually shipped in less than 18 months, although  the items may have stopped at various waypoints and their date of final  transfer cannot be determined. As a result, timeliness for those items  could not be determined.", "Our previous work has identified similar issues related to the quality of  DOD\u2019s data on the delivery of security assistance programs, including  Section 1206 and 1207(n). Specifically, we reported in 2012 that DOD  data on the status of fiscal years 2007 through 2011 security assistance  deliveries had information gaps such as missing information on the dates  items departed U.S. shipping locations, and the date of receipt at the final  destination. As a result, we recommended that DOD establish procedures  to help ensure that DOD implementing agencies populate these data  systems with complete data. In response to our recommendation, in May  2014, DOD updated its security assistance management manual to  require security cooperation officers to report the delivery of equipment in  DOD data systems within 30 days of delivery, programmed its systems to  update shipment tracking information more frequently, and developed  plans to ensure that accurate and timely delivery status information will be  maintained in a new information system that DOD is developing.", "DOD officials also reported that it has taken steps to address the gaps in  transfer data for Sections 1206 and 1207(n) for Yemen, and we found  evidence of recent improvements when we analyzed the data. For the  fiscal year 2009 and 2010 projects, the final transfer dates were available  for only 3 percent of items, whereas the final transfer dates were available  for 91 percent of the fiscal year 2012 and 2013 projects. Further, DOD  officials reported that since fiscal year 2013, DOD has automated more of  the data collection and hired additional personnel to manually enter the  remaining data.

These include security- related factors, partner country factors, and logistical factors.", "Security-related factors. Because of the ongoing security threats in  Yemen, ports of entry have had periods of limited accessibility and the  U.S. embassy has had periods of reduced staffing. For example, prior  to the suspension of operations at the embassy in February 2015,  officials from the U.S. Office of Military Cooperation in Sanaa  responsible for transferring equipment to Yemeni security forces  indicated that it could take hours to conduct the required inventories of  equipment prior to its transfer. However, at various points in the past,  spending hours at an airport or seaport was considered too  dangerous and arranging for protection and transportation was time- consuming. As a result, some inventories\u2014and therefore transfers\u2014 of equipment were delayed. In addition, DOD has intentionally  delayed deliveries in response to security threats. When protests  threatened security in 2011, DOD delayed delivery of one CN-235  aircraft, keeping it in Spain rather than delivering it to an uncertain  security environment. In November 2014, when Houthis seized control  of the port in Al Hudaydah, embassy officials worked with DOD to  delay a shipment of equipment for the 2013 Section 1206 Integrated  Border and Maritime Security project.", "Partner country factors. Yemeni officials must be available to receive  the security assistance being delivered, yet political transitions and  cultural factors have affected their availability. For example, DOD  notified Congress of a Section 1207(n) project in June 2012.", "However, as Yemeni security forces reorganized following the  transition from President Saleh to President Hadi, the recipient unit  within the Yemeni Ministry of Interior was not expanded as planned.  As a result, in July 2014, 2 years after the original project was  planned, DOD and State identified a new recipient and re-notified  Congress of their plan to redirect almost $58 million of the originally  notified $75 million in training and equipment. While many items were  delivered within 18 months, other items were not shipped until after  the re-notification, including sensitive equipment such as night vision  goggles, which embassy officials preferred to keep secure in U.S.  warehouses until the new Yemeni recipient was identified. As of  December 2014, U.S. embassy officials stated that all associated  equipment had been delivered to Yemen and most was being held in  Yemeni security force warehouses so human rights training could be  provided before transfer.", "DOD officials also reported that religious holidays and language  barriers have sometimes resulted in delayed deliveries and transfers  of equipment. Officials said they have had to delay deliveries of  security assistance to avoid transferring equipment during the month  of Ramadan, when Yemeni security forces responsible for receiving  transferred equipment are likely to be observing religious practices.  Officials also reported having delayed training because of the limited  number of English speakers among the Yemeni security forces  members with whom DOD officials work to complete transfers, as well  as among forces scheduled to receive the training.", "Logistical factors. DOD officials reported that several logistical factors  have led to delays in transfers of equipment to Yemen, such as  paperwork errors, customs challenges, challenges presented by the  type of delivery vehicle used (sea versus air), as well as lengthy  equipment procurement timeframes and competing worldwide  procurement and shipment prioritizations. For example, a CN-235  aircraft was transferred more than 3 years after congressional  notification, in part because of a lengthy procurement process, in  addition to country and security factors described earlier. In April  2010, DOD notified Congress of the plan to transfer the aircraft and  associated training and spare parts within 18 months. However, the  aircraft was ultimately transferred to Yemeni security forces in  September 2013\u2014more than 41 months after congressional  notification. Officials reported that procurement was delayed and,  although the contract was complete by September 2010, the aircraft  cost more than originally anticipated. As a result of this discovery late  in the fiscal year, DOD determined that the funding allocated to the  project would be used to cover the costs of the aircraft and a new  project would be developed with additional funding to provide the  training and 2 years of spare parts that had been included in the  original project. The transfer of the aircraft and training was further  delayed because of political unrest in 2011.", "To address some of these factors and other challenges DOD previously  identified with shipping equipment for building partner capacity programs,  such as Section 1206 and 1207(n), DOD began using the JCP in  Pennsylvania in 2010. DOD officials report that the JCP is used to  consolidate equipment, generate additional data on equipment that  transits there, and ensure that the equipment is accompanied by  documents designed to improve customs processing and transfer  processes in Yemen. DOD officials report that the JCP helps ensure that  equipment that passes through the point is documented in DOD data and  includes sufficient documentation to aid its clearance through customs  and efficient transfer to partner country security forces, including those in  Yemen.", "DOD assessments and DOD officials from the Office of Military  Cooperation in Sanaa reported that the JCP has improved the timeliness  of security assistance for Yemen. Our analysis of DOD data for security  assistance for Yemen from fiscal years 2009 from 2013 indicated that  equipment that passed through the JCP stayed there for an average of  about 10 months. JCP officials noted a number of criteria used to  determine when to time the shipments from the JCP to Yemen.  Specifically, officials reported that they work to balance delivering  equipment in a timely manner to address critical needs with making  efficient use of each shipment and trying to fill an entire government- contracted aircraft. They also aim, in consultation with the U.S. Office of  Military Cooperation in Sanaa, to deliver complete capabilities in one  delivery and to time these deliveries so training can begin on those  capabilities rather than delaying deliveries and training until shipment  processing of equipment for other capabilities is complete. Further, DOD  officials reported that DOD has conducted weekly teleconferences with  U.S. officials in Sanaa and has surveyed these officials following each  equipment transfer to determine their satisfaction with the timing of  shipments and transfers of security assistance, as well as identifying the  embassy\u2019s priorities for future transfers. In addition, in December 2014,  DOD conducted a review with U.S. Central Command and the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low- Intensity Conflict to assess the extent to which these stakeholders were  satisfied with the transfer timeliness for each Section 1206 and 1207(n)  project whose deadlines had passed from fiscal years 2009 through 2013,  including equipment that passed through the JCP.

We discussed  U.S. strategies, programs, and activities related to security assistance to  Yemen with U.S. officials from DOD, the Department of State (State), the  U.S. embassy in Yemen, and the intelligence community. We planned to  travel to Yemen but were unable to do so because of Yemen\u2019s unstable  security environment during the time of our review.

DOD and State provided data on allocations,  amounts reallocated, unobligated balances, unliquidated obligations, and  either disbursements of Section 1206 and 1207(n) funds or commitments  of FMF funds. We analyzed these data to determine the extent to which  funds from these three programs had been disbursed or committed.

We used these sources to describe the key steps in the  process for shipping assistance to Yemen and associated timelines. In  the congressional notifications, DOD described the Section 1206 and  1207(n) projects it intended to implement and established an 18-month  deadline for transferring all equipment and services related to the projects  to Yemeni security forces. The process includes two dates that are key  to assessing whether DOD has met its 18-month deadline: the date the  congressional notification period ends, allowing DOD to begin  implementing a project, and the date the equipment and training are  transferred to Yemeni security forces.", "During the course of our review, we found inaccuracies in DOD\u2019s data  regarding the congressional notification period and omissions in the data  regarding the transfer dates. DOD notified Congress of plans to  implement 15 Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects in fiscal years 2009  through 2014. For two-thirds of these projects, DOD data contained  inaccurate congressional notification clearance dates\u2014the initial step in  the 18-month shipment and transfer process. However, using the  legislation and copies of congressional notifications, we were able to  calculate the earliest possible dates DOD could have started  implementing the Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects. We obtained  documents indicating the dates when DOD notified Congress of its  planned Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects for Yemen, added the  required minimum of 15 days to those dates, and used these new dates  as the start of the 18-month deadline. We then used DOD data on  shipments and transfers of equipment and training to assess the extent to  which security assistance was transferred to Yemeni security forces  within 18 months. However, as we relied on the earliest possible dates  DOD could have begun implementing the projects, and the 18-month  timeline starts at implementation, our analysis may understate the  timeliness of transfers as, in some cases, implementation could have  begun several days afterwards because Congress may have requested  additional information that delayed the start.", "Of the 15 Section 1206 and 1207(n) projects notified to Congress in fiscal  years 2009 through 2014, 11 had deadlines that had already passed at  the time of our review; we did not assess timeliness for the remaining 4  projects because their deadlines had not yet passed. We assessed  timeliness for the 11 fiscal years 2009 through 2013 Section 1206 and  1207(n) projects, which consisted of a total of 4,323 line items. Projects  ranged from 1 line item to 1,897 line items. DOD data contained dates for  the final transfer of equipment for 62 percent of the line items related to  fiscal years 2009 through 2013 Section 1206/1207(n) projects. For the  remaining 38 percent, we calculated whether shipment took place prior to  established transfer deadlines. DOD data were current as of January 7,  2015. Shipment indicates the first step in the process of shipping items,  though equipment may stop at various waypoints between initial shipment  and final transfer to Yemeni security forces. We used the following criteria  for classifying the timeliness of items:", "On time: The transfer date fell on or before the 18-month deadline.", "Late: The transfer date fell after the 18-month deadline, or\u2014for items  lacking a transfer date\u2014the shipment date fell after the 18-month  deadline for transfer.", "Cannot determine: The shipment date that fell prior to the 18-month  deadline but no transfer date was documented. Such items may have  been transferred on time, they may have been late, or they may not  have been transferred yet. Discussions with DOD officials and review  of DOD documents indicated that some of these items were ultimately  transferred on time and some were transferred late, but the transfer  dates were not included in the data. DOD also shipped some items to  its Joint Consolidation Point in Pennsylvania or other waypoints en  route to Yemen and then held the equipment at those waypoints  because of security concerns, leaving these items without transfer  dates because transfer has not yet occurred.", "To assess the reliability of the transfer dates that DOD provided, we  interviewed cognizant officials about their processes for entering data,  performed basic logic checks, and spot-checked receipts that DOD  provided for certain items that had been transferred. Based on our  assessment, we determined that the transfer data in the database were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. DOD officials noted several reasons  38 percent of data were missing transfer dates, including the failure of  security cooperation officers to enter the dates in the data system, or the  failure of vendors delivering large items directly to Yemen to submit the  relevant information. They reported that DOD began efforts to address  these challenges in 2012. In fact, for the fiscal years 2009 and 2010  projects in our review, the final transfer dates were only available for 3  percent of items, whereas transfer dates were available for 91 percent of  the fiscal year 2012 and 2013 projects. Our previous work has identified  similar issues related to the quality of DOD\u2019s data on the delivery of  security assistance programs, including Section 1206 and 1207(n). In  2012, we recommended that DOD establish procedures to help ensure  that DOD implementing agencies populate these data systems with  complete data. In response to our recommendation, in May 2014, DOD  updated its security assistance management manual to require security  cooperation officers to report the delivery of equipment in DOD data  systems within 30 days of delivery, programmed its systems to update  shipment tracking information more frequently, and developed plans to  ensure that accurate and timely delivery status information will be  maintained in a new information system that DOD is developing.", "We assessed the other variables that we used, namely the project titles,  lines items, and project year, by crosschecking them against information  from DOD officials, congressional notifications, and other DOD  documents to determine that they were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. However, we determined that the data on the value of each line  item were not sufficiently reliable to determine timeliness by percentage  of dollar value transferred per project. Therefore, in table 4 of this report  (see app. II), we report overall project allocation and descriptions of each  project. In addition, as noted above, our estimates may understate  timeliness because we estimated based on the earliest possible  implementation dates rather than the actual implementation dates.", "To analyze the extent to which equipment provided to Yemen under  Section 1206 and 1207(n) has been maintained, we examined legislation,  presidential directive, and agency guidance to determine the  requirements for short- and long-term maintenance planning.

Rather, DOD\u2019s response highlights changes DSCA  made in fiscal year 2013 to improve overall data collection, including a  discussion of the Joint Consolidation Point. We found improvements  in DOD\u2019s data on transfer dates for Sections 1206 and 1207(n)  assistance to Yemen, but we continue to believe DOD needs to take  steps to ensure that accurate dates for congressional clearance are  reflected in its data systems.  2.  DOD concurred with our recommendation but suggested that our  analysis of sustainment costs did not reflect the full picture. After  reviewing a draft of our report, DOD provided updated documentation,  including the fiscal year 2016 Section 1206 project proposal template.  We have updated the report to include additional information,  including information regarding the fiscal year 2016 project proposal  template.  The fiscal year 2016 template addresses our concerns by  asking for information on the source of any U.S. funding if a partner  country is not expected to fully cover the costs of long-term  maintenance. We have thus removed this recommendation from the  final report.  3.  DOD asserted that our timeliness assessment should have focused  on larger end items. Our report acknowledged that, in some cases,  large end items were transferred within the 18 months and that this  focus on key capabilities is a priority for DOD. Other large end items\u2014 such as the CN-235 aircraft that was transferred more than 41 months  after congressional notification\u2014were late. In addition, as noted in our  report, in its notifications to Congress, DOD has stated that all  deliveries will be complete within 18 months. DOD has not indicated in  these notifications that this deadline applies only to what it considers  to be the main components. Further, DOD\u2019s data lack final transfer  dates for larger end items as well as for smaller ones. Finally, as  noted in our report, DOD data on the key dates related to timeliness  were not sufficiently reliable at levels other than the requisition-level,  and the data on dollar value at this level of detail were not available.
