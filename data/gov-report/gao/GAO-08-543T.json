GAO was also asked to provide an update on the implementation status of its recommendations and to comment on provisions of the proposed Federal Agency Data Protection Act. In preparing this testimony, GAO relied primarily on its April 2006 report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State and the Social Security Administration reported that they used personal information obtained from resellers for a variety of purposes, including performing criminal investigations, locating witnesses and fugitives, researching assets held by individuals of interest, and detecting prescription drug fraud. The agencies planned spending approximately $30 million on contractual arrangements with resellers that enabled the acquisition and use of such information. About 91 percent of the planned fiscal year 2005 spending was for law enforcement (69 percent) or counterterrorism (22 percent). Agency practices for handling personal information acquired from information resellers did not always fully reflect the Fair Information Practices. That is, for some of these principles, agency practices were uneven. For example, although agencies issued public notices when they systematically collected personal information, these notices did not always notify the public that information resellers were among the sources to be used. This practice is not consistent with the principle that individuals should be informed about privacy policies and the collection of information. Contributing to the uneven application of the Fair Information Practices are ambiguities in guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding the applicability of privacy requirements to federal agency uses of reseller information. In addition, agencies generally lacked policies that specifically address these uses. GAO made recommendations to OMB to revise privacy guidance and to the four agencies to develop specific policies for the use of personal information from resellers. The five agencies generally agreed with the report and described actions initiated to address the recommendations. Since GAO issued its report, agencies have taken steps to address the recommendations. For example, the Department of Homeland Security Privacy Office incorporated specific questions in its May 2007 Privacy Impact Assessment guidance concerning use of commercial data. In addition, the Department of Justice took steps to update its public notices to specify their use of data from information resellers. OMB, however, has not implemented GAO's recommendation to clarify guidance on use of commercial data. The Federal Agency Data Protection Act was introduced on December 18, 2007. The legislation, among other things would require that agencies (1) conduct privacy impact assessments for their uses of commercial data, and (2) promulgate regulations concerning the use of commercial data brokers. GAO considers these requirements to be consistent with the results and the recommendations made to the agencies in its 2006 report"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This  is  a  work  of  the  U.S.  government  and  is  not  subject  to  copyright  protection  in  the  United  States.

A PIA is an  analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared,  and managed in a federal system. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires  that the use of personal information be limited to predefined  purposes and involve only information germane to those purposes.  The provisions of the Privacy Act, in turn, are largely based on a set  of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal  information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were  first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee.

Such a requirement could more readily ensure agencies  perform these assessments. Further, since OMB has not clarified its  guidance on this issue, a requirement in law could provide needed  direction to agencies.", "The proposed Federal Agency Data Protection Act would also  require each agency to prescribe regulations that specify, among  other things, the personnel permitted to access, analyze, or  otherwise use commercial reseller databases. This legislation is  consistent with our recommendation that agencies develop policies  concerning their use of personal information from information  resellers.", "In summary, services provided by information resellers are  important to federal agency functions such as law enforcement and  fraud protection and identification. While agencies have taken steps  to adhere to some Fair Information Practices such as the collection  limitation, data quality, use limitation, and security safeguards  principles, they have not taken all the steps they could to reflect  others\u2014or to use the specific processes of the Privacy Act and E- Government Act requirements\u2014in their handling of reseller data.  Because OMB privacy guidance does not clearly address  information reseller data, agencies are left largely on their own to  determine how to satisfy legal requirements and protect privacy  when acquiring and using reseller data. Since we issued our report  in 2006, two of the four agencies have taken steps to address our  recommendations. However, OMB has not modified its guidance.  Without current and specific guidance, the government risks  continued uneven adherence to important, well-established privacy  principles and lacks assurance that the privacy rights of individuals  are being adequately protected. Absent action from OMB to revise  guidance, privacy provisions contained in the proposed Federal  Agency Data Protection Act could clarify the need to conduct  privacy impact assessments wherever reseller data are involved and  promote the development of agency policies and procedures  concerning the use of such data. We believe these provisions are  consistent with the results and recommendations contained in our  2006 report.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony today.
