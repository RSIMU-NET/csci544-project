One of IRS\u2019s strategic goals is to ensure taxpayer compliance, but the agency lacks current measures of taxpayers\u2019 voluntary compliance. Having such measures would give IRS an understanding of current compliance levels and help to identify steps that are likely to lead to improved compliance.", "There are three types of voluntary compliance measures: filing compliance, which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner; payment compliance, which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner; and reporting compliance, which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns. Although IRS\u2019s NRP plans include reviews of all three types of compliance, the majority of their efforts have been devoted to the development of reporting compliance measurement procedures. Reporting compliance is also the only aspect of NRP that will include audits of taxpayers.", "For many years, IRS has periodically used random audits of tax returns to measure the level of voluntary reporting compliance. However, IRS last measured voluntary reporting compliance over a decade ago when it did line-by-line audits of about 50,000 individual tax year 1988 tax returns. IRS planned to measure reporting compliance using 1994 returns in an ambitious effort involving over 150,000 randomly selected returns, including 92,000 individuals (including sole proprietorships and farmers) as well as corporations, partnerships, and S-corporations. Before beginning the audit process, however, IRS cancelled the study because of its cost and because of criticism from Congress, the media, tax community, and taxpayers about the size of the sample and the burden imposed by the audits on compliant taxpayers.", "IRS\u2019s compliance research studies provided more than just a measure of voluntary compliance. They have also been used by IRS to identify compliance trends and to allow IRS to suggest changes in tax laws and regulations to improve voluntary reporting compliance.", "Voluntary reporting compliance study results have also been the basis for formulas to help IRS select returns for enforcement audits. IRS conducts hundreds of thousands of enforcement audits each year as part of its overall enforcement efforts. Unlike compliance study audits, enforcement audits are not random. IRS targets enforcement audits on likely noncompliant returns\u2014those returns with a high probability that an audit would detect improperly reported tax liability. According to IRS, return selection formulas\u2014first used to select 1968 tax returns for audit\u2014have reduced the number of audits that resulted in no change to tax liability. No change enforcement audits are a burden on compliant taxpayers and use scarce IRS resources. In the year before the formulas were first used, the no change rate was 46 percent. For returns filed in 1994, the no change rate was about 19 percent. These formulas were last updated using 1988 tax return data, however, and as they become more out of date, the percentage of formula-identified enforcement audits resulting in no change has increased.

IRS determined that, since it plans to accept return information as accurate without getting additional information from taxpayers, the study results might misstate compliance levels. Therefore IRS developed this subsample of classified returns to compare NRP study results with what might have been detected by comprehensive line-by-line audits.

The test results indicated that casebuilding tools were useful in detecting misreported income, but that specific guidelines were needed for using the tools and for making classification decisions regardless of the amount of misreporting found. A second test, conducted in early May 2002, was done on 30 previously audited returns that were part of a tax year 1999 EITC compliance study. This test was to assess draft classification guidelines and to test for consistency among classifiers. The test resulted in changes to training materials and classification guidelines.", "IRS plans to do additional pre-implementation evaluations of the NRP casebuilding and classification process, but only a very limited evaluation of this process using actual audited returns. The agency plans to conduct an additional test in July 2002 using unaudited returns as was done in the October 2001 test, as well as some previously audited EITC returns. The July 2002 test will involve actual NRP processes in order to provide IRS with an opportunity to make final adjustments to those processes prior to NRP implementation. One of the purposes of this test is to determine whether the classification guidelines will result in consistent classification decisions among classifiers. To test the guidelines, more than one classifier will classify each return and the results will be compared. IRS expects that this test will allow it to make changes to the guidelines so that more consistent classification decisions are made. Since most of the returns used in the test will have not been previously audited, the results give IRS little assurance that, even collectively, the classification decisions are correct but only that the decisions were consistent. Testing the NRP classification process using previously audited returns would allow a comparison of classification results with actual audit findings. As in the May 2002 test, such a test using a small number of recently audited returns would give IRS more assurance that NRP classification will result in correct decisions.", "Another part of the July 2002 test will entail classifying a larger group of the previously audited EITC compliance study returns that were used in the May test. The primary purpose of this test will be as a pre-test of an analysis planned for later in the year when final NRP processes are applied to a sample of previously audited EITC returns. That analysis will provide a basis for a decision whether NRP will be a suitable substitute for separate EITC compliance research studies and, if so, what adjustments need to be made to NRP results to make them comparable to the EITC compliance studies. The July 2002 pre-test will also provide a check on classification accuracy for this particular type of return, but these only represent a small portion of the NRP sample.", "Until IRS completes its July classification test, it cannot update its classification guidelines and procedures or train the staff who are to classify the returns. Depending on the results of the test and the number and types of changes that may have to be made to the classification procedures, IRS may not be in a position to begin classifying returns in August, as planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Systems Testing Not Yet Completed", "paragraphs": ["IRS plans to use its existing information systems to capture and store the data generated by NRP.

Identifying information system issues early enough to deal with them before NRP is implemented will permit the rest of NRP\u2019s processes to run more smoothly than if problems are encountered later.

Because of the risk of increasing taxpayer burden, we agree with IRS that it is more important that design, testing, and implementation of NRP be complete before taxpayers are contacted, than it is that the agency meet a self- imposed deadline. While IRS has shown flexibility about the date to begin taxpayer contacts, the interim milestone for beginning to classify returns remains fixed at August 2002. Adhering to this milestone may pose problems because NRP plans call for several sequential steps to be completed before classification begins. Although IRS\u2019s plans call for completing these steps, there may not be sufficient time to complete them, in their proper sequence, before August 2002. Specifically, testing and modifying casebuilding and classification procedures must be finished before NRP examiners can be trained in the finalized procedures. Such tests will be most useful if they include the classification of some recently audited returns. In addition, IRS must select and then train the cadre of NRP examiners. While completing these steps before classification begins will not guarantee successful NRP implementation, it would provide added assurance that implementation will proceed smoothly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue:   Ensure that testing and modification of NRP casebuilding and classification procedures is complete before IRS begins cadre training, classifying NRP returns, or making any taxpayer contacts.

He expressed IRS\u2019s commitment to not compromising the quality of the program in order to meet the agency\u2019s scheduled date for commencement of taxpayer contacts under NRP.  The commissioner also noted that draft reports from the two contractors evaluating the NRP sample indicate that the sample is valid for IRS\u2019s goals of precision and workload selection development.", "The commissioner expressed concern with our recommendation that IRS use previously audited, non-EITC returns in the final stages of NRP casebuilding and classification testing.  Specifically, he noted that IRS would not be able to produce all of the casebuilding data that relate to previously audited, non-EITC returns, and that IRS would not have a clear understanding of why the non-EITC returns were selected for audit and what guidance the examiners were given in conducting the audits. We agree that these are issues that a full-scale evaluation of NRP using previously audited returns would have to address. In subsequent discussions with IRS\u2019s Director of Research, Analysis and Statistics, the senior IRS official responsible for NRP, we pointed out that our recommendation was not for IRS to conduct a full-scale evaluation of NRP, but for a smaller review of some previously audit returns. As we note in the report, a small test, such as the one IRS conducted in May 2002 using 30 previously audited EITC returns, would give IRS more assurance that NRP classification will result in correct decisions. The Director of Research, Analysis and Statistics agreed that such a test using non-EITC returns would be feasible and useful and that IRS will conduct the test before beginning taxpayer contacts.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its date.
