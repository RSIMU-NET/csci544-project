To fulfill this direction, NASA formally established  the SLS program in 2011. Then, in 2012, the Orion project transitioned  from its development under the Constellation program\u2014a program that  was intended to be the successor to the Space Shuttle but was canceled  in 2010 due to factors that included cost and schedule growth\u2014to a new  development program aligned with SLS. To transition Orion from  Constellation, NASA adapted the requirements from the former Orion  plan with those of the newly created SLS and the associated ground  systems programs. In addition, NASA and the European Space Agency  (ESA) agreed that ESA would provide a portion of the service module for  Orion. Figure 1 provides details about the heritage of each SLS hardware  element and its source as well as identifies the major portions of the  Orion crew vehicle.", "The EGS program was established to renovate portions of the Kennedy  Space Center to prepare for integrating hardware from the three  programs as well as launching SLS and Orion. EGS is made up of nine  major components, including: the Vehicle Assembly Building, Mobile  Launcher, software, Launch Pad 39B, Crawler-Transporter, Launch  Equipment Test Facility, Spacecraft Offline Processing, Launch Vehicle  Offline Processing, and Landing and Recovery.

NASA has committed to be ready to conduct one test  flight, EM-1, no later than November 2018. During EM-1, the SLS vehicle  is scheduled to launch an uncrewed Orion to a distant orbit some 70,000  kilometers beyond the moon. All three programs\u2014SLS, Orion, and  EGS\u2014must be ready on or before this launch readiness date to support  this integrated test flight. While the SLS and EGS program cost and  schedule baselines are tied to the uncrewed EM-1 mission, the Orion  program\u2019s cost and schedule baselines are tied to a second, crewed  mission\u2014EM-2. See table 1 for program baseline information.", "All three programs are entering the integration and test phase of the  development life cycle\u2014which our prior work has shown to be when  problems are commonly found and schedules tend to slip. In general,  programs have schedule and cost reserves in order to address  challenges that arise during development. Funded schedule reserve is  extra time, with the money to pay for it, in the program\u2019s overall schedule  in the event that there are delays or unforeseen problems. Cost reserves  are additional funds that can be used to mitigate problems during the  development of a program. For example, cost reserves can be used to  buy additional materials to replace a component or, if a program needs to  preserve schedule, cost reserves can be used to accelerate work by  adding extra shifts to expedite manufacturing and save time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ongoing Delays Foreshadow a Likely Schedule Slip as NASA Reassesses the Launch Readiness Date", "paragraphs": ["With less than two years until the committed November 2018 launch  readiness date for EM-1, the three human exploration programs\u2014Orion,  SLS, and EGS\u2014are making progress, but schedule pressure is  escalating as technical challenges continue to cause schedule delays. All  three programs face development challenges in completing work, and  each has little to no schedule reserve remaining to the EM-1 date\u2014 meaning they will have to complete all remaining work with minimal delay  during the most challenging stage of development. This includes  completing design, production, and integration work at each program as  well as integrating the hardware and software from the three programs in  preparation for launch. Integration and testing is the phase where  problems are most likely to be found, and the amount of potential  problems is increased due to the two levels of integration\u2014each  inherently complex program must be integrated individually and then as  an interdependent, combined enterprise. Because all three programs  must be ready for launch to occur, a redesign of a single program\u2019s  component, a test failure, or a significant hardware or software integration  issue in any one area could delay the launch readiness date for all three  programs.", "The schedule pressure is intensified by the low levels of cost reserves  held by all three programs to mitigate problems during development. In  some cases, however, even if the programs held higher levels of cost  reserves, using them to gain back schedule would be difficult because\u2014 at this late stage of development\u2014work has become more sequential and  there are fewer opportunities for workarounds, which the programs have  relied on until now to preserve schedule. With little to no schedule or cost  reserves remaining as the programs finalize production and enter  integration and testing activities, the EM-1 launch readiness date is in a  precarious position. While NASA officials told us they are assessing  factors that could contribute to an EM-1 schedule slip, they have not  committed to a timeline for completing that assessment or proposing an  amended launch schedule, if needed. Therefore, it is unclear when  Congress will be informed of NASA\u2019s findings and any impact those  findings might have on NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget request.", "Since we last reported on the human exploration programs in July 2016,  the programs have made progress toward completing development,  including the following:", "Orion: After changing the heatshield design following a December  2014 test flight in which NASA determined that not all aspects of the  original monolithic design would meet the more stringent requirements  for EM-1 and EM-2 when the capsule will be exposed to greater  temperature variance and longer durations, the Orion program and  contractor reported that production of heatshield blocks is underway  and production quality is very high. Orion officials also stated that the  risks associated with the ESM main engine\u2014a heritage in-space  maneuvering engine from the Space Shuttle program\u2014have been  largely addressed. The program was concerned with the state of  internal components given their age; however, the engines have  completed rounds of acceptance and vibration testing following  replacement of valves and other components. In addition, the program  and contractor stated that they have addressed all probable causes of  crew module airbag anomalies from the December 2014 test flight.  These bags are designed to inflate upon touchdown in the ocean to  properly orient the crew module; however, some did not properly  inflate or leaked due in part to the bags inflating before they were  outside of the vehicle, which placed the bags under stress. While the  root cause for the failures remains unknown, given the mitigation  steps being taken, program officials now have high confidence in the  system\u2019s performance going forward.", "SLS: Program officials stated that the solid rocket boosters have  completed the second of two planned qualification tests and that the  program has also implemented a design change to address an issue  where the solid rocket propellant might loosen from the insulation on  the inside of the booster casing, which may increase the risk of  booster failure. The program office is performing analysis to ensure  the mitigation meets expected safety margins. The program is  producing test and flight unit core stage hardware and, according to  program officials, has made progress manufacturing panels which will  be bolted together to create the intertank section of the core stage.  They also stated that early attempts to bend some of the thick  materials necessary for the core stage led to unrepairable cracks, but  the contractor has updated its processes, which has allowed recently  produced panels to pass inspections. The program has also begun  integrated structural testing of its EM-1 in-space propulsion stage,  Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter, and Orion Stage Adapter.", "EGS: Program officials stated that work for the Crawler Transporter  and Launch Vehicle Offline Processing facility is complete. In addition,  all 10 of the platforms that will allow access to the integrated SLS and  Orion vehicles during final assembly in the Vehicle Assembly Building  have been installed, according to EGS officials. Additionally, they  have started verification and validation, the process by which the  program assesses whether systems are capable of meeting their  intended purpose and are being developed according to agency  requirements, at the Multi-Payload Processing Facility\u2014where  spacecraft fueling will be performed. Program officials stated that 8 of  the 20 pieces of launch equipment and accessories\u2014for example,  umbilical connections from the launch tower to the vehicle\u2014have  been built, finished testing, and are ready for installation onto the  Mobile Launcher.", "The magnitude of the schedule delays that the programs have  experienced amid this progress, however, foreshadows a likely schedule  slip for the November 2018 EM-1 launch readiness date. In addition, each  program is facing risks that will likely consume what little schedule  reserve exists, and low cost reserves limit mitigation options to achieve  the planned launch readiness date. These ongoing challenges include the  following:  Orion: The Orion program has no schedule reserve to EM-1 and the  delivery of the European Service Module (ESM) and completion of flight  software are the primary and secondary critical paths\u2014or the path of  longest duration through the sequence of activities that determines the  earliest completion date\u2014for both Orion and EM-1 as a whole. In  December 2015, Orion officials stated that the program had zero  schedule reserve to EM-1 and we reported in July 2016 that the program  had already experienced several ESM development delays that impacted  the ESM delivery, and that further delays could cause the EM-1 launch to  slip. As of the ESM\u2019s critical design review in summer 2016, ESA has  delayed ESM delivery to the Orion program from January 2017 to April  2017, and senior NASA officials stated the delivery will likely slip to  August 2017 or later. Program officials stated that the delays are largely  due to NASA, ESA, and the ESA contractor underestimating the time and  effort necessary to address design issues for the first production ESM  and the availability of parts from suppliers and subcontractors. For  example, the contractor found welding failures in the ESM\u2019s propulsion  tanks, and a number of parts deliveries have been late.", "Orion program officials told us that following delivery from ESA, they will  need the service module for 12 months for integration with the crew  module and testing prior to providing the completed Orion spacecraft to  the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center. This means if ESA\u2019s  delivery date of the service module slips to August 2017, the Orion  program will not be ready to deliver Orion to Kennedy Space Center until  August 2018. NASA officials stated that they would not be able to  maintain a launch readiness date of November 2018 if Kennedy Space  Center receives the Orion spacecraft after July 2018. As a result, the  November 2018 launch readiness date is likely unachievable unless  NASA identifies further mitigation steps to accommodate delays.", "In addition, the Orion program faces a number of other technical  challenges including software delays and hardware design, but has  limited cost reserves to address them until fiscal year 2018 when more  cost reserves will be available. As we found in July 2016, the Orion  program continues to employ most of its available budget to fund current  work and holds most of its cost reserves in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.  Program officials told us that the Orion program is schedule-constrained  at this point, meaning that even if additional funding were available, it  could not alleviate all schedule pressure to EM-1.", "SLS: The SLS program currently reports having the most program-level  schedule reserve of the three programs\u2014approximately 80 days\u2014 however, schedule pressure is mounting as the program completes  production and integration and test events grow near. Development of the  core stage\u2014which functions as the SLS\u2019s fuel tank and structural  backbone\u2014is the program\u2019s critical path, meaning any delay in its  development reduces schedule reserves for the whole program. A  number of important events must successfully take place before the core  stage, or the vehicle at large, are ready for EM-1. First, the contractor is  scheduled to complete production of the core stage flight unit and deliver  it to Stennis Space Center for testing by September 2017. However,  officials stated that they have exhausted schedule reserve for this delivery  date to address \u201cexpected unknowns\u201d with hardware processing due to  this being the first time they have built the core stage. Further, according  to officials, welding on the core stage was stopped for months due to low  weld strength in the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks caused by a  program and contractor decision to change the weld tool configuration  during fabrication. The altered configuration produced different welds that  the program has had to confirm are within specification. While officials  indicate that they now have a corrective action plan in place, and welding  resumed in April 2017, they did not provide detail on the impact to  program schedule reserve.", "Once production of the core stage flight unit is complete, the program  plans to deliver it to Stennis Space Center for testing. At Stennis Space  Center, the core stage will be filled with cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen  for the first time\u2014a considerable process on its own, as officials stated  they were finding and mitigating hydrogen leaks for the entire life of the  Shuttle program\u2014and will undergo a \u201cgreen run\u201d test. During the green  run, the core stage flight model\u2014integrated with four RS-25 engines\u2014will  be fired for about 500 seconds to test a flight-like engine-use profile.  Following this, the program has 20 days of reserves\u2014less any delivery  delays and delays from issues that arise during testing\u2014from the  completion of the green run test until it must be shipped to Kennedy  Space Center to begin integration with the boosters, upper stage, and  Orion as well as all EGS equipment. Should further challenges arise  during final production and testing, the program\u2019s 80 days of reserve will  likely be reduced.", "As we found in July 2016, NASA baselined the SLS program with cost  reserves of less than 2 percent, even though guidance for Marshall Space  Flight Center\u2014the NASA center with responsibility for the SLS program\u2014 establishes standard cost reserves for launch vehicle programs of 20  percent when the baseline is approved. NASA has not changed its cost  reserve posture for this program since that time, meaning the program  still has limited cost reserves to address risks and challenges.", "EGS: EGS program officials stated they used the majority of the 6 months  of schedule reserve the program had when we reported in July 2016 to  address, among other issues, complications at the Launch Equipment  Test Facility and with the Mobile Launcher\u2019s ground support equipment  installation. The program now has 28 days of schedule reserve, which  program officials stated is being held for integrated operations before EM- 1, and zero days remaining for any further delays for EGS-specific  projects. Without any schedule margin remaining for the EGS-specific  projects, the program will be challenged to complete its remaining work  that includes umbilical testing, ground support equipment and umbilical  installation, and verification and validation testing. These efforts all carry  schedule risks with expected delays that, if not mitigated, total 14 months.  Program officials stated that they are actively trying to mitigate these  schedule risks; however, they acknowledged that some mitigation tactics  they are considering\u2014such as performing some portion of these efforts  concurrently\u2014increase the complexity of these efforts. In addition, EGS  officials indicated they are planning to consolidate some verification and  validation testing to streamline the test flow, which they said would  increase schedule risk but not technical risk. The program is also  considering implementing additional work shifts to create additional  schedule margin. The internal EGS delays and the cascading delays from  Orion and SLS that EGS may have to absorb\u2014as the program  responsible for final integration of the three programs\u2014contribute to  NASA likely not achieving the November 2018 launch readiness date.", "Similar to Orion and SLS, we previously found in July 2016 that the EGS  program is operating with limited cost reserves to address future  construction and software risks. For example, we found that when  NASA approved the program\u2019s baseline, the program had cost reserves  of only 4 percent. While Kennedy Space Center\u2014which is responsible for  the EGS program\u2014does not have cost reserve guidance in place,  guidance from other NASA centers establishes higher levels of cost  reserves at this stage of development. Further, according to EGS  officials, the program used all of its fiscal year 2017 reserves in recent  years, and has limited reserves in fiscal year 2018, hindering EGS\u2019s  ability to address any remaining challenges.", "GAO\u2019s work on acquisition best practices has shown that success in  development efforts such as these programs depends on establishing an  executable business case based on matching requirements and  resources before committing to a new product development effort. In our  prior reviews of NASA\u2019s human exploration programs, we have found that  all three programs have been using aggressive schedules and that SLS  and EGS have low reserve levels compared to NASA standards. We  have also previously found that both SLS and Orion cost and schedule  estimates\u2014which inform their cost and schedule baselines\u2014were  unreliable when compared to best practices.", "In July 2016, we recommended that the NASA administrator direct the  Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate to re-evaluate  SLS and EGS cost reserves as it finalized its schedule and plans for EM- 1 during a planned build-to-synchronization review\u2014in summer 2016\u2014in  order to take advantage of all available time and resources and maximize  the benefit of available cost reserves, and to verify that the November  2018 launch readiness date remained feasible. This review was  intended to demonstrate that the integrated launch vehicle, crew vehicle,  and ground systems will perform as expected to meet EM-1 objectives.  NASA concurred with our recommendation and as of January 2017,  senior NASA officials told us that they have reordered integration activities to try to meet the EM-1 launch schedule, but further analysis  indicates that they will have to delay the launch readiness date. These  officials stated that no decision has been made and NASA has not  committed to a timeline in which to report its findings. Fiscal year 2018 is  the last year before the November 2018 EM-1 launch readiness date.  With fiscal year 2018 budget discussions ongoing, until it receives  updated EM-1 schedule information, the Congress will be in the position  of determining NASA\u2019s appropriations based on a launch readiness date  that is likely not achievable.", "Should NASA determine it is likely to exceed its cost estimate baseline by  15 percent or miss a milestone by 6 months or more, NASA is required to  report those increases and delays\u2014along with their impacts\u2014to the  Congress. Given that these three human space exploration programs  represent more than half of NASA\u2019s current portfolio development cost  baseline, a cost increase or delay could have substantial repercussions  for not only these programs but NASA\u2019s entire portfolio. A principle of  federal internal controls is that managers should externally communicate  the necessary quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objective and  address related risks. If NASA\u2019s ongoing assessment of the November  2018 EM-1 launch readiness date reveals that a new, more realistic, date  is warranted, prolonging any decisions regarding the extent of delays and  cost overruns\u2014no matter the magnitude\u2014until after deliberations on  NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget request would increase the risk that both  NASA and the Congress continue making decisions potentially involving  hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars based on schedules that may no  longer be feasible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Human spaceflight and exploration programs are complex and require  significant time and effort to design and develop hardware and software.  While the Orion, SLS, and EGS programs are working toward a target  EM-1 launch readiness date of November 2018, the threats to each  program\u2019s schedule continue to mount, and the schedule reserve of each  program is either very limited or nonexistent. In addition, as the target  EM-1 launch readiness date nears\u2014now less than two years away\u2014the  flexibility of the schedule to allow for replanning is likewise reduced. To  this point, the programs have replanned program-level efforts and  scheduled concurrent work despite the risks involved, and NASA is  replanning integration efforts at the enterprise-level in an attempt to find  additional schedule margin. However, beyond that, the programs have  little to no cost reserves remaining to deal with challenges that may arise.  By continuing to work toward this deadline, these programs are  positioned to make potentially risky decisions in attempting to meet a  schedule that is likely unachievable. Until NASA completes an analysis of  factors that could contribute to an EM-1 schedule slip and reports on the  feasibility of either its current or revised schedule, program managers will  remain under pressure to achieve a goal that may be untenable, and the  Congress will continue to base important budget decisions on an unclear  picture of the time and money needed to support future human space  exploration efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure that the Congress is able to make informed resource  decisions regarding a viable EM-1 launch readiness date, we recommend  that the NASA Administrator or Acting Administrator direct the Human  Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate to take the following two  actions:", "Confirm whether the EM-1 launch readiness date of November 2018  is achievable, as soon as practicable but no later than as part of its  fiscal year 2018 budget submission process; and", "Propose a new, more realistic EM-1 date if warranted and report to  Congress on the results of its EM-1 schedule analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["NASA provided written comments on a draft of this report.

To determine the programs\u2019 cost and schedule posture and to  assess the availability of the programs\u2019 cost and schedule reserves  approaching EM-1, we analyzed its budget documentation, interviewed  program officials from all three programs with insight into the programs\u2019  budget and schedule and discussed how reserves were being used to  mitigate known risks. Our work was performed at Johnson Space Center  in Houston, Texas; Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama;  Kennedy Space Center in Titusville, Florida; Lockheed Martin Space  Systems Company in Houston, Texas; and NASA headquarters in  Washington, DC.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to April 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Cristina T.
