In this report, we define a need for long-term care as needing assistance from another person to perform certain everyday activities or as residing in an institution such as a nursing home.", "Both physical and mental limitations can create a long-term care need. \u201cLong-term care\u201d is shorthand for the wide array of services provided to help compensate for these limitations. Most of the support needed is not complex medical care, but assistance from others with the routines of daily living. As such, long-term care often involves the most intimate aspects of people\u2019s lives\u2014what and when they eat, personal hygiene, getting dressed, using the bathroom. Services vary widely in their intensity and cost, depending on individuals\u2019 conditions, the severity of their needs, and their environment. Long-term care assistance can range from helping a frail elderly person dress, eat, and use the bathroom to skills training and medication management for a mentally ill person to technology and nursing care for a ventilator-dependent child.", "Need for long-term care is generally defined, irrespective of age and diagnosis, by long-lasting limitations in the ability to undertake basic activities and routines of daily living independently. One common way to assess these limitations is to measure an individual\u2019s ability to perform basic self-care tasks, often called the activities of daily living (ADL). These include eating, bathing, dressing, getting to and using the bathroom, and getting in or out of a bed or chair. Less severe impairments are often measured through the ability to perform household chores and social tasks, known as instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). These include going outside the home, keeping track of money or bills, preparing meals, doing light housework, and using the telephone. In addition, other criteria\u2014such as the ability to attend school or behavioral problems\u2014are sometimes used for children or people with mental illness, whose age or condition means that limitations in self-care and household tasks may not be as valid for assessing need.", "Families and friends provide the bulk of long-term care services to people who need them. Nonetheless, public and private spending on long-term care services was estimated to exceed $108 billion in 1993. About $70 billion of this money was federal and state government spending, primarily through the Medicaid program. Almost all the remaining $38 billion was paid by individuals and their families.

Contrary to popular perception, most people within this population live at home or in community residential settings, not in institutions such as nursing homes. The largest group is elderly, but approximately 40 percent are working-age adults or children. Of those receiving assistance from others, most are helped by family members and friends, while a much smaller number receive assistance from government programs.", "Most people who need long-term care do not live in institutions. Of the more than 12 million Americans estimated to need long-term care assistance, only about 2.4 million live in institutions, such as nursing homes, chronic care hospitals, or other facilities.

Still others may have a long-term care need for supervision or guidance, because of their mental impairments, regardless of their ability to care for themselves.", "One common way to identify people with more severe needs is to focus only on those individuals needing assistance with self-care and to exclude those who only need assistance with less intense household tasks. This smaller group of 6.2 million people includes about 3.8 million adults outside of institutions who require another person\u2019s help with at least one of the basic self-care tasks\u2014eating, dressing, bathing, or using the bathroom\u2014which are more essential to independent personal functioning, and 2.4 million people in institutions.", "The most severely disabled population\u2014those who need substantial assistance\u2014comprises approximately 5.1 million individuals.

Another 1.3 million adults live in the community and need assistance from others with three or more self-care tasks, for example, people with advanced multiple sclerosis who cannot eat, dress, use the bathroom, or get out of bed without help. Finally, researchers in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and Human Services estimate an additional 1.4 million people require significant assistance because of mental disabilities, even if they do not report needing help with three or more self-care activities. People with mental impairments\u2014such as mental retardation or schizophrenia\u2014may be physically capable of performing everyday activities without assistance, but may be unlikely to do them in a safe, consistent, or appropriate manner. Even with no limitations in self-care, they may engage in other inappropriate behaviors that are a danger to themselves or others and require substantial supervision. It is important to note that the actual number of people who ultimately participate in any program may differ from these estimates, depending on how need for assistance is measured and the level of demand for program services.", "Limitations in a number of self-care tasks are a good indicator of severity of need because the amount and intensity of long-term care assistance a person needs increase appreciably with the number of his or her impairments. Recent data confirm that the average number of hours of care received\u2014both from family and paid sources\u2014rises with the number of basic self-care activities with which an individual needs assistance. This increase is especially dramatic between limitations in two or fewer and three or more self-care tasks.", "In addition to the elderly and working-aged adults, children are an important component of the long-term care population and often have distinct care needs. Among young children, need for long-term care is harder to assess because their age makes the traditional measures of self-care and household maintenance inappropriate measures of their abilities. Infants and toddlers, for example, are not expected to dress themselves or prepare their own food, whether or not they are disabled. Instead, children\u2019s long-term care needs may be assessed by other criteria, such as limitations in activities more typical for their age group. About 330,000 children living at home are unable to engage in major play or school activities because of disabilities such as epilepsy, asthma, or cystic fibrosis. A smaller population of approximately 170,000 children are severely disabled with conditions such as cerebral palsy or mental retardation and need assistance with self-care if they are 6 years and older or if they are under that age and have a similar level of impairment.

In addition, estimates of future long-term care need among the nonelderly disabled are difficult to project.

While most elderly people are not disabled, the elderly as a whole have the greatest likelihood of needing long-term care. As a result of this population aging, researchers predict that the number of elderly needing long-term care may as much as double in the next 25 years. Figure 2 shows that recent projections of elderly needing long-term care reach between 10 million and 14 million by 2020, and 14 million to 24 million in 2060, compared with about 7 million today.", "While the sheer number of future elderly is expected to drive up demand for long-term care services, projections of the number of elderly needing long-term care in the next century vary because of different assumptions about the future prevalence of disability. Changes in death and disease rates among the nation\u2019s older population, for example, will affect the need for long-term care. Long-term care need intensifies significantly with age, especially after age 85. It is this subpopulation, the elderly aged 85 and older, that is projected to grow most rapidly. Some researchers argue that medical advances have increased life expectancy but have not changed the onset of illness. They predict that declining death rates may actually increase long-term care need if, for example, more people live to develop age-related disabling conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or live longer with existing disabilities. Others argue that disability is becoming increasingly compressed into a shorter portion of the lifespan, decreasing the number of years long-term care is needed. Improved treatments or prevention of common disabling conditions among the elderly, such as strokes and heart disease, could lessen long-term care need, independent of death rates.", "Furthermore, according to the Bureau of the Census, future generations of elderly are likely to be different from the elderly of today\u2014better educated and more culturally diverse\u2014in ways that could affect their ultimate health and economic status. Higher levels of both education and income are often associated with lower levels of disability. At the same time, the economic resources available in old age vary significantly with race and ethnicity.

These factors make it difficult to predict future disability trends and subsequent long-term care need.", "Researchers agree that the number of nonelderly people with long-term care needs has grown in recent decades and that this increase is likely to continue. Some of the reasons suggested for past growth include better technology and improved access to acute care, both of which may make it possible for people to survive previously fatal conditions while sustaining permanent disabilities.

Smoking is strongly related to future heart disease, one of the most common causes of functional impairments that necessitate long-term care. Research also suggests many traumatic brain injuries, which can cause both mental and physical disabilities, could be prevented by improved motor vehicle safety or by use of protective head gear by bicyclists and motorcyclists. Greater use of these safety devices may decrease the incidence of such injuries and subsequent long-term care need.", "We do not know now how future medical advances will affect long-term care need. Improved treatments and technology may result in the prevention of certain chronic conditions, or simply in incremental or marginal improvements in the management of their symptoms.

Severely disabled children frequently need services to support their families in continuing the care they already provide as well as assistance with learning basic life skills and attending school. In contrast, nonelderly adults more often require services to help them establish their own households or regain lost skills.

Many people needing long-term care already receive unpaid help from family or friends, and may prefer this informal care to a public program. Currently most disabled people do receive their care unpaid from family members and friends, primarily women. However, greater geographic dispersion of families, smaller family sizes, and the large percentage of women who work outside the home are straining the capacity of this care source. Large numbers of potential caregivers in the baby boom generation may ease this strain in the near future. However, as members of this generation become disabled themselves and need assistance, they may have fewer family members available to care for them. Fewer informal caregivers, even with no increase in disability prevalence, could increase demand on public programs. In addition, some people may be able to purchase the assistance they need with private funds. Some people, even with very severe disabilities, do not want assistance from others.", "Finally, an individual\u2019s environment can also play a role in the need for government assistance.

Furthermore, not everyone with a disability needs long-term care to function independently. Within the long-term care population severity of need varies, with some people needing only occasional aid and a much smaller number requiring substantial assistance.
