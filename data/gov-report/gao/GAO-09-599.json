According to USPS, Intelligent Mail is the most complex change it has ever undertaken. GAO was asked to describe (1) the Intelligent Mail program and the status of implementation efforts and (2) the key risks to implementing Intelligent Mail and how USPS is addressing these risks.

The program is centered on a new barcode that can uniquely identify a mail piece. While Intelligent Mail could provide benefits to both mailers and USPS, it will also require both to make significant changes to their processes and information systems. USPS expects to be prepared to begin implementation in May 2009. After that, USPS will phase in price incentives and other functions in November 2009 and will require mailers to use the new barcode by May 2011 to qualify for lower postage rates. Successful implementation of Intelligent Mail faces two key risks--(1) USPS's management approach and (2) mailers may not choose to participate in the program--which if not addressed, could limit achieving Intelligent Mail benefits. USPS has taken some steps to address these risks, such as a phased approach. However, USPS has not followed some key program management practices to reduce risks, raising questions about whether USPS and mailers will be able to meet schedule and program objectives. For example, USPS (1) lacks a comprehensive strategy, including all planned phases and the specific functions and systems to be implemented in each phase; goals and measures of success; and a risk mitigation plan to address the risks that could impact the Intelligent Mail program as a whole; and (2) lacks information on costs and savings attributable to the Intelligent Mail program, including a baseline and mechanism to track and measure actual savings, which are needed to measure program performance. The second risk is that program success is dependent on mailer participation, and it is uncertain whether pricing and other incentives will encourage mailers to participate to the extent anticipated. Some mailers have said they find the pricing incentives insufficient to recover their investment in the program. The Postal Regulatory Commission has also noted that uncertainty may lead mailers to delay adoption. Low mailer adoption could affect USPS's ability to report representative delivery service results, as required to comply with service performance reporting requirements, but USPS has not said how it would address this risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 80 percent of the approximately 200 billion mail pieces processed  and delivered by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) last year was sent by  commercial mailers that barcode, sort, or transport mail in exchange for  lower postage rates.

Commercial mailers have  been encouraged to use barcodes through pricing incentives, allowing  USPS to cut costs and increase efficiency in its mail processing operations.  In particular, automated mail processing machines can sort mail with  barcodes containing delivery information faster than mail sorted manually.  Over the past three decades, the number and type of barcodes increased  along with technology changes, and in 2003 USPS estimated that there  were more than 30 different barcodes in use.

The Intelligent Mail concept was articulated in a 2001 report by  the Mailing Industry Task Force, which was led by chief executives of 11  mailing industry companies and USPS\u2019s Deputy Postmaster General. This  task force noted that Intelligent Mail would help ensure that mail  processing is responsive to customer needs.

USPS says it will be able to use information from Intelligent Mail to  improve its processing system. For example, USPS expects it will be able  to better identify and diagnose problems, such as systemic bottlenecks  that result in costly manual sorting and delivery delays. Also, USPS plans  to use Intelligent Mail to create efficiencies by streamlining and  automating the process it uses to accept mail from commercial mailers,  which is currently time- and labor-intensive.", "Reduce the amount of mail that must be forwarded, which can involve  extra handling by USPS and delays in delivery. As an incentive to adopt  Full Service Intelligent Mail, USPS will provide free notification when  intended recipients have moved and filed a change-of-address with USPS,  a service mailers previously paid for. This feature, known as Address  Correction Service, could help USPS meet its goal of reducing the amount  of mail that cannot be delivered as addressed. In exchange for this free  service, USPS requires mailers to update their mailing lists in order to  avoid paying additional fees.", "Provide better service to mailers. Through Intelligent Mail, USPS plans to  provide better service to mailers through real-time feedback. For example,  as another incentive to adopt Full Service Intelligent Mail, USPS will  provide mailers information on when their mail entered USPS\u2019s system,  known as Start the Clock. This information, which was not previously  offered by USPS, is helpful because it enables USPS to respond to mailer  inquiries on missing or delayed mail. Also, since Intelligent Mail will be  uniquely identified, USPS will have the ability to isolate and give special  handling to a specific mail piece, which creates an opportunity for USPS to  offer mailers new products and services.", "Service performance measurement capability. Intelligent Mail will allow  USPS to gather more comprehensive and detailed service performance  information and measure it against established performance standards,  which will help keep USPS accountable to its stakeholders. The 2006  Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act required USPS to develop a  system to measure service performance and report to PRC. The service   performance measurement system proposed by USPS to meet this  requirement relies on data from Intelligent Mail.", "Financial incentives.

The overall commercial mail process  using Intelligent Mail, including how it impacts mailer and USPS  operations, is shown in figure 3.", "Intelligent Mail requires significant changes to the way mailers prepare  and submit their mail. Mailers using Intelligent Mail will need to redesign  their mail pieces by populating and applying the new barcode. Full Service  mailers will also need to ensure that their barcodes contain a unique  tracking number. This means that each mail piece a mailer sends within a  45-day period must have a number imbedded in its barcode that is  different from every other piece of mail that the mailer sends within that  time frame. Full Service mailers must also apply unique barcodes to mail  trays and containers, and document which mail pieces are contained in  which tray and container. These changes may result in significant process  changes for mailers and may require new software or staff training.", "Mailers participating in Full Service Intelligent Mail must also make  changes to their information systems in order to submit documentation  electronically to USPS. The electronic documentation must contain  information on all of the Intelligent Mail barcodes used on the mail pieces,  trays, and containers; how the mail pieces, trays, and containers fit  together; and the identity of the mailer. While some mailers currently  submit electronic documentation, many currently submit this information  in hard copy format. Mailers must also provide advance notification of  their mail drop-off to a postal facility by sending an electronic  appointment and will need to ensure that their software systems are able  to communicate effectively with USPS\u2019s systems. This may involve  purchasing or upgrading software or hardware. Mailers will also need to  train their staff on how to use the new software and how to communicate  with USPS electronically.", "Intelligent Mail involves changes to USPS\u2019s operations. For instance,  USPS\u2019s current process for mail acceptance and verification is costly,  time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Mail acceptance and verification  involves mailers bringing mail to a postal facility, USPS accepting it and  verifying that it has been prepared according to postal standards, and  USPS verifying that the postage has been accurately calculated. Currently,  this process involves a postal official physically sampling a portion of the  mail to make sure it meets standards and is eligible for the prices claimed  in the mailer\u2019s documentation. With Intelligent Mail, USPS plans to be able  to scan mail pieces, trays, and containers, and reconcile the information to  the documentation that the mailer has sent electronically. USPS envisions  that, by using Intelligent Mail, it can eventually automate the verification  process and reduce its reliance on manual tests of the mail, making it  easier for mailers to hand mail off, thus saving both USPS and mailers time  and the related costs. Furthermore, USPS has completed changes to  software for its mail processing equipment so it is capable of scanning the  new barcodes. USPS officials said they completed these upgrades as they  were performing other, routine software upgrades for this equipment.", "In addition, USPS is changing its information technology systems. As  mailers start using Intelligent Mail, USPS expects to process scans from  millions of mail pieces containing new barcodes on a daily basis. USPS is  developing the information technology infrastructure to scan and track  individual mail pieces as they travel through its processing system. First,  USPS is developing a new Intelligent Mail information technology system  to process, manage, and store data from scanned barcodes. USPS has  acquired hardware and is using contractors to develop software for this  system. Second, USPS is integrating this new system with existing USPS  systems to share data, which requires changes to almost 30 different  systems and 59 different connections between these systems. An example  of one of the existing USPS systems that must be integrated with the new  Intelligent Mail system is PostalOne!, a main communications interface  between USPS and mailers. Upgrades to PostalOne! include a better user  interface design for mailers, electronic documentation acceptance  capabilities, and more options for mailers to access Intelligent Mail  tracking information.", "USPS plans to use barcode scan information to measure its service  performance and report the results to PRC. However, USPS will need to  establish report content and format standards that comply with PRC  reporting requirements. In order to report service performance to PRC,  USPS will need to develop a strategy to aggregate information from mail  pieces that will be representative of all mail.

Some of these mailers expressed frustrations with USPS\u2019s approach  because, they said, it appeared to lack planning and consistency, making it  difficult for them to make their needed changes.  Some mailers cited the  lack of an overall plan with dates, which caused difficulty with their  internal planning and resource assignment. Without such a plan, it  appeared that USPS was simultaneously making decisions and  implementing the program. For example, USPS announced it would  provide free Address Correction Service to Full Service participants, and  then subsequently announced a time limit for mailers to use information  and implement address changes. Mailers said that the time limitation made  it practically impossible to utilize the service. Other mailers said that, even  though Intelligent Mail required substantial software changes and  development, USPS continued to make changes to program technical  requirements and specifications, making it difficult for them to respond in  time for the planned implementation date."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives May Not Be Sufficient to Encourage Mailers to Participate in Full Service", "paragraphs": ["Another risk to the success of the Intelligent Mail program is that mailers  may not choose to participate in Intelligent Mail.  Based on our interviews  and review of other industry and USPS documentation, the Intelligent Mail  Full Service option\u2019s pricing and other incentives may not be sufficient to  convince some mailers to participate.  USPS officials have told us that the  success of Intelligent Mail is dependent upon mailers participating in the  Full Service option. Thus, if mailers decline to participate, the program has  a reduced chance of succeeding.", "Some mailers have said that the program\u2019s pricing and benefits are not  enough to provide sufficient incentives or even to recover their  investments.  For example, a mailer association said its members had  hoped for a larger discount than USPS announced, considering the large  investments some companies had made in preparing for the Intelligent  Mail program. A mailer told us that in order for the company to recover its  costs, the discount would have to be one-half of 1 cent per mail piece, or  much higher than the announced price incentives. Costs for mailers  preparing for Full Service vary largely depending on the size of the mailer.  For example, some large mailers said they invested millions of dollars to  update and purchase hardware and software, while some smaller mailers  expected to invest tens of thousands of dollars.", "Some mailers also expressed their concern about USPS\u2019s delay in offering  the price incentives. USPS delayed the effective date of the price  incentives from May 2009 to November 2009. Although USPS said it did so  because it does not want to punish mailers who do not adopt Full Service  immediately, some mailers who were planning on implementing Intelligent  Mail in May viewed this 6-month delay as problematic because of the  increased time to recover their implementation costs. Finally, some  mailers expressed concerns about the duration of the discount after USPS  announced it intends to offer the price incentives on a temporary basis.  According to USPS, these price incentives are not expected to become a  permanent part of its pricing schedule, meaning the incentives would  likely be phased out. USPS and mailers view the financial incentives  differently. According to USPS, the price incentives are one of several  benefits to encourage mailers to participate in Full Service, while many  mailers view the financial incentives as the main benefit of Intelligent Mail.  In addition to concerns about financial incentives, mailers find Intelligent  Mail complex. USPS requires mailers to greatly change the way they  prepare and submit their mail in order to participate in Full Service and  mailers say these changes may discourage them from adopting it. A  mailing industry consultant wrote in a mailing association\u2019s newsletter in  March 2009 that mailers should just sit back and wait until the \u201cdust and  dollars\u201d settle before participating in Full Service because the benefits  provided by Intelligent Mail are not worth the required effort or  investment.", "Other Intelligent Mail benefits offered by USPS may not appeal to some  mailers based on their various business needs and, thus, may not motivate  them to participate. For example, magazine mailers told us they may  benefit from receiving free Address Correction Service\u2014a service which  provides information to mailers when recipients move. Periodical mailers,  including magazines, are currently required by USPS to use Address  Correction Service and must pay $.25 each time they are notified of an  address change. By adopting Full Service, these mailers would receive, at  no additional cost, a service they are currently paying for. However, a  newspaper association representative said that none of the Intelligent Mail  incentives will benefit small newspaper publishers who enter newspapers  at local postal delivery facilities, thus bypassing USPS mail processing  where the Intelligent Mail program information is generated. Additionally,  some mailers viewed the time frame to incorporate updated address  information into subsequent mailings as too short. For example, under  Address Correction Service, the mailers have 30 days to update new  address information without risk of financial penalty, but one mailer told  us more time is needed because its mailings are sometimes prepared  weeks in advance. If mailers do not update the information within the  required timeframe, mailers might incur additional mailing costs from  penalties assessed by USPS.", "Mailers are facing other pressures that could affect their decisions to  participate in Full Service, including a recession that has affected their  businesses and additional postal requirements. Some mailers are reducing  the amount of mail pieces sent out due to a worsening economy. For  example, advertising mail in fiscal year 2008 was adversely affected by the  economy\u2014particularly credit card, mortgage, and home equity  solicitations\u2014as well as the continued shift from mail to electronic  communication. Mailers also face other, additional USPS requirements  unrelated to Intelligent Mail but which coincide with its implementation.  These unrelated requirements may affect mailer participation in Full  Service. Within the last year, USPS required mailers to simultaneously  implement several programs, including changes to the standards for  preparing some mail and the frequency that mailers must update their  address information. A mailer, referring to Intelligent Mail and other new  requirements, wrote in an association newsletter that USPS will  permanently lose customers if it continues to make mailing more difficult  and complex by creating new requirements and increasing prices. Thus,  due to costs incurred to implement Intelligent Mail, the reduction in mail  volume, and additional postal requirements, some mailers have questioned  the value the Intelligent Mail program will add to their businesses.", "USPS says that the incentives it is offering to encourage mailers to  participate in the Full Service option are appropriate to get Full Service  adoption started and recognize the investments mailers must make to  implement Intelligent Mail. According to USPS, the value of Intelligent  Mail lies in the enhanced value of the information it provides, and not only  in any discount that may accompany its introduction. Furthermore, USPS  said it could increase the incentive later if the adoption rate is too low.  USPS also points out that, in addition to the financial discount, Full  Service mailers will have access to Address Correction Service and Start  the Clock information. A senior USPS official told us that the value of  these other services should provide enough benefit for most mailers to  justify the expense of implementing Intelligent Mail. However, according  to a mailer association, many mailers placed a higher value on the  discount, calling it the main incentive to participate in Full Service.", "Without sufficient numbers of customers participating in Intelligent Mail,  USPS may not realize several benefits of the program. Specifically, USPS  may not realize the intended long-term benefit of discontinuing its  existing, manual acceptance and verification process for mailers who use  an automated one for Intelligent Mail. Similarly, USPS\u2019s ability to improve  customer service by providing tracking information on individual mail  pieces will be limited. With this improved tracking capability, USPS could  identify problem areas in its processing and delivery of a mail piece, while  mailers could determine the reasons behind the delivery of late mail,  including an incorrect address or a plant delay. These services to  customers, however, are only available through the Full Service option  because mail pieces in Basic Service are not given unique tracking  numbers. Further, it is not clear what Intelligent Mail information will be  provided to Full Service customers and what price USPS may charge for  this information.", "Finally, USPS\u2019s ability to meet its statutory requirement to measure and  report on how well it is meeting its overall delivery performance standards  could be hindered by low mailer adoption rates. The 2006 Postal  Accountability and Enhancement Act required USPS to report on the  speed and reliability of delivery for each market-dominant product.  According to PRC, the mail data USPS will use to measure its performance  must be representative in order to produce meaningful results. However,  USPS\u2019s measurement system only measures the performance of Full  Service mail (and not Basic Service mail), which may result in a  nonrepresentative sample. PRC views mailer adoption of Full Service  Intelligent Mail as critical to producing accurate performance measures  from data representative of a cross section of mail and notes that mailer  uncertainty about Intelligent Mail requirements, implementation dates and  discount rates may delay adoption. PRC has stated that it will monitor  Intelligent Mail implementation to assure that accurate and representative  data are obtained by requiring USPS to report quarterly on its Intelligent  Mail implementation progress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USPS is implementing a program to enable it to have much greater insight  into the mail but preparations for Intelligent Mail require considerable  work by both USPS and many of its commercial customers. The  management approach USPS is taking has several key risks that have  raised concerns about whether USPS will be able to implement the  program on schedule and with all program functions in place. USPS does  not have a comprehensive strategy that includes information about all the  phases planned, the numerous functions and systems upgrades included,  when they will be implemented, the program\u2019s goals, the baseline costs,  and expected cost savings. Consequently, it will be difficult for USPS to  measure Intelligent Mail\u2019s performance or to account for its results.  Overall, at the program level, key risks include the uncertainty about  whether mailers will find the incentives offered by USPS appealing enough  to participate in the program, resource limitations, and schedule delays.  Although USPS is aware of these risks, it has no plan for dealing with them  should these potential problems materialize. As a result, the  implementation efforts are at risk of taking longer and costing more and  achievement of the program\u2019s intended benefits may be delayed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that USPS addresses these risks to the successful  implementation of Intelligent Mail, we recommend that the Postmaster  General take the following three actions: (1) develop a comprehensive  Intelligent Mail strategic plan that defines all planned phases and their  associated functions and systems and includes program goals and  measures of success; (2) develop cost and savings information for the  activities that can be attributed to the Intelligent Mail program, including  the baseline and metrics to be used to track cost savings achieved; and (3)  develop a plan that addresses how USPS will mitigate program-level risks,  including the implications of lower-than-anticipated customer adoption of  the Full Service Intelligent Mail option, resource limitations, and schedule  delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Postal Service provided written comments on a draft of this  report in a letter from the Senior Vice President, Intelligent Mail and  Address Quality dated April 27, 2009. These comments are reproduced in  appendix III, and our evaluation of them is summarized below. Based on  the comments provided, we made minor modifications to some portions of  this report.", "USPS agreed with our findings that it lacked an up-to-date comprehensive  Intelligent Mail strategic plan and a program-level risk mitigation plan. It  agreed to implement our first recommendation\u2014to develop a  comprehensive Intelligent Mail strategy, including all planned phases and  the associated functions and systems, program goals, and measures of  success\u2014and our third recommendation\u2014to develop a plan that  addresses how it will mitigate risks, including the implication of lower- than-anticipated customer adoption of the Full Service Intelligent Mail  option. USPS did not agree with our finding that it lacks program cost  information, including an estimate of overall Intelligent Mail program costs  and a capability to measure savings, and did not agree to fully implement  our second recommendation, that it develop cost information.", "USPS said it will implement our first recommendation by completing an  update to its 2003 Intelligent Mail Corporate Plan within weeks. It said the  update will detail (1) efforts completed, (2) implementation plans for its  two planned phases, (3) items to be included for a possible third phase, (4)  a vision of future upgrades, and (5) enabling features and capabilities on  Intelligent Mail. This will facilitate improved program management and  accountability. However, USPS did not commit to defining program goals  and measures of success, which we believe are critical components of a  comprehensive strategic or Corporate Plan.", "USPS did not agree to fully implement our second recommendation  because it said that it has detailed program cost information and that costs  are being closely managed and monitored. In addition, USPS generally  disagreed with our finding that it should develop metrics to measure cost  savings associated with its Intelligent Mail effort. USPS said that although  the Intelligent Mail program would provide benefits that should reduce  costs, as well as improve efficiency and service, it did not anticipate a  specific cost or other benefit from its Intelligent Mail investment, in part  because these costs or benefits could not be measured. USPS explained  that there was no sound financial method to specifically attribute cost  reductions to Intelligent Mail when it is also implementing other efforts to  reduce costs. We recognize the difficulty of directly attributing costs to the  Intelligent Mail program and agree with USPS that the activities associated  with the acceptance and verification of commercial mail are most directly  related to the Intelligent Mail program. USPS said that it already has a  baseline and mechanism in place to track the cost and work hours  associated with these activities. Although USPS did not provide us with  this baseline, we agree that measuring and tracking the costs and savings  associated with the acceptance and verification activities would be the  most directly attributable performance indicator. We have modified our  recommendation accordingly, as we continue to believe that cost and  savings information is critical to provide USPS management with a means  for measuring the outcome of its Intelligent Mail efforts. USPS could  address our recommendation by including a discussion of its baseline and  cost tracking mechanism in its Corporate Plan.", "USPS agreed to implement our third recommendation by exploring the  risk analysis and potential mitigation required if mailer adoption rates fall  significantly below expectation, either as a separate document or as a part  of the Intelligent Mail Corporate Plan. In response to our finding that it did  not have a risk mitigation plan, USPS said that, at a technical level, the  Intelligent Mail program has an extremely detailed risk mitigation plan that  outlines both the process to identify risks and approaches to mitigate  these risks. However, USPS also acknowledges that the risk associated  with low mailer adoption is a valid program-level concern. We believe that  including a discussion of how USPS plans to address key risks in an  updated Corporate Plan is appropriate. Our recommendation was not  limited only to risks associated with mailer adoption, and we continue to  believe that USPS should identify and address other risks at the program  level, such as resource limitations or schedule delays, and also include  them in its Corporate Plan.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Member  of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; the  Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal  Service, and the District of Columbia; the Chairman and Ranking Member  of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs;  the Chairman and Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on Federal  Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and  International Security; the Postmaster General; and other interested  parties.

Documented information from USPS included  annual reports, comprehensive operating statements, relevant decision  analysis reports, quarterly investment highlights, and Intelligent Mail  federal register notices, technical guides, readiness plans, schedules,  presentations, and training material. Documented information from the  Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) included USPS proposals and  responses, PRC questions and rulings, and public comments. We also  coordinated with the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG), who was  conducting at least two audits of the Intelligent Mail program at the same  time as our review, and reviewed reports resulting from these audits,  released in March 2009, in addition to other OIG reports. To determine key  changes required for USPS and mailers to prepare for the Intelligent Mail  program, we compared USPS current and proposed changes to mail  acceptance, verification, and processing and toured USPS and mailer  facilities, including a presort and printing facility.", "To address the second objective\u2014risks to implementing the Intelligent  Mail program and how USPS addressed them\u2014and to obtain the  perspective of mailers, we interviewed representatives from 9 companies  involved in the mailing industry who participated in the development of  the Intelligent Mail program. We contacted these companies directly or  through trade associations. We also talked to representatives from six  commercial mailer trade associations who collectively represent most of  the mail sent. For example, one association said its members, which  consist of over 50 profit and nonprofit organizations and major mailing  associations, generate 70 percent of all mail. Documented information  included association newsletters, written minutes of meetings held with  USPS and letters written by the associations to USPS or PRC officials. We  attempted to interview mailers from small companies to obtain their  perspective on the Intelligent Mail program, but we were told by the  largest mailer association\u2014representing both large and small and the  greatest cross section of commercial mailers\u2014that smaller companies  were not as familiar with the Intelligent Mail program and, thus, were  reluctant to talk to us. USPS officials told us that to comply with  Intelligent Mail standards, many smaller companies would either rely on  vendors, such as software vendors, to provide software updates that  included Intelligent Mail capabilities or pay larger mail preparation  companies to prepare their mail.", "We also obtained and reviewed information from the Mailer\u2019s Technical  Advisory Committee, a venue for USPS to share information with mailers  and receive advice and recommendations from workgroups established by  the group\u2019s leadership, which is comprised of USPS and mailing industry  officials. We reviewed documentation from the Mailer\u2019s Technical  Advisory Committee, including written meeting minutes, and  documentation of issues that workgroups have identified and are working  on or have resolved and monitored weekly teleconferences held by  individual workgroups. We attended a local meeting in Dallas, Texas of a  Postal Customer Council, which is a national program comprised of over  two hundred local-level councils that provide a forum for mailers to  exchange ideas for improved mail service and discuss new and existing  USPS products, programs, regulations, and procedures. At the Postal  Customer Council, we participated in Intelligent Mail presentations given  by USPS and observed presentations given by top USPS leadership. We  also attended a presentation of USPS\u2019s Intelligent Mail University, a 1-day  USPS training course in Washington, D.C. for mailers.", "To identify risks associated with USPS\u2019s Intelligent Mail program  management approach, we worked with GAO\u2019s Information Technology  team which provided us analytical guidance in identifying relevant criteria.  We used criteria based on the practices of leading organizations, such as  the Software Engineering Institute and the Chief Information Officer\u2019s  Council, to effectively manage major programs and minimize risks. In  addition, we used criteria identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital  Program Costs (GAO-09-3SP). We compared selected criteria to  information and documentation obtained from USPS to identify areas  where USPS\u2019s management approach for Intelligent Mail did not match  criteria for sound risk management.", "In order to provide as broad a perspective as possible on mailer concerns  with USPS\u2019s implementation of the Intelligent Mail program, we analyzed  comments submitted in response to the January and April 2008 USPS  Federal Register notices regarding Intelligent Mail, primarily by  commercial mailers and mailer associations. Specifically, we reviewed two  sets of mailer comments to two Federal Register notices: (1) the  Implementation of New Standards for Intelligent Mail Barcodes, Advance  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Advance Notice) in January 2008, 73 Fed.  Reg. 1158 (Jan. 7, 2008) and (2) the Implementation of New Standards for  Intelligent Mail Barcodes, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed  Rule) in April 2008, 73 Fed. Reg. 23393 (Apr. 30, 2008). We took a different  analytical approach with each set of comments. Due to the large number  of comments USPS said it received in response to its Advance Notice  (nearly 400 written comments) and the intended use of the results of the  analysis, we determined the most appropriate method to analyze these  comments was to verify and validate USPS\u2019s summary of these comments  as published in the Proposed Rule. In the Proposed Rule, there were 16  statements made by USPS in summarizing the comments. We reviewed all  of the original comments and found evidence of comments supporting  each of the 16 statements. For the second Federal Register notice, the  Proposed Rule, USPS said it received 67 sets of comments. We determined  the most appropriate method to analyze these comments was to conduct a  complete content analysis by reviewing and categorizing all 67 comments.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2008 to April 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
