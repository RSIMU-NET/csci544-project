Unlike corn starch-based or cellulosic ethanol, drop-in fuels such as renewable gasoline are fully compatible with existing infrastructure, such as vehicle engines and distribution pipelines. In fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the federal government obligated more than $1.1 billion for advanced biofuels R&D. Of this amount, the Department of Energy (DOE) obligated over $890 million. For example, DOE's Office of Science funds three bioenergy research centers affiliated with universities and national labs that conduct basic research for all stages of biofuel production. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) obligated over $168 million in fiscal years 2013 through 2015 to support advanced biofuels. For example, USDA scientists developed a novel process to increase production of butanol, a drop-in fuel that lowered production costs by over 20 percent. The remaining federal obligations during these years were through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which obligated relatively less for such R&D. According to agency officials, agencies are shifting their focus to drop-in fuels in part because they are compatible with existing infrastructure. Officials from one federal funding agency said this compatibility makes drop-in fuels more desirable than cellulosic ethanol.", "Experts said that several advanced biofuels are technologically well understood and some are being commercially produced, but they noted there is limited potential for increased production in the near term and cited several factors that will make significant increases challenging. Given that current advanced biofuel production is far below Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) targets and those targets are increasing every year, it does not appear possible to meet statutory target volumes for advanced biofuels in the RFS under current market and regulatory conditions. Biofuels that are technologically well understood include biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, cellulosic ethanol, and some drop-in fuels. A few of these fuels, such as biodiesel and renewable diesel, are being produced in significant volumes, but it is unlikely that production of these fuels can expand much in the next few years because of feedstock limitations. Current production of cellulosic biofuels is far below the statutory volumes and, according to experts, there is limited potential for expanded production to meet future higher targets, in part because production costs are currently too high. Experts told GAO that technologies for producing other fuels, such as some drop-in fuels, are technologically well understood but that these fuels are not being produced because production is too costly. Among the factors that will affect the speed and volume of production, experts cited the low price of fossil fuels relative to advanced biofuels. This disparity in costs is a disincentive for consumers to adopt greater use of biofuels and also a deterrent for private investors entering the advanced biofuels market. Experts also cited uncertainty about government policy, including whether the RFS and federal tax credits that support advanced biofuels will remain in effect. While such policies should encourage investment, investors do not see them as reliable and thus discount their potential benefits when considering whether to invest."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) calls for increasing volumes of  renewable fuels to be blended into domestic transportation fuels through  2022, with the goals, as outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding the nation\u2019s  renewable fuels sector while reducing reliance on imported oil.

However,  production of advanced biofuels has not kept pace with targets in the  RFS. In part because of insufficient production, EPA, which is responsible  for implementing the RFS, has used its authority to set annual volume  requirements for advanced biofuels that are below the targets in the  statute starting in 2014. For example, for 2016, EPA set a volume  requirement of 3.61 billion gallons for total advanced biofuel, although the  statutory target is 7.25 billion gallons. This lower volume requirement  reflected in part, EPA\u2019s expectation of how much advanced biofuel could  be produced.", "To reach large-scale production, advanced biofuels must go through a  scale-up process from laboratory-proven technology to production on a  commercial scale\u2014a process that can be time-consuming and expensive.

We reviewed obligations data for  advanced biofuels R&D for fiscal years 2013 through 2015. In some  cases, agencies or offices estimated these obligations because they did  not track obligations data for advanced biofuels R&D separately from  other biofuels or bioenergy R&D. To assess the reliability of the  obligations data, we requested information from officials who maintain the  relevant databases about steps they take to maintain them. We  determined that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To describe expert views on the extent to which advanced biofuels are  technologically understood and on the factors that will affect the speed  and volume of production, we worked with the National Academy of  Sciences to convene a group of 19 experts for a 2-day meeting in May  2016. One additional expert was unable to attend the meeting, and we  interviewed him separately. (See app. II for a list of the experts we  consulted.) We analyzed summary statements agreed upon by experts at  the meeting as well as meeting transcripts to inform this report. To better  understand the extent to which advanced biofuels are technologically  understood and the factors that will affect the speed and volume of  production, we also interviewed representatives from 11 companies that  produce, or aim to produce, advanced biofuels. We selected these  producers on the basis of technology used and scale of production.  Specifically, we selected companies using well-established technologies  and producing at commercial scale, companies using first-of-their-kind  technologies and producing at commercial scale, and companies using  first-of-their-kind technologies and not yet producing at commercial scale.  Our interviews with producers provided key insights on and real-world  examples of the factors that influence the speed and scale of advanced  biofuel production; however, the results of our interviews cannot be  generalized to all producers.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Advanced biofuels are produced through a variety of combinations of (1)  a feedstock, which is the type of renewable biomass that is converted into  a renewable fuel, and (2) a conversion technology, which is used to  convert renewable biomass into fuel. The result is a final fuel product.  Advanced biofuels may be made from an assortment of feedstocks,  ranging from waste fats and oils to crops grown expressly for biofuels  production, such as grasses like miscanthus and switchgrass. (See   fig. 1.)", "These feedstocks are converted into fuel using a variety of conversion  technologies that generally rely on chemicals, catalysts, enzymes, heat,  or pressure. Depending on the feedstock and conversion technology  used, the fuel may fit into one or more of three advanced biofuels  categories established in the RFS.", "Advanced: renewable fuel, other than ethanol derived from corn  starch, that has life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions at least 50  percent lower than traditional petroleum-based fuels. This is a catch- all category that may include a number of fuels, including fuels made  from algae or ethanol made from sugar cane. This category includes  the following subcategories:", "Biomass-based diesel: biodiesel or renewable diesel that has  life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent lower  than traditional petroleum-based diesel fuels.", "Cellulosic: renewable fuel derived from any cellulose,  hemicellulose, or lignin that is derived from renewable biomass  and has lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions at least 60 percent  lower than traditional petroleum-based fuels. This category of fuel  may include cellulosic ethanol, renewable gasoline, cellulosic  diesel, and renewable natural gas from landfills that can be  upgraded and used in vehicles designed to run on liquefied or  compressed natural gas.", "Some advanced biofuels are compatible with existing engines and the  fuel distribution infrastructure. Such fuels, known as \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuels,  include renewable diesel, renewable jet fuel, and renewable gasoline.  Other advanced biofuels are not fully compatible. For example, cellulosic  ethanol, like corn-starch ethanol, faces limits on the amount that can be  blended into gasoline, in part because it is more corrosive. Drop-in fuels  do not face this limitation because they are compatible with current  infrastructure.", "EPA is responsible for implementing the RFS through several  mechanisms.  Specifically, EPA approves new combinations of  feedstocks, conversion processes, and fuels that can be counted toward  the statutory targets. EPA also has the authority to waive statutory targets  and set annual volume requirements for categories of renewable fuels,  including advanced biofuels. These volumes may deviate from the  statutory targets because of inadequate domestic supply, among other  reasons. For 2010 through 2013, EPA set annual volume requirements  for the cellulosic biofuels category that were below statutory targets, but  kept the overall volume for all advanced biofuels in line with the statute.  For 2014 through 2017, in addition to setting lower annual volume  requirements for the cellulosic biofuels category, EPA also set lower  overall volume requirements for all advanced biofuels. For 2013 through  2017 EPA also set volume requirements for biomass-based diesel that  were higher than the minimums set in the statute, which somewhat offset  the lower requirements for cellulosic biofuels. (See fig. 2 for a  comparison of statutory targets and volume requirements set by EPA.)", "In addition to the RFS, there are federal tax incentives to promote the  production and use of advanced biofuels. These include the Biodiesel  Income Tax Credit, which provides a $1 per-gallon tax credit for  producers of certain biodiesel or renewable diesel. Separately, the  Second Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit provides advanced  biofuel producers a tax credit of up to $1.01 per gallon of advanced  biofuel produced and used domestically.", "R&D related to advanced biofuels includes both basic and applied  research. In general, basic research focuses on gaining a fundamental  understanding of a material or process. Applied research explores the  potential of a material or process to satisfy a technology need.  Components of an advanced biofuels applied research portfolio may  include developing technologies to provide a reliable, affordable, and  sustainable biomass supply. To reach commercial-scale production,  advanced biofuels must go through a process of increasing the scale of  production, beginning with a research and development phase that  culminates in proving a given technology in a laboratory setting. Once a  conversion technology has been proven at laboratory scale, it can be  scaled up and tested in a pilot facility. Pilot-scale facilities are small-scale  facilities that verify the integrated performance of a given suite of  technologies from feedstock through final product. Once a technology has  been proven at this scale, it can be scaled up to a demonstration facility,  which verifies the performance of integrated technologies at a scale that  can be used to determine design specifications for a still larger facility.  Commercial-scale facilities, including both \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d and  subsequent facilities, aim to produce commercial volumes economically  on a continuous basis, with a reliable feedstock supply and production  distribution system.

The Office of Science also awards  grants to fund projects at national laboratories and academic  institutions. Research covers all areas of biofuels R&D, including  sustainability, feedstock development and logistics, and conversion  technologies. DOE officials told us that, although they continue to  investigate cellulosic ethanol, drop-in fuels are more desirable  because they are compatible with current engine designs and fueling  infrastructure. According to an agency official, the office supports  basic research and focuses efforts on demonstrating proof of  concept\u2014showing that laboratory results can be replicated in real- world conditions. For example, staff at one of the bioenergy research  centers supported by the Office of Science recently transplanted  poplar trees that had been cultivated for biofuel production under  laboratory conditions to the field to observe their growth.

The office focuses on  developing and transforming renewable biomass into commercially  viable high-performance biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower. The  office spent much of the past decade focusing R&D on cellulosic  ethanol, but after meeting key goals to reduce production costs, the  office shifted its focus to drop-in fuels in 2012. For example, the  Bioenergy Technologies Office funded a project by the nonprofit Gas  Technology Institute to develop a process for converting a broad  range of feedstocks\u2014residue from wood harvesting and  manufacturing, algae, and corn stover\u2014into drop-in fuels. According  to DOE officials, the process resulted in fuels that meet technical  specifications for gasoline and diesel while achieving a 90-percent  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to fossil fuels.

This cellulosic biofuel volume was less than 5 percent of the  statutory target of 3 billion gallons. According to experts, there is limited  potential for expanded production of cellulosic ethanol in the next 5 years  to meet the higher volumes called for in the statute. Experts said that the  most economical way to quickly expand production of cellulosic ethanol is  through \u201cbolt-on\u201d facilities, which use the cellulosic corn fiber remaining  after corn-starch ethanol production as a feedstock; however, the experts  said that such facilities would not boost overall cellulosic ethanol volumes  by more than about 750 million gallons even if added to every existing  corn-starch ethanol refinery. This is far short of the 2015 target of 3 billion  gallons. Several corn-starch ethanol producers are already using such  bolt-on facilities, and other corn-starch ethanol producers are expected to  follow suit, according to experts and producers we interviewed, because  these technologies require relatively low expenditures of capital and these  costs can be recovered relatively quickly. Experts said that significant  expansion of cellulosic ethanol production beyond current levels would  require construction of large stand-alone facilities and that even though  several such facilities have been built, attracting the investments  necessary to build more is unlikely until conversion yields and operability  improve and costs come down. Concerning renewable natural gas, which  is produced mainly from landfills, an expert noted that to be usable as a  transportation fuel, the gas must be purified and adjusted to  specifications. A renewable natural gas producer we spoke with said the  cost to upgrade landfill gas to meet such specifications is significant and  that landfill gas can be used for other purposes, including making  electricity, without this costly upgrading. The producer told us that despite  the additional cost, the incremental revenue from credits under the RFS  makes it worthwhile to upgrade landfill gas.", "According to the experts, some other technologies for producing  advanced biofuels are also well understood, but these technologies have  produced relatively small volumes of fuel because they cannot compete  with petroleum-based fuels given current oil prices and despite federal  biofuels tax credits and other incentives. These technologies include  pyrolysis, which involves the thermal and chemical decomposition of a  feedstock without the introduction of oxygen. About 44,000 gallons of  cellulosic renewable gasoline blendstock and about 9,000 gallons of  cellulosic diesel were produced in 2014 and none in 2015 or 2016  because the producer went out of business.

First, experts said getting consumers to accept higher blends of  advanced biofuels at the pump will require those biofuels to be priced  competitively with equivalent fossil fuels. While the average retail  gasoline price was over $4 per gallon in May 2011, it dropped to  under $2 per gallon in early 2016, making it harder to compete on  price at the pump. Similarly, retail diesel prices were over $4 per  gallon as recently as March 2014, but briefly fell below $2 in early  2016. Second, experts said low fossil fuel prices are a significant  impediment to biofuels investment. One expert noted that investment  in advanced biofuels technology has dropped since oil prices have  dropped, making it difficult to fund the R&D needed to reduce the cost  of biofuels. Experts agreed that one option to overcome this fossil  fuels price advantage would be to put a price on greenhouse gas  emissions\u2014for example, through a carbon tax or similar mechanism.", "High cost of converting cellulosic feedstocks. Experts told us that  conversion costs are a function of (1) the number of processing steps  it takes to convert a raw feedstock to a fuel; (2) the difficulty of  transporting and handling solid feedstocks as compared with liquid or  gaseous feedstocks; (3) the difficulty of handling and disposing of  waste products from the conversion process; and (4) infrastructure  challenges associated with a plant\u2019s location, such as access to a  steady feedstock supply and rail lines to transport fuel. For example,  one expert noted that handling solid feedstocks on the front end of  conversion, as opposed to liquids or gases, is more time consuming  and complex, resulting in additional costs. These feedstocks, such as  corn stover or forest logging residues, may need to be ground or  chipped to a uniform size so they will more easily flow through  equipment, and debris such as rocks and dirt may need to be  removed to prevent damage to equipment. In addition, experts noted  that it can be costly to dispose of waste products from the conversion  process. Ideally, producers will find ways to monetize waste products  by creating coproducts, but more work is needed in this area to make  that a reality. For example, lignin\u2014a part of plant matter that is left  over after conversion to cellulosic ethanol\u2014can be burned to produce  energy. One producer told us using lignin in carbon fiber may be a  future possibility.", "Time and cost to bring a new technology to commercial-scale  production. Experts told us that developing a biofuel technology and  bringing it from laboratory scale to commercial scale may take 12  years if every step works out well, and could take considerably longer;  one representative we interviewed from a company that produces  biofuel said this process may take 15 to 25 years. (See fig. 6 for  examples of laboratory-scale and commercial-scale advanced  biofuels production.) Once a biofuel technology is technologically  ready, the design, engineering, and construction of the first plant  normally take 3 to 4 years, according to experts. Such first-of-their- kind facilities often face challenges because the companies are still  optimizing the technology and may encounter problems that only  occur when building at commercial scale. One producer told us they  overbuilt their first commercial facility out of caution. Therefore these  facilities take longer and are more expensive to construct than  subsequent facilities. A representative of a company that produces  advanced biofuel told us that, compared to the cost of its first plant, it  has identified opportunities that could save about 25 percent on its  next plant.", "Time and cost to secure fuel certification and acceptance.", "Experts told us that once a fuel can be produced several steps remain  before it can be brought to market, including regulatory registration,  certification by ASTM International, as well as oil company and  vehicle acceptance. These steps can occur concurrently, but they  have different time frames. In addition, these steps are costly for  companies. For example, one expert said that passing the EPA  registration for a new fuel costs millions of dollars, while another noted  that ASTM certification of a new fuel is a longer and more expensive  process. Oil companies and vehicle manufacturers must also approve  a new fuel before they will be willing to blend it for use in  transportation fuels. New advanced biofuels must also have their  combination of a feedstock, a conversion process, and a final product  approved by EPA in order to be counted toward the annual volume  requirements under the RFS. A representative from one company we  spoke to told us EPA\u2019s reviews are taking longer than expected. One  expert told us that two different advanced biofuels projects have been  recently cancelled specifically because of the time it has taken for  EPA to complete these approvals.", "Uncertainty about government policy. Experts agreed that  uncertainty about government policy is a major barrier for the  commercialization of advanced biofuels because it sends mixed  signals to the market, which can limit investment. The future of the  RFS, the Biodiesel Income Tax Credit, and the Second Generation  Biofuel Producer Tax Credit may all be sources of uncertainty.  Regarding the RFS, there is uncertainty about whether it will remain in  place, and uncertainty about where EPA will set annual volume  requirements. As described in the sidebar on this page, the tax credits  have been allowed to expire and then have been retroactively  extended in the past. This uncertainty affects all stages of biofuel  production. For example, one expert stated that producers of farm  equipment will not invest in new harvesting technology to maximize  biomass feedstock yields if they see too much uncertainty in the  market for advanced biofuels over the next 10 years, while other  experts noted the difficulty in obtaining capital to build commercial- scale plants. Every advanced biofuels producer we interviewed also  cited uncertainty about government policy as a major barrier to  commercial-scale production. One producer said policy uncertainty  has increased since 2013 when EPA used its waiver authority to  reduce the RFS statutory volumes, causing investors to lose  confidence and interest in commercial-scale plants. Another producer  we interviewed told us that producers cannot rely on the Second  Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit in their investment decisions.", "Underdeveloped feedstock supply chain. Experts agreed that the  lack of logistics for the entire feedstock supply chain\u2014from securing a  contract to delivering and storing a feedstock\u2014is an economic barrier  to the production of advanced biofuels. One expert noted that it may  take longer to set up contracts with farmers for feedstock delivery,  such as corn stover, than it takes to build an advanced biofuels plant.  Without a developed commodity market for advanced biofuel  feedstocks, producers must negotiate contracts with individual  farmers, which is costly and time consuming. One cellulosic biofuel  producer told us it faced challenges with feedstock transport and  storage in trying to minimize burdens on farmers. Specifically, the  producer noted that it was working with farmers to offer two different  contract models: to store bales of stover at the farm, or to store them  at the plant. Experts also noted that large amounts of dry cellulosic  feedstock in storage may be susceptible to fire, such as from lightning  strikes\u2014something that has happened at one cellulosic ethanol  facility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to EPA, USDA, NSF, DOE, and DOD  for review and comment.

We reviewed obligations data for  advanced biofuels research and development for fiscal years 2013  through 2015. In some cases, agencies or offices estimated these  obligations because they did not track obligations data for advanced  biofuels R&D separately from other biofuels or bioenergy R&D. In  addition, USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service was not able to provide  obligations data for advanced biofuels R&D, but provided allocations data  instead. These data differ in that allocations are a delegation of authority  to obligate funds, while obligations are legally binding agreements to  outlay funds. According to officials from the Agricultural Research  Service, it does not track funding for its research projects by obligations  but rather by the allocation of funding by research project. Agency  officials told us that they have reasonable certainty that the allocations  they provided to us would align one-to-one with the obligations for agency  research projects. To assess the reliability of the obligations data, we  asked officials who maintain the relevant databases for information about  steps they take to maintain the data. We determined that the data we  used were sufficiently reliable for purposes of describing the scale of  advanced biofuels R&D by the federal government. In addition, to further  develop an understanding of the type of R&D done with federal funding,  we visited the USDA Agricultural Research Service\u2019s National Center for  Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois and National Laboratory  for Agriculture and the Environment in Ames, Iowa. We also visited a  DOE Office of Science Bioenergy Research Center in Madison,  Wisconsin.", "To describe expert views on the extent to which advanced biofuels are  technologically understood and on the factors that will affect the speed  and volume of production, we contracted with the National Academy of  Sciences to convene a group of 20 experts for a 2-day meeting in May  2016. One expert was unable to attend the meeting, and we interviewed  him separately. (See app. II for a list of the experts who participated.)  Participants, who were identified and recommended by the National  Academy of Sciences and approved by us, included experts in advanced  biofuels feedstocks, conversion technologies, and the use of biofuels from  industry, academia, and research organizations.", "We asked these experts to discuss the technological readiness of a  variety of biofuels and the economic and other factors that may affect the  speed and volume of their commercial-scale production. Specifically, we  asked the experts to discuss the short-, medium-, and long-term technical  potential of a variety of advanced biofuels and the conversion processes  and feedstocks that can be used to make them, as well as any  opportunities and challenges associated with these fuels, conversion  processes, and feedstocks. We also asked them to discuss the most  important economic and scale-up factors that will affect the speed and  volume of commercial-scale production of advanced biofuels once they  are technologically ready, and any particular areas on which the federal  government should focus its R&D efforts to advance the technological  readiness of advanced biofuels. We analyzed summary statements  agreed upon by experts at the meeting as well as meeting transcripts to  inform this report.", "To better understand the extent to which advanced biofuels are  technologically understood and the factors that will affect the speed and  volume of production, we also interviewed representatives, either in  person or over the phone, from 11 companies that produce, or aim to  produce, advanced biofuels. We visited POET-DSM\u2019s cellulosic ethanol  plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa; Quad County Corn Processor\u2019s\u2019 cellulosic  ethanol plant in Galva, Iowa; and Solazyme\u2019s demonstration plant in  Peoria, Illinois. Producers were selected on the basis of technology used  and scale of production to ensure a variety of perspectives. Specifically,  we selected companies that are using well-established technologies and  producing at commercial scale, companies using first-of-their-kind  technologies and producing at commercial scale, and companies using  first-of-their-kind technologies and not yet producing at commercial scale.  These selection criteria allowed us to obtain broader perspectives on the  logistical challenges of scaling up a technology, the factors involved in  processing different fuel types, and the factors involved in EPA  registration. These producer interviews provided key insights on and real- world examples of the factors that influence the speed and scale of  advanced biofuel production; however, the results of our interviews  cannot be generalized to all producers.
