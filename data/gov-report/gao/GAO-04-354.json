Control systems can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, examples of which have already occurred. Successful attacks on control systems could have devastating consequences, such as endangering public health and safety. Securing control systems poses significant challenges, including limited specialized security technologies and lack of economic justification. The government, academia, and private industry have initiated efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity of control systems. The President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace establishes a role for DHS to coordinate with these entities to improve the cybersecurity of control systems. While some coordination is occurring, DHS's coordination of these efforts could accelerate the development and implementation of more secure systems.

The  benefits have been enormous. Vast amounts of information are now  literally at our fingertips, facilitating research on virtually every topic  imaginable; financial and other business transactions can be executed  almost instantaneously, often 24 hours a day, and electronic mail, Internet  Web sites, and computer bulletin boards allow us to communicate quickly  and easily with an unlimited number of individuals and groups.", "However, this widespread interconnectivity poses significant risks to the  government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s computer systems and, more important, to  the critical operations and infrastructures they support. For example,  telecommunications, power distribution systems, water supplies, public  health services, national defense (including the military\u2019s warfighting  capability), law enforcement, government services, and emergency  services all depend on the security of their computer operations. If not  properly controlled, the speed and accessibility that create the enormous  benefits of the computer age may allow individuals and organizations to  eavesdrop on or interfere with these operations from remote locations for  mischievous or malicious purposes, including fraud or sabotage. Table 1  summarizes the key threats to our nation\u2019s infrastructures, as observed by  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).", "Government officials remain concerned about attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism, foreign  intelligence gathering, and acts of war. According to the FBI, terrorists,  transnational criminals, and intelligence services are quickly becoming  aware of and using information exploitation tools such as computer  viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping sniffers  that can destroy, intercept, degrade the integrity of, or deny access to  data. In addition, the disgruntled organization insider is a significant  threat, because these individuals often have knowledge about the  organization and its system that allows them to gain unrestricted access  and inflict damage or steal assets without knowing a great deal about  computer intrusions. As larger amounts of money and more sensitive  economic and commercial information are exchanged electronically, and  as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities increasingly rely on  standardized information technology (IT), the likelihood increases that  information attacks will threaten vital national interests.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, more  intrusion or \u201chacking\u201d tools have become readily available and relatively  easy to use. A hacker can download tools from the Internet and literally  \u201cpoint and click\u201d to start an attack. Experts agree that there has been a  steady advance in the level of sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. Intruders quickly develop attacks to exploit vulnerabilities  that have been discovered in products, use these attacks to compromise  computers, and share them with other attackers. In addition, they can  combine these attacks with other forms of technology to develop  programs that automatically scan networks for vulnerable systems, attack  them, compromise them, and use them to spread the attack even further.", "From 1995 through 2003, the CERT\uf8e8 Coordination Center (CERT/CC)  reported 12,946 security vulnerabilities that resulted from software flaws.", "Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic growth in security vulnerabilities over  these years. The growing number of known vulnerabilities increases the  potential for attacks by the hacker community. Attacks can be launched  against specific targets or widely distributed through viruses and worms.", "Along with these increasing vulnerabilities, the number of computer  security incidents reported to CERT/CC has also risen dramatically\u2014from  9,859 in 1999 to 82,094 in 2002 and to 137,529 in 2003. And these are only  the reported attacks. The Director of the CERT Centers has estimated that  as much as 80 percent of actual security incidents goes unreported, in  most cases because (1) there were no indications of penetration or attack,  (2) the organization was unable to recognize that its systems had been  penetrated, or (3) the organization was reluctant to report. Figure 2 shows  the number of incidents that were reported to the CERT/CC from 1995  through 2003.", "According to the National Security Agency (NSA), foreign governments  already have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential  adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and  methods to attack these systems. The National Infrastructure Protection  Center (NIPC) reported in January 2002 that a computer belonging to an  individual who had indirect links to Osama bin Laden contained computer  programs that indicated that the individual was interested in the structural  engineering of dams and other water-retaining structures. The NIPC report  also stated that U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies had  received indications that Al Qaeda members had sought information about  control systems from multiple Web sites, specifically on water supply and  wastewater management practices in the United States and abroad.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, warnings of the potential  for terrorist cyber attacks against our critical infrastructures have  increased. For example, in his February 2002 statement for the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence, the Director of Central Intelligence  discussed the possibility of a cyber warfare attack by terrorists. He stated  that the September 11 attacks demonstrated the nation\u2019s dependence on  critical infrastructure systems that rely on electronic and computer  networks. Further, he noted that attacks of this nature would become an  increasingly viable option for terrorists as they and other foreign  adversaries become more familiar with these targets and the technologies  required to attack them. James Woolsey, a former Director of Central  Intelligence, shares this concern, and on October 29, 2003, in a speech  before several hundred security experts, he warned that the nation should  be prepared for continued terrorist attacks on our critical infrastructures.  Moreover, a group of concerned scientists warned President Bush in a  letter that \u201cthe critical infrastructure of the United States, including  electrical power, finance, telecommunications, health care, transportation,  water, defense and the Internet, is highly vulnerable to cyber attack. Fast  and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid national disaster.\u201d  According to a study by a computer security organization, during the  second half of 2002, the highest rates of global computer attacks were for  those aimed at companies that provide critical infrastructures such as  power, energy, and financial services.

Typically, control systems collect sensor  measurements and operational data from the field, process and display  this information, and relay control commands to local or remote  equipment. In the electric power industry, control systems can manage  and control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric  power\u2014 for example, by opening and closing circuit breakers and setting  thresholds for preventive shutdowns. Employing integrated control  systems, the oil and gas industry can control the refining operations at a  plant site, remotely monitor the pressure and flow of gas pipelines, and  control the flow and pathways of gas transmission. Water utilities can  remotely monitor well levels and control the wells\u2019 pumps; monitor flows,  tank levels, or pressure in storage tanks; monitor water quality  characteristics\u2014such as pH, turbidity, and chlorine residual; and control  the addition of chemicals. Control systems also are used in manufacturing  and chemical processing. Control systems perform functions that vary  from simple to complex; they can be used simply to monitor processes\u2014 for example, the environmental conditions in a small office building\u2014or to  manage most activities in a municipal water system or even a nuclear  power plant.", "In certain industries, such as chemical and power generation, safety  systems are typically implemented in order to mitigate a potentially  disastrous event if control and other systems should fail. In addition, to  guard against both physical attack and system failure, organizations may  establish backup control centers that include uninterruptible power  supplies and backup generators.", "There are two primary types of control systems. Distributed Control  Systems (DCS) typically are used within a single processing or generating  plant or over a small geographic area. Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition (SCADA) systems typically are used for large, geographically  dispersed distribution operations. For example, a utility company may use  a DCS to generate power and a SCADA system to distribute it. Figure 3  illustrates the typical components of a control system.", "A control system typically is made up of a \u201cmaster\u201d or central supervisory  control and monitoring station consisting of one or more human-machine  interfaces where an operator can view status information about the  remote/local sites and issue commands directly to the system. Typically,  this station is located at a main site, along with application servers and an  engineering workstation that is used to configure and troubleshoot the  other components of the control system. The supervisory control and  monitoring station typically is connected to local controller stations  through a hard-wired network or to a remote controller station through a  communications network\u2014which could be the Internet, a public switched  telephone network, or a cable or wireless (e.g., radio, microwave, or   Wi-Fi) network. Each controller station has a remote terminal unit (RTU),  a programmable logic controller (PLC), or some other controller that  communicates with the supervisory control and monitoring station.", "The control system also includes sensors and control equipment that  connect directly with the working components of the infrastructure\u2014for  example, pipelines, water towers, or power lines. The sensor takes  readings from the infrastructure equipment\u2014such as water or pressure  levels, electrical voltage or current\u2014and sends a message to the  controller. The controller may be programmed to determine a course of  action and send a message to the control equipment instructing it what to  do\u2014for example, to turn off a valve or dispense a chemical. If the  controller is not programmed to determine a course of action, the  controller communicates with the supervisory control and monitoring  station and relays instructions back to the control equipment. The control  system also can be programmed to issue alarms to the operator when  certain conditions are detected. Handheld devices, such as personal digital  assistants, can be used to locally monitor controller stations. Experts  report that technologies in controller stations are becoming more  intelligent and automated and are able to communicate with the  supervisory central monitoring and control station less frequently, thus  requiring less human intervention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control Systems Are at Increasing Risk", "paragraphs": ["Historically, security concerns about control systems were related  primarily to protecting them against physical attack and preventing the  misuse of refining and processing sites or distribution and holding  facilities.

These widely-used, standardized  technologies have commonly known vulnerabilities, and sophisticated and  effective exploitation tools are widely available and relatively easy to use.  As a consequence, both the number of people with the knowledge to wage  attacks and the number of systems subject to attack have increased.

Using war dialers to find modems connected to the  programmable circuit breakers of the electric power control system,  hackers could crack passwords that control access to the circuit breakers  and could change the control settings to cause local power outages and  even damage equipment. A hacker could lower settings from, for example,  500 amperes to 200 on some circuit breakers; normal power usage would  then activate, or \u201ctrip,\u201d the circuit breakers, taking those lines out of  service and diverting power to neighboring lines. If, at the same time, the  hacker raised the settings on these neighboring lines to 900 amperes,  circuit breakers would fail to trip at these high settings, and the diverted  power would overload the lines and cause significant damage to  transformers and other critical equipment.
