To be eligible for Medicaid long-term care, individuals may transfer assets (income and resources) to others to ensure that their assets fall below certain limits. Individuals who make transfers for less than fair market value (FMV) can be subject to a penalty that may delay Medicaid coverage. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) changed the calculation and timing of the penalty period and set requirements for the treatment of certain types of assets. GAO was asked to provide data on the extent to which asset transfers for less than FMV occur. GAO examined (1) the financial characteristics of elderly nursing home residents nationwide, (2) the demographic and financial characteristics of a sample of Medicaid nursing home applicants, (3) the extent to which these applicants transferred assets for less than FMV, and (4) the potential effects of the DRA provisions related to Medicaid eligibility for long-term care. GAO analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national panel survey, and from 540 randomly selected Medicaid nursing home application files from 3 counties in each of 3 states (Maryland, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina). State and county selections were based on the prevalence of several factors, including population, income, and demographics."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, HRS data showed that, at the time most elderly individuals entered a nursing home, they had nonhousing resources of $70,000 or less--less than the average cost for a year of private-pay nursing home care. Overall, nursing home residents covered by Medicaid had fewer nonhousing resources and lower annual incomes, and were less likely to have reported transferring cash than non-Medicaid-covered nursing home residents. Similar to the nationwide results, GAO's review of 540 Medicaid nursing home applications in three states showed that over 90 percent of the applicants had nonhousing resources of $30,000 or less and 85 percent had annual incomes of $20,000 or less. One-fourth of applicants owned homes, with a median home value of $52,954. Over 80 percent of applicants had been living in long-term care facilities for an average of a little over 4 months at the time of their application. Of the 540 applicants, 408 were approved for Medicaid coverage for nursing home services the first time they applied and 122 were denied. Of the denied applicants, 56 were denied for having income or resources that exceeded the standards, 41 of whom submitted subsequent applications and were eventually approved, primarily by decreasing the value of their nonhousing resources. For about one-third of these applicants, at least part of the decrease in nonhousing resources could be attributed to spending on medical or nursing home care. Approximately 10 percent of approved applicants in the three states (47 of 465) transferred assets for less than FMV, with a median amount of $15,152. The average length of the penalty period assessed for the 47 applicants was about 6 months. However, only 2 of these applicants experienced a delay in Medicaid eligibility as a result of the transfers because many applicants' assessed penalties had expired by the time they applied for coverage. The extent to which DRA long-term care provisions will affect applicants' eligibility for Medicaid is uncertain. DRA provisions regarding changes to penalty periods could increase the likelihood that applicants who transfer assets for less than FMV will experience a delay in Medicaid eligibility, but the extent of the delay is uncertain. Several factors could affect the extent to which DRA penalty period provisions actually delay eligibility for Medicaid. These factors include whether an applicant transferred assets for less than FMV before or after the DRA was enacted and a potential increase in requests for waived penalty periods due to undue hardship--circumstances under which individuals are deprived of medical care, food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities of life. Other DRA provisions may have limited effects on eligibility. For example, provisions pertaining to home equity may have limited impact because few applicants whose files GAO reviewed had home equity of sufficient value to be affected. CMS, Maryland, and South Carolina generally agreed with the report's findings; Pennsylvania did not provide comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Long-term care is costly\u2014particularly nursing home care, which is  estimated to average more than $70,000 a year for a private-pay patient.  Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care financing program that covers  certain categories of low-income individuals, paid for nearly one-half of  the nation\u2019s total long-term care expenditures of about $193 billion in 2004.  As such, long-term care expenditures were a significant portion of total  Medicaid expenditures in 2004, comprising 32 percent of the total   $296 billion spent. As the nation\u2019s population ages and more individuals  are likely to need long-term care services, federal Medicaid spending is  expected to nearly double in size during the next 10 years. In light of the  associated increased demand and burden that these trends place on  federal and state budgets, it is important to ensure that Medicaid coverage  for long-term care is limited to those who are truly eligible.", "Individuals applying for Medicaid coverage for long-term care must meet  certain financial and functional eligibility criteria. To meet the financial  eligibility criteria, individuals must have assets\u2014both income and  resources\u2014that fall below established standards, which vary by state but  are within standards set by the federal government. Not all assets are  counted in determining financial eligibility for Medicaid. For example,  states generally exclude\u2014within specified limits\u2014the value of an  individual\u2019s home, car, and prepaid burial arrangements. Additionally,  federal law includes provisions to discourage individuals from artificially  impoverishing themselves\u2014for example, by transferring their assets to  certain family members\u2014in order to establish financial eligibility.  Specifically, the law states that those who transfer assets for less than fair  market value (FMV) during a specified \u201clook-back\u201d period\u2014a period of  time before application for Medicaid in which an individual\u2019s or couple\u2019s  assets are reviewed\u2014may be deemed ineligible for Medicaid coverage for  long-term care for a period of time, called the penalty period.", "Evidence on the extent to which individuals transfer assets for less than  FMV to become financially eligible for Medicaid coverage for long-term  care is generally limited and often based on anecdote. In September 2005,  we reported that none of the nine states we contacted systematically  tracked or analyzed data that would have provided information on the  incidence of asset transfers made for less than FMV and the extent to  which penalties were applied in their states. We also reported that other  methods of reducing assets to qualify for Medicaid\u2014such as using assets  to reduce debt or make home modifications\u2014did not always result in a  penalty period. You asked us to expand on this work to provide more  information on the extent to which asset transfers for less than FMV  occur.", "Subsequent to your request, in February 2006, the Deficit Reduction Act of  2005 (DRA), which amended certain existing provisions regarding asset  transfers for less than FMV and introduced new requirements related to  financial eligibility for Medicaid coverage for long-term care, was enacted.  For example, the DRA extended the look-back period from 36 months to  60 months for transfers occurring on or after its enactment, changed the  calculation and timing of the penalty period for those transfers, and  introduced new federal requirements regarding certain types of assets,  including an individual\u2019s home.", "Given your request and the passage of the DRA, for this report we   (1) examined the financial characteristics of elderly nursing home  residents nationwide, including the extent to which they transferred cash;  (2) for selected states, reviewed the demographic and financial  characteristics of elderly individuals who applied for Medicaid coverage  for nursing home care and if they applied more than once; (3) determined  the extent to which elderly Medicaid nursing home applicants in selected  states transferred assets for less than FMV and were subject to penalty  periods; and (4) assessed the potential effects of the DRA provisions  related to eligibility for Medicaid coverage for long-term care.", "To examine the financial characteristics of elderly nursing home residents  nationwide, including the extent to which they transferred cash, we  analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal  national panel survey, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and  conducted every 2 years by the University of Michigan. We used HRS data  from 1992 through 2004 to estimate the (1) level of assets (nonhousing  resources and income) held by elderly nursing home residents and (2) the  percentage of residents who transferred cash or the deed to their home  and the amount of the transfer. We further analyzed the above based on  the reported source of payment to the nursing home\u2014Medicaid or non- Medicaid (self-pay, Medicare, or other third-party insurance)\u2014and  assessed nonhousing resources relative to the average cost of a year of  private-pay nursing home care. Because HRS only addressed cash and  home deed transfers made to relatives, our analysis understates the  percentage of residents who transfer and the amount of transfers by  excluding transfers of other types of assets or transfers made to other  individuals. Because HRS did not inquire about the reason for the  transfers, no conclusions can be drawn regarding whether the survey  respondents made these transfers for purposes of establishing eligibility  for Medicaid coverage for nursing home care. To examine the  characteristics of elderly individuals who applied for Medicaid coverage  for nursing home care and the extent to which they transferred assets for  less than FMV, we reviewed 540 randomly selected Medicaid nursing home  application files from three selected counties in 3 selected states (180 files  from each of the selected states). To select states, we assessed the  prevalence of five factors in each of the 50 states and the District of  Columbia; on the basis of this assessment, we ranked the states into three  clusters (low, medium, and high) based on the prevalence of the five  factors and judgmentally selected one state from each cluster. The   3 selected states were South Carolina (low), Maryland (medium), and  Pennsylvania (high). We then judgmentally selected three counties in each  state based on the prevalence of four factors. From the 540 Medicaid  nursing home application files, we collected and analyzed data on the  applicants\u2019 demographic characteristics, income, nonhousing resources,  and home value. We also collected and analyzed data on the number of  applicants who transferred assets for less than FMV and the amount they  transferred. Because of the parameters set in our methodology, the data  from the 540 Medicaid nursing home application files can be generalized to  the county level but cannot be generalized to the state or national level.  To assess the potential effects of the DRA, we relied on data from HRS and  the 540 Medicaid nursing home application files, as well as interviewing  officials from the 3 selected states regarding Medicaid eligibility  determination practices, including the process for identifying whether  applicants had transferred assets. We reviewed applicable federal law  related to Medicaid and asset transfers, as well as related guidance from  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). We also spoke with  researchers and CMS officials. We considered the HRS data as well as data  from the Medicaid application files to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.

As of 2000, 36 states had a medically needy option,  although not all of these states extended this option to the aged and  disabled or to those needing nursing home care.  3.  Individuals can qualify for Medicaid if they reside in nursing facilities  or other institutions in states that have elected to establish a special  income level under which individuals with incomes up to 300 percent  of the SSI benefit ($1,737 per month in 2005) are eligible for Medicaid.  Individuals eligible under this option must apply all of their income,  except for a small personal needs allowance, toward the cost of  nursing home care.

If a transfer of assets for less than FMV is detected, the  individual is ineligible for Medicaid coverage for long-term care for a  period of time, called the penalty period.

(See fig. 10.) At the time these applicants applied for  Medicaid (state fiscal year 2005 or earlier), the three states in which we  reviewed applications did not assess penalties for partial months; that is,  the length of penalties assessed was rounded down to the closest whole  month. As a result, 9 of the 47 approved applicants who transferred  assets for less than FMV (about 19 percent) were not assessed a penalty  because they transferred assets valued at less than the cost of a month of  nursing home coverage for a private-pay patient in their state.  Furthermore, because penalty periods began at approximately the date of  the asset transfer, 36 applicants\u2019 penalty periods expired prior to the  submission of their application for Medicaid coverage for nursing home  care.

Since the trust fund should have only been used for the  applicant\u2019s care, the use of the funds to pay real estate fees, which totaled  $201,516, was considered a transfer of assets for less than FMV. Figure 11  shows the distribution of the amounts of transfers for less than FMV per  approved applicant. Nearly half of the applicants who transferred assets  for less than FMV (22 of 47) transferred $10,000 or less; 10 of the   22 applicants transferred $5,000 or less.

However, the types of assets transferred varied by state (see   table 7). This variation may be related, in part, to differences in counties\u2019  or states\u2019 Medicaid application review procedures. Specifically, based on  our review of the files, county officials in South Carolina conducted  searches of real property tax databases, which likely allowed South  Carolina eligibility workers to identify property transfers that were not  reported by the applicant. For example, a South Carolina applicant was  penalized because the eligibility worker identified that the applicant had  transferred property for less than FMV\u2014a house valued at $84,700 to her  son for $5. In contrast, although Maryland eligibility workers could search  the state\u2019s property tax records, state officials told us that workers\u2019  searching abilities were limited because they needed to know the county  and street name of the property.

All applicants who transfer assets for less  than FMV during the look-back period on or after February 8, 2006 (the  date the DRA was enacted) will experience a delay in eligibility for  Medicaid coverage for long-term care, whereas before that date, some  applicants\u2019 penalty periods expired before they applied for Medicaid  coverage. Second, regarding the calculation of the penalty period, the  DRA prohibits states from \u201crounding down\u201d or disregarding fractional  periods of ineligibility when determining the penalty period. This provision  could result in longer penalty periods for some applicants. (See fig. 13,  which illustrates the potential effects of the DRA penalty period  provisions.)", "If these DRA penalty period provisions had been in effect for the  applicants whose files we reviewed, all 47 approved applicants who  transferred assets for less than FMV would have experienced a delay in  Medicaid coverage, compared with only 2 who actually experienced a  delay.

Officials from the three states in which we  reviewed applications commented that they received few undue hardship  requests prior to the DRA but expected to see an increase in requests as  the DRA provisions are implemented.

This is primarily because few Medicaid  applicants appear to have resources that are specifically addressed by the  DRA, namely annuities, home equity of more than $500,000, or life estates.  Additionally, the provision on allocating income and resources to the  community spouse will only affect married applicants in certain states,  thus limiting the effects that the DRA might have on eligibility.", "Annuities. The DRA added requirements for states regarding the  treatment of annuities. A state must treat the purchase of an annuity as a  transfer for less than FMV unless certain conditions, such as a requirement  that the state be named as a remainder beneficiary, are met. However, the  effect of this provision may be limited because few Medicaid applicants  appear to have annuities. We found that 3 percent of the approved  applicants (14 of 465) whose application files we reviewed owned an  annuity. These 14 applicants\u2019 annuities would have been considered  transfers for less than FMV under the DRA because they did not name the  state as a remainder beneficiary, had a balloon payment, or both. While the  incidence of annuities among Medicaid beneficiaries is not nationally  known, a January 2005 study undertaken at the request of CMS estimated  that, among the five states examined, the percentage of Medicaid long- term care beneficiaries who had an annuity ranged from less than   1 percent in two states to more than 3 percent in one state.", "Home Equity. Under the DRA, certain individuals with home equity  greater than $500,000 are not eligible for Medicaid payment for long-term  care, including nursing home care. The effect of this provision may be  limited because it appears that few individuals who apply for Medicaid  coverage for nursing home care have homes valued at more than $500,000.  For example, 23 percent of the 465 approved Medicaid nursing home  applicants whose files we reviewed owned homes. Of the homes for which  we could determine values, the median value was $57,600. Only one  approved applicant owned a home valued at more than $500,000. Although  we do not know this applicant\u2019s equity interest in the home, the applicant  would not have been subject to the DRA home equity provision, since the  applicant\u2019s spouse lived in the home. Additionally, our review of 2004 HRS  data indicated that no elderly nursing home residents owned a home  valued at more than $500,000.", "Life Estates. The DRA requires states to treat the purchase of certain life  estates as a transfer of assets for less than FMV unless the purchaser (the  applicant) lived in the house for at least 1 year after the date of purchase.  The effect of this provision may be limited because we found that few  approved Medicaid nursing home applicants whose files we reviewed had  life estates. Specifically, the proportion of approved applicants who owned  life estates ranged from zero in Pennsylvania to 2 percent in South  Carolina.", "Income First. The DRA\u2019s income-first provision has the potential to affect  married applicants in states that did not already use the income-first  methodology. Under the income-first methodology the difference between  a community spouse\u2019s income and his or her minimum needs allowance is  made up by transferring income from the institutionalized spouse.  According to CMS, approximately half of all states did not use the income- first methodology before the passage of the DRA. Of the three states we  reviewed, only Pennsylvania will be affected by this provision. Among  approved applicants in Pennsylvania, 6 of the 42 married applicants whose  files we reviewed would have been affected by this change because these  applicants had retained resources in excess of the standards to create  income streams for their community spouses. Specifically, they created  annuities for the community spouses with values ranging from $7,372 to  $77,531, with a median value of $39,912. Pennsylvania officials told us that  almost all institutionalized spouses in their state have enough income to  supplement the income needs of their community spouses. As a result,  under the DRA, applicants would not be allowed to retain resources in  excess of the standards as they had previously through the creation of  annuities.

HRS includes individuals who were not institutionalized at the  time of the initial interview and tracks these individuals over time,  regardless of whether they enter an institution. Researchers conducted the  initial interviews in 1992 in respondents\u2019 homes and follow-up interviews  over the telephone every second year thereafter.

From these  data, we estimated the financial characteristics of elderly nursing home  residents as well as the percentage of residents who transferred cash or  deeds to their homes, the amount transferred, and whether it varied by  how they paid for their care (i.e., Medicaid-covered or non-Medicaid- covered). This analysis underestimates the percentage of elderly  households that transferred assets and the amount of assets transferred  because HRS data included only transfers of cash and deeds to the home.  Additionally, HRS does not assess whether the transfers relate to  individuals\u2019 attempts to qualify for Medicaid coverage for nursing home  services.", "In order to assess the reliability of the HRS data, we reviewed related  documentation regarding the survey and its methods of administration.

Number of individuals aged 65 and over who applied for, or were  enrolled in, Medicaid coverage for nursing home services.  2.  Number of licensed nursing home beds.  3.  Population aged 65 and over.  4.  Median and range of household income.", "For the first three factors, we ranked the counties within each selected  state from high to low.

For example, an individual may have applied in state fiscal year  2004, but had his or her application approved in state fiscal year 2005.  From the lists provided by the states, we randomly selected application  files by unique identifying numbers. In order to compensate for application  files that would need to be skipped because they did not meet our criteria  or lacked adequate information, we requested additional files (10 to   15 percent) in each county.
