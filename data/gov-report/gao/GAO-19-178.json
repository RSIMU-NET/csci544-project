GAO found that the Secret Service does not have a policy for ensuring that the semiannual reports are prepared and has not consistently submitted the reports. Secret Service officials last submitted reports in fiscal year 2015 and were unaware that reports had not been submitted in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 until GAO requested this information. GAO also found that the Department of Defense (DOD) has a policy but did not produce and submit the reports as required. Moreover, weaknesses in DOD's existing policy and instruction do not clearly establish the responsibility for preparing and reporting the costs incurred to support protection activities.

This would include  defining objectives in specific terms so they are understood at all levels  and can be carried out without regard to personnel changes. This further  involves clearly defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how  it will be achieved, and the time frames for realizing the achievement.  Establishing a policy defining requirements for producing the semiannual  reports to Congress\u2014including what is to be reported, the entity  responsible for preparing and submitting the reports, and reporting time  frames\u2014and an oversight mechanism to ensure that the reports are  prepared and submitted to Congress, may better position the Secret  Service to consistently report required expenditure data to specified  congressional committees as required.", "DOD: DOD has issued a policy related to collecting information on its  support for the Secret Service\u2019s protective duties but has not produced  and submitted the required reports to Congress in accordance with its  policy. DOD officials were unaware that the reports had not been submitted until we requested them. According to DOD officials, the  reports were not submitted as a result of an administrative oversight, and  they could not determine when the reports had last been submitted.", "This situation is in part the result of weaknesses in DOD\u2019s existing policy  and implementing instruction with regard to specific information that could  help ensure the reports are consistently produced and provided to  Congress. For example, the policy requires that any DOD organization  incurring costs associated with support provided to the Secret Service  collect and report the costs to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Homeland Defense and Global Security, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, and the Chief Financial Officer. However, neither the policy nor  underlying instruction sets forth time frames for internal or external  reporting to ensure that the semiannual dates are met. Further, DOD has  no mechanism for ensuring that the required information is submitted to  Congress.", "As previously noted, internal control standards require that management  should implement control activities through policies and define objectives  clearly to enable the identification of risks and define risk tolerances. This  involves clearly defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how  it will be achieved, and the time frames for realizing the achievement.  Moreover, the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that  enforce management\u2019s directives to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives are to  be defined.", "According to a DOD official, in March 2018 the department began efforts  to gather the information necessary to prepare the required report.  However, collecting the information has been challenging, largely due to  the multiple data sources and inconsistent methods for capturing the data  to date. Therefore, according to DOD officials, once the department  completes its initial data collection effort, officials plan to assess the  adequacy of the data and review DOD\u2019s existing guidance to identify  revisions needed to ensure that future reports are submitted in  accordance with Presidential Protection Assistance Act. However, the  agency has not yet defined the steps necessary to fulfill near-term  reporting requirements under the Act, or time frames for doing so. By  addressing these issues, DOD could be better positioned to comply with  the law.", "Further, while DOD officials anticipate updating the policy and instruction  at a future date, steps and time frames for completing the update have  not yet been defined, and it is unclear when or whether the updates will  occur. Updating DOD\u2019s policy and instruction to specify the requirements  and establish an oversight mechanism may better position DOD to report  expenditure data to Congress, as required, on a semiannual basis and  enhance visibility over the costs associated with providing protective  services, in particular in relation to protection at nongovernmental  properties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Secret Service, with help from the Coast Guard and DOD, plays a  vital role in protecting the President during his travels. The Presidential  Protection Assistance Act was intended to establish procedures to control  the expenditure of federal funds for protection at nongovernmental  properties; it requires that each of these entities report expenditures  under the Act. The Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and DOD have all  incurred costs related to protection for the President and others.  However, information on such costs is limited, because only the Coast  Guard has been reporting them. As a result, Congress lacks information  about the amounts that DOD and the Secret Service have expended for  providing protection\u2014including providing protection at nongovernmental  properties. This limits congressional efforts to ensure accountability for  these costs. The Secret Service does not have a policy in place that  defines and enforces reporting requirements, and DOD\u2019s policy and  underlying instruction lack important details such as time frames for  reporting expenditures and a mechanism for ensuring that the required  information is submitted to Congress. DOD has initiated steps to develop  required reports but has not identified the specific steps it will take and  the time frames within which these efforts will be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making one recommendation to the Director of the Secret Service  and two to the Secretary of Defense.", "The Director of the Secret Service should establish a policy defining  requirements for producing the semiannual reports of expenditures  required by the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976, as  amended, and an oversight mechanism to ensure that the Secret Service  consistently submits these reports to specified congressional committees.
