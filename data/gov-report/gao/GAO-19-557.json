GAO identified at least 58 billing codes in Medicare's physician fee schedule that could be used by providers to bill for services that cover some or all of the LCCP service components as defined in the 2018 BBA \u2014referred to by GAO as LCCP-type services. The 58 billing codes may be used individually or in combination, depending on a beneficiary's medical needs. Stakeholders representing providers told GAO their members generally use one or a combination of these codes to bill for LCCP-type services.", "Forty-five of the 58 codes are broadly-defined longstanding codes that can be used for LCCP-type services as well as other services such as the treatment of a specific medical complaint.", "The remaining 13 codes are more recent narrowly-defined codes introduced starting in 2013 that only cover LCCP-type services. They include transitional care management services introduced in 2013, chronic care management starting in 2015, advance care planning in 2016, and behavioral health integration in 2017.", "GAO found that overall Medicare spending on LCCP-type services that were billed to the 58 codes increased from $26 billion in 2013 to almost $29 billion in 2017. While narrowly-defined services accounted for a small share of this total spending ($467 million in 2017), spending on these narrowly-defined services such as chronic care management increased rapidly. Moreover, spending growth on narrowly-defined services was driven by increased use of these services rather than increases in reimbursement rates. From 2013 through 2017, more beneficiaries received and more providers billed for narrowly-defined services. The number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving these services grew from about 267,000 to about 2.5 million. The number of providers billing these services grew from about 31,000 to about 100,000."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over two-thirds of the 39 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare\u2019s  traditional fee-for-service program in 2017 had two or more serious health  conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. The often complex nature  of these types of conditions and the treatments for them generally  necessitate care planning and coordination among providers in different  medical specialties. For example, a beneficiary with diabetes and heart  disease may be simultaneously under the care of a primary care  physician, an endocrinologist, a cardiologist, and a podiatrist, highlighting  the need for planning and coordination of care to ensure that services are  not being duplicated and that all providers involved in the patient\u2019s care  share important clinical information and have clear expectations about  their roles in the patient\u2019s care.", "Providers have historically billed Medicare for care planning and  coordination services using one or more of the over 8,000 billing codes in  the program\u2019s physician fee schedule. The specific code or codes a  provider uses depends on the time, skill, and complexity of the medical  decision-making required for each patient\u2019s unique needs. In particular,  evaluation and management (E/M) billing codes\u2014codes used to bill for  face-to-face patient visits that are provided in various settings such as  physicians\u2019 offices or hospitals\u2014are widely used by all physicians  regardless of their specialty, accounting for over half of the $69.1 billion  spent on all physician fee schedule services in 2017. However, certain  physician specialties (largely those specializing in primary care) have  raised longstanding concerns that E/M codes do not adequately account  for the amount of time they spend in planning and coordinating care for  beneficiaries with complex medical needs.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (2018 BBA) defines longitudinal  comprehensive care planning (LCCP) as a service that includes the  following five components: a conversation with a beneficiary diagnosed with a serious or life- shared decision-making through an interdisciplinary team that  includes a physician, registered nurse, and social worker; development of a longitudinal comprehensive care plan (care plan)  that is discussed with the beneficiary that addresses the progression  of the disease and treatment options; a care plan that addresses the beneficiary\u2019s goals, values, and a care plan that discusses the availability of other resources or social  supports that may help mitigate the beneficiary\u2019s health risks.", "The 2018 BBA included a provision that we examine Medicare Physician  Fee Schedule billing codes established by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program\u2014that  may be used for care planning services provided to beneficiaries  diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness or illnesses.

Specifically, we identified billing codes  included in one of the six main categories of codes under Medicare\u2019s  2018 physician fee schedule that would most likely cover some or all of  the LCCP service components as defined in the 2018 BBA. To identify  these codes, we reviewed the code descriptors, claims processing  manuals, and other documents from the Medicare Learning Network on  CMS\u2019s website. We also reviewed CMS\u2019s proposed and final Medicare  Physician Fee Schedule rules from 2012 to 2019 to understand the  agency\u2019s rationale for establishing these codes. Based on our review of  these materials, we developed a preliminary list of billing codes that could  be used to bill for LCCP-type services. As part of our analysis, we  identified the extent to which these codes include the five key  components of the LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA. To do this,  we reviewed information from the AMA\u2019s RBRVS DataManager, a  database that includes detailed \u2018vignettes\u2019 describing the components of  services provided to a typical patient under each billing code. We also  reviewed estimates of physician and non-physician time used to provide  these services to a typical patient, using publically available time files  from the CMS website. (See app. I for a sample vignette and app. II for  our alignment of the five key LCCP components with equivalent  components in our list of selected billing codes.) We finalized our  preliminary list of billing codes based on our review of this information as  well as input from CMS and 19 stakeholders, including the AMA,  physician specialty societies, and other provider groups. To identify these  stakeholders, we reviewed a list of over 300 organizations that had  participated in a Chronic Care Working Group organized by the Senate  Committee on Finance in 2015. We narrowed the list to national umbrella  organizations representing a mix of physician and non-physician groups  (such as the American College of Physicians and the National  Association of Social Workers) that had specifically commented on the  need for a new billing code.

We  examined trends in spending and utilization on these services, including  the number of beneficiaries receiving these services and the number of  providers billing for these services. We report spending and utilization  trends in the aggregate as well as by provider specialty (for example,  internal medicine or family practice), and by setting (for example, facility  settings such as hospitals and hospices, and nonfacility settings such as  physicians\u2019 offices). We assessed the reliability of the Medicare claims  data in several ways, including reviewing relevant CMS data  documentation, performing manual and electronic tests of the data to  identify any outliers or anomalies, and comparing it with data from  published sources.

Physicians and  other providers bill Medicare for their services using various five-digit  billing codes based in part on codes developed by an AMA panel. Each  year, the panel receives proposals from provider groups and others to  revise existing billing codes or create new codes. The panel requires  those who submit proposals to develop a clinical vignette that describes  the typical patient who would receive the service, the diagnosis and  relevant conditions, and estimates of time that physicians might spend in  providing the service for the typical patient. The panel applies several  criteria in reviewing these proposals. For example, a new code  should represent a unique, well-defined procedure or service clearly  identified and distinguished from existing procedures and services;  should not fragment an existing procedure or service represented by  one or more existing codes;  should reflect the typical (not extraordinary) circumstances related to  the delivery of the service;  should be performed by many physicians or other qualified health  care professionals across the United States; and  should be consistent with current medical practice.", "CMS pays providers a fixed amount known as the Medicare fee for each  code.

In setting fees, CMS also does not allow  certain codes to be billed together if it deems that payment for one code  is already included in another. CMS establishes and updates relative  values annually. By law, the effect of any changes to its payment rates  generally must be budget neutral. That is, if total spending increases by  more than $20 million each year, including due to the creation of new  billing codes, fees for all services would have to be reduced accordingly.", "Services billed under the physician fee schedule may be provided in a  variety of settings, including physicians\u2019 offices and institutional settings  such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and hospices.

For example, some types of non-physicians practicing  independently\u2014such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u2014 may bill Medicare for certain services that they are legally authorized to  perform under their respective state laws. In other instances, physicians  may bill as if they had furnished services that were provided by non- physician staff that they employ or with whom they have a contractual  relationship as long as the physician has an established relationship with  the beneficiary, and is on the premises to provide supervision if  necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Care Planning Services in Medicare", "paragraphs": ["Providers and other stakeholders have noted that they care for an elderly  population with increasingly complex medical conditions who receive care  from multiple providers across different sites of care including physicians\u2019  offices, hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices.

CMS also noted that a new  trend in care planning is the use of shared care plans between the  beneficiary and the provider rather than those created solely by the  provider.

Some primary care physicians have  requested that CMS conduct a comprehensive review of existing E/M  codes to ensure they account for time spent on these services, or develop  new codes that primary care physicians may exclusively use to bill for  these services.

For example, three stakeholders  noted potential overlap with existing billing codes, such as the ACP  and CCM.

Specifically, two stakeholders  stated that having multiple billing codes for care planning and care  management, respectively, would have the potential to increase  spending because multiple providers could start billing the new codes  even though one provider may have primary responsibility for the  beneficiary.

According to the stakeholders, a new LCCP code as  defined in the 2018 BBA could address several concerns they identified in  Medicare\u2019s existing billing codes related to the provision of the LCCP  service. However, some of these concerns could be addressed under the  current Medicare billing framework, as shown by our analysis of available  data. For example, stakeholders identified the following limitations that  could be addressed by a new LCCP code:  Inadequate reimbursement for time spent on interdisciplinary care:  The 13 stakeholders stated that Medicare\u2019s existing billing codes  either did not require or did not sufficiently reimburse them for the time  spent on interdisciplinary care. They stated there should be a  separate code to reimburse this type of care. However, stakeholders  representing two specialties told us they had proposed such a code to  the AMA but the AMA had rejected their proposals because  interdisciplinary care is already accounted for in the existing billing  codes. Moreover, as our analysis of the 58 billing codes shows, the  majority of these codes include a provision for consultation and  coordination among providers that is equivalent to input from an  interdisciplinary team. With regard to inadequate reimbursement, as  another stakeholder noted, providers may bill a complex E/M service  along with a narrowly-defined LCCP-type service such as CCM. The  total reimbursement for such a combination of codes would be about  $203 as of 2019. (See table 2.)", "Insufficient physician time for care planning: Six stakeholders  representing a mix of primary care and medical specialties stated the  existing billing codes (including the more complex E/M codes) had  insufficient physician time to provide both care planning and care  management, which they maintained are separate and distinct  activities. They stated a new code could include the appropriate time  needed. One stakeholder said that care planning requires at least 30  minutes of time, and the complex E/M codes do not allow providers to  bill for the time it takes to provide both the care management of a  complex patient as well as care planning for the patient. According to  the stakeholder, for example, if a provider bills a complex E/M code  that allows for 40 minutes of physician time, that is insufficient to  provide both types of services. While CMS has recently established  new prolonged E/M codes (which allow for an additional 60 minutes of  time), the stakeholder noted that they do not address the problem of  insufficient time because a prolonged E/M code may only be billed  with a companion E/M code, and the threshold of time needed to bill  the two codes together is now too high\u2014specifically 40 minutes for  the complex E/M code plus 60 minutes for the prolonged E/M code.  However, our review of CMS guidance on billing of prolonged E/M  codes shows that providers do not have to meet the full 60 minutes of  time in order to bill a prolonged E/M code; they may bill it as long as  the total time spent on the visit exceeds the typical time for the E/M  visit plus 30 minutes.", "Documentation requirements: Three stakeholders, largely  representing primary care and medical specialties, stated that  burdensome documentation requirements for the more complex E/M  codes hampered their ability to bill these codes. They suggested  that a new billing code could be structured similar to the new ACP or  CCM codes which do not have the same documentation  requirements. While these stakeholders expressed concern regarding  documentation as a discouraging factor, our analysis of 2017  Medicare claims data showed that certain specialties, including some  that had expressed this concern, billed the more complex codes at a  significantly higher rate than the average across all specialties. This  may indicate that these documentation requirements do not  necessarily preclude providers from billing these codes. For example,  83 percent of all the E/M new patient visits billed by geriatricians in  2017 were billed using the more complex E/M codes, compared to 48  percent on average. Similarly, 80 percent of all the E/M established  patient visits billed by clinical psychologists in 2017 were billed using  the more complex E/M codes compared to 50 percent on average.  See appendix V for details on billing patterns for all medical  specialties.", "Inability of non-physician staff to independently bill for care planning:  Seven stakeholders expressed concerns that non-physician staff such  as nurses and social workers cannot independently bill the existing  Medicare billing codes that we identified as being LCCP-type  services. As one stakeholder explained, non-physician staff may  spend time providing coordination and care planning services  separately rather than concurrently with the physician, but they cannot  bill for this time independently because the physician was not present.  These stakeholders stated that a new LCCP code that could be billed  by physicians and non-physicians that participated in the care  planning process could address this issue. However, other  stakeholders expressed concerns about the effect on Medicare  spending if multiple providers billed for an LCCP service. Moreover,  reimbursement for non-physicians is built into Medicare fees.  Specifically, Medicare\u2019s fee for each billing code includes  reimbursement for physician\u2019s time as well as their practice expenses  (which cover the costs of non-physician staff), and when the AMA  panel develops resources estimates for each billing code (upon which  Medicare fees are based), it considers the amount of non-physician  time spent on that code. Certain non-physician practitioners, such as  nurse practitioners and physician assistants, may also independently  bill services under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule subject to  certain requirements, and as specified in their scope of practice under  state law.", "Stakeholders generally concurred that if a new LCCP code were  implemented, the definition of interdisciplinary care should be flexible and  not require a social worker. Currently, the LCCP billing code as defined in  the 2018 BBA requires that the interdisciplinary team providing care  planning services include a social worker. However, 13 stakeholders  stated that a typical practice did not include a social worker, but rather  included a nurse who might perform the functions of a social worker. They  stated that smaller office-based medical practices could not afford to hire  a social worker. The stakeholders concurred that social workers were  generally available in larger integrated practices (such as a single or  multiple groups aligning with each other or with a larger hospital system)  and in facility settings such as hospitals or skilled nursing facilities.  (Stakeholders also provided other comments on the structure of a  potential new billing code for the LCCP service should such a code be  established by CMS, which we summarize in app. VI.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.

Stakeholders were generally in  agreement that a new billing code for LCCP-type services as defined in  the 2018 BBA, if implemented, should be broadly defined. Specifically,  stakeholders stated that it should not be tied to a specific condition,  should allow for both in-person and non-face-to-face services performed  when the beneficiary was not present, should be billable more than once,  should be available for billing by both primary care physicians and  specialists, and should have restrictions to avoid duplicative billing with  existing billing that provided overlapping services. However,  stakeholders had more mixed views about what these specific restrictions  should be. Stakeholder views about the various structural components or  restrictions included the following:", "Applicable medical conditions: The majority of stakeholders (13 of the  17 who responded to this question) stated that the new code should  be broadly defined although they differed in their opinions of what  broadly-defined meant; one stakeholder cautioned against an overly  broad definition, and one suggested pilot testing with a discrete list of  conditions.", "Of the 13 stakeholders in favor of a broad definition, 12 stated that  the new billing code should not be tied to any particular specific  illness or medical condition but should be flexible in structure.  Three stakeholders stated that the extent of beneficiaries\u2019 daily  functioning or quality of life should also be considered when  defining applicable medical conditions. For example, a beneficiary  who is not necessarily suffering from a life-threatening illness but  is unable to perform the functions of daily living (such as bathing  and eating) needs extensive care planning and should therefore  be covered under the new LCCP-type service. Three stakeholders  stated that the new code should be billable if a beneficiary\u2019s  existing diagnosis of a serious illness changed. Three  stakeholders stated that a potential new code could be modeled  along the lines of existing billing codes\u2014specifically the advance  care planning (ACP) or chronic care management (CCM) codes\u2014 which do not specify any particular medical condition.", "Two stakeholders said that a new code should not be so broad  that it could apply to a vast majority of beneficiaries. For example,  one stakeholder stated that the American Medical Association  would likely not approve a code for a generic serious condition  because it would be difficult to differentiate that code from an  existing billing code, such as an evaluation and management  (E/M) code, which may be used for any medical condition  including serious, life-threatening conditions.", "One stakeholder suggested pilot testing the code with a discrete  list of conditions, with the intention of expanding the list  afterwards.", "In-person or non-face-to-face: The majority of stakeholders (12 of the  15 that responded to this question) stated that a potential new code  should allow for both in-person and non-face-to-face activities (such  as virtual or telehealth\u2014providing clinical care remotely by two-way  video, phone calls with the beneficiary or to arrange referrals or  coordinate care with other providers when the beneficiary was not  present); three said it should only include face-to-face activities.", "Twelve stakeholders stated that the visit should include both types  of activities. For example, one stakeholder said the initial visit for  LCCP-type services should be in-person, and follow up activities  such as updating a care plan or remote patient monitoring  (monitoring of patients outside of conventional settings) could be  non-face-to-face.", "Three stakeholders said it should only include face-to-face  activities either because of concerns about the potential for  overbilling if the new code included non-face-to-face activities  which might be difficult to verify or because other existing codes,  such as CCM, already cover non-face-to-face activities.", "Frequency of billing: All of the 16 stakeholders responding to this  question concurred that the new code should be billable more  frequently than on a one-time basis, although opinions varied on the  exact frequency.", "Nine stakeholders said the code should be billable on an ongoing  basis as the beneficiary\u2019s condition changes. For example, one  said that the new code should be on-going because the care  planning and treatment would continue to evolve over time as the  beneficiary\u2019s condition changes.", "Seven other stakeholders said that while it should not be an  ongoing service, it should be billable more frequently than once.  For example, one stakeholder specified that it could be billed once  per month or over every three months, but that a target end date  must be specified; otherwise, it would be too similar to existing  billing codes such as the CCM code that may be billed monthly.  Two other stakeholders said it could be billed up to 4-5 times a  year.", "Other billing restrictions: All 12 stakeholders responding to this  question indicated that restrictions would be necessary to avoid  overlap with existing billing codes. For example, three stakeholders  suggested that the new code could be billed along with an E/M code  for additional services not covered by the E/M code as long as it does  not overlap with other existing codes that account for additional time  beyond an E/M visit (such as the prolonged E/M visit billing codes).  One suggested that it should not be billed along with any of the  existing narrowly-defined LCCP-type codes, including CCM,  transitional care management, or the ACP codes. One did not specify  any particular code with which the new code should not be billed, but  cautioned that care should be taken to ensure that time spent with the  beneficiary was reported only once.", "Providers eligible to bill the code: The majority of stakeholders (13 of  the 15 that responded to this question) stated that both primary care  physicians and specialists should be eligible to bill the new code. Two  of these stakeholders said that there should also be a requirement  that the billing physician has an established relationship with the  beneficiary. Two stakeholders said that only specialists should bill  since they are generally the ones attending to the beneficiary\u2019s  serious illness. Two stakeholders stated that non-physicians  (including social workers) should also be able to bill the code as long  as they are currently allowed to bill separately under the Medicare  Physician Fee Schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Karen Doran, Assistant Director;  Iola D\u2019Souza, Analyst-in-Charge; Sarah Belford; Krister Friday; John  Lalomio; and Daniel Ries made key contributions to this report.
