However, the Laboratory's program to review examiner testimonies to ensure they are accurate and within the scientific limits of the given forensic discipline is limited by difficulties in acquiring testimony transcripts. Specifically, the Laboratory did not acquire transcripts and conduct internal evaluations for nearly half of the testimonies (78 of 164) given by Chemistry and Trace Evidence Unit examiners from 2011 through 2015, citing difficulties in locating transcripts and lack of response from courts. To better understand these factors, GAO sought and obtained almost half of the 78 transcripts (36 of 78). While attempting to obtain the remainder, GAO confirmed some of the difficulties identified by the FBI. Consistent with internal control standards, the FBI Laboratory could better ensure it obtains more transcripts for review by routinely capturing and using additional information that is critical to transcript acquisition, such as court jurisdiction and points of contact. Obtaining additional transcripts could help the FBI Laboratory expand its monitoring of examiner testimonies to help ensure the testimonies are accurate and within scientific limits, as defined by FBI and accreditation standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the FBI Laboratory's transcript acquisition procedure routinely capture and use additional information critical to transcript acquisition.

To help ensure competency  prior to assuming casework responsibilities, the Laboratory\u2019s training  approach employs unit-specific training. For example, the Chemistry and  Trace Evidence Units have each developed unit-specific training  programs and manuals to train staff on their specific disciplines and  positions. While training and testing requirements are specific to the  discipline(s) and role the employee is to perform, every employee must  pass competency tests and oral board examinations. In addition, forensic  examiners, who provide testimony in court proceedings, must also  complete moot court and admissibility hearing exercises, such as a  Daubert hearing. Successful completion of all training requirements is to be documented in a \u201cqualification and authorization\u201d memorandum  prepared by the unit chief or designee. Table 2 provides additional  information on the initial training and qualification requirements for  examiners and technicians in the Chemistry and Trace Evidence Units.", "After completing the initial training program, caseworking employees must  complete continued education and proficiency test requirements each  year. For example, Chemistry and Trace Evidence Unit employees must  complete a minimum of 15 hours of continued education related to job  requirements or job performance each year. Chemistry Unit policy states  that the continued education should focus on maintaining technical skills  and expertise. In addition, each examiner and technician must complete  an annual proficiency test in each category of testing that he or she  performs. According to accreditation and FBI requirements, the  Laboratory must use proficiency tests developed by an external test  provider where available. On the basis of ASCLD/LAB assessments, all  FBI Laboratory staff conducting casework or providing testimony in  disciplines in which the Chemistry and Trace Evidence Units are  accredited had successfully met annual proficiency testing requirements  in their respective discipline(s) from 2011 to 2015 as required by  accreditation standards.", "Additionally, we observed that for the forensic anthropology discipline,  wherein ASCLD/LAB does not provide accreditation, the two Trace  Evidence Unit examiners who conducted casework in forensic  anthropology completed annual proficiency testing in forensic  anthropology from 2011 to 2015. Furthermore, the FBI Laboratory  requires that all staff conducting casework in forensic anthropology obtain  certification by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology. According  to the Board, these two examiners were board-certified in 2012 and 2013,  respectively, and have maintained certification.", "The combination of training, continued education, and annual proficiency  testing are intended to help provide reasonable assurance that the FBI  Laboratory\u2019s caseworking staff are appropriately trained and qualified. We  reviewed the initial training records for the 47 employees who conducted  casework in the Chemistry and Trace Evidence Units or provided court  testimony related to chemical or trace evidence from fiscal year 2011 to  July 2016 and found that the records were generally complete and met  FBI requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI Laboratory Has Processes to Review Laboratory Reports and Testimony, but Could Review More Examiner Testimonies", "paragraphs": ["The FBI Laboratory implemented a monitoring program to help ensure  that the results of its forensic examinations and any related examiner  testimony are presented consistently with what is known about each  forensic method. However, the testimony monitoring program is limited by  difficulties in acquiring testimony transcripts.", "FBI Approved Standards for Scientific  Testimony and Report Language  These standards document examples of the  statements the FBI Laboratory has  determined to be scientifically-supported and  approved for its examiners to use when  reporting examination conclusions and expert  opinion in laboratory reports and court  testimony for certain methods. practices, and unit procedures. Our review of the 166 laboratory reports  produced by the Chemistry and Trace Evidence Units and used as the  basis of testimonies from fiscal years 2011 through 2015 found that all  had been technically and administratively reviewed in accordance with  FBI requirements.", "For example, according to the standards, FBI  fiber examiners may state or imply that a  textile fiber is natural or manufactured (man- made) and its type (e.g., cotton, wool,  polyester). However, the examiner may not  state or imply that a fiber came from a  particular source to the exclusion of all others.  The examiner also may not state or imply a  statistical weight or probability to a conclusion  or provide a likelihood that the questioned  fiber originated from a particular source. The  FBI Laboratory began developing and  implementing these standards in 2014.", "The court testimony monitoring program, in contrast, includes both  internal and external reviews. Specifically, the court testimony monitoring  program\u2019s two key monitoring and oversight components include the  following: (1) obtaining and reviewing transcripts of examiner testimonies  to determine their compliance with FBI standards, referred to as internal  evaluations; and (2) obtaining feedback on the quality of examiners\u2019  testimonies directly from court officials, referred to as external  evaluations. The FBI\u2019s internal evaluation required that the reviewer\u2014 an appropriate manager and, when necessary, with assistance from a  subject matter expert in the same area as the individual testifying\u2014 assess the examiner\u2019s testimony against seven technical criteria. These  include whether the examiner (1) testified accurately; (2) testified within  the scope of his or her expertise; and (3) declined to answer questions  beyond his or her expertise or beyond scientific limitations for the  discipline, among other things. External evaluations, on the other hand,  rely on the feedback of court officials who are not scientific or technical  experts and who are asked to evaluate factors such as an examiner\u2019s  appearance, demeanor, promptness, ability to maintain composure as an  expert witness, and ability to communicate results. See appendix I for  further details about the FBI Laboratory\u2019s practices for internal and  external evaluation of testimony.", "From fiscal years 2011 through 2015, a total of 22 forensic examiners in  the FBI Laboratory\u2019s Chemistry and Trace Evidence Units produced a  total of 164 testimonies. However, the FBI Laboratory did not acquire  transcripts and conduct internal evaluations for nearly half of these  testimonies (78 of 164). As such, the 78 testimonies were not reviewed  by a subject matter expert or against technical discipline-specific criteria,  as provided for by internal evaluations.", "The FBI obtained transcripts for 86 of the 164 testimonies and conducted  an internal evaluation of the 86 transcripts. Additionally, of the 164  testimonies, the FBI obtained an external evaluation of the examiner\u2019s  performance for 99 testimonies. All of the internal evaluations of  examiner testimonies that we reviewed received satisfactory  assessments from an FBI manager. Also, in conformance with  accreditation and FBI requirements and on the basis of our review of  ASCLD/LAB reports, the FBI Laboratory met the accreditation  requirement for testimony monitoring during this period.", "While the FBI Laboratory\u2019s testimony monitoring program meets current  accreditation requirements, it could be improved by enhancing its  testimony acquisition approach to allow it to conduct additional internal  evaluations. Subjecting testimonies to an internal evaluation provides the  strongest basis for understanding the extent to which examiners are  adhering to FBI technical and reporting standards while also ensuring that  examiner testimony is factually accurate. Furthermore, in March 2017, the  merged accrediting body issued updated testimony monitoring  requirements requiring that examiner testimony in each discipline be  reviewed by an individual that has been competency tested in the task(s)  that the review is encompassing. To meet the revised requirement, the  FBI Laboratory will need to conduct an internal evaluation of examiner  testimony. In other words, external evaluations by court officials, alone,  will no longer satisfy the requirement for accreditation.", "In explaining why the 78 testimony transcripts were not acquired, FBI  Laboratory officials told us that because they could not compel courts to  provide them with responses or transcripts, they have no way of knowing  exactly why courts or court reporters did not provide specific transcripts.  Anecdotally, they provided us with the following challenges and limitations  they often encounter in their efforts to obtain transcripts:", "There is no clear point of contact, or there is lack of responsiveness  from points of contact, such as prosecutors or court reporters;", "There is a lack of uniform computer and business systems across the  separate federal, state and local courts in which they testify;", "Some courts store their transcripts manually and lack electronic  databases, making it difficult to locate and acquire transcripts;  In some cases, transcripts may not be accessible because they have  been sealed or may not have been generated.", "While FBI cannot compel courts to provide transcripts in all instances,  there are opportunities for the FBI to improve its ability to obtain more  transcripts. To better understand the factors cited by the FBI Laboratory,  we sought to obtain the remaining 78 transcripts directly from the courts.  During this effort, we obtained 36 of the 78 transcripts (46 percent) that  the FBI Laboratory did not obtain. Of the 36, we obtained:", "16 transcripts by searching the Public Access to Court Electronic  Records (PACER), an electronic public access service that allows  users to obtain case information from federal appellate, district, and  bankruptcy courts. This did not require personal contact with any court  officials involved with the case;", "9 transcripts by directly contacting and coordinating with the court or", "11 transcripts through third-party transcription services or by directly  visiting the court.", "We were unable to obtain the remaining 42 of 78 transcripts for various  reasons. In several cases, the information provided by the FBI was  incomplete or additional information would be needed to locate the case  and associated transcript. However, while attempting to obtain the  outstanding transcripts, we also confirmed some of the reasons the FBI  identified for not acquiring transcripts. For example, after identifying the  court reporter, sometimes the reporter did not respond to our request(s)  or provide us with the documentation necessary to request the transcript.  Further, some testimonies could not be released because the cases were  sealed. Lastly, some testimonies were not transcribed at the time of our  review.", "To develop better controls in its testimony monitoring program activities,  in May 2013, the FBI Laboratory implemented a Testimony Tracker  System (Tracker) to capture and monitor information on internal and  external evaluation of examiner testimony and to help ensure that  transcripts are requested, obtained, and reviewed. As of May 2013, FBI  policy requires that appropriate data regarding the monitoring and  evaluation of examiner testimonies\u2014including when a testimony  occurred, whether a transcript was requested, whether follow-up  occurred, and when a transcript was received and reviewed, among other  things\u2014be recorded in the Tracker system. In addition, in December  2016, the FBI updated its policy to require that a unit chief or designee  check the Testimony Tracker System monthly to ensure testifying  individuals are entering required information. However, we found that  the Tracker is not currently set up to routinely capture certain additional  information that could help examiners conduct more effective follow up.  For example, the Tracker does not capture the specific reason that a  transcript has not been acquired. If a court reporter indicates to an  examiner that a transcript will not be available for 1 year, being able to  note the reason and the availability date or timeframe in the Tracker  would better enable the examiner to follow up at the specified time. Or, if  a specific transcript will not be available until after the case is completed,  configuring the Tracker or revising the testimony monitoring policy to  require examiners to record this information would better enable them to  follow up on the transcript at a future date. Other information that could be helpful in obtaining a transcript includes the court\u2019s jurisdiction, address,  and a point of contact for the transcript. FBI officials confirmed that the  Tracker is not currently configured to routinely record this type of  information but did acknowledge that some information would be useful. A  senior FBI Laboratory official also stated that recording more information,  such as point of contact information, could help the FBI obtain more  transcripts.", "Obtaining transcripts and subjecting them to an internal evaluation is a  key control in FBI\u2019s efforts to ensure the quality of examiner testimonies.  To facilitate this, each time an examiner testifies, FBI policy requires the  examiner to request a transcript of the testimony from the respective court  official so that it may be reviewed by an appropriate FBI manager or other  subject matter expert. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government calls for, among other things, controls to be  designed to assure that ongoing monitoring occurs. The standards also  state that relevant, reliable, and timely information is needed throughout  an agency to control operations, achieve its objectives, and carry out its  oversight responsibilities. Consistent with internal control standards, the  FBI Laboratory could better ensure that it obtains more transcripts by  routinely capturing and using additional information and data that are  critical to their acquisition, such as the reason a transcript is unavailable,  when it is expected to be available, the court jurisdiction, and a point of  contact for the transcript. Increasing the number of transcripts acquired  could help the FBI Laboratory expand its monitoring of examiners\u2019  testimonies, which helps ensure that they are accurate, supported by the  underlying analyses, and within the scientific limits of the given forensic  discipline, as defined by FBI and accreditation standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The FBI Laboratory\u2019s forensic work is used to support law enforcement  across all levels of government.
