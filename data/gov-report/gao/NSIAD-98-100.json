The legislation required DOD to report on a number of topics, including the defense strategy, the force structure best suited to meet the strategy, and the appropriate ratio of combat to support forces. During the QDR process, DOD considered three alternatives for implementing the national defense strategy to shape and respond to current needs and prepare the force for the future within an expected budget of about $250 billion annually (constant 1997 dollars). One alternative focused on current dangers and called for maintaining the current force structure and investment levels. Another alternative focused on future dangers and allocated more resources to modernizing for the future but significantly reduced the current force. The final alternative, selected by DOD, targeted infrastructure activities, called for modest force structure cuts, and increased modernization funding to $60 billion per year. According to the QDR, this option retains sufficient force structure to meet current requirements and reallocates resources to invest in force modernization.", "A principal objective of the QDR was to understand the financial risk in DOD\u2019s program plans and devise ways to manage that risk. The QDR noted that past years\u2019 procurement funds were used for unplanned operating expenses. The QDR concluded that as much as $10 billion to $12 billion per year in future procurement funding could be diverted for unplanned operating expenses. The QDR also noted that the migration of procurement funding is caused by unprogrammed operating expenses from underestimating day-to-day operating costs, unrealized savings from initiatives such as outsourcing or business process reengineering, and new program demands. To address this financial instability, the QDR directed cutting some force structure and personnel, shedding additional excess facilities through more base closures and realignments, streamlining infrastructure, and reducing quantities of some new weapon systems.", "Congress establishes minimum active duty personnel levels for each service as part of the annual national defense authorization process. Thus, congressional approval for the QDR active duty personnel reductions will be needed because they would reduce the number of personnel below the current approved levels. The QDR directed the services to cut 61,700 active, 54,000 reserve, and 60,800 civilian personnel by fiscal year 2003, except for 7,700 of the civilian cuts that DOD expected to achieve by fiscal year 2005. DOD expected to save about $3.7 billion annually by fiscal year 2003 as a result of these cuts. The QDR personnel cuts are in addition to those cuts the services had planned in the fiscal year 1998 FYDP through fiscal year 2003, which was prepared before the QDR. Appendix I shows the total projected personnel reductions by service through fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personnel Cuts Are Based on DOD\u2019s Goal to Increase Modernization Funding", "paragraphs": ["The level of personnel cuts called for in the QDR was based on DOD\u2019s plan to achieve dollar savings that would (1) reduce the possibility that procurement funds would be used for unplanned expenses and (2) enable DOD to increase and maintain procurement funding at $60 billion annually.In March and April 1997, DOD officials concluded that a 10-percent force structure cut would result in an unacceptable risk in implementing the national military strategy and that the potential savings from infrastructure initiatives identified during the QDR process would not be sufficient to ensure that procurement funding would not be used for unplanned expenses. As a result, senior civilian officials and the service chiefs agreed that the services needed to eliminate the equivalent of about 150,000 active military personnel, which Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) officials estimated would save between $4 billion and $6 billion annually by fiscal year 2003. The Secretary of Defense directed the service chiefs to develop initiatives to achieve personnel cuts and assess how to allocate the cuts among active, reserve, and civilian personnel.", "In May 1997, the Secretary of Defense approved the services\u2019 proposals to eliminate about 175,000 active, reserve, and civilian personnel and save an estimated $3.7 billion by 2003, as shown in table 1. The savings estimates vary among the services because of the different levels of active, reserve, and civilian personnel cuts and the extent of outsourcing included in the services\u2019 plans. For example, the Navy and the Air Force plan to cut about 30,000 and 46,000 active, reserve, and civilian personnel, respectively.", "Despite the larger personnel cut, the Air Force\u2019s estimated savings are significantly lower than the Navy\u2019s because most of the Air Force cuts will occur primarily from replacing military and civilian personnel with contractors, which saves only a portion of current salaries. In contrast, the Navy plans to eliminate personnel primarily by reducing force structure, such as surface combatants, which will save all of the current and future salaries.", "The Army plan was based on the assumption that it had to eliminate the equivalent of 45,000 active personnel. The Army decided to cut its active, reserve, and civilian personnel each by the equivalent of 15,000 active personnel. The active cuts were based primarily on transferring some active combat service and combat service support missions to the reserves and allocating percentage cuts to most of the major command institutional forces. The Army decided to cut the reserves by 45,000, which it believed to be the equivalent of 15,000 active positions, based on the assumption that three reserve component positions equaled the cost of one active position. In allocating the cuts between the reserve components, the Army considered an analysis of forces that indicated about 6,300 Army Reserve and 62,000 Army National Guard forces were not included in current war plans. After considering this analysis and other factors, the Army decided to cut the Army Reserve by 7,000 personnel and the Army National Guard by 38,000 personnel. After the release of the QDR, Army National Guard officials stated that they were not included in the process used to determine the scope of the cuts and that they have yet to reach agreement with Army headquarters on all the personnel cuts. The Army reserve components have agreed to cut 20,000 reserve personnel by fiscal year 2000 and defer allocation of the remaining 25,000 cuts. The Army civilian cuts were based primarily on a plan to compete 48,000 civilian positions, with the assumption that private contractors would win one-half of the competitions. However, the Army\u2019s plan was not based on a study of missions and functions by location. The Army assumed that all eligible positions in commercial activities would be competed and that it could reclassify some positions that cannot currently be competed. The remainder of the civilian cuts were based on efforts to reengineer the Army Materiel Command and reduce the number of military technicians in the reserve component.", "The Navy proposed reducing its active, reserve, and civilian personnel by about 4.5 percent each. The majority of the active military cuts were based on planned force structure cuts, such as reducing the number of surface combatants and attack submarines, and transferring some active support ships to the Military Sealift Command. The Navy Reserve cuts were based primarily on plans to decommission frigates, deactivate some aircraft and helicopters, and eliminate positions that had been funded but had not been filled. The Navy expects to reduce civilian personnel primarily by workload reductions and reengineering; however, it had not initiated any studies, as of May 1997, to achieve these cuts. Unlike the Army and the Air Force plans, the Navy plan assumes very few reductions from outsourcing because the Navy, in its fiscal year 1998 budget, had programmed savings of $2.5 billion from outsourcing by fiscal year 2003.", "The Air Force planned to achieve the majority of its personnel cuts from outsourcing and the remainder through consolidating fighter and bomber squadrons and streamlining headquarters. The Air Force relied on an ongoing study, known as Jump Start, to determine the potential for reducing active military and civilian positions by outsourcing. This study examined the potential for outsourcing at wing level rather than relying exclusively on a broad, headquarters-only assessment of all personnel that could potentially be outsourced. After the QDR, the Air Force identified some problems with the data used to determine the potential number of cuts; therefore, it programmed a smaller personnel reduction than that identified in the QDR report.", "The Marine Corps plan to reduce active personnel was based primarily on reducing and reorganizing the Marine Corps Security Battalion, which provides security for Navy installations. The Marine Corps also proposed to cut some administrative support in headquarters activities, but it had not identified any specific actions as of May 1997. The Marine Corps had also not developed specific plans to reduce reserve and civilian personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Aspects of the Services\u2019 Plans Are Incomplete and Based on Optimistic Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["Not all of the QDR personnel cuts were included in the fiscal year 1999 FYDP. In addition, there is considerable risk that some of the cuts included in the FYDP may not be achieved because (1) the Army has not agreed on the allocation of 25,000 of the 45,000 reserve component cuts, (2) significant reductions in the Air Force and the Army are based on implementing aggressive outsourcing plans, and (3) some of the Army and the Navy civilian reductions are contingent on the outcome of reengineering studies. On the other hand, all of the services, except the Air Force, have plans to achieve the majority of their active military cuts by the end of fiscal year 1999. For example, the Navy plans to achieve about 14,200, or 79 percent, of its active military cuts in fiscal year 1999 through force structure reductions, such as decommissioning surface combatants. Moreover, the Navy has plans to achieve its reserve cuts, and the Army has specific plans to achieve 20,000 reserve component cuts. Also, the Marine Corps has plans to achieve the majority of its active and reserve cuts. Although outsourcing is only a small part of the Navy\u2019s QDR cuts, the Navy has an aggressive outsourcing program that involves risk because the Navy has not identified the majority of the specific functions that will be studied to achieve the expected savings.

The Air Force double counted some potential outsourcing savings, and OSD deferred most of the Air Force\u2019s plans to restructure fighter squadrons and consolidate bomber squadrons because it determined that the plans were not executable at this time. According to an OSD official, OSD was concerned that the restructuring plan could be construed by Congress as violating its guidance to refrain from any planning for future base closures. Likewise, the Air Force reserves will not be reduced by 700 personnel because, after the QDR was released, the Air Force decided to increase the reserve end strength to cover an existing wartime shortage, according to Air Force officials. These actions will reduce the Air Force\u2019s planned recurring savings to about $600 million compared with the $790 million it had planned to achieve by fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Agreement on All of the Army Reserve Component Cuts", "paragraphs": ["The QDR directed that the Army reduce its reserve components by 45,000 personnel.

In developing their plans, the services made different assumptions about the personnel cuts that could be achieved through these competitions. The Air Force identified the specific functions that will be studied by base; however, it made some assumptions that could overstate the number of civilian cuts. On the other hand, the Army had not identified the majority of the specific functions by location to be competed, and its plan assumes that all eligible civilian positions in commercial activities can be competed.", "Although the fiscal year 1999 FYDP reflects a lower number of reductions through outsourcing than the Air Force\u2019s May 1997 plan, the Air Force made some assumptions that could make it difficult to achieve about 6,900 civilian cuts. According to Air Force officials, the fiscal year 1999 FYDP reflects that about 22,000 military and 16,000 civilians will be eliminated through outsourcing by fiscal year 2003. To estimate the potential personnel cuts from outsourcing, the Air Force assumed that all of the military positions included in its Jump Start study, and all of the military and civilian positions included in a separate outsourcing study of targeted functions at four bases, would be contracted out. This assumption differs from past Air Force experience, which shows that a civilian workforce wins 40 percent of all competitions and that 60 percent of the work is contracted out. Air Force officials noted that a standard 12-percent overhead factor must now be included in the government cost estimate, which they believe will result in more functions being contracted out. Our recent review of the 12-percent overhead rate suggests the potential, though not the certainty, for more competitions to be won by the private sector. If more functions are contracted out, then more civilian positions will be eliminated. However, the Air Force commercial activities manager stated that the Air Force has not had sufficient experience with the 12-percent overhead factor to determine if it will change the mix of functions that remain in house or are contracted out. If the A-76 change does not result in contractors winning more competitions and the results are similar to past results, we estimate that the Air Force may not be able to eliminate as many as 6,900 civilian positions.", "The Army plans to compete 48,000 positions to achieve the majority of its civilian reductions; however, the Army made some assumptions that could make it difficult to achieve all of the planned cuts. For example, the Army assumed that it could compete all 34,000 civilian positions in commercial activities except those exempted by legislation, such as firefighters and security guards. However, unlike the Air Force, the Army has not done a study to determine if all positions can be competed. The Air Force found that it is not practical to compete many positions in commercial activities because the positions are spread across many units and locations. The Army announced studies covering about 14,000 of the 34,000 positions; however, it has not identified the specific functions or location of the remaining positions to be studied. Army officials stated the major commands would identify the functions to be studied as part of their future annual budgets. Finally, the study universe also included some positions that involved performance of inherently governmental functions and therefore cannot be competed. Army officials stated that, as part of the Defense Reform Initiative, a study is underway to determine if all positions are consistently and properly classified throughout DOD. Army officials believe this review will reclassify about 14,000 positions to commercial activities, which will then enable the positions to be competed. However, the Army does not have analysis to support this figure.", "The Navy planned to achieve about 1,300, or 7 percent, of its active military and about 1,200, or 14 percent, of its civilian QDR personnel reductions through outsourcing. However, the Navy now plans to achieve about 660 of its active military QDR personnel cuts through outsourcing because its initial plan did not adequately consider the impact that outsourcing would have on sea-to-shore rotation. In addition to the QDR reductions, the Navy has programmed savings of $2.5 billion in its fiscal year 1999 budget based on plans to study 80,500 positions\u201410,000 military and 70,500 civilian\u2014by fiscal year 2003.

Moreover, in February 1998, we reported that Army efforts to reengineer the institutional forces have not been successful. For example, the Army initially identified 4,000 active military institutional positions that it planned to transfer to operational forces.

For example, the Air Force plans to eliminate about 22,000 active military personnel through outsourcing. Air Force officials noted that these personnel are not military essential because they do not deploy, are not required to support overseas rotation needs, and primarily involve infrastructure functions such as logistics and base operating support. Moreover, on the basis of past experience, the Air Force expects that 75 percent of these personnel will be replaced by either civilian employees or contractors. The other 25 percent will be eliminated because A-76 studies should result in more efficient organizations requiring fewer personnel.", "The Navy plans to eliminate about 5,400 active military personnel by reducing the number of surface combatants from the current level of 128 to 116 and decommissioning 2 attack submarines. According to Navy officials, the surface combatant reductions are possible because the newer ships entering the fleet provide greater combat capability. Similarly, the Marine Corps plans to eliminate 1,200 active military positions by restructuring its security battalion, which provides support to the Navy. Navy officials agreed with the Marines Corps\u2019 proposed restructuring, which will eliminate personnel associated with missions that are no longer valid and reorganize personnel to provide the same level of support more efficiently.", "The Army believes that the plan to reduce active personnel can be accomplished without significantly increasing the risk associated with implementing the national military strategy. The Army plans to achieve almost one-half of its QDR-directed active cut by transferring 7,100 active military combat support and combat service support positions to the reserve component. Army officials believe that this plan will enable it to execute the national military strategy with an acceptable level of risk, assuming adequate resourcing for active and reserve components, availability of increased sea- and airlift, funding for equipment modernization, and improvements to existing intelligence and communication systems. However, the Army had not finalized its plan on which combat support and combat service support missions would be transferred to the reserve component. Our February 1997 report on Army support forces highlighted shortages in active support forces. We reported that a smaller active Army support force did not appear feasible because it could increase the Army\u2019s risk of carrying out current defense policy.Specifically, our report stated that about 79,000 support forces needed in the first 30 days of the first major theater war would arrive late because the Army lacks sufficient numbers of active support forces and must rely on reserve forces, which generally require more than 30 days to mobilize and deploy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight of the Services\u2019 Plans Will Be Critical to Achieving QDR Goals", "paragraphs": ["The May 1997 QDR report recognizes that one of the primary sources of instability in DOD\u2019s current plans is the possibility that planned procurement funding may need to be used for other activities and that unrealized savings is one of the key components of this problem.

For example, the Navy\u2019s projected personnel levels included in its budget for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 reflect the force structure cuts planned to meet QDR-mandated personnel levels but do not reflect further cuts that could result from outsourcing. The Navy plans to compete 10,000 military and 70,500 civilian positions by fiscal year 2003, and its budget assumes that these competitions will achieve $2.5 billion in savings through fiscal year 2003. However, because the Navy does not know how many civilians and military positions will be reduced as a result of these competitions, it did not adjust the personnel figures in its budget to reflect the projected effects of outsourcing. In contrast, the Air Force\u2019s projected personnel levels in the fiscal year 1999 budget reflect large cuts in military and civilian personnel from outsourcing.

It believed the report\u2019s emphasis on dollar savings ignores the Department\u2019s strategy assessment and noted that the resulting balanced program recommended by the QDR is based on modest reductions and restructuring of U.S. military forces to meet present threats. DOD also noted that the QDR was a blueprint to revolutionize business affairs and promote more efficient infrastructure, with many of the details to be fully developed through the programming and budget cycles. Moreover, DOD stated that our report is apparently based on information available as of May 1997 and does not reflect the implementation details that were developed during the fiscal year 1999 budget cycle. Finally, DOD noted that we were critical of QDR decisions to downsize the Army\u2019s active, reserve, and civilian components. It stated these decisions were based on a careful analysis of the risks, the potential impact on readiness, and the ability to execute the cuts.", "Our report specifically recognizes that the QDR included more than personnel reductions and notes that we will be reporting separately on other aspects of the QDR, such as the process for determining the force structure and modernization requirements. We believe that the risk associated with the services\u2019 plans to implement the personnel cuts and achieve the expected savings is an important linkage. Specifically, the personnel cuts account for the majority of the savings DOD expects from the QDR to increase modernization funding. Although this report reflects our analysis of the services\u2019 initial plans when the QDR was released in May 1997, it also assesses OSD and service actions to implement the QDR personnel reductions as of February 1998.

Marine Corps officials stated the revised plan will achieve approximately the same level of savings implied in the QDR-proposed reduction because more positions for reservists on full-time active duty are being eliminated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Active Cuts Involve a Reorganization of Security Forces", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps plans to reduce the size of the Marine Security Force Battalion and eliminate headquarters administrative and support positions to achieve its active military cuts. The Marine Security Force Battalion has historically provided security for some Navy installations and some deployed Navy ships. These requirements have been reduced because the number of nuclear weapons storage and transfer sites are decreasing, nuclear weapons are no longer deployed on ships, and most Navy bases are open to the public. The Navy has agreed that the Marine Corps could reduce the size of the security battalion, eliminating about 1,200, or 40 percent, of its 3,000 positions. About 70 percent of these positions were associated with missions that were no longer valid. The remaining 30 percent involved proposals to meet the same level of support through more efficient use of personnel. The Marine Corps plans to satisfy the Navy\u2019s security needs by increasing the number of special anti-terrorist platoons from 6 to 11, providing anti-terrorist training to the Navy personnel on Navy bases and stations as needed, and continuing to provide security guards for selected Navy activities. The Marine Corps also plans to eliminate about 600 administrative positions by improving efficiency and using new technology, although the positions have not been specifically identified.", "The Marine Corps developed its plan to meet active duty cuts outlined in the QDR as a part of a broader effort to shift resources to its highest priority operational requirements. In addition to developing a plan to achieve its QDR cuts, the Marine Corps also identified about 4,000 positions that could be eliminated and transferred to operational units to achieve a 90-percent staffing level in these units. For example, the Marine Corps plans to eliminate or reduce administrative and support positions, such as audio-visual and disbursing. The Marine Corps also plans to reduce or eliminate some weapon systems. For example, the Marine Corps plans to reduce about 850 positions related to cuts in certain infantry and missile systems, including some anti-tank missile positions and all 383 HAWK missile firing positions. A senior Marine Corps official said that, although these systems are valuable, they are not the most critical and that the resources can be better used in other ways. For example, despite the capability of the HAWK system, its lift requirements make movement into theater difficult. The Marine Corps plans to rely on Navy aircraft and Army Patriot missiles to replace HAWK capabilities until a future anti-ballistic missile defense is deployed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reserve Cuts Are Fewer Than Directed by the QDR", "paragraphs": ["The QDR directed that the Marine Corps reduce its reserve component by 4,200. According to Marine Corps officials, the Commandant, after an extensive review of the reserve force structure, decided to cut only 3,000 positions. Marine Corps officials noted that, although fewer positions are being cut than the QDR directed, approximately the same level of savings will be achieved because the Marine Corps original estimates were based on average costs for drilling reservists who are generally paid for weekend duty, whereas the Marine Corps\u2019 revised plan cuts more full-time reservists who have higher salaries that are comparable to active duty personnel.The Commandant chartered a reserve force structure review group to make recommendations on restructuring the Marine Corps Reserve, within QDR guidelines, to complement the active component in meeting the requirements of the war-fighting commanders in chief. The group focused on identifying forces not critical to meeting war-fighting requirements and units at sites that are underutilized, not cost-effective, or in poor condition and eliminating redundant or unnecessary headquarters overhead. An additional consideration was to minimize the impact on individual personnel whose positions will be eliminated. This consideration meant closing units in areas where there are other units within the geographical area so that personnel displaced by closings can fill positions in other local units.", "On the basis of the work of the force structure review group, the Commandant decided to eliminate 3,000 reserve positions: 1,434 positions from drilling units, 695 individual mobilization augmentees, and 553 positions for reservists on active duty. The Marine Corps also plans to reduce the number of new recruits by 318 positions. Full-time reserve personnel represent the highest cost category. By eliminating more of these positions than it originally estimated, the Marine Corps expects to achieve approximately the same level of savings and lose fewer personnel than directed in the QDR.", "To achieve the reductions in drilling units, the Marine Corps plans to deactivate units and realign personnel and organizations at various sites throughout the United States. The Marine Corps plans to deactivate one theater missile defense (HAWK) unit and reorganize another, which will eliminate about 475 positions. This action corresponds to the Marine Corps\u2019 decision to eliminate HAWK units in the active force. The Marine Corps also plans to deactivate 10 other units, which will eliminate about 740 positions. Some of these units had difficulty in recruiting and sustaining their occupational specialties and were already understaffed, whereas others had no wartime mission. Finally, other cuts are based on plans to restructure some units so that the Marine Corps can accomplish its missions more efficiently without undermining operational effectiveness. For example, the Marine Corps plans to cut about 230 positions by deactivating one Marine Wing Support Squadron and transferring some of its functions to other squadrons.", "The Marine Corps plans to reduce 695 individual mobilization augmentee positions in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 through attrition. The individual mobilization augmentees currently serve in many capacities, including headquarters and support activities. The Marine Corps allocated the cuts to each functional area, such as communications and information. However, it is currently conducting a review to identify the specific positions within each area to eliminate.", "Full-time reserve reductions will be taken by units spread throughout the Marine Corps Reserve, including small cuts in some operating units. The largest number of reductions\u2014175\u2014will come from the reserve air wing, which had 1,080 full-time reserve positions. The Marine Corps plans to achieve most of these reductions by reducing air wing headquarters staff (77 positions) and eliminating HAWK units (34 positions). Headquarters and support units will be cut by higher percentages than other units. For example, Marine Corps headquarters will eliminate 49, or 37 percent, of its 133 active reserve positions, and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command will be reduced by 15, or 75 percent, of its 20 active reserve positions. In addition, the Marine Corps plans to consolidate reserve administrative activities in one location, which will eliminate about 155 active reserve positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Civilian Cuts Have Not Been Identified", "paragraphs": ["To achieve the civilian cuts, the Marine Corps plans to eliminate 63 positions, or 10 percent, of the civilian staff at its headquarters and other activities in the Washington, D.C., area. The remaining 237 positions to be eliminated will be prorated among other installations worldwide. The Marine Corps has not identified the actual positions to be cut. Over the next 5 years, the Marine Corps will provide funding for fewer positions, and the local commanders will have to decide which positions to cut.
