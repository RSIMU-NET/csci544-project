In January 2018, we reported that  states cited the need for additional guidance, training, and technical  assistance from HHS to address the needs of infants born with prenatal  drug exposure. HHS disagreed with our recommendation to provide such  guidance regarding the safe care for substance-affected infants, and has  not implemented the recommendation. HHS stated that it had already  clarified guidance in this area and believed that states needed flexibility to  meet the program requirements in the context of each state\u2019s program.  We found that states continued to report issues with the guidance, and  that the clarifications did not address an ongoing challenge regarding the  program requirements. We continue to believe our recommendation is  warranted. As of February 2020, HHS continues to disagree with us and  with the states. Without adequate supports and services to ensure their  safety, these vulnerable infants may be at risk for child abuse and  neglect.", "We have also recently recommended in January 2020 that DEA should,  in consultation with industry stakeholders\u2014such as drug distributors\u2014 identify solutions to address the limitations of the ARCOS Enhanced  Lookup Buyer Statistic Tool, to ensure industry stakeholders have the  most useful information possible to assist them in identifying and  reporting suspicious opioid orders to DEA. DEA agreed with our  recommendation, and is starting to assess how to address this  recommendation. These limitations, including a lack of appropriately  detailed data, may limit the usefulness of the tool in assisting distributors  in determining whether an order is suspicious.", "In addition, we have previously reported in 2019 that coordination across  private health plans, health-care prescribers, pharmacists, and at-risk  beneficiaries could contribute to the success of Medicare drug monitoring  programs, which are designed to identify beneficiaries at risk of opioid  misuse. We also have ongoing work on how federal departments and  agencies coordinate their drug prevention efforts in schools as well as on  how effectively federal agencies coordinated their counter-drug activities  with Mexico.", "Capacity to address the crisis. We have identified ongoing challenges  related to the nation\u2019s capacity to address the drug crisis. Sufficient  capacity and efficient use of that capacity are key components for making  progress in high-risk areas; they are necessary for federal, state, and  local agencies to achieve strategic goals in addressing drug misuse, such  as implementing the National Drug Control Strategy. In our work  designating high-risk government programs and functions, we define  capacity as having the people and resources sufficient to address the  risk.", "Our prior work has found that the nation faces insufficient capacity to  successfully address persistent, troubling trends in drug misuse, including  the lack of treatment options. In addition, the nation\u2019s existing capacity  may be plagued by inefficiencies and gaps in information about what  resources are most effective in addressing drug misuse. These capacity  challenges permeate every level of government and affect the nation\u2019s  key social services and health care programs. As a result, effectively  addressing the drug crisis requires harnessing capacity across agencies  within the federal government as well as coordinating with state and local  governments and community-based nongovernment organizations.", "The availability of treatment for substance use disorders has not kept  pace with needs, and the federal government has faced barriers to  increasing treatment capacity. For example, we have reported on  barriers to increasing access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use  disorder, and federal efforts to address these barriers. Such barriers to  treatment include a lack of Medicaid coverage for treatment medications  in some states, delays that can be caused by the need for prior  authorizations for some treatment medications, and the unwillingness of  some health care providers to obtain the federal waiver required to  prescribe some treatment medications. We have also reported that,  according to officials at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), many  veterans lack access to residential substance use treatment programs  because of high demand relative to capacity.", "Developing and maintaining sufficient capacity to address the drug crisis  also requires that federal agencies use existing resources\u2014such as  data\u2014effectively. For example, we have recently reported in January  2020 that DEA should be more proactive in using the data it already  collects from DEA registrants to identify problematic drug transaction  patterns. According to DEA officials, one analysis that they conduct on a  quarterly basis involves using a computer algorithm when comparing  large volumes of drugs purchased in a given geographic area to the  area\u2019s population data. However, DEA did not report conducting active  and recurring monitoring of transactions using algorithms to detect and  flag transactions that indicate potential diversion, either on a real-time or  near real-time basis, to help identify questionable patterns in the data or  unusual patterns of drug distribution on a more routine basis. Such  analyses could be used to proactively support or generate leads for  investigations of potential drug diversion.", "Registrants already report data on controlled-substance transactions to  the DEA. DEA could use these data to identify trends in distribution or  purchases of drugs in a given geographic area. DEA could also look for  and compare unusual patterns in drug order activity in different locations  to identify potential issues that warrant further investigation. Further, DEA  has not established a way to manage all of the data it collects and  maintains.", "DEA agreed with three of our four recommendations to better manage  and use the data it collects. DEA neither agreed nor disagreed with the  fourth recommendation. However, DEA has not yet implemented any of  the recommendations. By implementing these recommendations, DEA  could ensure that important data assets are formally managed and fully  utilized to inform investigations and prevent diversion of prescription  opioids to be sold illegally. Overall, federal efforts to address the drug  crisis could make better use of available data to assist in identifying  emerging patterns of misuse, allowing the government to respond more  quickly to evolving trends.", "Beyond specific capacity challenges that we have identified, in December  2019 we reported on challenges federal agencies face in assessing the  resources they will need to achieve the goals of the National Drug Control  Strategy. ONDCP is required to issue drug control funding guidance to  the heads of departments and agencies with responsibilities under the  National Drug Control Program by July 1 of each year, and such funding  guidance must address funding priorities developed in the National Drug  Control Strategy. Since ONDCP did not issue a Strategy in 2017 or  2018, ONDCP could neither provide funding guidance to National Drug  Control Program agencies based on the Strategy, nor could it review and  certify budget requests of these agencies to determine if they are  adequate to meet the goals of the Strategy, in accordance with and as  required by law. Without a National Drug Control Strategy in 2017 or  2018, ONDCP used other sources\u2014such as policy priorities identified in  the President\u2019s Budget from fiscal year 2018\u2014to identify drug policy  priorities and develop funding guidance.", "ONDCP issued a National Drug Control Strategy in 2019 and 2020, but  neither Strategy included a 5-year projection for program and budget  priorities, as required by law. In December 2019, we recommended that  ONDCP develop and document key planning elements to help ONDCP  structure its ongoing efforts and to better position the agency to meet  these requirements for future iterations of the National Drug Control  Strategy.", "We also found that the 2020 National Drug Control Strategy does not  include estimates of federal funding or other resources needed to achieve  each of ONDCP\u2019s long-range goals. The 2020 Strategy includes a plan  to expand treatment of substance use disorders that identifies unmet needs for substance use disorder treatment and a strategy for closing the  gap between available and needed treatment. The plan also describes  the roles and responsibilities of relevant National Drug Control Program  agencies for implementing the plan. However, the plan does not identify  resources required to enable National Drug Control Program agencies to  implement the plan or resources required to eliminate the treatment gap,  as required by law. The National Drug Control Strategy is important for  assessing the nation\u2019s capacity to address drug misuse through both the  development of federal funding estimates and the certification of agency  budget requests that aim to meet the goals of the Strategy.", "Additionally, we have ongoing work on the federal government\u2019s capacity  to address the drug crisis. For example, we are studying gaps in the  capacity of the health care system to treat substance use disorders, and  examining how grantees use funding from selected SAMHSA grant  programs to increase access to substance use disorder treatment. We  are also studying school-based drug prevention programs and the effects  of drug misuse on the workforce. This work will examine challenges that  states and local educational entities face in serving the needs of  communities affected by the drug crisis. We also have planned work  examining the effectiveness of federal funding to combat the ongoing  opioid crisis.", "Measurement, evaluation, and demonstration of progress. The  federal government faces challenges related to measuring, evaluating,  and demonstrating progress towards addressing the crisis. We have  reported that key data needed to measure and evaluate progress towards  strategic goals are not reliable or are not collected and reported. We have  also found that some agencies lack plans or metrics to measure the  effectiveness of specific programs to address the drug crisis and to  demonstrate that these programs are making progress towards stated  national goals, including reducing drug overdose deaths and expanding  access to addiction treatment. Successfully addressing drug misuse  requires ongoing measurement and evaluation of efforts towards stated  goals and the ability to share and use performance information to make  midcourse changes and corrections where needed.", "Regarding challenges related to data, we have identified gaps in the  availability and reliability of data for measuring progress. ONDCP and  other federal, state, and local government officials have identified  challenges with the timeliness, accuracy, and accessibility of data from  law enforcement and public health sources related to both fatal and non- fatal overdose cases. In March 2018, we recommended that ONDCP  lead a review on ways to improve overdose data; ONDCP did not indicate  whether it agreed with our recommendation. Additionally, in December  2019, we found that ONDCP\u2019s Drug Control Data Dashboard did not  include all of the data required by the SUPPORT Act, such as data  sufficient to show the extent of the unmet need for substance use  disorder treatment. We recommended that ONDCP establish the  planning elements to ensure that these data were included in the Data  Dashboard, and ONDCP disagreed with our recommendation. Having  accessible and reliable data, including data on drug overdoses will help  ONDCP and other agencies better measure the scope and nature of the  drug crisis.", "We also found in 2019 that the State Department cannot ensure the  reliability of its program monitoring data for its Caribbean Basin Security  Initiative, which seeks to reduce illicit drug trafficking. The State  Department agreed with the recommendation to ensure the development  and implementation of a data management system for centrally collecting  reliable program monitoring data for all Caribbean Basin Security Initiative  activities, but has not yet implemented it. Without this action, there may  be discrepancies in how Caribbean Basin Security Initiative program  performance data is defined and collected, and the State Department  cannot report comprehensively or accurately on the Initiative\u2019s activities to  reduce illicit drug trafficking or track data trends across countries.", "While ONDCP is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of national  drug control policy efforts across the government, we found that ONDCP  has not developed performance evaluation plans for the goals in the 2020  National Drug Control Strategy. Some of the long-range goals listed in the  2020 Strategy include expanding access to evidence-based treatment,  reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United States, and decreasing the over-prescribing of opioid medications. However, the 2020  National Drug Control Strategy does not include performance evaluation  plans to measure progress against each of the Strategy\u2019s long-range  goals, as required by law. These performance evaluation plans are  required by statute to include (1) specific performance measures for each  National Drug Control Program agency, (2) annual and\u2014to the extent  practicable\u2014quarterly objectives and targets for each measure, and (3)  an estimate of federal funding and other resources necessary to achieve  each performance objective and target. Without effective long-term  plans that clearly articulate goals and objectives and without specific  measures to track performance, federal agencies cannot fully assess  whether taxpayer dollars are invested in ways that will achieve desired  outcomes such as reducing access to illicit drugs and expanding  treatment for substance use disorders.", "Additionally, National Drug Control Program agencies are responsible for  evaluating their progress toward achieving the goals of the National Drug  Control Strategy, and in some cases have improved how to measure  this progress. For example, although the federal government continues to  face barriers to increasing access to treatment for substance use  disorders, HHS has recently implemented our recommendation to  establish performance measures with targets to expand access to  medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders. As of  March 2020, HHS has established such performance measures with  targets to increase the number of prescriptions for MAT medications and  to increase treatment capacity, as measured by the number of providers  authorized to treat patients using MAT. Monitoring progress against these  targets will help HHS determine whether its efforts to expand treatment  are successful or whether new approaches are needed.", "We have also identified challenges regarding how federal agencies  demonstrate the progress of specific programs toward addressing the  drug crisis. We reported in 2018 on DEA\u2019s 360 Strategy\u2014which aims to  coordinate DEA enforcement, diversion control, and demand reduction  efforts\u2014as well as on ONDCP\u2019s Heroin Response Strategy under its High  Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. We found that neither DEA\u2019s  360 Strategy nor ONDCP\u2019s Heroin Response Strategy included outcome- oriented performance measures for its activities and goals, respectively.  DEA disagreed with and has not yet implemented our recommendation to  establish these types of performance measures for its activities. ONDCP  neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation to establish  outcome-oriented performance measures for the goals of the Heroin  Response Strategy, and has not yet implemented the recommendation.  Without these measures, it is unclear the extent to which DEA or ONDCP  can accurately and fully gauge their efforts and their overall effectiveness  in combatting heroin and opioid use and reducing overdose deaths.", "Additionally, we have found that DEA does not have outcome-oriented  goals and performance targets for its use of data in opioid diversion  activities, making DEA likely not able to adequately assess whether its  investments and efforts are helping to limit the availability of and better  respond to the opioid prescription diversion threat. DEA neither agreed  nor disagreed with our recommendation to establish these outcome- oriented goals and related performance targets for its opioid diversion  activities, and has not implemented this recommendation.", "We have also reported that the Department of State has not established  performance indicators for its Caribbean Basin Security Initiative to  facilitate performance evaluation across agencies, countries, and  activities, inhibiting the assessment of the program\u2019s progress to reduce  illicit drug trafficking. The State Department agreed with our  recommendation to develop and implement a data management system  for centrally collecting reliable program monitoring data. The State  Department has not yet implemented this recommendation. Without  robust assessments of how specific programs help to achieve the goals of  the National Drug Control Strategy, federal agencies may be unable to  demonstrate progress in addressing the drug crisis, and may be unable to  make any needed adjustments to their strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Illicit drug use and misuse of prescription drugs is a long-standing  national problem that will continue to evolve. The terrible effects of drug  misuse on families and communities have persisted over decades,  despite ongoing federal, state, and local efforts. Federal agencies and  Congress can and must work to ensure that available resources are  coordinated effectively to mitigate and respond to the drug misuse crisis.", "Maintaining sustained attention on preventing, responding to, and  recovering from drug misuse will be challenging in the coming months as  many of the federal agencies responsible for addressing drug misuse are  currently focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the  severe public health and economic effects of the pandemic could fuel  some of the contributing factors of drug misuse, such as unemployment\u2014 highlighting the need to sustain drug misuse prevention, response, and  recovery efforts. Addressing these challenges will require sustained  leadership and strengthened coordination; the necessary capacity to  address the crisis; and the systems to measure, evaluate, and  demonstrate progress. The more than 60 related GAO recommendations  that have yet to be implemented are an indication of how federal agencies  may begin addressing these challenges.
