However, contrary to sound planning practices, the plan does not include timeliness goals for all five appeals options available to veterans, does not include goals or measures for additional aspects of performance (such as accuracy or cost), and does not explain how VA will monitor or assess the new process compared to the legacy process.

If veterans are  dissatisfied with VA\u2019s initial decision they can appeal\u2014first to the  Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and then, if not satisfied there, to  the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board), a separate agency within VA. In  recent years, the number of appeals of VA\u2019s benefit decisions has been  rising. For appeals resolved in fiscal year 2017, veterans waited an  average of 3 years from the date they initiated their appeal to resolution  by either VBA or the Board\u2014and a cumulative average of 7 years for  appeals resolved by the Board.

We made five recommendations to improve  VA\u2019s ability to implement its proposed appeals process reform while  addressing a growing appeals workload. VA agreed in principle with our  five recommendations, which remain open as of January 2018. We  recommended, in essence, that VA develop: (1) a detailed workforce  plan, (2) a complete schedule of information technology (IT) updates, (3)  better estimates of future workloads and timeliness, (4) a robust plan for  monitoring appeals reform, and (5) a strategy for assessing whether the  new process improves veterans\u2019 experiences over the current process.

According to VA  officials, each month VA plans to continue offering RAMP to additional  eligible veterans with pending legacy appeals until January 2019\u2014a  month before VA anticipates fully implementing the new appeals system.  However, as designed, RAMP does not include features that\u2014consistent  with a well-developed and documented pilot test program\u2014would provide  VA with an opportunity to evaluate fully the soundness of new processes  and practices on a smaller scale. Specifically:", "VA\u2019s plan does not clearly define success criteria for RAMP: VA\u2019s  appeals plan states that the agency will collect certain data from  RAMP, such as the rate at which eligible veterans opt into the  process, timeliness of claims processing, and individual employee  productivity. VA also established an overall average processing time  goal of 125 days for the two VBA options; however, the plan and  supporting documentation do not clearly articulate whether RAMP  reviews are expected to meet this timeliness goal. The plan also did  not identify other success criteria for RAMP or the types of results  expected before fully implementing the new appeals process. For  example, VA\u2019s plan does not articulate the expected number and type  of subsequent appeals to the Board that result from RAMP.", "In commenting on this assessment, VA noted that its intent in  implementing RAMP was to collect data and test aspects of the new  process, and that RAMP was not an initiative in and of itself. However,  developing performance measures and data gathering procedures  and defining success criteria for a pilot test before proceeding to full  implementation are sound practices for process redesign and pilot  testing. In addition, because RAMP was not included in VA\u2019s risk  assessment, we asked VA if it had identified any risks or mitigation  strategies specific to RAMP. In its supplemental materials, VA stated  that the greatest risk to RAMP is a low participation rate among  eligible veterans with legacy claims. VA also indicated that it would  need 10 percent of eligible veterans to opt into RAMP to yield  meaningful results. However, this threshold is not articulated in VA\u2019s  appeals plan as an explicit success criterion or objective. According to  data provided by VA, as of January 22, 2018, 238 veterans opted in.  Of veterans with pending claims in RAMP, two-thirds chose the  higher-level review option. VA also reported that 47 RAMP decisions  have been made so far. As of yet, no appeals of RAMP decisions  have been filed.", "VA\u2019s plan does not articulate how it will assess RAMP before  proceeding with full implementation: Although VA\u2019s appeals plan  describes a \u201cclose-out\u201d phase in which VA intends to assess the  results of RAMP, it does not detail the conditions that would have to  be met (or not met) to trigger changes. For example, VA\u2019s plan does  not explain when or how it might respond to low opt-in rates for  RAMP\u2014other than stating it will increase outreach to eligible  veterans\u2014or to unexpectedly high appeal rates to the Board resulting  from RAMP decisions. Sound redesign and change management  practices both suggest that pilot tests be rigorously monitored and  evaluated, and that further roll-out occur only after an agency\u2019s  transition team takes any needed corrective action and determines  that the new process is achieving previously identified success  criteria. Without fully articulating its plan for deciding how and when to  roll out changes more broadly, it is not clear whether VA would be  prepared to fully implement a new appeals process that achieves its  aim of better serving veterans.", "RAMP does not test all aspects of the new appeals process:  RAMP provides an opportunity to learn about experiences at VBA  under the new system, such as the rate at which eligible veterans  choose those options and the resources that will be required to  process their appeals. However, RAMP was not designed to test how  many veterans would choose to appeal directly to the Board and,  therefore, it will not provide comparable information on the Board  appeals options. Sound workforce planning practices suggest that  agencies identify the total resources needed to manage the risk of  implementing new processes and conduct scenario planning to  determine those needs.", "In addition, although we previously recommended VA conduct  additional sensitivity analyses to inform projections of future appeals  inventories, VA\u2019s appeals plan does not reflect VA\u2019s use or intended  use of sensitivity analyses when projecting staffing needs for new  appeals options at the Board. In commenting on our assessment,  VA officials said they do not plan to conduct additional sensitivity  analyses to project future workloads until they have more information  from RAMP to inform their assumptions. As a result, VA will lack data  on scenarios in which veterans may overwhelmingly choose options  available at the Board over those at VBA when the appeals plan is  fully implemented. This presents a risk that VA\u2019s early production  projections and initial resource allocations may not be properly  balanced between the Board and VBA. This, in turn, may result in an  unexpectedly large number of appeals pending with the Board, and  corresponding lengthy average wait and decision times for some, if  not all, Board options.", "Having information on the number of veterans who are likely to appeal  to the Board is particularly critical, given that similar efforts to create  additional review options at VBA did not achieve their goals of  reducing the percentage of appeals that continue on to the Board. In  2001, VA established the Decision Review Officer (DRO) process\u2014in  which senior staff have the authority to overturn an initial disability  claim decision without any new evidence\u2014to resolve more appeals at  the regional level and avoid long waits at the Board. However, we  reported in 2011 that, although the DRO process helped some  veterans get additional benefits at the regional office level, it did not  accomplish the program\u2019s primary goal of reducing the percentage of  appeals continuing on to the Board.", "In responding to our assessment, VA officials reiterated their plans to  increase outreach in the event of low opt-in rates for RAMP and indicated  they recently began to send follow-up RAMP invitation letters. With  respect to assessing all appeal options, VA officials stated that, while no  legal bar prevents testing of the Board options, the Board is focused on  reducing its inventory of pending appeals while RAMP provides early  resolution of appeals within the new VBA-only options. Officials conceded  that this approach means they cannot collect data on the rate at which  veterans opt to appeal directly to the Board (e.g., bypassing additional  VBA review) until the new process is fully implemented. However, they  noted that they can collect some data on the rate at which veterans  whose appeals go through RAMP file subsequent appeals to the Board,  even though the Board will not begin processing those appeals until full  implementation.", "By pursuing an approach that does not identify or mitigate significant risks  associated with implementing a new process, VA is taking a chance that  untested aspects will not perform as desired. The Act provides VA  authority to pilot aspects of the process and flexibility on the timing of  implementing the new process, which could allow some additional time  for VA to carefully measure performance under RAMP and determine  whether any corrective actions are necessary. If VA does not take full  advantage of this authority, it risks moving forward without knowing  whether the new appeals process improves experiences for veterans, and  potentially implementing a process that is more expensive or results in  longer wait times than originally anticipated.", "In conclusion, in implementing appeals reform after the enactment of the  Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, VA is  undertaking a complex endeavor that has the potential to affect the lives  of hundreds of thousands of veterans with service-connected disabilities.", "Such an endeavor demands a commensurate level of planning to be  successful. While the Act required VA to submit its plan within 90 days of  enactment, VA had proposed and began to plan for appeals reform much  earlier, and had our March 2017 recommendations to guide its planning  efforts from a foundation of sound practices.", "VA\u2019s November 2017 appeals plan is a positive step forward. Certain  elements of the plan\u2014such as establishing an agency-wide governance  structure to oversee implementation and testing aspects of reform prior to  full implementation\u2014are notable gains since our March 2017 report. At  the same time, the plan partially addresses or does not address five of  the required elements called for by the Act, such as delineating the total  resources required by VBA and the Board to implement and administer  the new appeals process and address legacy appeals. The plan also is  not fully responsive to our past recommendations and does not reflect a  number of sound planning practices that are essential for gauging  progress, establishing accountability, and linking resources to results.", "One such key practice is articulating a desired \u201cend state\u201d\u2014a vision for  what successful implementation would look like for the new appeals  process as well as the wind-down of the legacy process, such as  accurate and timely processing of appeals while ensuring veteran  satisfaction. Without establishing a complete and balanced set of goals  and related performance measures to achieve this end state and  monitoring and assessing progress along the way, VA risks falling short of  its overarching objective\u2014to improve timeliness of appeals decisions for  veterans overall. By not fully articulating how it plans to monitor workloads  and devote resources to both the new and legacy processes, VA runs the  risk of disadvantaging veterans with legacy appeals relative to those in  the new process, or vice versa.", "Just as important is establishing a robust integrated master schedule\u2014 rather than a high-level timeline\u2014that is built upon and clearly reflects  extensive detailed planning and includes all of the activities necessary to  execute the program and interdependencies between these activities.  Without such a road map, VA\u2019s appeals plan does not provide reasonable  assurance that decision makers have the essential information needed to  manage this complex and important program.", "We are encouraged that VA has taken some steps toward assessing  risks, including establishing a risk register and implementing RAMP to  collect information on the two VBA appeals options; however, unless VA  assesses risks against a balanced set of goals and measures, VA may  not be fully aware of risks that may impede successful implementation of  appeals reform. Further, although VA will undoubtedly learn from the  RAMP experience, it may not learn all that it should from its efforts  without (1) establishing clear criteria for what success looks like (or the  circumstances that would cause VA to consider making course  corrections) and (2) building in time to take stock of the lessons learned  before moving to full implementation.", "VA\u2019s plan places a lot of weight on RAMP to, among other efforts,  mitigate risk and generate estimates of the resources needed for  successful implementation after fiscal year 2018, even though RAMP  does not fully test options for appealing to the Board that will be available  to veterans after full implementation. Unless VA addresses key risks  associated with fully implementing appeals reform\u2014by either testing or  conducting sensitivity analyses for all five appeals options, to better  understand potential workloads at the Board\u2014VA runs the risk of fully  implementing the process without knowing if it is improving the process  for veterans.", "In our forthcoming report, we anticipate making recommendations to  address these issues. Specifically, we are preliminarily considering  recommending that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs: address all of the required elements in the Act in VA\u2019s appeals plan to  Congress\u2014including delineating resources required for all VBA and  Board appeals options\u2014using sensitivity analyses and RAMP results,  where appropriate and needed.  clearly articulate in VA\u2019s appeals plan how VA will monitor and assess  the new appeals process compared to the legacy process, including  specifying a balanced set of goals and measures\u2014such as timeliness  goals for all VBA appeals options and Board dockets, and measures  of accuracy, veteran satisfaction, and cost\u2014and related baseline  data. augment the master schedule for VA\u2019s appeals plan to reflect all  activities\u2014such as RAMP and modifications to IT systems\u2014as well  as assigned responsibilities, interdependencies, start and end dates  for key activities for each workgroup, and resources, to establish  accountability and reduce overall risk of implementation failures. ensure that the appeals plan more fully addresses risk associated with  appeals reform\u2014for example, by assessing risks against a balanced  set of goals and measures, articulating success criteria and an  assessment plan for RAMP, and testing or conducting sensitivity  analyses of all appeal options\u2014prior to fully implementing the new  appeals process.", "Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members of the Committee,  this concludes my prepared statement.

To compare the required elements and  their sub-parts against VA\u2019s appeals plan and supplemental materials  provided, we developed decision rules for determining whether the VA\u2019s  appeals plan addressed, partially addressed, or did not address each  required element. Specifically, we concluded that VA\u2019s plan addressed (or  partially addressed) a required element if the plan included information  related to all (or some) subparts of the requirement. We focused on the  plan as presented, rather than auditing the information VA relied on in  developing the plan. For example, the Act\u2019s section 3(b)(10) required  VA\u2019s plan to include a description of the modifications to the IT systems  that VBA and the Board require to carry out the new appeals system,  including cost estimates and a timeline for making the IT modifications.  We concluded that VA\u2019s plan addressed all sub-parts of this element  because it provided a description of required IT modifications, a reference  to costs included in the Appeals Modernization IT budget, and a timeline.  However, our determination that VA addressed this element should not  be construed to necessarily mean that VA fully identified or described all  IT requirements, or provided complete estimated costs and timelines  associated with those requirements, or that the information in VA\u2019s  appeals plan comported with sound planning practices. This type of  assessment was outside the scope of this objective.
