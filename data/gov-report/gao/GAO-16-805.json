As we previously reported, illegal armed  groups and some units of the Congolese national military have committed  severe human rights abuses and mass killings and profited from the  illegal exploitation of minerals originating in eastern DRC, particularly in  the provinces of Nord-Kivu and Sud-Kivu. In May 2016, the United  Nations (UN) reported that although the Armed Forces of the Democratic  Republic of the Congo conducted military operations against both foreign  and local armed groups in eastern DRC in 2015, these groups continue to  control territory and profit from natural resources. Fragmentation of some  of the armed groups and decreases in troop strength failed to translate  into significant improvements in security in 2015 in eastern DRC. The UN  also reported that armed groups continue to generate significant revenue  from the control, taxation, or looting of all of the \u201cconflict minerals\u201d\u2014gold,  tin, tantalum, and tungsten\u2014despite the expansion of traceability and due  diligence efforts to more mining sites in the DRC.", "This report is a continuation of GAO\u2019s annual reporting requirement  included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act (hereafter referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act) that  addressed the trade in conflict minerals.

For example, Section 1502(b) of the act required SEC, in consultation  with State, to promulgate disclosure and reporting regulations regarding  the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. SEC  adopted its conflict minerals disclosure rule in August 2012. Under the  act, Commerce is responsible for annually submitting a report to  appropriate congressional committees that includes a list of all known  conflict minerals processing facilities worldwide and an assessment of the  Independent Private Sector Audits (IPSA) and other due diligence  processes described by the Dodd-Frank Act conflict minerals provisions.  The act also required State, in consultation with USAID, to submit to  appropriate congressional committees a conflict minerals strategy to  address the linkages between human rights abuses, armed groups,  mining of conflict minerals, and commercial products. In addition, the act  included a provision for GAO to report, beginning in 2012, and annually  thereafter, on the effectiveness of the SEC rule in promoting peace and  security in the DRC and adjoining countries and to report annually,  beginning in 2011, on the rate of sexual violence in war-torn areas of the  DRC and adjoining countries, among other things.", "To respond to the act, in this report we examine (1) company disclosures  filed with SEC in 2015 in response to the SEC conflict minerals disclosure  rule, (2) challenges to companies\u2019 due diligence efforts related to the  processing facilities in conflict minerals supply chains and efforts to  mitigate those challenges, and (3) Commerce\u2019s actions regarding its  conflict minerals-related requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Processing facilities rely on  paper documentation from miners and exporters for information on source  and chain of custody, which, according to some industry officials, could  be susceptible to fraud. Ore may pass through a number of traders and  exporters before reaching a processing facility. The documentation of  these stages may be falsified by smugglers or be incomplete, which may  mask the actual source of the minerals being traded, according to some  experts. Some programs exist to certify the chain of custody of minerals  in some countries, but, as we have previously reported, these programs  face operational challenges, including lack of infrastructure and  government support. OECD reported in 2013 that as long as there are  no traceability or certification schemes in place that cover the whole  region, smuggling and contamination of conflict-free materials will  continue to pose a threat to due diligence initiatives. There are challenges  to the integrity of these programs. For example, a 2015 UN Group of  Experts report documented the black-market sale of tin supply chain  initiative tags; officials obtained two such illicit tags in the DRC and two in  Rwanda. As we have previously reported, some agency officials and  officials we interviewed from industry, NGOs, and international  organizations commented that the DRC government lacks capacity to  mitigate corruption and smuggling of conflict minerals. The UN Group of  Experts reported in 2015 that, while there has been progress on  traceability and due diligence efforts concerning minerals produced in the  DRC, smuggling continues, and there is scant evidence of interest in  traceability and due diligence by the governments of the DRC and  Burundi.", "Disclosure efforts at the processing-facility level are also made more  difficult by the complexity of processing operations. As shown in figure 6,  mineral processing may require many stages and distinct intermediate  products. According to USGS officials, many processors perform only  some of the refining work before selling intermediate products to other  processors. Therefore, according to these officials, with each additional  processing stage it becomes increasingly likely that minerals will change  hands, complicating due diligence efforts that depend on chain-of-custody  documentation by increasing opportunities for fraud or error, such as  falsified source-of-origin documentation. Even within the context of a  vertically integrated processor, such as a single company that performs  all of the steps to turn raw concentrate into refined products sold to  industry\u2014processing may take place in multiple facilities located in  different regions of the world.", "Further, processing companies may purchase products from multiple  suppliers, commingling the products. Commingling can occur at multiple  stages of processing, complicating due diligence efforts. \u201cPrimary\u201d  processing facilities, which upgrade ore concentrate into metal, may  source concentrate from multiple locations. These may be combined prior  to processing into a product with a higher purity or a different chemical  identity (as shown in fig. 7, a photograph we took at a processing facility  in Asia). Moreover, intermediate products with different locations of origin  may exchange hands at numerous stages. This \u201csecondary\u201d processing- facility commingling further complicates due diligence efforts to identify  primary processing facilities and locations of origin because it adds  points in mineral processing where fraud and error can be introduced  (see fig. 8). In addition, it introduces additional points where downstream  companies\u2019 due diligence efforts to identify the source of their minerals  can break down.", "Sourcing and chain-of-custody complexities, which companies reported to  be a challenge, may increase the cost required for disclosure efforts or  result in missing information. Several of the filings we reviewed indicate  that suppliers could identify all of their suppliers but not the suppliers used  for a particular batch of output, because they did not have the ability to  track production in such detail. As a result, companies completing  disclosure efforts may have needed to survey and examine many second- level suppliers from whom they did not actually source minerals, as well  as suppliers of these second-level suppliers and their respective  processing facilities. Additional disclosure efforts may be needed because  each refined form of tantalum and tungsten used, such as tantalum ingot,  tantalum oxide, or tungsten carbide powder, follows from a production  process that branches into distinct intermediate products. Many \u201cprimary\u201d  processing facilities, which turn ore or concentrate into a different  downstream product, produce a limited range of possible intermediate  products for a given mineral. As a result, the chain of custody for each  refined form of mineral used, not simply each mineral type, may need to  be examined independently. Moreover, many companies reported that  only a portion of their suppliers responded to surveys requesting  information about the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals  acquired through them. A company\u2019s missing information from its  suppliers at one level may result in its having incomplete information from  all suppliers earlier in the supply chain. Without information on all  companies in its supply chain, a company cannot report knowing the  source of all of its conflict minerals or whether any of its conflict minerals  benefited armed groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts May Mitigate Challenges of Disclosure Efforts at the Processing Facility Level", "paragraphs": ["Industry participants may be reducing the cost of the disclosure process  by encouraging the participation of processing facilities in conflict-free  certification programs and through efforts to standardize the audit  process. According to CFSI and OECD officials, CFSI, LBMA, RJC, and  other industry groups are working to better align their programs with  OECD\u2019s due diligence guidance that can be used for conflict minerals  disclosures, which SEC officials said is the most established due  diligence framework for conflict minerals filings under Section 1502 of the  Dodd-Frank Act. According to SEC officials, SEC\u2019s conflict mineral  processing facility disclosure requirements and terminology are intended  to be consistent with OECD\u2019s processing facility standards and  definitions, which were the only established due diligence standards at  the time SEC\u2019s final rule was being prepared. According to CFSI officials,  alignment on these standards reduces the need for redundant audits and  encourages participation because it allows for cross-recognition of  conflict-free certification by CFSI, LBMA, and RJC; in turn, according to  OECD officials, downstream companies rely on these certifications in  order to efficiently complete the disclosure process. A 2016 OECD report  noted that all major industry certification initiatives at the processing  facility level, including CFSI, LBMA, and RJC, among others, are  designed to implement OECD\u2019s framework and explicitly use it as their  benchmark. OECD\u2019s report also notes that, as of March 2015, nearly 100  percent of globally identified tantalum processors, 54 percent of gold  refiners (representing nearly 90 percent of all production), and 65 percent  of tin processors (approximately 80 percent of all smelted tin production)  participate to some degree in an industry audit program designed to  implement OECD\u2019s framework. Similarly, CFSI officials said that the  number of facilities certified by their program has increased from 2  processors 5 years ago to 215 as of April 2015. According to OECD and  CFSI officials, there is currently an ongoing external review of CFSI,  LBMA, and RJC processes by OECD to ensure alignment with OECD  guidelines, which OECD officials said is likely to be completed by early  2017.", "Industry participants are also improving the completeness of information  available for the audit process by working with CFSI to identify and  develop improvements to tools and database systems and by taking  steps to educate companies directly, which, according to industry  participants, are facilitating disclosure efforts. For example, CFSI officials  said that, in 2016, their public processing-facility list has been linked to a  database of live information, which may help companies conducting due  diligence. These officials also said that the tool is being revised to align  with global trade association standards on data exchange. According to  these officials, CFSI is also working on its processing-facility database  with industry participants to actively identify and investigate new  processing facilities, which has helped to provide information for  disclosure efforts. These officials said that CFSI has gathered information  on 332 processors in its database as of April 2016 (of which 214, or about  64 percent, are compliant with CFSI\u2019s standards). Some companies are  taking direct steps to encourage industry participants to participate in  these industry certification programs. Several companies told us that they  are actively reaching out to their suppliers to inform them about conflict  minerals rules, encouraging them to participate in industry programs, and  offering compliance training. Several companies and an industry group  told us that some companies are threatening to switch suppliers if their  suppliers do not join conflict-free certification programs. Information may  also flow in the other direction. One company we spoke with said that its  primary processing facility had reached out to educate it about conflict  minerals regulations and had provided extensive training on U.S.  disclosure requirements; this company is now using only conflict-free  minerals as a result.", "Additionally, industry participants are developing new technologies, such  as \u201cchemical fingerprinting,\u201d to mitigate the risk of documentation fraud,  which may supplement existing certification efforts. Chemical  fingerprinting technology allows minerals to be traced to a location of  origin based on distinct chemical signatures. At least two distinct methods  of chemical fingerprinting are available for use with conflict minerals to  confirm location of origin; however, neither is presently in wide use.  Both methods depend on databases in order to function, but the  databases are not yet sufficiently developed for reliable use. Both have  been characterized by experts as potential supplements to chain-of- custody controls.", "However, there are limitations to these efforts to mitigate challenges to  due diligence efforts. OECD officials noted that industry certification  programs sometimes engage in inefficient and redundant auditing,  increasing compliance costs, and that downstream companies do not  always rigorously scrutinize certification statements, which, if done, might  boost the credibility of due diligence efforts. According to these officials  and officials we met at processing facilities in Asia, downstream  companies also do not shoulder much of the auditing cost burden placed  on upstream companies, which may be reducing participation. Further,  OECD reported in 2016 that upstream companies and certification  initiatives have struggled with the significant cost of conflict minerals  traceability programs and voiced their concerns about downstream  companies not sharing the burden sufficiently while benefiting from those  programs. Moreover, one NGO said that CFSI is not yet fully compliant  with OECD guidance because companies are not completing a step of  OECD\u2019s framework that would require them to publish a detailed  summary of audit findings; foregoing this step reduces the transparency  of company due diligence efforts and makes public review of the findings  impossible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Commerce Has Produced Lists of Conflict Minerals Processing Facilities but Has Not Developed Plans to Assess or Advise Audits of Conflict Minerals Filings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Commerce Produced Lists of Conflict Minerals Processing Facilities in 2014 and 2015", "paragraphs": ["Commerce produced annual reports in 2014 and 2015 listing known  conflict minerals processing facilities to comply with its responsibilities  under the Dodd-Frank Act.

We also attended an industry conference on conflict minerals and  spoke with company representatives to provide additional perspective.", "To examine the challenges that exist at the processing-facility level for  companies performing due diligence as part of their conflict minerals  disclosure process and the steps taken to mitigate these challenges, we  reviewed academic and industry studies and conducted interviews with  relevant companies and experts by interviewing a judgmental sample at  industry events based on their availability and willingness to meet with us  and by reaching out to companies and experts referred to us by subject  matter experts. We also examined information about processing facilities,  including due diligence problems associated with processing facilities,  contained in SEC filings that we reviewed as described above. In  addition, based on a number of considerations such as preliminary  research indicating a high concentration of processing facilities and other  mid-supply-chain companies, as well as geographic proximity and  recommendations from Department of State (State) officials, we traveled  to China, Malaysia, and Singapore and interviewed representatives of  numerous processing facilities, commodities exchanges, and industry  groups to ask them about these risks. We assessed information from the  United States Geological Survey (USGS) and other sources to develop a  general framework for processing tin, tantalum, and tungsten to inform  our questions to these industry groups.", "To examine actions that Commerce has taken regarding its conflict  minerals-related requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, we interviewed  Commerce officials and reviewed relevant documentation and reports.  We discussed these Commerce reports where appropriate in our  interviews with companies and other industry stakeholders.", "In response to a mandate in the Dodd-Frank Act that GAO submit an  annual report that assesses the rate of sexual violence in war-torn areas  of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries,  we identified and assessed any additional published information available  on sexual violence in eastern DRC, as well as three adjoining countries  that border eastern DRC\u2014Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi\u2014since our  August 2015 report on sexual violence in these areas. During the course  of our review, we contacted researchers we interviewed from our prior  review on sexual violence rates in eastern DRC and adjoining countries.  We also requested information from the United Nations Fund for  Population Activities, the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and the United Nations Children\u2019s  Fund on sexual violence data from the region that became available since  our prior review. In addition, we reviewed relevant reports from the United  Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo. To determine the status of Demographic Health Survey (DHS)  reports for the countries, we reviewed completed reports and  corresponded with officials at ICF International, a firm providing technical  assistance for survey design and implementation.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to August  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Godwin Agbara (Assistant  Director), Jeffrey Baldwin-Bott (Analyst-in-Charge), Debbie Chung, Karen  Deans, Neil Doherty, Justin Fisher, Andrew Kurtzman, Jill Lacey, Grace  Lui, and Jasmine Senior made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
