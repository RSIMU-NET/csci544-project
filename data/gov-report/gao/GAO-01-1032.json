These deficiencies indicated insufficient or ineffective management attention to establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial management operations. The resulting weaknesses exposed the agency to waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Some basic controls were not always clearly and consistently incorporated into NTSB policies and procedures, and, in some cases, the written policies were ambiguous and contributed to possible improper transactions. Furthermore, NTSB's payment review and approval process--the last and best opportunity to detect and address inadequate documentation and other policy violations prior to payment--was often ineffective. Separate reviews of different aspects of NTSB's 1999 and 2000 financial activities and related internal controls, done by PwC at NTSB's request, documented various internal control weaknesses, including problems with the completeness and clarity of policies, the recording and review of transactions, and the tracking and reporting its use of funds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["At the request of the former chairmen of the House Committee on the Budget and the House Task Force on Housing and Infrastructure, we reviewed the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (NTSB) internal controls over selected types of fiscal year 1999 expenditures.

NTSB\u2019s principal responsibility is to promote safety in various modes of transportation through accident investigation, special studies, and recommendations intended to prevent accidents. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, NTSB was appropriated a total of $77 million for salaries and expenses with 421 full-time equivalent employees.", "In April 1989, NTSB began using a Rapidraft system under which designated employees were authorized to use commercial draft payment instruments similar to blank checks. Using Rapidraft, approximately 175 authorized employees could make immediate payment to vendors or reimburse employees for purchases and travel claims up to $2,500. The stated purpose of Rapidraft was to eliminate the extra paperwork and processing time required to issue checks through the traditional Department of the Treasury process. During 1999, NTSB officials began seeing evidence of misuse of Rapidrafts and concern arose about possible embezzlement. In August 1999, NTSB requested the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General (DOT IG) to conduct a review of the Rapidraft system. In September 1999, NTSB stopped using Rapidrafts. The DOT IG audit report, issued in November 1999, disclosed significant internal control weaknesses associated with the use of the Rapidraft system, including the lack of supporting documentation, poor security over unused Rapidraft instruments, and lack of review and reconciliation of processed payments. Concurrent with this review, the suspected fraud by two NTSB employees was investigated and confirmed, ultimately leading to the employees\u2019 successful prosecution.", "In response to the disclosure of internal control weaknesses surrounding its use of the Rapidraft system, NTSB, in April 2000, hired PwC to further review NTSB\u2019s past use of the Rapidraft system and to conduct a broad- based review of NTSB\u2019s current financial management processes and related internal controls. Also in April 2000, the House Committee on the Budget\u2019s Task Force on Housing and Infrastructure held hearings on the widespread internal control weaknesses associated with NTSB\u2019s use of the Rapidraft system and subsequently asked us to review internal controls over other selected areas of NTSB\u2019s financial operation.", "Internal control represents an important and integral part of managing an accountable organization. Internal control   consists of the plans, methods, and procedures designed and implemented by an organization to achieve its mission, goals, and objectives and support performance-based management; represents an organization\u2019s first line of defense in safeguarding assets and protecting against errors and fraud; and   provides management with important assurance that an organization\u2019s operating and administrative objectives are being achieved, namely,   effective and efficient operations,  reliable financial reporting, and   compliance with applicable laws and regulations.", "Since the enactment of FMFIA, executive branch agencies have been required to annually assess the adequacy of their internal controls in achieving established control objectives. As required by the act, the Comptroller General has established standards that agencies must use in assessing their internal control. Also, in accordance with the act and guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, federal agencies are required to annually assess the adequacy of their internal controls and report to the President and the Congress on the extent to which their system of internal control is achieving their intended objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In May 2000, following the House Budget Committee\u2019s Task Force on Housing and Infrastructure hearing on NTSB\u2019s use of the Rapidraft system, the committee asked us to review internal controls related to other types of NTSB financial activities. Following discussions of the potential nature and scope of our review, we agreed with the committee staff that, because PwC\u2019s ongoing review was examining NTSB\u2019s internal controls in place at the time of PwC\u2019s review (April and December 2000), our review would focus on selected aspects of NTSB\u2019s fiscal year 1999 financial operation. We also agreed to monitor and consider PwC\u2019s ongoing work at NTSB in reporting on the adequacy of NTSB\u2019s overall internal controls. Specifically, we agreed to   determine, for selected payment types (travel, products and services, and nonroutine benefits) whether key NTSB internal controls applicable to fiscal year 1999 payments were designed effectively to provide reasonable assurance that assets were safeguarded against unauthorized use and that expenditures were made in accordance with management\u2019s authority and applicable laws and regulations;   determine, for those fiscal year 1999 transactions selected for testing, whether NTSB complied with key controls; and   consider and report on results of two ongoing PwC reviews at NTSB as they related to adequacy of NTSB\u2019s overall internal controls.", "To accomplish these objectives we (1) gained an understanding of applicable policy and related laws and regulations, transaction processing, and supporting documentation, (2) identified key controls related to safeguarding assets and executing expenditures in accordance with management authority and laws and regulations, (3) reviewed, for a targeted selection of transactions from each payment type, the available supporting documentation and, as necessary, followed up with NTSB officials, and (4) concluded on whether key controls were effectively designed and, for those transactions reviewed, effectively implemented by NTSB management and staff.", "To monitor PwC\u2019s ongoing work at NTSB, we discussed the nature, scope, and approach of PwC\u2019s separate reviews with NTSB officials and PwC representatives, examined PwC\u2019s results by reviewing its written reports, and identified those PwC results that, when considered in conjunction with our results, we considered relevant to the overall adequacy of NTSB internal controls.", "We conducted our review from June 2000 through May 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The rule requires the traveler to submit a constructive cost analysis to show that the cost to the government would be the same or less than traveling from the traveler\u2019s official duty station. However, the policy did not clearly establish when and under what circumstances the AHB rule could be applied. Under the Federal Travel Regulation, government travelers are prohibited from using the government travel card and contract airfares for personal travel. Thirty-four of the 103 Board member travel vouchers we reviewed involved the use of their government travel card and contract fares for trips that included, in part, travel to or from their distant place of abode, as permitted by the AHB rule. For 12 of the 34 vouchers involving the AHB rule, we noted that the government travel card and contract fares were used for mixed-purpose trips (partially business and partially personal) or for segments of trips for which no valid business purpose was evident from the supporting documentation available at the time of our review.", "NTSB officials advised us that the rule was not intended to provide for the use of the government travel card and contract airfares for personal commuting between a Board member\u2019s official duty station and his or her place of abode. Rather, the rule was intended to allow a Board member to originate and/or complete official travel at his or her residence instead of his or her official duty station, if doing so did not cost the federal government more. NTSB officials also stated that it was not appropriate to use the government travel card or contract airfare for personal travel.", "NTSB\u2019s policy also provides for the use of annual travel orders, giving staff broad authority for travel related to accident investigations and, for senior management and Board members, authorization to attend conferences and to visit headquarters and field offices. The annual orders provided by NTSB for our review generally authorized the traveler to travel any time during the year without specific authorization of the purpose, destination, or estimated cost of each trip. According to NTSB officials, more than 75 percent of NTSB\u2019s staff had annual orders for fiscal year 1999. While annual travel orders are permitted under the Federal Travel Regulation and their use is justified for those traveling with limited or virtually no advance notice for accident investigations, NTSB\u2019s widespread use of annual orders largely negated the effectiveness of pretravel authorization as a control. In addition, NTSB\u2019s policy on annual travel orders does not ensure that the traveler obtained advance authorization required by the Federal Travel Regulation for certain travel (e.g., travel to attend a conference or involving acceptance of payment for travel expenses from a nonfederal source). This lack of up-front authorization for most travel takes on greater significance at NTSB, as discussed later in this report, because of weaknesses in the review and approval function over travel payments we reviewed.", "According to NTSB officials, 23 of the 25 travelers for whom we examined at least one fiscal year 1999 travel payment had annual orders, but NTSB could provide annual orders for only 13 of the 23 travelers. According to NTSB officials, 142 of the 149 vouchers we examined were authorized by annual orders. Of these 142 reviewed trips, 105 were for non-accident- related travel by 16 travelers. As a result, travel arrangements for those trips, such as the (1) trip\u2019s purpose and destination (including attendance at conferences and foreign travel), (2) itinerary and estimated cost, (3) possible use of indirect or interrupted travel or leave while on travel, and (4) possible acceptance of payment for travel expenses by nonfederal sources, were not reviewed and authorized as part of a trip-specific travel authorization.", "While use of annual orders is permitted by the Federal Travel Regulation, the regulation also requires that \u201copen\u201d authorizations, such as NTSB annual orders, must contain, as a basis for adequate funds control, an up- front estimate of the total costs for travel being authorized. However, NTSB\u2019s policy governing the use of annual orders did not require that the orders include the estimated costs of travel being authorized. Consistent with its policy, none of the 13 annual orders provided by NTSB contained estimates of the costs of travel covered by the annual orders, and the lack of cost estimates severely limited NTSB\u2019s ability to exercise effective funds control over travel authorized by annual orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procurement of Products and Services", "paragraphs": ["NTSB policy governing the purchase of products and services required authorized officials to ensure, prior to incurring an obligation to procure products or services, that (1) funds were available and (2) specific procurement was approved.

As a result, for 21 of the 31 payments we reviewed for products and services that were $2,500 or less, the supporting documentation lacked evidence of one or more of the required advance approvals; 14 had neither evidence of funds-availability approval nor procurement approval, 6 had no evidence of funds- availability approval, and 1 lacked evidence of the advance procurement approval.

The amount owed by the student was limited to the employee\u2019s share of premiums for 12 months because the student became ineligible for the coverage after 12 continuous months in LWOP status. NTSB continued paying for coverage after the student\u2019s eligibility ended, resulting in improper payments of more than $4,800 in health insurance premiums during the student\u2019s remaining 17 months in LWOP status. According to NTSB staff, NTSB had no policies or procedures related to monitoring the status of health insurance premiums paid by NTSB on behalf of student employees in LWOP status; halting premium payments after 12 months in LWOP status; or tracking, controlling, and recovering any related amounts owed to NTSB. According to an NTSB official, the student recently indicated that she was unaware that the benefit coverage continued during her LWOP status and did not use it. NTSB also plans to request a return of premium from the insurance provider for the student\u2019s period of ineligibility.", "Without adequately designed internal controls that are clearly and unambiguously documented in management directives, the effectiveness of the entire control system is impaired and accountability is reduced.

At NTSB\u2019s request, the investigative procedures applied by PwC were designed to identify transactions, from a review of available documentation, that appeared questionable and in need of follow-up by appropriate authorities. PwC\u2019s review methodology was based on an examination of documents retained in NTSB\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate its review, PwC obtained available supporting documentation and had the relevant information entered into an automated database that it analyzed for indications of questionable transactions.

PwC reported that following an agencywide search, in March 2001, NTSB located missing files for 630 of the 688, leaving 58 payment transactions issued by 21 individuals for which no documentation could be located. Accordingly, because PwC\u2019s scope consisted of a review and analysis of supporting documentation available from NTSB, PwC reported that it could not determine the appropriateness of the 58 payments and recommended that NTSB follow up with the employees involved. In addition to the payments with no supporting documentation on file, PwC identified other transactions for which there were gaps in the supporting documentation. PwC reported that, in some of these cases, it was able to reasonably determine the propriety of the payment transactions with the documentation that was available.", "With respect to transactions for which NTSB could not locate some or all of the supporting documentation during PwC\u2019s investigation, PwC recommended that NTSB continue its attempt to locate as many of the missing documents as possible.

PwC\u2019s January 2001 report on the results of its review disclosed a wide range of internal control weaknesses. Specifically, PwC identified weaknesses related to the completeness and clarity of financial policies, recording and reviewing transactions, segregation of duties, and reporting on budget execution. In light of the weaknesses identified, PwC concluded that NTSB is \u201cexposed to significant risk of financial loss.\u201d", "PwC conducted its review by applying the Committee of Sponsoring Organization\u2019s framework for evaluating internal controls, Internal Control\u2013Integrated Framework. Specifically, PwC reviewed NTSB existing policies and procedures, activities and records, interviewed NTSB managers and staff, and reviewed selected transactions. The review, conducted from April through December 2000, covered NTSB financial activities associated with procurements, disbursements, payroll, asset and receipts management, budget planning and execution, and financial reporting and systems.", "In making more that 50 recommendations in response to the control weaknesses identified, PwC noted several cross-cutting themes associated with the need to improve NTSB internal controls, including those noted below.", "Greater Attention to and Awareness of Financial Policies. PwC concluded that NTSB needed to establish policies governing various financial activities including accounting for and controlling fixed assets and various types of receipts owed to NTSB and to update and clarify existing policies including procurement and use of agency credit cards. PwC also noted that once the financial policies are updated and clarified, NTSB staff need training on their application and enforcement. Finally, PwC noted that NTSB management must demonstrate, through review of activities and compliance audits, that the financial policies will be enforced.", "Improved Recording of Transactions. PwC concluded that NTSB needs to record selected transactions when the financial information needed to record and track the transactions becomes known to NTSB. PwC based this conclusion, in part, on the fact that NTSB had not been recording certain types of transactions (including amounts owed by others to NTSB and automatic charges, known as OPAC charges, made by other agencies against NTSB\u2019s funds) until well after the transactions or their underlying economic events have occurred. In addition, PwC noted that NTSB needs to improve controls over the tracking of invoices pending approval and the payment of approved invoices to help ensure that all invoices are paid in a timely manner. Finally, PwC noted that NTSB needs to strengthen procedures to better identify and more timely record the purchase of fixed assets.", "Proper Review of Transactions. PwC concluded that NTSB needs to establish new and strengthen existing processes for managerial review of transactions involving training requests and the use of travel and office purchase cards. Also, controls should be strengthened over the approval of requisitions and the processing of disbursements. PwC observed that a separate review of selected travel vouchers from the first half of fiscal year 2000, conducted at NTSB\u2019s request by another organization, found policy noncompliance on approximately 40 percent of the vouchers reviewed involving 10 percent of the amounts claimed evidencing a serious lack of managerial review, understanding, and enforcement of NTSB\u2019s travel policies.", "Strengthen Segregation of Duties. PwC noted a number of instances in which NTSB needed to take action to address inadequate segregation of key duties and responsibilities. Specifically, PwC\u2019s review found that (1) an individual responsible for controlling access to the personnel system also had the ability to modify payroll time sheets, (2) certain management level staff were able to initiate and approve their own requisitions (up to $10,000) for products and services in the financial management system, and (3) an individual who authorized new purchase (credit) cards and convenience checks also received the new cards and checks when they were issued by the vendor.", "Improved Budget Execution Reporting. PwC concluded that NTSB needs to take a series of actions designed to improve its accounting and reporting on its use of funds (budget execution and reporting). PwC noted that NTSB had not recorded all of its transactions in its accounting system, which contributed, in part, to NTSB\u2019s failure to prepare and submit its budget execution reports as required by OMB. In addition, PwC noted that NTSB did not have the ability to generate comprehensive budget execution data and reports from its automated system, further inhibiting NTSB\u2019s ability to monitor its status of funds.", "In addition to the more than 45 recommendations related to the specific internal control weaknesses they identified, PwC made several important broad-based recommendations for management action. These recommendations were intended to address the need to (1) revise, update, and refocus NTSB policies to ensure that management\u2019s directives are carried out and, once disseminated, that policies are monitored for effectiveness, (2) adequately train and/or reeducate NTSB employees to better appreciate their responsibilities under the policies, (3) hold all employees accountable for failing to follow established controls, and (4) provide visible management leadership and endorsement for establishing internal controls. In making its recommendations, PwC observed that the changes needed in NTSB\u2019s internal control environment will be difficult, given the crisis-driven nature of NTSB\u2019s mission and the erosion of internal controls that has occurred in recent years. PwC further observed that to accomplish this change NTSB\u2019s senior management must set a tone for change\u2014one that recognizes the need for strong controls, supports the changes needed to establish these controls, and demonstrates that all staff will be held accountable for their control responsibilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Legislative Efforts are Geared Towards Strengthening NTSB\u2019s Financial Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000enacted November 1, 2000, includes various provisions designed to strengthen NTSB\u2019s financial accountability.
