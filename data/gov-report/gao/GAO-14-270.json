This report examines (1) trends in the number of and expenditures for self-referred and non-self-referred Medicare PT services and (2) how provision of these services differs among providers on the basis of whether they self-refer. GAO analyzed Medicare Part B claims data from 2004 through 2010 and examined three measures of PT referral for each referring provider: number of PT services referred, number of beneficiaries referred, and number of PT services provided per beneficiary. GAO compared PT referrals for self-referring and non-self-referring providers after accounting for referring provider specialty, Medicare beneficiary practice size, and geographic (urban or rural) location.

During this period, the number of self-referred PT services per 1,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries was generally flat, while non-self-referred PT services grew by about 41 percent. Similarly, the growth rate in expenditures associated with non-self-referred PT services was also higher than for self-referred services.", "The relationship between provider self-referral status and PT referral patterns was mixed and varied on the basis of referring provider specialty, Medicare beneficiary practice size, and geography. GAO examined three measures of PT referral for each referring provider for the three provider specialties that referred nearly 75 percent of PT services in 2010\u2014family practice, internal medicine, and orthopedic surgery.", "The overall relationship between provider referral status and the first measure of PT referrals\u2014the average number of PT services referred per provider\u2014was mixed. GAO found that self-referring family practice and internal medicine providers in urban areas, on average, generally referred more PT services than their non-self-referring counterparts. In contrast, self-referring orthopedic surgeons, on average, generally referred fewer PT services than non-self-referring orthopedic surgeons.", "Self-referring providers in all three specialties that GAO examined generally referred more beneficiaries for PT services, on average, but for fewer PT services per beneficiary compared with non-self-referring providers. For these two measures of PT referrals, differences between self-referring and non-self-referring providers generally persisted after accounting for referring providers' specialty, Medicare beneficiary practice size, and geographic location, although the magnitude of these differences varied on the basis of these factors. For example, the average number of beneficiaries referred by self-referring family practice providers in urban areas was approximately 43 to 87 percent higher than for their non-self-referring counterparts, depending on Medicare practice size. In contrast, beneficiaries referred by self-referring family practice providers in urban areas received 12 to 28 percent fewer PT services, on average, depending on practice size, compared with their non-self-referring counterparts.", "GAO also found that in the year a provider began to self-refer, PT service referrals increased at a higher rate relative to non-self-referring providers of the same specialty. For example, family practice providers that began self-referring in 2009 increased PT referrals 33 percent between 2008 and 2010. In contrast, non-self-referring family practice providers increased their PT service referrals 14 percent during this same period."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Rising Medicare spending for outpatient therapy services, including  physical therapy (PT), has long been an issue. Between 2006 and 2009,  Medicare expenditures for outpatient PT increased by approximately   28 percent, while the national economy grew about 4 percent. In 2011,  Medicare paid about $4.1 billion for outpatient PT services provided to  about 4.3 million Medicare beneficiaries. PT services, such as therapeutic  exercises, are designed to improve mobility, strength, and physical  functioning, and to limit the extent of disability resulting from injury or  disease. An aging U.S. population that remains active later than previous  generations may have contributed to an increase in demand for such  services. However, there is concern that not all PT services may be  medically necessary, and selected legislation has focused on reforming  how the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency  that administers the Medicare program\u2014pays for and manages the  outpatient therapy benefit. For example, under the Balanced Budget Act  of 1997 (BBA), CMS was required to apply per beneficiary financial limits,  known as therapy caps, to help control spending growth and discourage  medically unnecessary use of outpatient therapy services, including PT.  More recently, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012  required CMS to gather information on patient function during the course  of therapy to better understand patient condition and outcomes for  outpatient therapy claims, including PT, beginning January 1, 2013.", "Some policymakers also have expressed concern that some of the  growth in PT may be the result of provider self-referral, which occurs  when providers refer their patients for services delivered by entities\u2014 such as their own solo or group practice\u2014in which they or a member of  their family have a financial relationship. While federal law generally  prohibits self-referral under Medicare, there are exceptions for certain  services and arrangements, including PT. Opponents of self-referral for  PT suggest that financial incentives may lead providers to initiate PT  services more frequently than is necessary, leading to overutilization and  increased Medicare spending. Proponents of PT self-referral suggest that  such arrangements allow providers to improve coordination of care and  provide patients with convenient access to PT services. Some proponents  also have argued that physical therapists practicing independently can  have a financial incentive to recommend additional PT visits and perform  more PT procedures per visit than may be medically necessary.", "We have recently reported on self-referral for advanced imaging,  anatomic pathology, and intensity modulated radiation therapy. We  generally found that providers who self-refer tended to use more of these  health care services, in some cases resulting in additional Medicare  spending. You also asked us to examine provider self-referral for PT  services and Medicare spending for these services. In this report, we  provide information on (1) trends in the number of and expenditures for  self-referred and non-self-referred Medicare PT services from 2004  through 2010 and (2) how provision of these services differs among  providers on the basis of whether they self-refer.", "Medicare data from the Carrier file include data from the CMS-1500, which is the  standard claim form used by noninstitutional providers, such as physicians\u2019 offices and  physical therapists\u2019 private practices, to bill Medicare.

We then performed two  analyses using 100 percent of Medicare Part B claims for PT services  provided in both professional offices and facility settings. For the first  analysis, we compared PT referrals during 2010 by providers who self- referred at least one beneficiary for PT services (\u201cself-referring\u201d providers)  with providers who referred all beneficiaries for PT services to provider(s)  with whom they had no financial relationship (\u201cnon-self-referring\u201d  providers). Because the amount, frequency, and duration of PT services may vary for each beneficiary, we examined three PT referral measures  for each referring provider: total number of PT services referred, total  number of beneficiaries referred, and average number of PT services  received by each beneficiary referred. Differences in these measures of  PT referrals between providers may reflect differences due to self-referral  status, provider characteristics, or beneficiary characteristics. To account  for provider characteristics that may be associated with the amount of PT  referrals, we categorized self-referring and non-self-referring providers  into subgroups of similar specialties, geographic areas (urban/rural  location), and beneficiary practice size (i.e., the number of Medicare FFS  beneficiaries treated in a professional office for any medical condition),  and examined our three PT referral measures for self-referring and non- self-referring providers of each subgroup. We examined PT referral  measures for providers in three specialties that we found referred nearly  75 percent of PT services in 2010\u2014family practice, internal medicine, and  orthopedic surgery. To account for differences in beneficiary  characteristics, we compared selected characteristics of the beneficiaries  referred by self-referring and non-self-referring providers, such as  beneficiary age and disability status.", "For our second analysis, we analyzed the extent to which the total  number of PT services referred changed the year after providers began to  self-refer. Specifically, we identified a group of providers that began to  self-refer PT services in 2009. We then calculated the difference in the  percentage change in the number of PT services referred by two groups  of providers\u2014\u201dswitchers\u201d and non-self-referring providers. Switchers were  non-self-referring during 2008 and self-referring during 2009 and 2010.  Switchers may have begun to self-refer in 2009 by hiring PT provider(s)  or joining a group practice that self-referred. Non-self-referring providers  were providers who were non-self-referring throughout 2008, 2009, and  2010.", "Our study has some limitations. First, we may not have identified all self- referred PT services because CMS uses the referring provider identifier  on PT claims to identify the provider who certified the beneficiary\u2019s plan of  care, and in some cases the referring provider may be different from the  certifying provider. In addition, Medicare claims data do not capture all  financial relationships between performing and referring providers.  Second, we may have understated the occurrence of certain self-referral  arrangements, such as referring physician ownership of hospitals, by  assuming that all PT services referred to facilities were non-self-referred.  Third, our analysis that compares PT diagnostic categories for  beneficiaries referred by self-referring and non-self-referring providers is  based on data that CMS does not use to determine payment for PT  services. Consequently, providers do not have a financial incentive to  accurately report diagnostic data for PT services on Medicare claims.  Finally, it is outside the scope of this report to examine the medical  necessity, clinical appropriateness, or effectiveness of PT services  beneficiaries received.", "We assessed the reliability of the CMS data we used by interviewing  officials responsible for overseeing these data sources, reviewing relevant  documentation, comparing means and frequencies of selected variables  with published data, and examining the data for obvious errors.

Our review indicates  that PT service use and expenditures grew considerably from 2004 to  2010, despite a slight decrease in the total number of FFS beneficiaries  over this period. The primary driver of this growth was growth in non-self- referred services. These results differ from our prior work on self-referral  of other Medicare services\u2014namely, advanced imaging, anatomic  pathology, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy\u2014in which we  reported that self-referred services and expenditures grew faster than  non-self-referred services and expenditures. One potential reason for this  difference is that non-self-referred PT services can be performed by  providers who can directly influence the amount, duration, and frequency  of PT services through the written plan of care required by Medicare. In  contrast, non-self-referred services we examined for our prior work tend  to be performed by providers who have more limited ability to generate  additional services or referrals; for example, radiologists generally do not  have the discretion to order more imaging services or more intense  imaging procedures.", "Regardless, substantial growth in PT services raises concerns about  higher costs for Medicare and beneficiaries.

Better understanding the  differences in referral patterns between self-referring and non-self- referring providers may provide useful information to help manage growth  in PT services.

First, AAOS  noted that self-referring orthopedic surgeons may also refer some  services outside of their practice. Our analyses provided a picture of self- referral at both the service and provider levels. Specifically, for our  analysis of trends between 2004 and 2010 in the utilization of and  expenditures for self-referred and non-self-referred services, we  examined each PT service to determine if it was self-referred or not by  matching the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on the claim with a  crosswalk of the TINs associated with each provider submitting claims.  This method allowed us to examine utilization and spending for each PT  service\u2014self-referred and non-self-referred. For our analysis of self- referring providers, as we note in the draft report, we considered a  provider to be non-self-referring if the provider referred at least one  beneficiary for a PT service in a professional office and did not self-refer  any PT services. Conversely, we considered a provider to be self- referring if the provider self-referred at least one beneficiary for a PT  service that was provided in a professional office during our period of  study. Second, AAOS noted that nine states have changed their laws  governing self-referral to PT services during the study period and that this  may impact our results. We agree that this may impact our results, but  examining state laws governing self-referral were outside the scope of  this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "American College of Physicians", "paragraphs": ["ACP stated that a major conclusion of our report, that the primary driver  of growth in Medicare expenditures and utilization of PT services was due  to non-self-referred PT services, differs from our prior work on self-referral  for advanced imaging, anatomic pathology, and intensity-modulated  radiation therapy services. According to ACP, this finding demonstrates  the complex effects of self-referral on Medicare utilization and  expenditures, which may be influenced by type of service as well as the  other variables outlined in this report, such as provider specialty,  geographic location, and Medicare beneficiary practice size. ACP also  stated that the primary payment model can also affect the relationship  between self-referral, expenditures, and utilization. For example,   and other value- practices that participate in Medicare Shared Savingsbased payment models likely refer in a different manner than those paid  predominantly through the traditional Medicare FFS payment system.  While we agree that different payment models could affect physicians\u2019  referral patterns, such payment models generally had not been  implemented by Medicare at the time of our study. ACP also stated that it  is important to consider the extent to which services are ordered on the  basis of recognized appropriate use criteria. However, using appropriate  use criteria can involve assessing the severity of symptoms in order to  determine the appropriate course of treatment, and data on severity were  not available at the time of our study. ACP believes that self-referral alone  cannot explain expenditure growth differences and that, if utilized  appropriately, self-referral allows for increased quality oversight by  ordering physicians, better care coordination, and the potential for the  provision of lower-cost care compared to alternative settings, such as  hospitals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "American Physical Therapy Association", "paragraphs": ["APTA acknowledged the thoroughness of the draft report and appreciated  our comprehensive analysis. According to APTA, our findings that self- referring providers referred more beneficiaries for PT services, and that  PT referrals for switchers in the three specialties we examined increased  relative to non-self-referring providers, are consistent with other studies  that found that providers have a financial interest to self-refer. However,  APTA also expressed concerns about some of our results. Specifically,  APTA noted that patient condition, physical impairments, and  comorbidities have a major impact on the amount, duration, and  frequency of PT services provided, and without this information it is  difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of self-referral  arrangements on the frequency of PT services. For example, APTA noted  that the frequency of PT use could be attributed to differences in the  complexity of the conditions of patients treated by self-referring compared  with non-self-referring providers. It also expressed concern that the  measures of health status in this report\u2014such as disability status,  average risk score, and Clinical Classification Software (CCS) diagnostic  categories\u2014are limited in their ability to explain differences in PT  frequency. In this report, we state that some of the differences between  self-referring and non-self-referring providers in the number of PT  referrals may be due to differences in the severity or type of medical  conditions of the beneficiaries that they referred for PT treatment. We  also acknowledge that data on the severity of beneficiaries' medical  conditions requiring PT treatment were not available for our study period.  Given the lack of severity data, we examined risk scores, age, and  disability status, and described these measures as \"overall health status  variables,\" and we present data on beneficiary diagnostic categories  without labeling them as measures of severity. We also note that APTA  agreed with our conclusion that data CMS began collecting in 2013 may  help the agency to better assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of  PT treatment for both self-referring and non self-referring providers.", "APTA also expressed concerns that including data on PT referrals to  facilities, such as outpatient hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, may  have affected the results shown in the tables in appendix II of this report,  which compare the distribution of Medicare PT services for self-referring  and non-self-referring providers. According to APTA, our assumption that  all PT services referred to facilities were non-self-referred neglects a  significant portion of self-referral arrangements. APTA also stated that  because patients in facility settings tend to be more medically complex  than patients seen in physician offices, these tables may make an unfair  comparison. As we note in the limitations section of this report, we  acknowledge that we may have understated the occurrence of certain  self-referral arrangements, such as referring physician ownership of  hospitals, by assuming that all PT services referred to facilities were non- self-referred. For example, some providers may have referred  beneficiaries for PT services to hospital(s) in which they had a financial  interest in the entire hospital, and, due to data limitations, we did not  analyze the extent to which this type of referral may have occurred.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

For both  objectives, we used 100 percent of fee-for-service (FFS) claims from the  Medicare Part B Carrier file, which contains final action Medicare Part B  claims for noninstitutional providers, such as physicians. For the second  objective, we also used 100 percent of FFS claims from the Medicare  Outpatient Claims file, which includes final action Medicare Part B claims  for five types of facilities that also provide PT services: outpatient  hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation  facilities, rehabilitation agencies, and home health agencies.", "Each Medicare claim contains data for one or more services for a  particular beneficiary. Each service is identified on a claim by its  Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, which  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) assigns to products,  supplies, and services for billing purposes. To identify all PT services  covered by Medicare, we used outpatient therapy HCPCS codes  published in the Federal Register and in CMS\u2019s Annual Therapy Update  to identify the universe of outpatient therapy HCPCS codes in use from  2004 through 2010. We then used the HCPCS code claim modifier (for  Carrier file claims) and Revenue Center code (for Outpatient file claims)  to distinguish PT services from occupational therapy or speech-language  pathology services. Because there is no indicator or flag on the claim that  identifies whether services were self-referred or non-self-referred, we  developed a claims-based methodology to identify services as either self- referred or non-self-referred. Specifically, we classified services as self- referred if the provider that referred the beneficiary for a PT service and  the provider that performed the PT service were identical or had a   To determine providers\u2019 financial relationships, we  financial relationship.used the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), which is either the Social  Security Number or Employer Identification Number that an individual or  organization uses to report tax information to the Internal Revenue  Service. A TIN could be that of the provider, the provider\u2019s employer, or  another entity to which the provider reassigns payment. There may be  one or multiple TINs for a medical group practice depending on the  organizational structure of the practice. To identify the associated TINs  for the referring and performing providers, we created a crosswalk of the  performing provider\u2019s unique physician identification number, or national  provider identifier (NPI), to the TIN that appeared on the claim and used  that to assign TINs to the referring and performing providers.", "To describe the trends in the number of and expenditures for self-referred  PT services from 2004 through 2010, we used the 100 percent Medicare  Part B Carrier file for each year to calculate utilization and expenditures  for self-referred and non-self-referred PT services. We focused on PT  referrals to professional offices, such as physician offices or PT clinics,  because the financial incentive for providers to self-refer is most direct  when the service is performed in a professional office.

This alternative definition included an additional 49,062  providers in family practice, internal medicine, and orthopedic surgery who referred  beneficiaries for PT services exclusively to facilities during 2010. With this alternative  definition, we computed higher relative rates of self-referral for the average number of  Medicare beneficiary referrals for PT services and for the average number of PT services  provided per beneficiary (except for family practice providers). We decided to use our  original definition of non-self-referring provider because it generally produced more  conservative results. provider location). We identified providers\u2019 specialties on the basis of the  specialties listed on the claims. We report results for three physician  specialties that referred nearly 75 percent of PT services during 2010 that  had a unique referring provider identification number\u2014family practice   (20 percent), internal medicine (26 percent), and orthopedic surgery   (28 percent). We calculated beneficiary practice size by computing the  number of unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries that providers treated in a  professional office in 2010 for any medical condition covered by  Medicare.

The CCS categories group ICD-9-CM  codes into a smaller number of clinically meaningful categories. The CCS  diagnostic categories for PT that we used include Arthritis/Other  Connective Tissue and Joint Disorders, Fractures/Traumatic Joint  Disorders, Neurological, Spine, Sprains/Strains, V codes/Miscellaneous  Rehab, and Other PT diagnoses.", "For the second analysis, we determined the extent to which the number  of PT service referrals made by providers changed after they began to  self-refer. Specifically, we identified a group of providers, whom we called  \u201cswitchers,\u201d that were non-self-referring in 2008 and self-referring in 2009  and 2010. We then calculated the change in the number of PT referrals  made from 2008 (i.e., the year before the switchers began self-referring)  to 2010 (i.e., the year after they began self-referring). We compared the  change in the number of referrals made by these providers to the change  in the number of referrals made over the same time period by providers  who were non-self-referring between 2008 and 2010. Differences in the  average number of PT services referred by non-self-referring providers  between 2008 and 2010 reflect changes during this period that were not  related to self-referral, such as changes in the number of beneficiaries  who needed PT services or changes in the severity or types of the  medical conditions treated with PT. Differences in the average number of  PT services referred by switchers may reflect these changes as well as  changes associated with self-referral. The difference in the percentage  change in the number of PT services referred by switchers and non-self- referring providers is an estimate of the change in providers\u2019 referrals for  PT services that may be associated with self-referral.", "Our study has some limitations. First, we may not have identified all self- referred PT services, because CMS uses the referring provider identifier  on PT claims to identify the provider who certified the beneficiary\u2019s plan of  care, and in some cases the referring provider may be different from the  certifying provider. In addition, Medicare claims data do not capture all  financial relationships between performing and referring providers.  Second, we may have understated the occurrence of certain self-referral  arrangements, such as referring physician ownership of hospitals, by  assuming that all PT services referred to facilities were non-self-referred.  Third, our analysis that compares PT diagnostic categories for  beneficiaries referred by self-referring and non-self-referring providers is  based on data that CMS does not use to determine payment for PT  services. Consequently, providers do not have a financial incentive to  accurately report diagnostic data for PT services on Medicare claims.  Finally, it is outside the scope of this report to examine the medical  necessity, clinical appropriateness, or effectiveness of PT services  beneficiaries received.", "We took several steps to ensure that the data used to produce this report  were sufficiently reliable. Specifically, we assessed the reliability of the  CMS data we used by interviewing officials responsible for overseeing  these data sources, including CMS and Medicare contractor officials. We  also reviewed relevant documentation, compared means and frequencies  of selected variables with published data, and examined the data for  obvious errors, such as missing values and values outside of expected  ranges. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our study, as they are used by the Medicare program as a  record of payments to health care providers.
