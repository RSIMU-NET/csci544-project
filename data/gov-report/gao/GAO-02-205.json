Interviews with IRS officials and an analysis of relevant documentation identified several factors that limited the impact of electronic filing. Specifically, (1) the overall number of individual and business tax returns filed increased, and the resources needed to process that increase partially offset the resources saved by processing more electronic returns; (2) the number of the most costly to process individual income tax returns filed on paper essentially stayed the same; and (3) the number of individual income tax returns filed on paper and received during the peak filing period stayed relatively the same, and peak processing needs drive the resources needed to process individual paper returns. Although electronic filing increased, so did the demands placed on paper processing staff. In particular, (1) processing changes increased the workload for units responsible for reviewing returns for completeness and coding them for entry data, and correcting errors; (2) because most electronic filers still sent a paper signature document to IRS, the work done by paper processing staff was not entirely eliminated when taxpayers filed electronically; and (3) front-line paper processing staff spent increasing amounts of time on activities, including training, not specifically related to processing returns.

IRS estimated that it would need  3,150 more full-time equivalent staff years if none of those returns were  filed electronically. At IRS\u2019 estimate of $36,300 per staff year, that would  be a cost avoidance of $114.3 million. Therefore, if no returns were filed  electronically and using IRS\u2019 estimates, which we did not verify, IRS\u2019 fiscal  year 2002 budget request of $615 million for submission processing would  have increased to about $729 million.

The complexity of a return varies  according to the form on which it is filed. Complexity is determined by the  number of lines of data that need to be entered on a form. According to  IRS submission processing officials, the standard Form 1040 is the most  complex. Complexity then decreases from the Form 1040 to the Form  1040A, and finally to the Form 1040EZ. The more complex a return, the  longer it takes to process and the greater the processing costs. For  example, according to data developed for IRS by a consulting firm for  fiscal year 1999, the average direct labor cost to process a Form 1040 filed  on paper was $1.93 compared to $1.50 to process a paper 1040A and $1.01  to process a paper 1040EZ.", "As shown in table 2, the number of Form 1040s filed on paper only  decreased by about 1 percent from 1997 through 2000, with the only  decrease occurring between 1999 and 2000.

According to the Director of Submission Processing, when  Submission Processing determines its resource needs, the first priority is  the resources (including staff, equipment, and space) needed during the  peak period. The Director added that, all things considered, if the number  of individual paper returns received during the peak period increases  while the total number of paper returns received during the entire year  decreases, the increase during the peak period would have more of an  impact on submission processing resources than would the overall  decrease in paper receipts.", "IRS\u2019 goal of improving business results also directly affects the resources  needed during the peak filing period. To help achieve this goal, in 2000, 85  percent of refund checks for paper returns were to be processed within 40  days.

Other changes stemmed from changes in the tax law that established new  credits and deductions for which IRS had to enter data into its computer  system.", "Although the numbers of additional seconds and keystrokes cited in table  4 for any one change are small, the overall effect of these processing  changes, considering the number of returns involved, is to increase the  number of staff years needed to process returns. For example, the  additional second needed to review and code 41.6 million returns for  secondary Social Security number validation equates to about 11,556  hours or (on the basis of 2,088 hours per staff year) 5.5 staff years.  Similarly, a total of about 584.5 million additional keystrokes would have  had to be made to process the four changes in table 4, which, we roughly  estimated using IRS data on average keystrokes per hour, would consume  at least 78,000 additional hours or 37.4 staff years at a cost of almost $1.4  million.Although these changes in workload may not be of great  magnitude, they required additional resources that offset some of the  potential savings from electronic filing.", "The workload of error correction staff can also be affected by changes in  the accuracy of work done by other processing staff. In that regard, the  accuracy of staff who reviewed and coded tax returns for transcription  increased from 95 percent in 1997 to 96.6 percent in 2000, while the  accuracy of data transcribers decreased from 94.7 percent to 93.9 percent.  We do not know how much, if at all, the volume of error correction work  actually changed as a net result of these increases and decreases in  accuracy.", "The increase in responsibilities can also affect the staff\u2019s productivity.  Using IRS information on average keystrokes per hour for various tax  forms as a measure of data transcribers\u2019 productivity, table 5 shows that  there was a general decline in productivity in 1999, which is when  transcribers began using a new computer system, and a general  improvement in productivity in 2000. For example, IRS data for Other- Than-Full-Paid Form 1040s showed that the average keystrokes per hour  went from 7,503 in 1997 to 7,250 in 1998 and 6,802 in 1999 before rising to  7,108 in 2000.", "Submission Processing officials said that many factors affected accuracy  and productivity and that it would be difficult to determine specifically  what caused them to decrease. However, they believed that the learning  curve associated with using a new computer system in 1999 was probably  the major contributing factor to the decrease in data transcribers\u2019  productivity. They added that there has been high turnover in the  Submission Processing Centers for the past few years due to the  availability of higher paying jobs elsewhere within IRS or in the private  sector. As a result, they have less experienced staff, which may have  contributed to lower accuracy and productivity rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work Done by Paper Processing Staff Not Totally Eliminated by Electronic Filing", "paragraphs": ["During the years covered by our study, electronic filing was not entirely  paperless.

Beginning in 1999, IRS provided two options that could be  used in place of submitting a paper signature document. In 2000, about  6.8 million (or about 19 percent) of the 35.4 million taxpayers who filed  their individual income tax returns electronically used one of those  options. However, that meant that IRS still had to process about 28.6  million paper signature documents.

The  percentage of time spent on these activities grew from 7.8 percent to 9.9  percent. Because IRS records did not separately identify all training  related to processing and nonprocessing activities, it was not possible to  determine the change in the amount of time spent in nonprocessing\u00ad related training.

This was because some units could  absorb these activities by doing less direct work, such as opening fewer  collection cases. Submission Processing, on the other hand, could not  process fewer returns, so any additional required activities meant working  more overtime, keeping seasonal employees longer, or hiring more  employees than originally planned, resulting in an increase in costs.

To achieve that level of electronic  filing, the number of returns filed on paper would have to decrease  significantly from the fiscal year 2000 levels previously described in this  report.
