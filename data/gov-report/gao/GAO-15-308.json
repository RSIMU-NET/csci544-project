Most of the estimated cost decline is due to fewer than expected engineering changes and changes in military construction plans.", "The Air Force delayed the production decision two months, to October 2015, due to wiring problems that Boeing experienced that delayed aircraft delivery and testing. For example, Boeing completed 3.5 hours of flight testing during a single flight of the 767-2C (a precursor to the KC-46 tanker) in 2014, compared to nearly 400 flight test hours it planned to conduct. With program office approval, Boeing restructured its nearly 2,400 development flight test hour plan to focus on demonstrating key KC-46 aerial refueling capabilities required for the production decision. Significantly less testing will now be conducted prior to the decision and only three test months will be on a KC-46, compared to the original plan of 13 months. This testing is intended to demonstrate design maturity and fix design and performance problems before a system enters production. Boeing remains at risk of not being able to demonstrate the aerial refueling capabilities in time to meet the new production decision date due to late parts deliveries, software defects, and flight test cycle assumptions, which could result in additional delays.", "Program officials are gathering manufacturing knowledge to support a production decision, such as determining if suppliers can produce military subsystems in a production environment. However, the program office will have less knowledge about the reliability and performance of the KC-46 than planned because of reduced testing prior to the decision.

The contract is for the design, manufacture,  and delivery of four test aircraft and includes options to manufacture the  remaining 175 aircraft. The contract requires Boeing to deliver 18  operational aircraft by August 2017 and specifies that Boeing must  correct any required deficiencies and bring development and production  aircraft to the final configuration at no additional cost to the government.  The contract limits the government\u2019s financial liability and provides the  contractor incentives to reduce costs in order to earn more profit. Barring  any changes to KC-46 requirements by the Air Force, the contract  specifies a target price of $4.4 billion and a ceiling price of $4.9 billion, at  which point Boeing must assume responsibility for all additional costs. As  of December 2014, Boeing and the program office estimated costs would  be over the ceiling price by about $380 million and $1.4 billion,  respectively.

These  challenges could result in additional schedule delays. The following is a  summary of these development challenges and any steps Boeing is  taking to address them.", "Late delivery of parts for aircraft final assembly: Boeing\u2019s suppliers are  having difficulties delivering several key aerial refueling parts. For  example, the telescope actuator, which extends and retracts the  boom, needs to be redesigned in order to work properly. A redesigned  telescope actuator is tentatively scheduled to be delivered in April  2015, enabling the boom that will be used to support the July/August  2015 demonstration flights to be delivered two weeks prior to its June  2015 need date. In another example, the supplier of the wing aerial  refueling pod and centerline drogue system is experiencing delays in  delivering these subsystems due to design and manufacturing issues  with a number of parts. To stay within schedule targets, Boeing and  the supplier have developed a plan to complete parts qualification  testing and safety of flight testing in parallel. Program officials have  said that one of the risks of this parallel approach is that discoveries  during safety of flight testing could drive design changes that would  then require qualification testing to be re-done. Boeing has sent  engineers and other staff to help the aerial refueling suppliers  overcome these challenges, and held regular management meetings  to stay abreast of the latest developments.", "Defects in delivered software: Boeing and the program office consider  the resolution of software problems as one of the program\u2019s top risks.  According to program documentation, open problem reports may have  peaked in December 2014, at roughly 780 priority problem reports.  Boeing fixed 170 of these problems over the past few months. As of  March 2015, however, a little over 600 problem reports were still not  resolved, including several hundred that must be addressed prior to  the KC-46 first flight, currently planned for June 2015. Many of these  problems are related to the military subsystems and either adversely  affect the accomplishment of an essential operational or test capability  or increase the project\u2019s technical, cost, or schedule risk\u2014and no  workaround solution is known. Additional problems may be identified  as Boeing integrates the last two software modules related to aerial  refueling. Boeing expects to fully integrate these software modules in  April 2015, about 10 months later than originally planned.", "Flight test cycle time assumptions: The program may not be able to  meet the established timeframes, or cycle times for flight testing. Both  Boeing and the program office regard maintaining the planned flight  test rate of 65 hours per month for the 767-2C aircraft and 50 hours  per month for the KC-46 aircraft\u2019s military tests as one of the  program\u2019s greatest risks. DOD test organizations have shown that the  planned military flight test rate is more aggressive than other  programs have demonstrated historically. The Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation also reported that the test schedule  does not include sufficient time to address deficiencies discovered  during tests. Despite these concerns, Boeing predicts that it can  achieve the flight test rates as it has local maintenance and  engineering support and control over the flight test priorities as testing  is being conducted at Boeing facilities. Deviations from its proposed  flight test cycle times could pose risk to the program\u2019s ability to  capture the knowledge necessary to hold the low-rate production  decision in October 2015.", "Boeing provided an updated schedule to the program office in January  2015 that may address some of the risks we highlighted. As part of the  updated test plan, the program office and Boeing also revised their  approach to conducting operational test and receiver aircraft certification.  The new approach re-phases some receiver aircraft certification and  shifts test execution responsibility for 10 receiver aircraft from Boeing to  the government. This approach may result in adding additional risk to the  program should the Air Force fail to complete the testing on time. The  new schedule and associated contract modifications are expected to be  approved by early 2015.

They have  identified these processes and completed two prior rounds of  assessments in support of the preliminary and critical design reviews.  Currently, they are assessing nine critical manufacturing processes for  low-rate production, such as the assembly and installation of aerial  refueling components. Six of the assessments have been completed,  including the assembly and test of the wing aerial refueling pod and  centerline drogue system that had been delayed over four months. As  mentioned previously, the supplier has had difficulty delivering these  subsystems on time due to design and manufacturing issues with a  number of parts. The program did not identify any action items for two of  the completed assessments. For the other four, Boeing must undertake  several actions, including developing a plan on how it would qualify and  deliver key parts on time, such as the telescope actuator and the refueling  receptacle panel. The remaining three assessments are expected to be  completed in early summer 2015. The results were not available for us to  analyze during this review.", "Set reliability growth plan and goals: The program office has established  a reliability growth curve and goal. To assess reliability growth, the  program is tracking the mean time between unscheduled maintenance  events due to equipment failure, which is defined as the total flight hours  divided by the total number of incidents requiring unscheduled  maintenance. These failures are caused by a manufacturing or design  defect and require the use of Air Force resources, such as spare parts or  manpower, in order to fix them. The program has set a reliability goal of  2.83 flight hours between unscheduled maintenance events and expects  to be at 2 hours at the start of initial operational test and evaluation. Since  the first flight dates have slipped on all four development aircraft, the  program will likely have less reliability knowledge than planned prior to its  low-rate production decision.", "Conduct failure modes and effects analysis: Boeing has completed the  initial failure modes and effects analysis that covers 41 subsystems and  plans to update it as flight testing is conducted. Boeing and the program  office rely on this analysis to determine which subsystems on the aircraft  are likely to fail, when and why they fail, and whether those subsystems\u2019  failures might threaten the aircraft\u2019s safety.", "Conduct reliability growth testing: Boeing has taken steps to improve the  aircraft\u2019s reliability, but is behind in its reliability growth efforts because of  delays to the start of development flight testing. Boeing is currently testing  prototypes of critical parts, uncovering failures, and incorporating design  changes or manufacturing process improvements. For example, program  officials told us that Boeing has initiated testing in its labs and facilities  and its subcontractors\u2019 equipment must pass specific test procedures to  be considered acceptable. Boeing conducted the 767-2C first flight at the  end of December 2014, which will allow the program to begin tracking the  aircraft\u2019s reliability against the growth curve (i.e., in terms of mean time  between unscheduled maintenance). However, this was almost seven  months later than planned. Detecting reliability problems early lessens the  impact on the development and production programs. In addition, if  problems are not detected until after an aircraft has been fielded, it could  result in a reduction in mission readiness and higher than expected  operations and sustainment costs because the aircraft have to be fixed.", "Determine processes in control and capable: The program has started  activities to determine whether manufacturing processes are in control  and capable of producing parts consistently with few defects. The  program\u2019s review of critical manufacturing processes for the military  unique subsystems involves evaluating several risk areas, including  whether processes are in control and capable. Program officials said that  they plan on verifying that military subsystem suppliers have procedures  in place to collect process control data prior to the low-rate production  decision. They told us they do not plan on analyzing that data, but will rely  on Boeing for process control management.", "Test a production-representative prototype in its intended environment:  The program has not begun testing a production-representative KC-46  tanker in its intended environment. As discussed previously, the program  planned to have 13 months of flight testing between two fully configured  KC-46 tankers by the low-rate production decision. Due to program  delays, it is likely to complete only three months of flight testing on one  fully configured KC-46 tanker prior to this decision.

The small schedule margin that was built into the program has  eroded, largely due to problems Boeing experienced while wiring the  aircraft. Only one flight test has been conducted to date on a 767-2C  aircraft. No flight testing has been conducted on a KC-46 tanker. The  flight test pace it now hopes to achieve to support the low-rate production  decision is in jeopardy because of late deliveries of key aerial refueling  parts, a large number of software defects that need to be corrected, and  optimistic flight test cycle assumptions. Although Boeing should bear the  costs of any design or manufacturing problems that may occur, the  department must be careful not to hold the low-rate production decision  and award a production contract before it has adequate knowledge that  the KC-46 can perform its aerial refueling mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given that the KC-46 program has encountered significant delays to the  start of development test and the schedule moving forward remains risky,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Air Force to  ensure that key aerial refueling capabilities are demonstrated prior to the  low-rate production decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force provided us with written comments on a draft of this report,  which are reprinted in appendix II.
