To effectively institutionalize and implement change, best practices show that a comprehensive analytical framework provides useful information to decision makers. However, the Navy has not established such an analytical framework--consisting of formal measurable goals, objectives, and metrics--that could be used to assess the feasibility of various rotational crewing options and determine their impact on operational requirements, ship condition, and crew morale. Further, the Navy has not systematically collected or developed accurate cost data to perform complete cost-effective analyses. Absent such information, the Navy may not know the full impact of rotating crews on surface ships, the extent to which the various options should be implemented, or whether it is getting maximum return on investment. Because rotating crews on surface ships is evolving as an alternative, the Navy has not provided effective guidance when implementing the practice and has not systematically leveraged lessons learned. Effective guidance and sharing of lessons learned are key tools used to institutionalize change and facilitate efficient operations. While the Navy has well-established crew rotation policies and procedures for ballistic missile submarines that include appropriately documenting a ship's condition and turnover procedures for accountability, it has not provided comparable guidance to surface ships. As a result, the Navy unnecessarily risks repeating mistakes that could decrease warfighting effectiveness and crew morale. Furthermore, the impact of ship maintenance on the implementation of rotational crewing has not been fully assessed. Effective maintenance strategies help ensure ships can perform their missions without adverse impacts on crew morale. It is a challenge to ensure the mission capability of ships that are deployed for longer periods because most maintenance and repair is usually completed between 6-month deployments. While rotating crews has enabled the Navy to keep ships deployed for up to 24 months, the service has not fully examined all issues related to the best maintenance strategies that could affect a ship's condition and crew's morale. Absent effective strategies, the Navy risks degrading long-term ship condition and discouraging crew support for rotational crewing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s fleet of surface ships represents a significant capital  investment to provide the forward presence desired. The Navy is also  facing an affordability challenge as it invests in new ships, supports a high  pace of operations, and manages rising personnel costs. The Navy has  traditionally maintained overseas presence by using standard deployments  whereby individual ships and their permanently assigned crews are  deployed for approximately 6 months out of a 27-month cycle that  includes time for training and ship maintenance. Rotating crews aboard  ships so that the ships can remain deployed for a longer period is one of  many alternatives the Navy could pursue to increase the utilization or the  operational on-station days, or both, of Navy ships. Recently, senior Navy  officials have also cited crew rotations as one of the ways to partially  mitigate the need for a larger force structure and free billions of dollars for  higher priority areas, such as the capabilities needed to operate from the  sea when the United States is denied access to bases and ports abroad. As  such, it is prudent for the Navy to employ its ships in a manner that  maximizes its return on investment.", "The Navy has rotated crews on ships in several ways, although its use of  this practice is not widespread and is still evolving. On its Ohio-class  Trident ballistic missile submarines, the Navy has used a \u201cBlue-Gold\u201d crew  concept since the 1960s, whereby two complete crews are assigned to a  single hull and rotate deployments. In the 1990s, the Navy\u2019s Mine Warfare  Command used a concept whereby four crews rotated among three ships  throughout the deployment cycle. More recently, the U.S. Pacific Fleet has  been demonstrating the ability to rotate crews on some of its destroyers as  part of a \u201cSea Swap\u201d demonstration project. Under this concept, there are  the same numbers of crews as ships, but the crews rotate for 6 months to  those ships that are forward deployed for extended periods of 18 months  or more. The Navy is also using this concept on its patrol coastal ships  operating in the Persian Gulf and the Blue-Gold concept to support the  high speed vessel experimental ship, the HSV-2 Swift.", "We prepared this report under our oversight authority and are providing it  to you because of your oversight on defense issues. Recognizing the  Navy\u2019s need to explore ways for improving the use of its surface ships and  its plan for employing rotational crews on several types of surface ships in  the current and planned force (appendix I provides a description of all  ships included in our evaluation), this report addresses the following  questions: (1) Has the Navy systematically evaluated the feasibility,  including the cost-effectiveness, of rotational crewing concepts for  existing and future classes of surface ships? (2) Have the Navy\u2019s  experiences with rotational crewing been effectively implemented?  (3) How does ship maintenance affect implementation of rotational  crewing?", "To assess whether the Navy has systematically evaluated the feasibility  and cost-effectiveness of rotational crewing concepts for existing and  future classes of surface ships, we reviewed rotational crewing studies  performed by and for the Navy, including a recent study by the Center for  Naval Analyses; compiled and analyzed sailor reenlistment data;  interviewed Department of Defense (DOD) and Navy Headquarters and  fleet officials; met with cost analysis experts in the government and the  private sector; and reviewed key acquisition documents and crew  employment plans. To assess whether the Navy has effectively  implemented rotational crewing on surface ships and leveraged lessons  learned, we conducted over 40 focus group meetings with rotational  crews; interviewed Pacific and Atlantic Fleet officials responsible for  personnel, operations, maintenance, and training; and reviewed Navy  Lessons Learned System instructions and queried the system to determine  relevant lessons recorded. We used the strategic ballistic submarine  community as a best practice based on its long-standing successful use of  rotational crewing. To assess how maintenance on ships homeported in  the United States might be affected by extended deployments, we  reviewed ship maintenance directives and instructions, reviewed ship  maintenance reports, and conducted focus group meetings with the three  crews on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers involved with the Sea Swap  destroyer demonstration project and several crews that had rotated on  patrol coastal ships.", "While we did not validate the maintenance reports and sailor reenlistment  data used in this report, we discussed the data with DOD officials to  determine that the data were sufficiently reliable for our analysis. We did  validate the Navy Lessons Learned System data and determined the data  were sufficiently reliable for our analysis.

Within a year, an operational studies group within the Office  of the Chief of Naval Operations noted that the need for alternative  crewing approaches might be necessary to sustain the pace of global  operations, especially in the global war on terrorism.", "More recently, senior Navy officials have warned that budgets will remain  tight. In June 2004, the Secretary of the Navy stated that DOD will have  less money for recapitalization because the defense budget will not  continue growing at the rates it has in recent years.

The  result is that a ship homeported in the United States and deploying to the  Persian Gulf area for 6 months will normally spend less than 20 percent of  its time in theater and that the Navy would need about 6 ships to maintain  a continuous presence in the region over a 2-year period.", "As part of the transformation efforts to increase the fleet\u2019s operational  readiness and responsiveness, the Navy recently implemented a new  operational strategy\u2014called the Fleet Response Plan\u2014that changes the  manner in which it maintains, trains, mans, and deploys its ships. The  overall objective of the plan is to create a more responsive force by  sustaining a more level balance of training between deployments, instead  of dropping to minimum rates of readiness upon return from deployment  and then gradually rebuilding its state of readiness throughout a 12-month  training cycle that follows major maintenance of the vessel. The plan also  modifies long-standing forward presence policy of predictable, 6-month  deployments to predetermined regions. This flexible deployment concept  allows units that have attained high readiness to embark on deployments  of varied duration\u2014but still generally no longer than 6 months\u2014in  support of specific national priorities, such as homeland defense,  multinational exercises, security cooperation events, deterrent operations,  or prosecution of the global war on terrorism.

Each of these options can be implemented in varying ways and may have  different advantages and disadvantages, but the Navy\u2019s actual experience  with nonstandard crewing concepts on surface ships is limited.", "Standard crew deployments use one crew per ship. Most of the  crewmembers are assigned to the ship for 4 years, and it is common for  crewmembers to deploy overseas on the same ship more than once.  Standard ship deployments occur once every 27 months for a period of  6 months of which the ship and the crew are on-station for 3 to 4 months,  depending upon whether the ship deploys from the east or west coast of  the United States. Most Navy ships and their crews employ the standard  crew deployment option.", "The Sea Swap option uses the same number of crews as ships. Notionally  under this option, one of the ships deploys two, three, or four times longer  than the standard time by rotating crews every 6 months at an overseas  location. Ideally, all of the Sea Swap ships share an identical configuration,  so crew performance and capability are not degraded because of ship  differences. Because crews do not return to the ships on which they  trained, under a four-ship Sea Swap option, some crews could serve on  three different ships in just over 6 months and be expected to demonstrate  combat proficiency on each one. A limited number of destroyers and  patrol coastal ships have employed the Sea Swap option in recent years.", "The Horizon option involves one or two more crews than hulls, such as  four crews for three ships or five crews for three ships. Crews serve for no  more than 6 months on ships that are deployed for 18 months or more.  Under a three-ship Horizon option, crews could serve on at least two ships  in just over 6 months and be expected to demonstrate combat proficiency  on each one. In addition, each crew would be without a ship for a period  of time and stay ashore at a readiness, or training, center. This crewing  option was employed on mine countermeasure ships during the 1990s.", "The Blue-Gold option assigns two complete crews, designated \u201cBlue\u201d and  \u201cGold,\u201d to a single ship. Most of the crewmembers are assigned to a ship  for several years, and it is common for them to deploy overseas on the  same ship more than once. Crew deployments would not exceed 6 months  and are often of much shorter duration. An advantage with this option  includes the crews\u2019 familiarity with the ship. However, a disadvantage is  that the proficiency can degrade since crews sometimes do not have a ship  on which to train and must rely on mock-ups and simulators. The Blue- Gold option has been employed by the strategic submarine force and the  HSV-2 Swift.", "Partial or Graduated Crew Swapping  Partial crew swapping has been employed on a limited basis. The most  notable use of this option involved the exchange of crewmembers  between a ship based in Japan with a ship based in the United States in  1999.

Top Navy officials, including the Chief of Naval  Operations, believe that increased efficiencies from rotating crews enable  the Navy to perform the same number of missions with fewer ships or to  increase the number of missions with the same force size.

Both  Pacific Fleet and Surface Force Command officials identified reenlistment  data as a key indicator of whether crews are satisfied with rotations. The  Center\u2019s survey and our analysis showed that negative morale associated  with participating in Sea Swap had an adverse impact on reenlistment  rates. The Center\u2019s conclusion was based on a series of crew surveys.  According to the Center,    55 percent of the crew said after the deployment that they thought that  Sea Swap would make them less likely to stay in the Navy, versus  39 percent before the deployment, and    73 percent stated that if all deployments were like Sea Swap, they would  be less likely to stay in the Navy.", "Our analysis of overall reenlistment data for sailors with less than 6 years  of active service indicated that the crews on all three Arleigh Burke-class  destroyers involved in the Sea Swap demonstration experienced  50 percent reenlistment rates. These rates were below the Navy-wide  reenlistment goal of 56 percent for this group and the actual 64 percent  reenlistment rate for non-Sea Swap Arleigh Burke-class destroyers based  in the Pacific Fleet. Because the first-term reenlistment rates for the three  Sea Swap destroyer crews were as low as 23 to 37 percent during their  Sea Swap cycle, these ships were among the few that did not meet the  Navy-wide reenlistment goal.

The Navy testified to the  Senate Committee on Armed Services in March 2002 that it would  determine the true cost and potential savings of one rotational crewing  option, Sea Swap, to provide a firm analytical basis in order to decide  whether to expand use of that option or look for other alternatives.  Recently, the Commander, Naval Surface Force, initiated a limited effort  to collect and model costs. However, to date, data collection and analyses  comparing the cost of all the crew rotation options have not been  completed. Cost-effectiveness is a method used by organizations seeking  to gain the best value for their money and to achieve operational  requirements while balancing costs, schedules, performance, and risks.  The best value is often not readily apparent and requires an analysis to  maximize value. A cost-effectiveness analysis is used where benefits  cannot be expressed in monetary terms but, rather, in \u201cunits of benefit,\u201d  for example, days of forward presence. Such an analysis would be of  particular importance when making return on investment decisions about  how many ships to buy and how to operate them.", "Moreover, officials in DOD\u2019s Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation  told us that they have not conducted a basic cost-effectiveness analysis of  rotational crewing alternatives.

The Naval Cost Analysis Division cited DOD cost analysis  guidance and procedures that would be applicable to a cost-effectiveness  study of rotational crewing alternatives. According to Division officials,  this guidance is to be used as the basis for preparing program life-cycle  cost estimates, and provides information on the scope of the cost analysis,  the procedures, and the presentation of the estimates. Division officials  also told us they have not participated in any rotational crewing  cost-effectiveness studies nor are they aware of any. Officials in both DOD  and Navy offices indicated that the cost analyses for crew rotation  alternatives should include the development of a cost structure for  identifying all the relevant cost elements in the program, including depot  level maintenance, fuel, training, infrastructure costs, and other costs  unique to the program.", "While Surface Force Pacific officials had developed limited information on  costs and savings unique to the Sea Swap destroyers, it was not complete,  and they have not developed comparable data for the patrol coastal ships  and the HSV-2 Swift. Examples of information collected included the  estimated fuel savings from ship transits that were not needed;  transportation, room and board for flying the crews to turnover cities; and  special training. These officials told us that they plan to collect additional  data to help evaluate Sea Swap costs, but that they are still determining  what cost data should be collected and how to establish a baseline for  control group comparison purposes. Furthermore, they told us that  collection of the data will be challenging because there is no central  database or automated system for coding rotational crewing-related  expenses that could be used for documenting the unique costs associated  with rotational crewing. The officials were also concerned that Navy  management and accounting data systems are not integrated, making it  difficult to collect complete and actual cost information that could be  helpful in identifying the costs of the Sea Swap initiative.", "Surface Force Pacific officials have also determined that they have  responsibility for assessing the costs of crew rotation in the patrol coastal  ships as well, but they had not been doing so. Amphibious Group Two  officials told us in October 2003 that they have not systematically  evaluated costs and are not aware of any cost-effectiveness analyses of  rotational crewing being conducted.

Surface Force Pacific officials said that this model is also used to  present similar data for the future littoral combat ship. However, we were  informed that much of the data used in the model is based on estimates  rather than actual costs and that some costs integral to evaluating  rotational crewing options, such as maintenance and training  infrastructure, were not included.

The turnover process  takes place over 2 to 3 days, during which the on-coming crewmembers  from each department and division meet with their off-going counterparts  to review detailed turnover checklists that cover issues such as personnel,  training, administration, maintenance logs, classified material, ship  operational funds, parts, and food supplies. For example, both crews  review the status of preventative and corrective maintenance repairs that  are recorded in equipment status logs, which help document the material  condition of the ship. This information is passed from one crew to another  during turnover to maintain continuity of maintenance. Both crews also  review an inventory of provisions, medicines, hazardous material, and  information technology equipment. Crewmembers from both crews are  required to sign the checklists, and the two ship commanders are  ultimately responsible for ensuring accountability of the material  condition of the ship.

In response, the strategic submarine force has developed a  training program to maintain crew proficiency in core competencies while  ashore. This program is designed to update crews on recent procedural  changes, allow crews to perform maintenance operations, and refresh  personnel who have been away from their duties for several months.  Crews receive classroom instruction and maintain their skills in simulators  at the Trident Training Facility. Crews are monitored and evaluated  through graded individual and group exercises. Officers and crewmembers  stated that they generally received adequate and sufficient training at the  training facility to perform their mission.

The concept consists of crews working together to conduct maintenance  repairs and incremental maintenance that is planned or unplanned  corrective maintenance during an in-port maintenance period.", "The submarine community has formal guidance for the in-port  maintenance period during which both crews jointly conduct maintenance  repairs. One main purpose is to enhance the efficiency and productivity  of the maintenance period. During this time, both crews operate under one  chain of command; the off-going crew reports directly to the on-coming  ship commander. Once the submarine is at sea, the off-crew works with  the maintenance facility and the on-crew to develop a work package of  needed preventive and corrective maintenance repairs. As a result, during  the next in-port maintenance period the crew that has just taken command  knows what to expect. Officers and crewmembers in our focus groups  stated that this approach was key to completing required maintenance  repairs in a short period. It also helps ensure that items that may not have  been captured during turnover are identified according to officers on one  submarine. In addition, crews stated that this concept decreases the  incentives for pushing off work to the other crew because both crews  conduct the needed maintenance repairs.", "The incremental maintenance plan involves routine maintenance based on  a set schedule common to all submarines and corrective repairs, which  include those items that break or are in a degraded condition as a result of  operations.

As part of the  Sea Swap demonstration project, the Commander, Naval Surface Force,  sought to address differences in ship design, construction, and  modernization between forward-deployed and nondeployed ships by  providing crews with predeployment training specific to the forward- deployed ship they would join. The Command planned for the training to  account for many of the differences between the destroyers, with  emphasis on training systems and equipment on the forward-deployed  ship, and set-up training classes in the United States and Sea Swap cities.  For example, one on-coming crew received training to ensure its  proficiency in areas such as critical weapons systems and engineering  prior to the ship\u2019s turnover. Amphibious Group Two also provided training  to patrol coastal ship crews to help them bridge the engineering  differences they would face on the deployed ship.", "However, in our focus group discussions, ship crews participating in  Sea Swap and on the patrol coastal ships cited concerns about the  adequacy of this training. The crewmembers indicated that proficiency  improved with practice drills, but sufficient proficiency was not achieved  prior to deploying, even though they had received their certifications. The  delay in achieving proficiency was accentuated for the crew that swapped  in the Persian Gulf because the crewmembers did not have the  opportunity during a transit to become familiar with their new ship. For  example, crewmembers for one ship stated that they only received partial  training for operating a new radio that is necessary for conducting strike  operations. This partial training degraded the crew\u2019s ability to shoot  Tomahawk land attack missiles. Crewmembers also stated that they did  not receive training to operate damage control radios, which meant the  crew would have been unable to use the radios in an emergency.", "Patrol coastal ship crewmembers also indicated that they faced challenges  in training to operate the deployed ship\u2019s different equipment. For  example, crewmembers stated they did not receive weapons training for  Stinger missiles prior to overseas deployment because these weapons  systems are not typically used while on deployment in the United States.  Patrol coastal ship focus group comments revealed that the crews  compensated for training deficiencies with self-initiated training during  deployment. These crews also received some training from the Coast  Guard while in theater.

The use  of an advanced turnover team was an effort to expedite the turnover  process from one crew to another. A Command official cited the work  performed by these teams as instrumental in reducing the amount of time  required for the turnover as well as for increasing their familiarity with the  new ship. However, crewmembers in our focus groups stated that advance  teams were not as effective as they could have been in some turnovers  because they were denied access to areas and equipment in the ship at the  time of turnovers. For example, a regional support office assumed control  of a Sea Swap destroyer in the United States, locked up the workspaces,  and did not grant the advance team access.

A full assessment of maintenance issues on all ships employing  this practice would be important in identifying and addressing possible  impediments to effectively implementing rotational crewing. Navy  destroyers and patrol coastal ships using rotational crews on extended  deployments have faced maintenance challenges to ensure the mission  capability of ships while overseas. To help minimize the adverse effects on  the material condition of forward-deployed Sea Swap destroyers, the Navy  expanded the scope of predeployment maintenance and sent maintenance  support representatives in theater to provide additional technical support  to crews. Despite concluding that the condition of the returning ship,  U.S.S.

However,  ships employing rotational crews on extended deployments do not return  to the United States for periods of 12 or more months, so crews must  maintain ship capability while deployed in compliance with law and Navy  guidance on overseas maintenance (see appendix III for details on Navy  guidance).", "According to the Center, each Sea Swap destroyer received more  maintenance support and more intensive support than typically received  by ships on routine deployments. This support included numerous  predeployment inspections and maintenance on their power, electrical,  steering, combat, and other systems to eliminate many potential required  maintenance activities during deployment. For example, the  predeployment maintenance on one of the Sea Swap ships, the  U.S.S. Fletcher, began with the identification of all time-driven  maintenance requirements that were scheduled during the extended  deployment. Examples included calibration, assessments, and inspections  of equipment to renew time-driven certifications. (Such actions are  comparable to checking a car\u2019s timing belt or inspecting brakes and tires  before taking a long trip.) Numerous other inspections were also  conducted prior to deployment on selected ship systems and equipment to  identify and repair problems and ensure the good working order of the  ship. The U.S.S.

The  teams also assisted the crews while the destroyers were in port at the  crew turnover city and were comprised of senior-level maintainers capable  of performing a variety of maintenance jobs at the ship\u2019s organizational  and intermediate levels. According to Navy maintenance officials, the  team\u2019s presence during transit from the theater of operations to the  Sea Swap city and in port facilitated the completion of preventative  maintenance, particularly repairs associated with ship habitability.

Patrol coastal port engineers and maintenance support teams  checked key systems\u2014such as engines, weapons packages, and the  bridge\u2014to hedge against wear and tear the ship would experience on an  extended deployment. However, unlike the Sea Swap destroyers,  U.S. Naval Forces Central Command officials indicated that patrol coastal  ships were not given preferential treatment to support maintenance. The  patrol coastal ship community deployed a maintenance support team with  the crews in an effort to address overseas maintenance needs, however,  these teams are not unique to rotational crewing and typically support any  patrol coastal ship deployment. The team consisted of five members  located in theater who performed limited maintenance, ordered and stored  parts, and provided administrative support. The scope of the maintenance  performed by the teams was limited to organizational, intermediate, and  select depot-level maintenance.", "According to focus groups with patrol coastal ship crews, the maintenance  support teams were usually the only personnel in theater capable of  rectifying frequently occurring maintenance problems. If a maintenance  support team was not available, the crew had to contact a technical  support representative in the United States for assistance or try to conduct  the maintenance itself. Some patrol coastal ship crewmembers indicated  that the size of the maintenance support teams was insufficient to support  both patrol coastal ships on extended deployments and suggested  expanding the maintenance support teams to be comparable to the system  used by the Coast Guard. According to patrol coastal ship crews, the Coast  Guard had four ships similar to the patrol coastal ships in theater and  provided approximately 50 maintenance personnel to perform the same  function as the patrol coastal maintenance support team. The increased  size of the Coast Guard\u2019s maintenance support allowed its crews to stand  down and live in barracks during maintenance periods. By contrast, a  patrol coastal officer noted that, during maintenance availabilities,  maintenance support teams only assisted the crew and did not take over  the work effort and the crews remained on board throughout the repair  process and performed maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Full Impact of Navy Maintenance Strategy for Destroyers and Other Ships Using Crew Rotations Is Not Clear", "paragraphs": ["The results of the different maintenance strategies used to sustain the  two destroyers that were apart of the Sea Swap demonstration project and  other ships using rotational crewing are uncertain. While the Center  judged that the condition of the U.S.S. Higgins was comparable to another  ship that had recently returned from a routine 6-month deployment, others  in the Navy disagreed based on inspection results. We did not identify any  similar effort to determine the impact on the patrol coastal or other ships  that would provide the Navy with additional insights into the impact of the  extended deployment on their condition.", "The Center\u2019s judgment was based in part on a total ship readiness  assessment conducted by Pacific Fleet maintenance personnel, in which  Surface Force Pacific officials judged the U.S.S. Higgins\u2019 ship material  condition after a 17-month deployment to be comparable to the  U.S.S. Decatur\u2019s. However, officials from the Fleet Technical Support  Center Pacific that performed the assessment thought there were some  significant differences in the condition between the two ships. These  officials found that the U.S.S. Higgins had 697 noted deficiencies out of  3,370 items tested (21 percent), whereas the U.S.S. Decatur had 465 out of  3,231 items tested (14 percent). While the number of deficiencies alone  does not necessarily indicate the significant material differences between  the ships, some of the items deficient on the U.S.S. Higgins included data  links for controlling operations between a ship and an aircraft and another  was the nonoperational extra high frequency communication system on  the U.S.S. Higgins that was operational on the U.S.S. Decatur.", "Fleet Technical Support Center Pacific officials also assessed the  operational functionality of each ship\u2019s equipment and found that the  U.S.S. Higgins was not as capable. This assessment measured the  equipment operational capability of each ship in order to quantitatively  determine whether the ship\u2019s systems were performing in accordance  with Navy requirements. The assessment results showed that the  U.S.S. Higgins received an overall score of .70, while the U.S.S. Decatur  received a score of .85. According to the Navy handbook, an equipment  operational capability score of 1.0 indicates the equipment is fully capable  of performing its function as designed, while a score of 0 indicates the  equipment is totally unable to perform its function as designed. The  handbook provides that any score between .70 and .80 indicates ship  equipment is unable to obtain optimum operational standards, while  scores above .80 indicate ship equipment passes all operational tests.", "A further breakdown of the scores indicates the U.S.S. Higgins may have  had problems that were more serious. The .70 score for the U.S.S. Higgins  was arrived at by assessing two categories of equipment: the combat  system-related equipment and the hull, mechanical, and electrical  systems-related equipment. The combat system-related equipment score  for the U.S.S. Higgins was .77, while the U.S.S. Decatur received a score  of .83. Since the combat system portion of the score was higher than the  total for the U.S.S. Higgins, the hull, mechanical, and electrical equipment  score was at a minimum below .70. According to the handbook, scores  above .50 and below .70 indicate that equipment has significantly reduced  output or restricted operability. By contrast, we found that the hull  mechanical and electrical equipment score for the U.S.S. Decatur was at  least .85, given an overall score of .85 and a combat system score of .83,  which indicated that equipment was fully operable.", "Even though it concluded that the U.S.S. Higgins\u2019 condition was  comparable, the Center recognized the importance of maintenance to the  success of rotational crewing and proposed the Navy further assess  maintenance responsibilities, relationships, and costs. Specifically, the  Center suggested that if Sea Swap becomes a more standard practice,  \u201cit will be necessary to conduct a holistic review of the overall  maintenance process, including technical services and training.\u201d This  review would assess the responsibilities and interrelationships among the  many players, such as the ship\u2019s force, ship repair units, port engineers,  and ship engineering maintenance teams. In addition, the Center added  that the Navy should conduct a careful assessment to determine which  maintenance support aspects are essential costs and which are  dispensable. As of July 2004, the Navy had not started such an assessment.", "We found that the experience of other ships on extended deployments,  such as patrol coastal ships, bore out the need for such an analysis.  Patrol coastal ships did not receive focused maintenance comparable to  Sea Swap destroyers, and ship officials identified several maintenance  problems aboard one or more ships (see table 3) that were not corrected  while deployed that could have affected their mission capability.", "Patrol coastal ships on extended deployments did not have extra  in-theater maintenance support comparable to Sea Swap destroyers. For  instance, patrol coastal ships did not have ship engineering maintenance  teams to aid the crew in achieving maintenance. As a result, according to  the maintenance support team coordinator for patrol coastal ships,  routine continuous maintenance often could not be accomplished and,  subsequently, the overall material condition of patrol coastal ships  deployed overseas slowly degraded. The official explained that repairs  authorized overseas are very narrow in scope and only cover maintenance  absolutely necessary for the ship to conduct its mission. As a result, the  official commented that organizational- and intermediate-level planned  maintenance and preservation work are left to the crew and deployed  maintenance support teams to take on over short periods in port, typically  5 days or less. In addition, according to a patrol coastal ship port engineer,  each forward-deployed patrol coastal ship had received about 4 weeks of  maintenance in port over the last 18 months and added that this level of  maintenance does not equal what a traditionally deployed patrol coastal  would receive. Port engineers and other maintenance staff noted  challenges in keeping the patrol coastal ships operationally ready. For  instance, in our focus group discussions with patrol coastal ship crews,  they explained that the ship\u2019s rotating crane that launches and retrieves  the ship\u2019s rigid inflatable boats broke down during a patrol and the ship  had to rely upon the Coast Guard to help with its repair. A Navy official  also explained that the extendedly deployed patrol coastal ships have a  very high operational tempo, which also impacts the ability of the ship\u2019s  force to conduct organizational maintenance and increases the overall  degradation of the ship over time. The official stated that onboard  maintenance efforts have been able to keep the patrol coastal ships  running, but that the Navy will pay a heavy price once the ships return to  homeport for extensive overhauls, since repairs that are more serious will  be necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Challenge of Maintaining Ships on Extended Deployment Contributed to Crew Morale and Quality-of-Life Problems", "paragraphs": ["The Center and we found that crews expressed concern about the extra  workload they endured to maintain high ship readiness. Specifically, the  Center concluded that while the Sea Swap demonstration showed a  benefit for the Navy\u2014saving dollars and increasing forward presence\u2014  many sailors spoke of the burdens and loss of traditions. According to the  Center, Sea Swap crews performed more work and experienced fewer  benefits and traditions than what may have originally drawn them to the  Navy. For instance, the Center\u2019s report noted that some Sea Swap  crewmembers found that the maintenance workload was high throughout  the entire deployment. Other complaints were that whenever the Sea Swap  ships pulled into an Arabian Gulf port, other ships\u2019 sailors left on liberty  while the Sea Swap crews remained on board doing maintenance. This  intense maintenance schedule was a morale problem and a frequent topic  that arose during the Center\u2019s crew interviews.", "Our focus groups with Sea Swap destroyer crews identified similar  concerns. For instance, extra maintenance work related to painting and  preserving the ship was left to the ship\u2019s crew to accomplish. In addition,  Sea Swap officers in our focus groups indicated that unreported work and  high workloads disrupted sailor quality of life and that there was no  increase in time or resources to get maintenance done. They also told us  that more equipment inspections by in-theater support teams were needed  while in port. The officers explained that the ship\u2019s crew had to inspect  and fix different equipment throughout the ship because in-theater support  teams were not available. According to the Sea Swap officers and crew,  this affected their quality of life since liberty time was reduced to  accommodate ship maintenance needs.", "Our focus groups with patrol coastal ship rotational crews also indicated  that increased maintenance tasks and workloads adversely affected crew  morale and quality of life. Patrol coastal ship senior chiefs told us that  rotational crews had difficulty meeting ship preservation requirements,  loading supplies, and documenting ship maintenance logs for non-working  items during port visits of 5 days or less. In addition, crewmembers on  each rotational patrol coastal ship complained that they received no  liberty ports; that all port visits became working ports due to the ship\u2019s  maintenance needs; and that, given the small size of the ships, they needed  time away from other crewmembers to decompress.

Successfully overcoming issues that could  impede using this alternative and to gain support for implementing this  change require knowledge of the various rotational options and their  impact on operational requirements, ship condition, and crew morale.  However, the Navy has not taken several key steps that could help it better  plan, manage, and monitor the implementation of this crewing approach  and therefore may not realize its full potential. For example, the Navy has  not established the analytical framework to evaluate all rotational crewing  options and related costs. In the absence of formal measurable goals,  objectives, and metrics for assessing feasibility, cost, and other factors,  including crew quality of life, the Navy does not have clear criteria for  deciding when to use rotational crewing and which option best fits the  situation. Furthermore, until the Navy more systematically collects data on  current and potential surface ship rotational crewing options, including  complete and accurate cost data for cost-effectiveness analyses, it will  lack valuable information for making informed decisions about the  potential for applying rotational crewing to current and future ships as  well as whether it can get maximum return on investment and  offset billions of dollars in future total ownership costs.", "The Navy\u2019s implementation of crew rotations also lacks effective guidance  to ensure oversight and accountability. For example, the Navy does not  provide guidance that specifies standard policies and procedures for  rotating crews to ensure consistent management of and accountability for  ship operations during crew rotations. Until it does, crews may continue to  have problems consistently documenting ship condition and accounting  for ship inventories during ship turnover, which could lead to additional  work burdens on the on-coming crew and potentially affect readiness.  Furthermore, without more formal guidance built on systematically  collected, recorded, and disseminated lessons learned from all rotational  experiences that specify standard policies and procedures, the Navy may  repeat mistakes.", "Finally, the Navy does not know enough about the implications of  maintenance on ships using rotational crews as a means to extend their  deployments. The Center for Naval Analyses noted in its report on the  Sea Swap demonstration that if that option is to become a more standard  practice, the Navy needs to further review the overall maintenance  process. However, until the Navy fully assesses the additional  maintenance demands and related crew quality-of-life issues experienced  by all ships implementing this crewing approach, and evaluates alternative  maintenance strategies, it runs the risk that it will degrade the long-term  condition of ships and discourage crew support for rotational crewing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the nation\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment in Navy ships  yields the greatest possible benefits at the lowest possible total cost, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy  to take the following four actions:    Systematically evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness for current  and potential application of several rotational crewing alternatives for its  surface forces by    establishing formal measurable goals, objectives, and metrics for  assessing feasibility, costs, and other factors, including crew quality of  life, and    systematically collecting and developing complete and accurate cost  data, including ship total ownership costs, in order to perform accurate  cost-effectiveness analyses.", "Provide guidance that specifies standard policies and procedures for  rotating crews to ensure consistent management of and accountability for  ship operations during the rotation.", "Systematically collect, record, and disseminate lessons learned pertaining  to rotational crewing in the Navy Lessons Learned System to enhance  knowledge sharing.", "Conduct a study of the maintenance processes used for all ships involved  in rotating crews and examine, as part of the study, opportunities to  mitigate the crews\u2019 concerns about maintenance workload to improve  their quality of life."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with the  recommendations and cited actions it will take to implement the  recommendations.", "DOD\u2019s comments are presented in their entirety in appendix IV.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, and the  Director, Office of Management and Budget.

The guide helped the moderator address several topics related to  crew rotations: training, maintenance, infrastructure and operations,  management and oversight, readiness, crew characteristics, quality of life,  lessons learned, and overall satisfaction with the rotational crewing  experience. Each focus group discussion began with the moderator  describing the purpose of our study and explaining how focus groups  work. Participants were assured anonymity of their responses, in that  names would not be directly linked to their responses in write-ups of the  sessions and that all of the responses for the session would be  summarized. The participants were then asked open-ended questions  about the impact of crew rotations on each of the topics.

Agreement regarding each placement was reached between at least two  analysts. All initial disagreements regarding placement into categories  were discussed and reconciled.

First, they represent the responses of Navy  ship officers and enlisted personnel from more than 40 selected groups.  Second, while the composition of the groups was designed to assure a  distribution of Navy officers, enlisted personnel, seniority, and ship  departments, the groups were not randomly sampled. Third, participants  were asked questions about their specific experiences with crew rotations.  The experiences of other Navy ship officers and personnel involved in  crew rotations, who did not participate in our focus group, may have  varied.", "Because of these limitations, we did not rely entirely on focus groups, but  rather used several different methodologies to corroborate and support  our conclusions to objectives two and three."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Summary List of Department of the Navy Guidance Implementing 10 U.S.C. 7310", "paragraphs": ["Department of the Navy guidance related to the implementation of  Title 10, United States Code, section 7310(a) restrictions on overseas  maintenance, or that define terms used in the law, is noted below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Chief of Naval Operations", "paragraphs": ["Chief of Naval Operations Instruction 4700.7K (July 2003), \u201cMaintenance  Policy for U.S. Navy Ships,\u201d defines voyage repairs as \u201ccorrective  maintenance of mission- or safety-essential items necessary for a ship to  deploy or to continue on its deployment.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Naval Sea Systems Command", "paragraphs": ["Naval Sea Systems Command Fleet Modernization Program Management  and Operations Manual (June 2002, Rev. 2), SL720-AA-MAN-010,  Glossary, defines voyage repairs as \u201cemergency work necessary to repair  damage sustained by a ship to enable the ship to continue on its mission  and which can be accomplished without requiring a change in the ship\u2019s  operating schedule or the general streaming notice in effect.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Sealift Command", "paragraphs": ["Commander Military Sealift Command Instruction 4700.15A  (February 2, 2000), \u201cAccomplishing Ship Repair in Foreign Shipyards,\u201d  states that voyage repairs include    corrective maintenance on mission or safety essential items necessary for  a ship to deploy, to continue on its deployment, or comply with regulatory  requirements;    scheduled maintenance, only to the extent that said maintenance is  absolutely necessary to ensure machinery and equipment operational  reliability or comply with regulatory requirements; and    voyage repairs do not include corrective maintenance actions that may be  deferred until the next scheduled regular overhaul and drydocking  availability in the United States or Guam without degrading operational  readiness, habitability standards, or personnel safety, or adversely  impacting regulatory compliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Defense\u2019s letter  dated October 25, 2004.  1.
