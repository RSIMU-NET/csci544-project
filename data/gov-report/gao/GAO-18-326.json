GAO's objectives, among others, were to (1) assess DOD's policies for managing and overseeing MAIS programs and (2) describe the extent to which selected MAIS programs have changed their planned cost and schedule estimates and met technical performance goals. To address these objectives, GAO compared DOD's policies for managing and overseeing all 34 MAIS programs (24 non-business programs and 10 business programs) to leading IT management practices. GAO also compared 15 selected programs' initial cost, schedule, and performance baselines to their current acquisition program estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The strength of Department of Defense's (DOD) policies for managing and overseeing major automated information system (MAIS) programs varies.

However, the department directed those programs to use a policy for the management and oversight of MAIS business programs that was not fully comprehensive. Until DOD updates its business systems policy to address gaps in establishing performance information such as baseline estimates on program cost and schedule goals, identifying thresholds to identify high risk, and requiring periodic reports to be provided to stakeholders at regular intervals, stakeholders will likely not have all the information they need to manage and oversee MAIS business programs.", "While all 15 business and non-business MAIS programs had either increased or decreased their planned cost estimates and the majority had delays in their planned schedule estimates, the majority of the 9 programs that had performance targets met those performance goals. Specifically, the decreases and increases in cost estimates ranged from a decrease of $1.6 billion (-41 percent) to an increase of $1.5 billion (163 percent). The decreases in planned cost were largely due to scope reduction, while cost increases were due to underestimating levels of effort and contracting issues. The slippages in schedule estimates ranged from a delay of 5 years to 5 months; these delays were caused by unrealistic expectations or unplanned changes. Six of the 9 programs that had performance targets met all of them, while the other 3 met several but not all of their performance targets. The other 6 programs were in the early stages of system development and had not begun performance testing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that DOD update its policy for managing MAIS business programs to include baseline estimates.

In this regard, according to DOD\u2019s IT investment portfolio for  fiscal year 2017, the department spent approximately $33.4 billion for IT  investments. Of this amount, approximately $2.5 billion was spent on  major automated information system (MAIS) programs, which include  business and non-business information systems that help the department  sustain its key operations in communications and command and control,  and provide it with access to information to organize, plan, and monitor  mission operations.", "A DOD IT investment that falls within one of the following categories is  designated as a MAIS program when: (1) program costs in any single  year exceed $40 million, (2) total program acquisition costs exceed $165  million, or (3) total life-cycle costs exceed $520 million.

From this list, we identified those MAIS programs based on our  criteria that programs must be unclassified and have a first acquisition  program baseline that could be used as a reference point for evaluating  cost, schedule, and technical performance characteristics. Based on  these criteria, we selected 15 of the 34 MAIS programs for our review.", "We then compared each program\u2019s cost (in then-year dollars) and  schedule estimates established in the first acquisition baseline to the  latest total life-cycle cost and schedule estimates.

Specifically, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment stated that  regarding establishing baselines, the DOD Instruction 5000.75 requires  establishment of cost, schedule, and performance parameters for each  release before development or delivery. The 5000.75 also requires  consideration of program progress against baselined cost, schedule, and  performance as a criterion at the limited deployment and full deployment  decision points. A baseline requirement thus exists in DOD Instruction  5000.75 but it is not described as an acquisition program baseline, which  may be familiar to readers of DOD Instruction 5000.02. However, the  Under Secretary added that the Army\u2019s implementation guidance includes  guidance that states each increment must have an acquisition program  baseline with its own set of threshold and objective values set by the  user.", "While we agree that the existing policy requires such parameters to be  captured and included in the department\u2019s decision making process, we  found the policy to be vague in its discussion of these parameters and to  not clearly define what a baseline is, or which baselines are to be used or  reported for comparison purposes. For example, the policy does not  make a distinction between the initial acquisition program baseline,  current baseline, and baseline deviations. Yet, such information is  important because it provides a basis for decision makers to identify the  extent to which a program may have deviated from its initial cost,  schedule, or technical performance baseline. By making these  distinctions in the policy, the department\u2019s policy for its MAIS business  programs will be more consistent with its other policy for non-business  MAIS programs with regard to the way an acquisition program baseline is  defined and the elements that should be captured and reported to its  decision makers. In turn, the program managers who prepare these  reports and the decision makers who rely on them will have information  that is consistently and succinctly prepared for making credible decisions.", "Regarding adding provisions in its policy for the establishment of  predetermined thresholds, the Under Secretary stated that the 5000.75  states that the milestone decision authority is responsible for delivery  within cost, schedule, and performance parameters, and the milestone  decision authority is to do this by establishing oversight controls for  programs, including procedures to report and address variances. The  Under Secretary added that the 5000.75 does not suggest the practice of  establishing a predetermined threshold for the variance, and DOD will  consider the addition of this feature to the 5000.75 update.", "Finally, regarding providing periodic annual and quarterly reports to the  department\u2019s leadership, the Under Secretary stated that such a periodic  report would add value only if there had been no recent communication of  program status from the program office to the leadership or stakeholders  communities. While such communication is expected to occur frequently,  its regularity is not specified in current policy or guidance. The Under  Secretary stated that DOD will consider adding a provision for a report to  leadership and functional stakeholder if such communication has not  occurred within the past 3 or 4 months.", "DOD concurred with the second and third recommendations related to the  department\u2019s implementation of selected IT management practices.  Regarding the second recommendation, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition and Sustainment agreed to direct the Defense Healthcare  Management System Modernization program manager to update and  approve the requirements management plan, identify and document  changes to the requirements baseline, and quantify the costs and benefits  in the risk mitigation plans. Further, regarding the third recommendation,  the Secretary of the Navy agreed to direct the program manager to  identify and document all potential external environmental issues that  could negatively affect work efforts for the Navy\u2019s Consolidated Afloat  Networks and Enterprise Services program.
