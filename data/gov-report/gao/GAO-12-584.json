Veterans diagnosed with  ESRD must receive dialysis treatments for the rest of their lives unless  they receive a kidney transplant. These treatments are time intensive for  veterans and relatively expensive for VA. Dialysis typically requires  veterans to undergo three outpatient treatments per week that each last  about 4 hours. Due to VA\u2019s limited dialysis capacity in its own facilities,  VA most commonly provides these dialysis treatments to veterans by  referring them to non-VA outpatient dialysis clinics in their local  communities through VA\u2019s fee basis program. In fiscal year 2011, VA  referred about 9,600 veterans to fee basis providers for dialysis  treatments at a cost of about $314 million, up from about 6,900 veterans  at a cost of about $133 million in fiscal year 2008.", "To help address these rising costs, VA began developing its Dialysis Pilot  in 2009.

This workgroup identified several options VA could take to build its  internal capacity to provide dialysis treatments to veterans and identified  several ways VA could address the rising costs of dialysis care provided  through the fee basis program, including (1) building dialysis units in  leased space in communities surrounding select VAMCs, (2) purchasing  modular dialysis units, (3) modifying existing space in selected VAMCs to  expand or build dialysis units, and (4) negotiating pricing agreements with  select dialysis providers to allow VAMCs to pay a lower rate for fee basis  dialysis treatments.", "In March 2010, after discussing these options and exploring potential  solutions, the Dialysis Workgroup began designing the Dialysis Pilot as  an effort to build VA\u2019s capacity to provide dialysis treatments to veterans  in VA-operated facilities and reduce fee basis costs.

However, this potential  performance metric may be limited by VA\u2019s failure to maintain control  over the cost estimation model or provide sufficient guidance to pilot  locations about how to properly use it.", "Because VA has not yet developed an evaluation plan or formally defined  performance measures for pilot locations, it does not have access to  consistent and reliable information on the performance of the pilot  locations and may not have this information accessible when it is time to  either make midcourse corrections for the Dialysis Pilot or decide whether  and how to open additional VA-operated outpatient dialysis clinics.", "Step 3\u2014Using performance as a basis for decision making. Despite  not having fully developed performance measures for assessing the pilot  locations, VA has already begun planning for the expansion of the  Dialysis Pilot, which should not occur until after VA has defined clear  performance measures for the existing pilot locations and evaluated their  success. Specifically, a member of the VHA Dialysis Steering Committee  told us that the committee has already developed a limited plan for  expansion of the Dialysis Pilot. However, this plan does not incorporate  the results of a performance assessment for the existing four pilot  locations. In addition, VA systems redesign engineers have begun  developing three additional cost estimation models despite not having  fully evaluated the effectiveness of the cost estimation model used in the  Dialysis Pilot. Taken together, these two actions indicate that VA is  beginning to make decisions about the future of the Dialysis Pilot and the  cost estimation model, even though VA decision makers currently lack  critical performance information on the existing four pilot locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To its credit, VA developed the Dialysis Pilot as a potential way of  addressing the rising cost and utilization of fee basis dialysis treatments  among veterans. Through the Dialysis Pilot, VA intends to test the viability  of increasing its capacity to provide dialysis treatments in VA-operated  outpatient dialysis clinics. VA set four goals for its Dialysis Pilot:   (1) improve quality of care, (2) increase access for veterans, (3) provide  additional dialysis research opportunities, and (4) achieve cost savings for  VA-funded dialysis treatments. While these are commendable goals,  there were weaknesses in VA\u2019s planning and early implementation of the  Dialysis Pilot that if not corrected, will make it difficult to determine  whether the Dialysis Pilot has met its goals and will provide cost-effective  care if expanded. Specifically, VA did not conduct a transparent and well- documented pilot location selection process, provide clear and timely  guidance to participating VISNs and VAMCs on key financial aspects of  the Dialysis Pilot, or articulate clear performance measures for pilot  locations. We believe that VA can rectify these weaknesses, but must act  prior to full implementation of the four pilot locations to ensure that the  Dialysis Pilot is not compromised and can serve as an effective  demonstration effort. Moreover, until VA has reliable data, we believe it  would be unwise for VA to expand the Dialysis Pilot beyond the current  four pilot locations, as doing so may risk investing resources  inappropriately.", "Moving forward, we believe four critical areas should be addressed. First,  VA must clearly document the selection process it used to identify the  existing four pilot locations and may use to identify any future pilot  locations. VA relied on a decentralized and ad hoc selection process to  choose the existing four pilot locations and failed to properly document  the results of this key decision-making effort. Such inattention to  documenting critical decisions results in a lack of transparency and  weakens the credibility of the Dialysis Pilot.", "Second, VA needs to ensure that changes to its cost estimation model  are reviewed by knowledgeable staff. This step is necessary to ensure  that this model produces comparable data for all pilot locations that can  serve as an accurate basis for evaluating the financial success of the  Dialysis Pilot. To date, pilot locations altered existing formulas and model  assumptions, which resulted in cost estimation data with questionable  reliability that may limit VA\u2019s ability to compare results consistently across  the pilot locations.", "Third, VISN and VAMC officials need specific guidance for the repayment  of Dialysis Pilot start-up funds and the calculation of cost savings realized  from the pilot locations. To date, VA Central Office has not articulated its  expectations regarding these two critical aspects of the Dialysis Pilot.  Without a clear understanding of the terms for start-up fund repayment, it  is difficult for VA or external entities to determine if the four pilot locations  are making significant progress toward repaying these funds and  generating cost savings that can be used to offset the cost of treating the  projected increased number of veterans who will need dialysis treatment  in the coming years.", "Finally, VA must develop clear and measurable performance criteria that  can be consistently applied to evaluate the Dialysis Pilot. Despite defining  the mission and goals for the Dialysis Pilot, VA has not developed a plan  for evaluating its success or developed performance measures to track  pilot locations\u2019 progress toward meeting its stated mission and goals. An  effective evaluation plan and clear performance measures are needed to  help ensure that the Dialysis Pilot operates in an environment of  accountability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to increase VA\u2019s attention to planning, implementation and  performance measurement of the Dialysis Pilot we are making five  recommendations.", "To improve VA\u2019s communication related to the Dialysis Pilot, we  recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Health to ensure that key decisions made regarding pilot  location selection and efforts to continue or expand the Dialysis Pilot are  clearly documented.", "To ensure that reasonable cost estimates are created for the Dialysis  Pilot and other similar programs, we recommend that the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to restrict or  evaluate changes made to cost estimation models at the VISN and VAMC  levels that affect pilot development and analysis.", "To ensure that start-up funds are repaid and cost savings are accurately  calculated for the Dialysis Pilot, we recommend that the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to develop written  guidance about expectations for the repayment of start-up funds and how  the cost savings generated by the four pilot locations should be  calculated.", "To ensure that VA Central Office effectively evaluates the Dialysis Pilot,  we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take the following two actions:", "Develop an evaluation plan that outlines how the Dialysis Pilot will be  assessed and provides target dates for the completion of this  assessment.", "Develop clear measures for assessing the performance of the four  Dialysis Pilot locations in key areas\u2014including quality, access, and  cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["VA provided written comments on a draft of this report, which we have  reprinted in appendix II.

In addition, VA  stated that it is in the process of developing longer-range plans for the  expansion of dialysis services, including establishing additional  freestanding outpatient dialysis clinics similar to the current four pilot  locations.

According to  VA, this plan will ensure better communication and documentation of  decisions for future pilot site selections; more rigorous oversight of cost  estimation tools and analysis of financial and clinical outcomes; and a  thorough analysis of start-up fund repayment, including whether VA will  reverse its decision to require repayment of these funds.
