These consultations are a step in implementing the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA or Results Act) whose purpose is to reduce the cost and improve the performance of the federal government.", "Mr. Chairman, you asked that we provide analyses and observations about the agencies\u2019 draft strategic plans, including the strengths and weaknesses of each plan, the extent to which the agencies are experiencing particular challenges that face regulatory agencies in their attempts to measure performance, and any suggestions we might have for improvements in these draft plans before they are finalized and submitted to Congress in September.", "As its title indicates, the Results Act\u2019s focus is on results. In crafting the Act, Congress recognized that congressional and executive branch decisionmaking had been severely handicapped in many agencies by the absence of the basic underpinnings of well-managed organizations. These agencies lacked clear missions; results-oriented performance goals; well-conceived agency strategies to meet those goals; and accurate, reliable, and timely program performance and cost information to measure progress in achieving program results. In recent years, Congress has established a statutory framework for addressing these long-standing challenges and for helping Congress and the executive branch make the difficult trade-offs that are necessary for effective policymaking.Improving management in the federal sector will not be easy, but the Results Act can assist in accomplishing this task. period of 1997 through 2002. The Results Act requires agencies to consult with Congress and solicit the input of others as they develop these strategic plans.", "Beginning with fiscal year 1999, executive agencies are then to use their strategic plans to prepare annual performance plans. These performance plans are to include annual goals linked to the activities displayed in budget presentations as well as to the indicators the agency will use to measure performance against the results-oriented goals. Agencies are subsequently to report each year on the extent to which these goals were met, provide an explanation if these goals were not met, and present the actions needed to meet any unmet goals.", "Congress can use the Results Act to provide the vital information that it needs to better make decisions. The congressional consultations on agencies\u2019 strategic plans provide an important opportunity for Congress and the executive branch to work together to ensure that agencies\u2019 missions are focused, goals are results-oriented and clearly established, and strategies and funding expectations are appropriate and reasonable.", "One of the reasons we are here today is to provide our perspective on these plans. We note that, although these strategic plans are not due until September, each agency we reviewed had prepared a draft plan. Overall, we found that each agency had made an effort to adhere to the Results Act, and we recognize that agency officials are still in the process of updating and revising the draft plans. addressed major management challenges and included indications of interagency coordination.", "On the basis of our review of the draft plans, we found that each plan contained most of the components required by the Results Act. Three of the draft plans had all six components, and two draft plans had five of the components. In general, the draft plans reflected the statutory authorities and responsibilities of the federal regulators with respect to the institutions and matters within their jurisdictions. On the whole, the draft plans showed little evidence of interagency coordination.", "Our analysis of individual plan components showed that the draft plans had mission statements that broadly defined the purpose of the agency and goals and objectives that were somewhat results-oriented and appropriate to the agency\u2019s mission. The content of other components varied across agencies. For example, some agencies had useful discussions of approaches and strategies to achieve the goals and objectives, while others could have benefitted from more discussion of the resources needed. Each agency discussed key external factors but only one discussed how those factors would affect the achievement of its goals. None of the plans discussed how the external factors would be addressed.", "In general, two sections were most in need of improvement. Each agency could strengthen its section on the relationship between strategic and annual goals by explicitly discussing the link between these two types of goals. Also, each agency could improve its section on how program evaluations were used and a schedule for future evaluations. Due to the complex set of factors that determine regulatory outcomes, measuring the impact of a regulatory agency\u2019s programs will be a difficult challenge going forward. However, the use of program evaluations both to derive results-oriented goals and to measure the extent those goals are achieved is a key part of the process. components, we used our May 1997 guidance for congressional review of the plans as a tool. To determine whether the draft plan contained information on interagency coordination and addressed management problems we had previously identified, we relied on our general knowledge of each agency\u2019s operations and programs and the results of our previous work.", "The requirements of the Results Act and OMB guidance indicate that the following factors should be addressed within the six components of strategic plans: (1) The comprehensive mission statement should be brief and define the basic purpose of the agency and focus on core programs and activities. (2) The description of general goals and objectives should contain general goals and objectives for the major functions and operations of the agency, elaborate on how the agency is carrying out its mission, contain a number of outcome-type goals, and be stated in a manner that allows a future assessment to be made on whether the goals are being achieved. (3) The description of how the general goals and objectives will be achieved is to include discussion of operational processes, staff skills, and technologies as well as the human, capital, information, and other resources that are needed to achieve the goals and objectives and outline how the agency will communicate strategic goals throughout the organization and hold managers and staff accountable for achieving these goals. (4) A strategic plan is to describe how the performance goals included in the agency\u2019s annual performance plans are related to the goals and objectives in its strategic plan. (5) A strategic plan is to identify and discuss key factors external to the agency and beyond its control, which could occur during the time periods covered by the plan and significantly affect the agency\u2019s achievement of its strategic goals. The plan is to briefly describe each key external factor, indicate its link with a particular strategic goal or goals, and describe how the factor could affect the achievement of the goals.

Because these issues are significant and likely to affect each of the agencies to some extent, their strategic plans could be more useful to the agencies, Congress, and other stakeholders if these challenges were more fully discussed in the plans. The issues include electronic innovation, new approaches to supervisory oversight, pending legislation on financial modernization, and consolidation in the financial services industry.", "For example, electronic innovation, both in the way transactions are conducted and in the way information is transmitted, represents a regulatory challenge for all five regulators. The regulators have generally adopted a wait-and-see approach to this policy because they do not want to interfere with the pace or determine the direction of change. However, deciding if and when this policy should be altered and how regulation might be applied to electronic \u201cbanking\u201d represents a major challenge. adding an additional risk factor and increasing the emphasis on the quality of risk management.", "Another issue facing all three bank regulators and OTS is the potential impact of legislation currently being considered to modernize the financial services industry. Provisions currently being considered by Congress could have far-ranging impact on each of the regulators. For example, the elimination of the federal thrift charter and merger of OTS with OCC could affect all three bank regulators and OTS in terms of (1) workload, if thrifts are allowed to choose between a federal or state charter, and (2) supervisory focus, if the balance sheet structure of thrifts remains different from that of banks.", "Ongoing financial consolidation, in part related to interstate banking and branching could also have important implications for the structure of the bank regulators. Each of these regulators has traditionally had a regional structure that has more or less evolved over time. As more and more banks become multiregional or even national institutions, the old regional structure may become less relevant and a fundamental shift in geographical focus may be in order. OCC has recently announced a reorganization, which is at least partially due to the anticipated effects of interstate banking.", "The Federal Reserve System, due to its broader mandate and unique structure, faces its own set of challenges. For example, an increased use of electronic payments in services provided to the Department of the Treasury and other agencies may result in realignments or reductions in certain staff at particular reserve banks. These and other challenges may, in turn, raise questions about the structure of the Federal Reserve System, such as the size, number, and location of the Federal Reserve banks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Faced by Other Regulatory Agencies Also Apply to Depository Institution Regulators", "paragraphs": ["In enacting the Results Act, Congress realized that the transition to results-oriented management would not be easy. The difficulties in moving to results orientation could be especially difficult for a regulatory agency. We analyzed a set of barriers facing certain regulatory agencies in their efforts to implement the Results Act in a June 1997 report. These barriers included the following: (1) problems collecting performance data, (2) complexity of interactions and lack of federal control over outcomes, and (3) results realized only over long time frames.", "At least to some extent, each of these barriers is also applicable to federal regulators of depository institutions. For example, in focusing on the safety and soundness of depository institutions any measure (such as the average capital to risk-based asset ratio or the number of failed institutions) would be largely determined by overall economic conditions, rather than any particular regulatory intervention strategy. Finding approaches that could effectively disentangle regulatory intervention from the myriad of other forces influencing outcomes represents a difficult challenge for all of these agencies as they pursue results-oriented measurement.", "Long time lags between actions and possible results could also be an issue for regulators of depository institutions. Historically, there has been a considerable time lag between the time that a financial institution makes a questionable underwriting decision and the time that a loan goes bad and finally affects earnings and eventually bank capital, thereby potentially threatening the institution\u2019s existence. Effective intervention by a regulator may also not show a result, at least not by many standard measures, for an extended period. This argues for constructing sophisticated measures that can account for long time lags and that are evaluated over a period longer than a year.", "Mr. Chairman, one of the most difficult challenges facing these agencies, as implementation of the Results Act proceeds, will be separating a program\u2019s impact on the agency\u2019s objectives from the impact of external factors that are often outside the program or agency\u2019s control. Although developing performance measures or evaluating program impact is difficult in these situations, it is important that agencies make efforts toward that end. We note that all the agencies\u2019 plans we reviewed had one section that consistently was in need of development: the discussion of how program evaluations were used to establish goals and how such evaluations might be used in the future. a potential source for researching and developing innovative methods for measuring results. Any new methods or research approaches developed by one agency could also be useful to others because, at least in the areas of supervision and regulation, there are many similarities in the activities undertaken by these agencies.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
