While the actual annual benefits paid to participants  are not adjusted for inflation, the initial maximum levels are set by law and  are indexed for inflation. Covered benefits include pension benefits  accrued at normal retirement age, most early retirement benefits, and  survivor and disability benefits. PBGC pays these benefits when a plan is  terminated and the plan has insufficient assets to pay all benefits accrued  under the plan up to the date of plan termination. In 2006, PBGC paid over  622,000 people a median benefit of about $296 per month.", "The vast majority of the participants in PBGC-trusteed plans receive all the  benefits they were promised by their plan. Benefits for some participants  may be reduced if 1) their benefits exceed PBGC\u2019s maximum guarantee  limit, 2) a benefit increase occurred (or became payable due to a plant  shutdown) within five years of the plan\u2019s termination, or 3) a part of their  benefit is a supplemental benefit.

Operations are  financed by insurance premiums set by Congress and paid by sponsors of  defined benefit plans, investment income of assets from pension plans  trusteed by PBGC ($4.8 billion in investment income from $68.4 billion in  assets for its combined programs in 2007) and recoveries from the  companies formerly responsible for the plans. Under current law, other  than statutory authority to borrow up to $100 million from the Treasury  Department (sometimes referred to as a $100 million line of credit), no  substantial source of funds is available to PBGC if it runs out of money. In  the event that PBGC were to exhaust all of its holdings, benefit payments  would have to be drastically cut unless Congress were to take positive  action to provide support.", "In 2007, PBGC received over $1.5 billion in premium income. An insured  plan in the single employer program was required to pay PBGC a yearly  premium of $31 per participant for pension benefit insurance coverage in  2007. This per-participant premium rate is adjusted annually to wage  inflation. Plans that are underfunded as specified by ERISA must pay  PBGC an additional premium of $9 per $1,000 of underfunding.

Multiemployer plans are established through  collective bargaining agreements involving two or more unrelated  employers and are common in industries such as construction, trucking,  mining, the hotel trades, and segments of the grocery business. The  multiemployer program is far smaller than the PBGC single employer  program, insuring about 10 million participants in about 1,530 plans. Like  the single employer program, PBGC collects premiums from sponsoring  employers and insures multiemployer participant benefits up to a limit,  although both the level of premiums and the maximum insured limit are  far lower than those for the single employer program. Further, unlike the  single-employer program, a multiemployer plan termination does not  trigger the PBGC benefit guarantee. A terminated multiemployer plan  continues to pay full plan benefits so long as it has sufficient assets to do  so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC\u2019s Budget Only Partly Flows through the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["The treatment of PBGC in the federal budget is complicated by the use of  two accounts\u2014an on\u2013budget revolving fund and a non-budgetary trust  fund.

These cash flows are reported in the budget in a single  revolving fund account. The cash flows include premiums paid, interest  income on federal securities, benefit payments, administrative expenses,  and reimbursements from PBGC\u2019s non-budgetary trust fund. The non- budgetary trust fund includes assets obtained from terminated plans and is  managed by private money-managers. Because the trust fund is a non- budgetary account, the transfer of assets from terminated plans to PBGC  is not considered a receipt to the government. Likewise, the liabilities  PBGC incurs when it takes over an underfunded plan or other changes in  PBGC\u2019s assets and liabilities are not reflected in the budget. Figure 2  provides an overview of PBGC\u2019s budgetary and non-budgetary cash flows.", "When an insured pension plan is terminated, assets are transferred to  PBGC\u2019s non-budgetary trust fund. Neither these assets nor the benefit  liabilities appear on the federal balance sheet and PBGC\u2019s net loss is not  recorded in the federal government\u2019s income statement. Assets in the non- budgetary trust fund are commingled and no longer identified with  particular plans. PBGC has broad authority to oversee and administer  pension assets held in its trust fund and is free to invest and expend the  funds as if it were a private fiduciary of the trust fund\u2019s holdings. PBGC  can invest the assets in whatever way it chooses, as long as it acts in the  best financial interest of beneficiaries.", "In addition to the non-budgetary trust fund, PBGC has an on-budget  revolving fund. Premium income and transfers from the trust fund for both  benefit payments and administrative expenses are deposited to the  revolving funds as offsetting collections (that is, offsets to outlays). Unlike  the trust fund, the revolving fund appears on the federal government\u2019s  balance sheet and provides PBGC with permanent spending authority to  carry out its activities. In years that premium income and trust fund  reimbursements exceed benefit payment and administrative costs, the  revolving fund would show negative outlays, thus improving the overall  fiscal balance of the federal government. Any funds that are not used to  pay benefits or expenses are considered unobligated balances and are  available for expenditure in the next year. By law, unobligated funds in the  revolving fund must be held in Treasury securities and earn interest  income.", "PBGC transfers funds from the non-budgetary trust fund to its on-budget  revolving fund to pay a portion of retirement annuities and certain  administrative costs. Such transfers are referred to as reimbursements and  are recorded as offsetting collections in the budget. Generally, the  proportion of benefit payments that is reimbursed from the trust fund  depends on the aggregate funding level of the plans that PBGC has taken  over and is adjusted periodically. In other words, if the average funding  ratio of all plans taken over by PBGC is 50 percent, then half of all benefit  payments originate from the non-budgetary trust fund. In addition to  financing benefits, trust fund assets are also transferred to the revolving  fund to pay for PBGC\u2019s administrative expenses related to terminations.  PBGC\u2019s other administrative expenses are paid directly from the revolving  fund.", "Insurance programs with long-term commitments, such as PBGC, may  distort the budget\u2019s fiscal balance by looking like revenue generators in  years that premium collections exceed benefit payments and  administrative expenses because the programs\u2019 long-term expected costs  are not reported. For example, in 2004 when PBGC\u2019s losses measured on  an accrual basis ballooned and its deficit grew from $11 billion to $23  billion, PBGC\u2019s cash flow reported in the budget was positive and reduced  the federal government\u2019s budget deficit.", "GAO has reported previously that the cash-based federal budget, which  focuses on annual cash flows, does not adequately reflect the cost of  pension and other insurance programs. Generally, cost is only recognized  in the budget when claims are paid rather than when the commitment is  made. Benefit payments of terminated plans assumed by PBGC may not be  made for years, even decades, because plan participants generally are not  eligible to receive pension benefits until they reach age 65. Once eligible,  beneficiaries then receive benefit payments for the rest of their lives. As a  result, there can be years in which PBGC\u2019s current cash collections exceed  current cash payments, regardless of the expected long-term cost to the  government."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PBGC Continues to Face Financial Challenges", "paragraphs": ["PBGC\u2019s single-employer program faces financial challenges both from past  claims resulting from bankruptcies and plan termination, which have been  concentrated in a few industrial sectors, and structural problems such as  weak plan funding rules and a premium structure that does not fully  reflect the various risks posed by plans. Because of these financial  challenges, GAO designated the single-employer program as \u201chigh risk\u201d in  2003, and it remains so today. PBGC has seen recent improvements to its  net financial position and recent legislative changes have raised premiums,  changed certain plan funding rules and limited PBGC guarantees.  However, the legislation has only been recently implemented and it did not  completely address a number of the risks that PBGC faces going forward.  Further, PBGC has recently implemented a new investment policy which  adds significant variability and risk to the assets it manages.", "PBGC\u2019s net deficit for the single-employer program, which is currently  $13.1 billion, reached a peak of $23.3 billion (or $23.5 billion for both  insurance programs combined) in 2004 largely as a result of a number of  realized and probable claims that occurred during that year. See figure 3  for the difference between PBGC assets and liabilities for both insurance  programs from 1991 to 2007. GAO has generally focused its work on the  single-employer pension insurance program with respect to PBGC\u2019s  overall financial challenges. This is because the single-employer program  represents nearly all of the assets and liabilities held by PBGC.", "The assets and liabilities that PBGC accumulates from taking over, or  \u201ctrusteeing,\u201d plans has increased rapidly over the last 5 years or so. This is  largely due to the termination, typically through bankruptcies, of a number  of very large, underfunded plan sponsors. In fact, eight of the top 10  largest firms that have presented claims to PBGC did so from 2002 to 2005.  (See table 1).", "These top 10 claims alone currently account for nearly two-thirds of all of  PBGC\u2019s claims and are concentrated among firms representing the steel  and airline industries. Overall, these industries account for about three- quarters of PBGC\u2019s total claims and total single-employer benefit  payments in 2006.", "While the claims presented by the steel and airline industries were due in  some part to restructuring and competitive pressures in those industries, it  is important to recognize other economic and regulatory factors affected  PBGC and DB plan sponsors as a whole. For example, when we reported  on airline pension plan underfunding in late 2004 we noted that several  problems contributed to the broad underfunding of DB plans. These  problems included cyclical factors like the so called \u201cperfect storm\u201d of key  economic conditions, in which declines in stock prices lowered the value  of pension assets used to pay benefits, while at the same time a decline in  interest rates inflated the value of pension liabilities. The combined  \u201cbottom line\u201d result was that many plans were underfunded at the time  and had insufficient resources to pay all of their future promised benefits.  Figure 4 shows the underfunding of PBGC\u2019s single-employer plans from  1991 to 2007.", "Underfunding among large plans (as reuired by ERISA section 4010)", "In 2003, GAO designated PBGC\u2019s single-employer program as high-risk, or  as a program that needs urgent Congressional attention and agency action.  We specifically noted PBGC\u2019s prior-year net deficit as well as the risk of  the termination among large, underfunded pension plans, as reasons for  the programs high-risk designation. As part of our monitoring of PBGC as  a high-risk agency we have highlighted additional challenges faced by the  single-employer program. Among these concerns were the serious  weaknesses that existed with respect to plan funding rules and that  PBGC\u2019s premium structure and guarantees needed to be re-examined to  better reflect the risk posed by various plans. Additionally the number of  single-employer insured DB plans has been rapidly declining, and, among  the plans still in operation, many have frozen benefits to some or all  participants.  Additionally the prevalence of plans that are closed to new  participants seems to imply that PBGC is likely to see a decline in insured  participants, especially as insured participants seem increasingly likely to  be retired (as opposed to active or current) workers.", "There have been a number of developments with respect to PBGC\u2019s  situation since we issued our most recent high risk updates in 2005 and  2007. At least until fairly recently, key economic conditions have been  generally favorable for DB plan sponsors and plan funding has generally  improved. In addition, major pension legislation was enacted which  addressed many of the concerns articulated in our previous reports and  testimonies on PBGC\u2019s financial condition. The Deficit Reduction Act of  2005 (DRA) was signed in to law on February 8, 2006 and included  provisions to raise flat-rate premiums and created a new, temporary  premium for certain terminated single-employer plans. Later that year the  Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law and included a  number of provisions aimed at improving plan funding and PBGC finances.  However, PPA did not fully close plan funding gaps, did not adjust  premiums in a way that fully reflected risk from financially distressed  sponsors and provided special relief to plan sponsors in troubled  industries, particularly those in the airline industries. PBGC\u2019s net financial  position improved from 2005 to 2006 because some very large plans that  were previously classified as probable terminations were reclassified to a  reasonably possible designation as a result of the relief granted to troubled  industries. Since this provision has only been implemented for a few years,  it is still too early to determine how much risk of new claims these  reclassified plans still represent to PBGC. As many of the provisions in  PPA are still phasing-in, we will continue to monitor the status of the  single-employer program with respect to PPA and will be updating our  high risk series in early 2009.", "GAO recently reported on a newly developing financial challenge facing  PBGC due to the recent change to its investment policy. While the  investment policy adopted in 2008 aims to reduce PBGC\u2019s $14 billion  deficit by investing in assets with a greater expected return, GAO found  that the new allocation will likely carry more risk than acknowledged by  PBGC\u2019s analysis. According to PBGC the new allocation will be  sufficiently diversified to mitigate the expected risks associated with the  higher expected return. They also asserted that it should involve less risk  than the previous policy. However, GAO\u2019s assessment found that, although  returns are indeed likely to grow with the new allocation, the risks are  likely higher as well. Although it is important that the PBGC consider ways  to optimize its portfolio, including higher return and diversification  strategies, the agency faces unique challenges, such as PBGC\u2019s need for  access to cash in the short-term to pay benefits, which could further  increase the risks it faces with any investment strategy that allocates  significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements Needed to PBGC\u2019s Governance, Oversight and Management", "paragraphs": ["Improvements are needed to PBGC\u2019s governance structure, to oversight of  the corporation, and to its strategic approach to program management.

While the PBGC board is now meeting twice a year, very  little time is spent on addressing strategic and operational issues.  According to corporate governance guidelines, boards should meet  regularly and focus principally on broader issues, such as corporate  philosophy and mission, broad policy, strategic management, oversight  and monitoring of management, and company performance against  business plans. However, our review of the board\u2019s recorded minutes  found that although some meetings devoted a portion of time to certain  strategic and operational issues, such as investment policy, the financial  status of PBGC\u2019s insurance programs, and outside audit reviews, the board  meetings generally only lasted about an hour.", "The size and composition of PBGC\u2019s board does not meet corporate  governance guidelines.

Further, dedicating staff that are independent of PBGC\u2019s  executive management and have relevant pension and financial expertise  to solely support the board\u2019s policy and oversight activities may be  warranted. In response to our finding, PBGC contracted with a consulting  firm to identify and review governance models and provide a background  report to assist the board in its review of alternative corporate governance  structures.

PBGC must annually submit reports to Congress on its prior  fiscal year\u2019s financial and operational matters, which include information  on PBGC\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, and compliance with  certain laws and regulations. In addition, through its support agencies\u2014 GAO, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research  Service\u2014Congress has also provided oversight and reviewed PBGC.  Specifically, Congress has asked GAO to conduct assessments of policy,  management, and the financial condition of PBGC. For example, we  conducted more than 10 reviews of PBGC over the past 5 years, including  assessments related to PBGC\u2019s 2005 corporate reorganization and  weaknesses in its governance structure, human capital management, and  contracting practices. Our work also raised concerns about PBGC\u2019s  financial condition and the state of the defined benefit industry.", "Some government corporations have additional reporting requirements for  notifying Congress of significant actions. For example, the Millennium  Challenge Corporation is required to formally notify the appropriate  congressional committees 15 days prior to the allocation or transfer of  funds related to the corporation\u2019s activities. The Commodity Credit  Corporation is subject to a similar requirement. These examples  demonstrate how Congress has required additional reporting requirements  for certain activities conducted by government corporations. PBGC  generally has no requirements to formally notify Congress prior to taking  any significant financial or operational actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A More Strategic Approach Could Improve Contracting and Human Capital Management at PBGC", "paragraphs": ["As reported in our recent work on PBGC contracting and human capital  management, contracting plays a central role in helping PBGC achieve its  mission and address unpredictable workloads. Three-quarters of PBGC\u2019s  budget was spent on contracts and nearly two-thirds of its personnel are  contractors, as shown in figure 6. Since the mid-1980s, PBGC has had  contracts covering a wide range of services, including the administration  of terminated plans, payment of benefits, customer communication, legal  assistance, document management, and information technology. From  fiscal year 2000 through 2007, PBGC\u2019s contract spending increased steadily  along with its overall budget and workload, and its use of contract  employees outpaced its hiring of federal employees. As PBGC workload  grew due to the significant number of large pension plan terminations,  PBGC relied on contractors to supplement its workforce, acknowledging  that it has difficulty anticipating workloads due to unpredictable economic  conditions.", "In 2000, we recommended that PBGC develop a strategic approach to  contracting by conducting a comprehensive review of PBGC\u2019s future  human capital needs and using this review to better link contracting  decisions to PBGC\u2019s long-term strategic planning process. PBGC took  some initial steps to implement our recommendation, and in August 2008,  we reported that PBGC had recently renewed its efforts and drafted a  strategic human capital plan.", "In addition to drafting a strategic human capital plan, PBGC recently  issued its strategic plan; however this plan does not document how the  acquisition function supports the agency\u2019s missions and goals. Although  contracting is essential to PBGC\u2019s mission, we found that the Procurement  Department is not included in corporate-level strategic planning. Further,  PBGC\u2019s draft strategic human capital plan acknowledges the need for  contractor support, but does not provide detailed plans for how the  contract support will be obtained. While PBGC\u2019s workload can expand and  contract depending on the state of plan terminations, planning documents  do not include strategies for managing the fluctuations. Based on these  findings, we recommended that PBGC revise its strategic plan to reflect  the importance of contracting and to project its vision of future contract  use, and ensure that PBGC\u2019s procurement department is included in  agency-wide strategic planning.", "PBGC also needs a more strategic approach for improving human capital  management. While PBGC has made progress in its human capital  management approach by taking steps to improve its human capital  planning and practices\u2014such as drafting a succession management plan\u2014 the corporation still lacks a formal, comprehensive human capital strategy,  articulated in a formal human capital plan that includes human capital  policies, programs, and practices. PBGC has initiatives for the  management of human capital, such as ensuring employees have the skills  and competencies needed to support its mission and establishing a  performance-based culture within the corporation, and has made some  progress toward these goals. However, PBGC has not routinely and  systematically targeted and analyzed all necessary workforce data\u2014such  as attrition rates, occupational skill mix, and trends\u2014to understand its  current and future workforce needs.", "PBGC is generally able to hire staff in its key occupations\u2014such as  accountants, actuaries, and attorneys\u2014and retain them at rates similar to  those of the rest of the federal government. However, PBGC has had some  difficulty hiring and retaining staff for specific occupations and positions,  including executives and senior financial analysts. PBGC has made use of  various human capital flexibilities in which the corporation has  discretionary authority to provide direct compensation in certain  circumstances to support its recruitment and retention efforts, such as  recruitment and retention incentives, superior qualification pay-setting  authority, and special pay rates for specific occupations. However, PBGC  officials said that they had not recently explored additional flexibilities  that required the approval of OPM and OMB to determine whether they  would be applicable or appropriate for the corporation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["PBGC clearly faces many challenges. The impact of PPA is still unclear,  but in any case difficult decisions for the future still remain. While PBGC\u2019s  net financial position has improved along with economic conditions that  until recently had been favorable to plan sponsors, we are concerned that  such conditions are changing and could leave PBGC exposed to another  spate of claims from sponsors of very large severely underfunded plans.  The challenges PBGC faces are acutely illustrated by its recent changes to  its asset investment policy. The aim of the change to the policy is to  reduce the current deficit through greater returns, but, holding all else  equal, the potential for greater returns comes with greater risk. This  greater risk may or may not be warranted, but the uncertain results of the  policy could have important implications for all PBGC stakeholders: plan  sponsors, insured participants, insured beneficiaries, as well as the  government and ultimately taxpayers.", "One thing that is certain: PBGC will continue to require prudent  management and diligent oversight going forward. However, PBGC faces  challenges with its board structure, which will only become more apparent  in the coming months as the board, its representatives, and the  corporation\u2019s director will likely be entirely replaced by a new president.  Without adequate information and preparation, this transition could limit  not only the progress made by the current board, its representatives, and  director, but may also hinder the corporation\u2019s ability to insure and deliver  retirement benefits to millions of Americans that rely on the corporation.  As this transition highlights, an improved board structure is critical in  helping PBGC manage the daunting, and in many ways fundamental, long- term financial challenges it faces, which is why we have recommended the  Congress restructure the Board.", "Chairman Lewis, Congressman Ramstad, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
