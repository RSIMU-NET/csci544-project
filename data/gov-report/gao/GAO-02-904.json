To maximize the prospects for successful transfer, the advisory committees recommended that communications with potential users should be opened as early as possible and proceed through all phases of the work (research, development, and demonstration). According to the advisory committees, it is important that in the earliest phases of concept formulation, prospective users be made aware of the potential technological and scientific advances. In addition, uncertainties need to be communicated as well to minimize surprises. The February 2000 advisory committee report recognized the need for exploratory projects designed to see whether a technical idea with a plausible application to a nuclear, chemical, or biological nonproliferation mission is feasible. In these cases, seeking input from a user of the technology might not be necessary until technical feasibility has been proven. However, the advisory committee also reported that, in general, users should be involved at the earliest stages of the R&D process and guidelines should be established to define when exceptions to this are allowed. In addition, involving users at such an early stage may achieve unexpected benefits. For example, the March 2002 advisory committee report notes that \u201cbrainstorming with potential end- users can sometimes lead to innovative ideas for new technologies.\u201d", "In response to the February 2000 advisory committee report, NNSA\u2019s R&D program reported that it recognized the importance of involving potential end users of the technology at the earliest date and that it would continue to emphasize that relationship.

Under this process, program managers and potential users conduct regular reviews of each project before key decisions are made, such as whether to proceed from exploratory research into product development. The reviews examine how well the project is linked to user needs, the strength of the researchers\u2019 scientific or technical approach, and the researchers\u2019 ability to carry out the project effectively and efficiently. Users are also involved in broader planning initiatives in this area.

In addition, we queried the R&D program\u2019s project management information system for detailed information on each project in the R&D program. We also examined the R&D program\u2019s funding projections for fiscal year 2003 and analyzed NNSA\u2019s Future-Years Nuclear Security Program report to the Congress, dated March 2002, which shows funding estimates for fiscal years 2003 through 2007.

With regard to R&D program office reports and memorandums, we reviewed, among other things, the NNSA Strategic Plan, dated February 2002, and strategic plans prepared by the Nuclear Explosion Monitoring area, dated January 2002; Chemical and Biological National Security research area, dated spring of 2000; and Deterring Proliferation area, dated December 2001. The Proliferation Detection research area had not yet prepared a strategic plan at the time of our review. In addition, we reviewed various memorandums outlining NNSA\u2019s efforts to develop an integrated programming, planning, budgeting, and evaluation process. With regard to independent reviews done on the R&D program, we analyzed several specific studies. These analyses included the Institute for Defense Analysis\u2019 study entitled The Organization and Management of the Nuclear Weapons Program, dated March 1997; the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Nonproliferation and National Security Advisory Committee\u2019s review entitled DOE Research and Technology against the Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction, dated February 2000; and the NNSA advisory committee\u2019s report entitled Science & Technology in the NNSA Nonproliferation and Counterterrorism Programs, dated March 2002.", "To obtain the views of federal, state, and local agencies about the usefulness of the R&D program\u2019s technology, we interviewed officials at the Department of Transportation, Office of Intelligence and Security; Department of State, Office of Technology and Assessments; Navy Special Reconnaissance Program; Defense Intelligence Agency; Central Intelligence Agency; United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Chemical and Biological Defense Directorate; Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Counter Proliferation and Chemical and Biological Defense; Air Force Technical Applications Center; Federal Transit Administration; Utah Department of Health; Association of Public Health Laboratories, Infectious Disease Programs; and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, Counter-Terrorism Development.", "We also reviewed how the R&D program works in conjunction with other federal R&D programs by analyzing NNSA\u2019s reports and statements, reports generated by other federal executive entities, and interviewing individuals who serve on interagency coordinating bodies. With respect to NNSA\u2019s reports and statements, we analyzed NNSA\u2019s Report to the Congress on the Organization and Operations of the National Nuclear Security Administration, dated February 25, 2002, and the statement by the Assistant Deputy Administrator for Nonproliferation Research and Engineering, NNSA, before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, dated April 10, 2002. With regard to reports generated by other federal executive entities, we reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Fiscal Year 2001 Annual Report to Congress on Combating Terrorism and the Counterproliferation Program Review Committee\u2019s report entitled Activities and Programs for Countering Proliferation and Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Terrorism, dated October 2001. We also interviewed officials who serve on interagency coordinating bodies, including officials both within and outside NNSA. For instance, we discussed interagency coordination with the NNSA program managers for the Nuclear Explosion Monitoring and Proliferation Detection areas. We also discussed interagency coordination with officials at the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Counter Proliferation and Chemical and Biological Defense; Defense Threat Reduction Agency; and Department of State.", "We conducted our work from October 2001 through July 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Nuclear Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
