By the end of program year 2001, states had spent virtually all funds allocated in 1999 as well as 90 percent of 2000 funds and 56 percent of 2001 funds. By contrast, Labor's estimate suggests a slower pace of spending because it is based on all available funds, including those only recently distributed. Even though 44 percent of program year 2001 funds are being carried over into program year 2002, many of these funds may have already been committed at the point of service delivery. Furthermore, because of reporting inconsistencies, Labor's data do not accurately reflect funds that have been obligated long-term commitments made by states and local areas on behalf of WIA customers. For a truer picture of available funding, both expenditures and obligations must be considered. But, because Labor lacks consistent data on obligations, it focuses only on expenditures to gauge budgetary need and overestimates funds states have available to spend. Labor compares state expenditures against its benchmarks to determine how states manage their spending, to target guidance and assistance efforts, and to formulate next year's budget request. But Labor does not often communicate these benchmarks to states. Despite active monitoring and additional guidance, state and local officials remain confused by some of Labor's financial reporting requirements. They seek more definitive guidance and the opportunity to share promising strategies to help them better manage spending. Financial reporting delays result from lengthy spending approval and contract procurement procedures lasting as long as 8 months and untimely service provider billing. Also, yearly funding fluctuations affect states' and local areas' willingness to commit resources in the long term and inhibit workforce system planning. Some states and localities have implemented strategies to overcome these factors and better manage their WIA spending."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the enactment of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998, the Congress repealed the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) and overhauled federal employment and training programs.

In fiscal year 2002, WIA\u2019s three funding streams\u2014adults, dislocated workers, and youth\u2014were appropriated about $3.9 billion. In July 2002, most states had just completed their second full year of implementation. Under WIA, the federal government allocates funds to states each year, and states have three years to spend those funds\u2014that is, funds received in 1999 may be spent through 2001; similarly, those received in 2000 may be spent through 2002. Twice, the administration has proposed reducing the program\u2019s budget, recommending a $359 million reduction for fiscal year 2002 and another $343 million in 2003. In both cases, the administration has cited states\u2019 large amounts of unexpended funds carried over from the prior year, saying that states could readily absorb funding cuts without affecting service levels. Labor estimates that nearly 40 percent of states\u2019 WIA funds remain available to spend at the end of program year 2001.

To gain a better understanding of WIA spending issues, we met with workforce officials in two states\u2014Colorado and Washington\u2014and conducted in-depth structured telephone interviews with state officials in 7 others: California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Vermont. We also contacted officials representing local areas in 7 of the states. In selecting the states, we focused primarily on those with the larger WIA allocations. Collectively, the 9 states we selected accounted for about half of the total WIA allocation in program years 2000 and 2001. Besides being geographically dispersed, the states we selected included those with single and multiple local workforce areas and represented a range of expenditure rates and experience levels in implementing WIA. In selecting local areas, we chose from among the largest ones. We also interviewed officials at Labor headquarters and five of its regional offices, as well as four national associations.

WIA requires most federally funded employment and training services to be delivered through a one-stop system overseen by newly created state and local workforce investment boards, although the services themselves may be provided by partner agencies and locally contracted service providers.

Thus, any changes in the annual appropriation or elements of the allocation formula will result in year-to-year funding fluctuations. Once the Congress appropriates funds for a given fiscal year, Labor notifies states of their annual allocation\u2014usually in the February to March timeframe. The funds are made available to states and localities at three separate times during the year, depending on the program (see fig. 1). For youth services, all funds for the year are made available on April 1, 3 months before the beginning of the program year on July 1. This once-a- year youth allocation is designed to help states and local areas gear up for summer youth activities. The adult and dislocated worker funding allocations are distributed twice a year from two different years\u2019 appropriations\u2014on July 1 (1/4 of the allotment) and on October 1 (3/4 of the allotment)\u2014with the October allocation funded from a new fiscal year\u2019s appropriation. States and localities are required to manage their WIA programs, including spending, on a program-year basis, regardless of when funds are made available. In addition, WIA allows states 3 program years to spend their funds while local areas have 2 program years.", "Once WIA funds are made available, they flow from Labor to states, states to local areas, and local areas to service providers. For dislocated worker funds, the Secretary of Labor retains 20 percent of the funds in a national reserve account to be used for emergency grants, demonstrations, and technical assistance and allocates the remaining funds to the states according to a specified formula. Once states receive their allocation, the governor can reserve up to 25 percent of dislocated worker funds for rapid response activities intended to help workers faced with plant closures and layoffs to quickly transition to new employment. In addition to funds set aside for rapid response, WIA allows states to set aside up to 15 percent of the dislocated worker allotment and permits them to combine the dislocated worker set-aside with similar set-asides from their adult and youth allotments. States use the set-asides to support a variety of statewide activities such as helping establish one-stop centers, providing incentive grants to local areas, operating management information systems, and disseminating lists of organizations that can provide training. After funds are set aside for rapid response and statewide activities, the remainder\u2014at least 60 percent for dislocated workers and 85 percent for adult and youth\u2014is then allocated to local workforce areas, also according to a specified formula.

Appendix I depicts a sample form that states complete and submit to Labor. Because adult and dislocated worker funds for each program year are provided from two separate appropriations, Labor requires states to track financial information separately by the year in which funds are appropriated. As a result, states submit a total of 11 reports each quarter for activities funded by the current program year\u2019s allocation, as shown in table 3. In addition, WIA gives states 3 years within which to spend their grant; consequently, states may be tracking activities that are funded by 3 different program years, thus submitting up to 33 reports each quarter (11 reports multiplied by the 3 program years in which funds are available).", "In completing their financial status reports, states are required to follow Labor\u2019s guidance that identifies and defines the data elements to be reported. Labor collects \u201ctotal federal obligations\u201d\u2014which it defines as the sum of expenditures, accruals, and unliquidated obligations\u2014for determining how much states have already spent and how much is still available for spending. Table 4 shows the definitions of each of these terms. In addition, WIA regulations require expenditures to be reported on an accrual basis. This means states should report all cash outlays and all accruals as expenditures on their reports. As of July 2002, all states we contacted told us that they were reporting expenditures on an accrual basis.", "Financial reporting begins at the local service provider level and progresses through the local, state, and national levels.

After reconciling any discrepancies, states aggregate the local reports and are required to submit a financial status report to their regional Labor office 45 days after the quarter\u2019s end, according to Labor officials. Ten days later, after performing edit checks, regional officials told us that they certify and forward states\u2019 reports to Labor\u2019s national headquarters. The national office then merges information for the six funding categories into the three funding streams\u2014 adults, dislocated workers, and youth\u2014and combines the program and fiscal year data into a single program year.

Thus, program year 2000 funds must be spent by the end of program year 2001 for localities and by the end of program year 2002 for states. If funds are not spent, WIA directs both states and Labor to recapture and, if appropriate, redistribute unspent funds according to specific criteria (see fig. 3). The recapture processes are similar at both the state and federal level. States have a two-tiered process by which they recapture available funds. First, at the end of the initial program year, states may reclaim funding from local areas with total obligations less than 80 percent of their annual allocation and redistribute these recaptured funds to those local areas that have met the criterion for total obligations. Second, at the close of local areas\u2019 2-year grant period, states may recapture any unexpended local funds and may reallocate the funds to other local areas that have fully expended their allocation or to statewide activities, but only in the third year the grant is available.", "Like local areas, states are also subject to having their funds recaptured. At the federal level, Labor may recapture funds from states with total obligations less than 80 percent of their annual allotment at the end of the first program year. Labor applies the same recapture process to the end of the second program year. At both intervals, Labor may redistribute these funds to other states that have met the requisite total obligation rate. By the end of the 3-year grant period, Labor may recapture any state funds that have not been fully expended. Because states\u2019 WIA grants expire after 3 years, funds recaptured by Labor at the end of the third year may not be redistributed to other states.

As a result, reported expenditures may have been understated. Some states and local areas may still be using a cash-based accounting system, usually tied to the state\u2019s or local area\u2019s existing accounting system and often used to report expenditures for other programs, such as welfare. State and local workforce officials we spoke with in areas that are reporting cash outlays told us they are modifying their accounting systems and will soon begin reporting accruals. In fact, as of program year 2002, all states we spoke with told us they are beginning to collect and report expenditures on an accrual basis as required under WIA regulations. Excluding accruals may understate expenditures primarily in the short term because invoices for goods and services received in one month are often converted into cash outlays in the next month. However, if this conversion takes a long time to occur and if expenditures are uneven from month-to-month and year-to-year, the effect of accruals for a year may be longer term and expenditures for a given year may be understated. For example, a jobseeker may have completed a training class in June of one program year, but the school does not submit an invoice to the local area until September of the next program year. If the local area captures the cost of training as an expenditure only after paying the invoice, it will wait until the new program year to report it and will understate its prior program year expenditures. Eventually, accruals may catch up with expenditures over the life of the grant\u2014-2 years for local areas and 3 years for states.", "In addition to reporting expenditures each quarter, states also report obligations\u2014funds committed through contracts for goods and services for which a payment has not yet been made.

Both state and local officials told us that public institutions\u2014particularly community and technical colleges\u2014are primary providers of training, often delivering such services through Individual Training Accounts. The 4 to 6 month lag in school billing in Miami, for example, not only causes delays in reporting expenditures, but public schools\u2014not accustomed to billing monthly\u2014may also have little financial incentive to expedite billing because they do not rely on WIA funds as a major source of their tuition revenue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statewide Funds Are Spent at a Slower Rate", "paragraphs": ["Slower spending of statewide funds compared to local funds also affects expenditure rates.

For example, the governor\u2019s statewide 15 percent set-aside was 37 percent expended compared to 70 percent expended for local adult programs (see fig. 9). The difference in expenditure rates is due, in part, to WIA\u2019s requirement that some of the statewide funds be used for end-of- year incentive grants to local areas for exemplary performance on the local performance measures. In addition, Washington, for example, uses statewide funds for long-term projects and for activities such as program evaluations. Likewise, rapid response funds are held at the state level to enable response to mass layoffs or plant closures. Florida State officials told us that, by state law, the state board must retain 30 percent of its rapid response funds until the latter part of the program year.", "Although these factors affect when expenditures are incurred and reported, other factors may influence states\u2019 decision on whether to spend their WIA funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Factors Affect States\u2019 Overall Level of Spending", "paragraphs": ["Three key factors affect the extent to which states spend their WIA funds.

Second, WIA\u2019s emphasis on referrals to other one-stop partners\u2019 programs may result in non-WIA funds being spent first.

The dislocated worker funding formula, which distributes a third of its funds based upon the amount of \u201cexcess unemployment\u201d (unemployment exceeding 4.5 percent), is especially volatile. In addition, funds appropriated for WIA programs vary according to annual budget decisions. For program year 2001, for example, $177.5 million was rescinded from the dislocated worker program. State and local area officials told us that they were uncertain whether the rescission would be restored and that the uncertainty contributed to their sense of funding instability. Local area funding levels can also fluctuate when they receive an infusion of unanticipated, unspent statewide funds, as was the case in Seattle and Tacoma. Washington\u2019s governor held back some rapid response funds in anticipation of aluminum plant closings and mass layoffs stemming from the energy shortage along the West Coast. However, when plant closings did not materialize, the state no longer needed the funds for rapid response activities and allocated them to these two cities midway through the program year, with the expectation that the funds would be spent by the end of the program year.", "Year-to-year fluctuations in funding also hinder states\u2019 and localities\u2019 ability to plan comprehensive workforce investment systems. For example, in New York, funds for dislocated workers decreased by about 40 percent from program year 1999 to program year 2000, a fluctuation that state officials said would inhibit its local areas from committing funds beyond the current program year because future funding levels are uncertain.

As part of the core services under WIA, adults and dislocated workers can get help in establishing financial aid eligibility for training and education programs that are available in the community but are not funded under WIA. In addition, to qualify for training services under the adult and dislocated worker programs, individuals must be unable to obtain other grant assistance, such as Pell Grants, or must require assistance beyond that provided by other grant aid programs.

For example, while Texas got a head start in establishing one- stops under WIA because it was an early implementer, state workforce officials struggled with other issues such as implementing individual training accounts and developing data collection systems for WIA\u2019s performance measures. In addition, some states and local areas initially took a \u201cwork-first\u201d approach, emphasizing job placement services that were less expensive compared to long-term training and education services, especially given the positive economic and employment conditions at the time of WIA\u2019s enactment.

Our analysis of Labor\u2019s data shows that states are rapidly spending their funds\u2014in fact, nationwide, states have spent 90 percent within 2 years, much of it often within the first year the funds were available. This pace of spending has occurred even though the law allows states 3 years to spend the funds.", "But, expenditures by themselves do not provide a complete picture of spending activity. Obligations\u2014funds that have been committed on behalf of WIA customers\u2014must also be considered to accurately gauge how much is truly available for spending. Moreover, the law requires Labor to use obligations in its recapture decision. Taken together, expenditures and obligations are important tools for effective grant management and prudent oversight of the program. Labor has begun taking an active role in monitoring program spending. But, state officials have told us that it is not enough; they need more clear and consistent guidance from Labor on how to manage and report their WIA spending and how to collect and report obligations, particularly those commitments made at the local level. Failing this, states will continue struggling to understand what information is needed, and Labor\u2019s data will continue to be incomplete and inaccurate. Perhaps most problematic, though, is that, lacking consistent, reliable data on obligations, Labor uses only expenditure data to gauge budgetary need. In so doing, Labor does not take into account longer-term commitments made to customers and service providers and, as a result, overestimates available funds. Budget decisions based on underestimated spending levels contribute to funding instability in the system and impair the ability of state and local officials to plan workforce systems that provide the nation\u2019s jobseekers and employers with critically needed services.", "To build their workforce investment systems, states must carefully plan and use their limited resources in a way that best meets the growing demand for employment and training services, in the current uncertain economic environment. State officials told us that they seek more guidance and assistance in managing their WIA funds wisely and some states have implemented strategies to do so.

Labor\u2019s comments are in appendix IV. In its comments, Labor noted that the report contained a number of findings that will be very helpful during WIA\u2019s reauthorization. In general, Labor agreed with our findings and recommendations related to providing clearer definitions, guidance, and technical assistance to states to help them manage their WIA spending. However, Labor disagreed with our findings and recommendations related to the importance of considering obligations in addition to expenditures as it assesses WIA\u2019s financial position.", "In response to our finding that states are spending their WIA funds faster than the authorized 3-year period, Labor said that states were exceeding the law\u2019s minimum spending requirements, but that it must look beyond minimum expectations when investing limited resources. We agree with this point. In fact we found an expenditure rate of 90 percent of program year 2000 funds within 2 years, indicating that states are going well beyond minimum expectations. Labor also acknowledged that its spending estimate included all funds available at the start of the program year, without which an analysis of expenditure rates would be misleading. We do not contest Labor\u2019s methodology, but think it is important to note that most of the funds available to states were allocated within the past year, and states have not had long to spend the funds. We continue to assert that a better way to look at expenditure rates is not in the aggregate, but on a year-by-year basis.", "Regarding our conclusion that Labor\u2019s data do not accurately reflect state spending because they exclude obligations, Labor commented that, while it collects information on obligations due to statutory requirements, obligations are unimportant in formulating the budget because they represent future commitments to provide services, not actual service delivery. We continue to believe that obligations play a significant role in light of WIA\u2019s greater emphasis on contracting for services and are recommending that Labor establish a clearer definition of obligations that states can follow so that they can report more meaningful data to Labor.", "While agreeing with our recommendation to clarify its definition of obligations, Labor took exception to the recommendation to collect and report obligations made at the point of service delivery. Labor was concerned that a new reporting requirement would be extremely burdensome and costly to implement nationwide, in part because it did not believe that service providers always collected this information. We believe that assessing both obligations and expenditures is an important tool for sound financial management at any level\u2014state, local area, or service provider\u2014and a number of states are already collecting local obligations. We are pleased to note that Labor said it plans to work with states on this recommendation during WIA reauthorization.", "Labor also concurred with our recommendations to provide additional financial reporting guidance and technical assistance as well as to share promising practices for effectively managing spending. Labor agreed that it would be a priority for the coming year to ensure that all states are aware of requirements for the accounting of WIA funds.", "Regarding our recommendation that Labor communicate spending benchmarks that states should meet, Labor disagreed with our characterization of the expenditure rates as benchmarks, saying instead that they were projections of spending used to formulate a budget. Labor also commented that expenditure rates used to monitor spending were based on actual financial reports submitted by states, not on Labor\u2019s expectations. Labor has used these expenditure rates as benchmarks to identify states that were underspending their WIA funds and to prioritize oversight efforts. We agree that using benchmarks to prioritize monitoring helps manage limited resources; however, if spending targets are established, they should be disclosed.", "Finally, Labor was concerned about the unprecedented level of unspent balances carried over from prior years, citing these excess funds as justification for the dislocated worker rescission and for seeking additional budget reductions. While unspent balances under WIA may be larger than those experienced under JTPA, it may not be reasonable to expect comparable spending levels between the two programs. WIA\u2019s requirements represent a significant shift from prior workforce programs, including its emphasis on contracting for services, streamlining services through one-stop centers, and establishing training vouchers on behalf of customers. In addition, we contend that these unspent balances may have already been committed and may be unavailable for spending. We agree that the nation will face many challenges in financing its priorities in the coming years. However, in order to make funding choices, decisionmakers will need comprehensive information that considers expenditures, obligations, and how long the funds have been available for states to spend.
