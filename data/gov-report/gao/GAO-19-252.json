For example, FHFA required FHLBanks to add board demographic data to their annual reports; clarified how banks can conduct outreach to diverse board candidates; and allowed some banks to add an independent director.", "Since 2015, the share of women and minority directors on the boards of FHLBanks increased (see figure). The number of women directors increased from 34 in 2015 to 44 in October 2018, and the number of minority directors increased from 20 in 2015 to 30 in 2017, based on most recently available data. Trends for minority directors were less clear, because the banks' varying data collections processes did not always allow them to determine the extent to which directors opted out or forgot to answer data collection forms. FHFA stated that it planned to use board data to establish a baseline to analyze diversity trends. A review of the banks' data collection processes would help identify whether practices exist that could help improve the completeness of the data.", "FHLBanks reported they continued to face some challenges to their efforts to promote board diversity, especially among member director seats. The challenges include (1) balancing the addition of new women or minority directors with retaining the institutional knowledge of existing directors; and (2) competing with other organizations for qualified female and minority board candidates. Despite reported challenges, FHLBanks have taken measures to promote board diversity, such as establishing a task force to promote board diversity through information sharing and training. Individually, the FHLBanks emphasized the importance of diversity in election materials, built pools of diverse candidates, and conducted outreach to industry and trade groups. They also took actions to increase diversity specifically among member directors, including filling interim board seats with women and minority candidates and encouraging directors to personally reach out to potential women and minority candidates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FHFA, in consultation with FHLBanks, review data collection processes for board demographic information and communicate effective practices to banks.

HERA also created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)  as the regulator of the FHLBanks and required that all board directors be  elected rather than appointed by the banks\u2019 regulator.", "Academic researchers and others have highlighted the importance of  diversity among board directors, which they say can help better address  risks and complex issues or contribute to more diverse leadership. In  2015, we reported that while FHLBanks took steps to increase board  diversity, female and minority representation on their boards was limited.  In another 2015 report, we found that women\u2019s representation on boards  of U.S. publicly traded companies had been increasing, but we estimated  that complete gender balance could take decades.", "You asked us to review the diversity and inclusion efforts at FHLBank  boards.

To obtain information on  steps FHFA has taken to encourage FHLBank board diversity, we also  reviewed other FHFA documentation, such as FHFA\u2019s template for the  banks\u2019 annual reports and its 2016\u20132018 annual analysis related to the  bank boards. We also interviewed FHFA staff to learn about the agency\u2019s  efforts to encourage board diversity, including regulation amendments  and guidance.", "To describe trends in FHLBanks\u2019 board diversity, we analyzed gender  and race/ethnicity data self-reported by board directors in the banks\u2019  annual reports to FHFA as of the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017. At the time of our review, the most recently available data on board directors\u2019  race/ethnicity were from the banks\u2019 2017 annual reports. To provide more  recent data on board directors\u2019 gender, we also compiled a list of board  directors who started or continued their terms on the FHLBank boards in  2018, based on information from the banks\u2019 2017 Form 10-K filings with  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We then confirmed  with each bank our compiled list of board directors, as of October 17,  2018. We also requested and analyzed the gender and race/ethnicity  data voluntarily reported by each bank\u2019s board chair and vice chair as of  October 17, 2018, and requested the names of the chairs and vice chairs  of their board committees as of October 26, 2018.", "Because some directors did not self-identify their gender in 2015\u20132017  annual reports, we also used information in the FHLBanks\u2019 2014\u20132017  Form 10-Ks to derive data on the gender of the banks\u2019 board directors as  well as directors in board leadership positions as of October 2018. For  example, if directors were referred to as \u201cMr.\u201d in the Form 10-Ks, we  counted them as male. If they were referred to as \u201cMs.,\u201d we counted them  as female. However, we were not able to derive data on the race/ethnicity  for board directors who did not self-identify their race/ethnicity in 2015\u2013 2017 annual reports because the banks\u2019 Form 10-Ks did not include such  information. We assessed the reliability of the data from the banks\u2019  annual reports and Form 10-Ks through electronic testing, a review of  documentation, and interviews with knowledgeable agency staff. We  determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for describing the overall  trends and composition of gender and race/ethnicity at the FHLBank  boards, except the data for directors who did not self-identify their  race/ethnicity, as discussed later in the report.", "We also compared the most recently available demographic information  on FHLBank board directors with the demographic composition of senior  management in the financial services industry and the overall private  sector (excluding financial services), based on data from the Employer  Information Report (EEO-1) of the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC). In our analysis, we included workforce from all  sites of multi-establishment companies (companies with multiple  locations). Consequently, the analysis included in this report may not  match the analysis found on EEOC\u2019s website, which excludes workforce  from sites of multi-establishment companies with less than 50 employees.  Senior management in the financial services industry represents a pool of  comparable candidates that could provide directors for FHLBank  boards. We assessed the reliability of the data from the EEO-1 report  through electronic testing, a review of documentation, and interviews with  knowledgeable agency staff, and determined them to be sufficiently  reliable for comparing the composition of gender and race/ethnicity in the  financial services sector and the overall private sector with that at the  FHLBank boards.", "In addition, we requested and reviewed the forms and questions each  FHLBank used to collect gender and race/ethnicity information from their  board directors. We also reviewed information on the methods the banks  used to distribute and collect these data collection forms, and any  instructions or guidance FHFA provided to the banks on collecting this  information. We reviewed relevant FHFA regulations on collecting and  submitting board directors\u2019 gender and race/ethnicity information.

The 2010  rule also requires FHLBanks to submit an annual report to FHFA on their  diversity efforts.", "FHFA also evaluates the quality of corporate governance by board  directors as part of its on-site annual examinations and off-site monitoring  of FHLBanks.

While FHFA reviews the list of independent director  nominees for FHLBank boards to ensure that the nominees meet all  eligibility and qualification requirements, board directors are not FHLBank  employees. Rather, they form the oversight body of each bank. In  contrast, FHFA has a larger role in monitoring diversity efforts related to  the workforce and suppliers of the banks. For example, the agency\u2019s  annual examination manual contains a section that covers such efforts.", "FHFA oversight of diversity efforts also includes reviewing the FHLBanks\u2019  annual reports on diversity efforts, which the banks are required to submit  under HERA. In adopting its Minority and Women Inclusion rule of 2010  to implement this requirement, FHFA stated that it would analyze and  include information from the banks\u2019 annual reports in the agency\u2019s own  annual report to Congress. The banks\u2019 annual reports initially included  data related to their workforce and supplier diversity efforts.", "In May 2015, FHFA amended the 2010 rule and added two reporting  requirements for the annual reports: (1) data on gender and race/ethnicity  of board directors (which the directors would voluntarily self-report), and  (2) information on the banks\u2019 outreach efforts (such as to promote  diversity when nominating and soliciting director candidates). FHFA  stated in its 2015 amendments that it intended to use the director data to  analyze future trends in board diversity and the effectiveness of each  bank\u2019s policies and procedures to encourage board diversity.", "FHFA also clarified expectations on FHLBank diversity efforts in a 2016  amendment to its regulation related to bank board directors as well as in  guidance and communications to FHLBanks.", "Clarifying scope of election outreach activities. According to  FHFA staff, FHLBanks had inquired if the existing regulation would  prohibit the banks from conducting outreach to or recruiting of diverse  board candidates in the nomination or solicitation process. FHFA  regulation restricts FHLBanks from advocating for a particular  member director candidate or influencing the board election for  member and independent directors. According to FHFA staff, to  address these concerns, the agency amended the regulation in 2016  to clarify that the banks may conduct outreach to find diverse board  director candidates. FHFA staff added that the regulation  amendment also made clear that the banks may fulfill the regulatory  requirement to encourage consideration of diversity in nominating or  soliciting candidates for board director positions without violating  restrictions on advocating for particular director candidates.", "Guidance. FHFA provided FHLBanks with guidance related to  diversity, including board diversity. For example, the agency provided  guidance on the roles and duties of the banks\u2019 OMWI officers and the  scope of diversity regulations. FHFA provided the banks a template to  report newly required data on the gender and race/ethnicity of board  directors. To help banks prepare their annual reports, in June 2018  FHFA also developed an annual report template that outlines and  describes the contents of the required reporting elements. The  template includes sections for individual FHLBanks to present data on  board composition by diversity categories and to describe past and  future outreach activities and strategies to promote board diversity  and outcomes from the bank\u2019s activities.", "Communications. FHFA has communicated guidance and discussed  board diversity issues with FHLBank boards and with staff involved in  the banks\u2019 board diversity efforts. For example, FHFA staff gave  presentations at meetings during which FHLBank board directors  shared information on board diversity efforts. The staff noted FHFA\u2019s  OMWI director generally attends the semi-annual conferences of the  banks\u2019 OMWI officers, during which she discusses diversity issues  such as the roles and responsibilities of these officers and the scope  of the FHFA regulations.", "Furthermore, FHFA OMWI and other offices developed and implemented  some strategies to help FHLBanks maintain or increase board diversity.  In 2016, FHFA OMWI staff met with FHLBanks and requested that the  banks create a Bank Presidents Conference Board Diversity Task Force  to share practices to promote board diversity. The staff said that they act  as facilitators and informal advisors and may provide technical assistance  to the system-wide task force\u2014for example, by developing a list of  practices related to board diversity. Also, as encouraged by FHFA,  starting in 2017, each bank has a representative (a board director or the  bank president) on the task force.", "Also, based on FHFA\u2019s 2016 annual FHLBank board analysis, the FHFA  Director approved requests from three FHLBanks to add an independent  director seat for their 2017 boards to help maintain or increase board  diversity. FHFA extended the offer to the other banks (except Des  Moines, as its board was undergoing restructuring after the merger with  Seattle). FHFA staff said in preparation for their 2017 FHLBank board  analysis, they informally monitored the gender and minority status of the  additional independent director seats filled by the seven banks that  accepted the offer. Six of the seats were filled by women (of whom two  were minorities) and one seat was filled by a minority male, according to  FHFA staff. FHFA staff also told us the FHFA Director has some  discretion on the number of director seats based on an individual bank\u2019s  circumstances, including the request to maintain diversity. For example,  in 2018, one FHLBank requested to retain its female board vice chair to  help preserve diversity and institutional knowledge on its board. FHFA  granted the bank\u2019s request to keep the director for another year.", "FHFA staff told us that FHFA has considered issuing guidance in two  areas, but that these areas do not represent immediate priorities for their  diversity efforts. Specifically, FHFA OMWI staff stated that the office  intended to develop an examination module on board diversity, but this is  not the office\u2019s high priority for 2019. As previously noted, FHFA\u2019s current  examination manual includes a section that covers FHLBanks\u2019 workforce  and supplier diversity efforts. But, the manual does not consider board  diversity-related issues in as much detail as the supplier and workforce  section. For example, it covers FHFA\u2019s review of the quality of corporate  governance by board directors and mentions the consideration of  diversity for potential board director candidates. Also, the 2015 rule  amendments noted that the agency intended to develop guidance to  further elaborate on its expectations related to outreach activities and  strategies for the banks\u2019 board directors. FHFA staff told us that they  would like to focus on ongoing diversity efforts and gather more  information before starting new efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHLBank Boards Increased Share of Female Directors Since 2015, but Trends for Minority Directors Were Less Clear", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Share of Female Board Directors Increased from 2015 to October 2018, and Varied by FHLBank", "paragraphs": ["At the overall FHLBank board level, the share of female directors  increased from 18 percent (34 directors) in 2015 to 23 percent (44  directors) in October 2018 (see fig. 3).

One  bank collected gender and race/ethnicity as a voluntary section of its  annual board director skills assessment, which was filled out by each  director.

However, none of these  documents discussed processes for collecting board director  demographic data.

FHFA also stated in the amendments that it intended to use  the director data to establish a baseline to analyze future trends of board  diversity. Additionally, federal internal control standards state that agency  management should use quality information to achieve their objectives.  Quality information would include complete and accurate information that  management can use to make informed decisions in achieving key  objectives. By obtaining a better understanding of the different processes  FHLBanks use to collect board demographic data, FHFA and the banks  could better determine which processes or practices could contribute to  more complete data. For example, there may be practices that could help  banks more effectively follow up with directors who might have missed  the data collection forms or questions. More complete board demographic  data could help FHFA and the banks more effectively analyze data trends  over time and demonstrate the banks\u2019 efforts to maintain or increase  board diversity."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FHLBanks Report Some Challenges, but Have Taken Steps to Increase Their Board Diversity", "paragraphs": ["FHLBanks report some challenges that may slow or limit their efforts to  increase board diversity, which include low levels of diversity in the  financial sector; member institutions not prioritizing diversity; balancing  the need for diversity with retaining institutional knowledge; and  competition for women and minority candidates. Despite these  challenges, the banks have taken several steps to help increase board  diversity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FHLBank Boards Report Some Ongoing Challenges in Their Efforts to Increase Diversity, Especially among Member Directors", "paragraphs": ["According to FHLBank representatives, including board directors, the  FHLBank boards face challenges that may slow or limit their efforts to  increase diversity, including the following:  Low levels of diversity in the financial sector. Twelve representatives  from nine FHLBanks told us that the pool of eligible women and minority  board candidates is small in the banking and financial sector. For  example, five representatives emphasized that the majority of member  institutions have chief executive officers (CEO) who are white males. In  particular, one director told us that out of the hundreds of member  institutions affiliated with his FHLBank, he knew of only six female CEOs.  Directors representing five banks also noted that the pool of eligible,  diverse candidates in senior management positions in the financial  services sector can be even smaller in certain geographic areas. As a  result, it can be particularly challenging for some banks to fill member  director seats because, by statute, candidates for a given FHLBank board  must come from member institutions in the geographic area that the  board seat represents. For example, one director said that the pool of  such candidates is especially small in rural areas. In 2015, FHFA told us  that the overall low levels of diversity in the financial services sector,  including at FHLBank member institutions, increased the challenges for  improving board diversity.", "However, representatives of corporate governance organizations with  whom we spoke told us that the financial services sector does not face  unique challenges. Representatives also said that qualified women and  minority candidates are present in the marketplace. Our analysis of 2016  EEOC data found that the representation of women in senior  management in the financial services sector was within 1 percentage  point of the share of women in senior management in the private sector  overall, and minority representation was within 4 percentage points.", "Member institutions may not always prioritize diversity in director  elections. As previously discussed, member institutions nominate  member director candidates and vote for the member director and  independent director candidates. Ten representatives from eight  FHLBanks stated that member institutions may prioritize other  considerations over diversity when they nominate and vote on board  candidates, such as name recognition or a preference for candidates who  are CEOs. One director told us that the member banks may not be as  interested in diversity as the FHLBanks. Another director emphasized that  FHLBanks are trying to change attitudes and embed diversity in the  member institutions\u2019 operations. He characterized this process as a  marathon, not a sprint.", "Board directors with whom we spoke also stressed that FHFA regulations  do not allow the FHLBank boards to exert influence over how member  institutions vote. Board directors can emphasize the importance of  diversity to member institutions but cannot in their official capacity  campaign for specific candidates.", "Balancing the need for diversity with retaining institutional  knowledge. Directors from five banks told us that they aim to balance  bringing in new women or minority directors with retaining the valuable  institutional knowledge of incumbent directors. One director added that  new board directors face a steep learning curve. Thus, the directors at  some banks will recruit new directors only after allowing incumbent  directors to reach their maximum number of terms (which could translate  to several years). As we reported in 2015, FHFA staff acknowledged  that low turnover, term lengths, and the need to balance diversity with  required skills posed challenges to the FHLBank board diversity. In our  2016 report on women on corporate boards, relevant stakeholders  acknowledged this as a challenge because directors with longer tenure  possess knowledge about a company that newer directors cannot be  expected to possess.", "Competition for women and minority candidates. Board directors from  five FHLBanks told us that they face competition as they seek to recruit  women and minority candidates. For example, a director from one bank  told us that his board encouraged a potential female candidate to run for  a director seat. However, the candidate felt she could not accept the  opportunity because of her existing responsibilities on the boards of two  publicly traded companies.", "While these challenges can apply to member and independent directors,  representatives from all 11 FHLBanks emphasized that it can be  particularly challenging to find and elect female or minority member  directors. Our analysis of FHLBank board director data confirmed that  across 11 FHLBank boards, female representation was lower among  member directors (13 directors or 12 percent) than independent directors  (31 directors or 36 percent) in October 2018. FHFA stated in this review  and in 2015 that they are aware of the potential difficulty of identifying  diverse candidates for member directors and that greater board diversity  likely would be achieved with independent directors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHLBanks Developed Practices and Strategies to Help Increase Board Diversity", "paragraphs": ["Since 2015, FHLBanks have taken actions to help increase board  diversity, including developing and implementing practices and strategies  that target board diversity in general and member directors specifically.  As previously discussed, at the request of FHFA, the banks established  the Bank Presidents Conference Board Diversity Task Force. The  purpose of the task force is to develop recommendations for advancing  board diversity and to enhance collaboration and information sharing  across FHLBank boards. Each bank is represented by a board director or  the bank president. Representatives meet regularly to discuss challenges,  recommend practices, and receive training. One task force representative  told us that her participation on the taskforce has helped demonstrate to  her board and bank that diversity matters. Others mentioned that the  ability to share practices and learn from other banks was a great benefit.", "As part of its work, the task force developed a list of practices that  FHLBanks have used or could use to improve board diversity (see text  box). According to bank staff, the list was approved by the presidents of  each bank and distributed to bank staff. The practices can be generally  summarized into three categories\u2014emphasizing the importance of  diversity; assessing skills diversity; and seeking new ways to find  candidates\u2014which are generally similar to the commonly cited practices  for improving board diversity we identified in 2015.", "Summary of Practices Developed by Bank Presidents Conference Board Diversity  Task Force of the Federal Home Loan Banks  Include references to diversity on the bank website, in appropriate publications, in  presentations about the bank, and particularly in all election materials.  Educate current board members on the business case for diversity.  Educate member institutions on the business case for diversity through member  meetings, newsletter articles, etc. to help develop a more diverse member base and  help groom new leaders.  Perform a skills assessment of current board skills and areas of expertise and  determine skill sets and expertise needed.", "Review the term limits of current directors and determine the possible loss of  continuity if multiple incumbent directors leave the board in a short period of time.  Build a pool of diverse member and independent candidates.", "Conduct outreach to regional and national business organizations, such as trade  associations, women and minority business groups, and professional organizations,  to ask for referrals of possible candidates and form relationships prior to a board  election.  Seek an additional independent board seat from the Federal Housing Finance  Agency.", "Example of Diversity Statement in an  Election Announcement for a Federal  Home Loan Bank  The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York  (FHLBNY) included the following statement in  its 2017 director election announcement  package:  \u201cThe FHLBNY\u2019s Board of Directors consists of  a talented group of dedicated individuals that  benefits from, among other things,  demographic (including gender and racial)  diversity, and we expect that this will continue  in the future. As you consider potential  nominations for Member Directorships and  give thought to persons who might be  interested in Independent Directorships,  please keep diversity in mind. Your  participation in this year\u2019s Director Election  process is greatly appreciated, and will help  continue to keep the Board and the FHLBNY  diverse and strong.\u201d", "Emphasizing the importance of diversity. All 11 FHLBanks included  statements in their 2017 election announcements that encouraged voting  member institutions to consider diversity during the board election  process. Six banks expressly addressed gender, racial, and ethnic  diversity in their announcements. One female director with whom we  spoke said that she was encouraged to run for a board seat after reading  an election announcement in 2013 that specifically called for candidates  with diverse backgrounds. All 11 FHLBanks also referenced their  commitment to diversity on their websites, including posting diversity and  inclusion policies, describing diversity missions, or including board  statements on diversity.", "Directors we interviewed from all 11 FHLBanks told us that their bank  conducted or planned to conduct diversity training for board directors. The  training sessions covered topics such as the business case for diversity  and unconscious bias. Additionally, board directors from two banks  discussed efforts to encourage member institutions to increase diversity,  such as holding a panel on the importance of diversity at the annual  member conference. In 2015, we found that demonstrating a commitment  to diversity in ways similar to these is a first step towards addressing  diversity in an organization.", "Assessing skills diversity. Nine FHLBanks performed board skills  assessments annually or biennially. These assessments asked directors  to evaluate their knowledge of specific topic areas. FHFA regulation  allows each bank to annually conduct a skills and experience assessment  and, if applicable, inform members before elections of particular  qualifications that could benefit the board. In 2015, we found that  conducting a skills assessment was a commonly cited practice for boards  seeking to increase representation of women and minorities. The other  two FHLBanks conducted board self-assessments annually, focused on  board effectiveness and organization, but did not evaluate the skills of  their individual directors. All 11 FHLBanks also reported regularly  reviewing the remaining terms of current directors to determine the  possible loss of continuity.", "Seeking new ways to find candidates. Representatives from 10  FHLBanks noted that their banks maintain a pool of diverse director  candidates for future open positions. FHLBanks described using various  methods to build these pools. All 11 banks described outreach to trade  organizations, industry groups, universities, and nonprofit organizations  when looking to identify women and minority candidates. For example,  FHLBank of Pittsburgh identified 15 organizations in its district that  actively promote diversity and the inclusion of women and minorities in  business to specifically target in 2017. Directors from seven banks also  reported hiring a search firm or consultant to help them identify women  and minority candidates. These activities are consistent with commonly  cited practices described in our 2015 work that boards can use to reach  out beyond the typical pool of applicants.", "As previously mentioned, seven FHLBanks requested or were offered an  additional independent director seat by FHFA. According to FHFA staff,  four of the seats were filled by white females, two were filled by minority  females, and one was filled by a minority male.", "Example of a Diversity Practice Focused on  Member Directors  In 2017, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San  Francisco developed a Member Director  Diversity Outreach Plan. The plan included  eight steps that provide timelines and specific  assignments for directors and bank  management. For example, steps include  conducting early outreach to trade  organizations where women and minority  directors might participate, individual director  outreach to potential candidates, and  developing a list of prospective candidates in  case of vacancy appointments. Following the  implementation of this plan, member  institutions elected one female director and  one minority director to fill the vacant member  director seats.", "Fill interim seats with women and minority candidates. FHLBanks  can appoint women or minority candidates to fill interim member  director seats. By regulation, when a director leaves the board in mid- term, the remaining board directors may elect a new director for the  remaining portion of the term. For example, the FHLBank of  Pittsburgh reported electing a minority director in 2017 to fill a vacant  member director seat. One director told us that when a female or  minority director is elected for an interim term, the election increases  the likelihood of the director being elected by the member institutions  for a following full term.", "Conduct mentoring and outreach. FHLBank board directors also  can use their personal networks to conduct outreach and mentor  potential candidates. Current directors can pledge to identify and  encourage potential women and minority candidates to run for the  board. For example, one director told us that his board emphasizes  the need for directors to pay attention to potential women and minority  candidates they meet. This director said he had personally contacted  qualified potential candidates and asked them to run. Another director  noted that women and minority directors are likely to know other  qualified candidates with diverse backgrounds. These directors can  identify and refer individuals in their networks. Another director  emphasized the importance of member directors conducting outreach  to member institutions. Member directors have the most interaction  with the leadership of member institutions and can engage and  educate them on the importance of nominating and electing diverse  member directors.", "Look beyond CEOs. Additionally, FHLBanks can search for women  and minority candidates by looking beyond member bank CEOs. By  regulation, member directors can be any officer or director of a  member institution, but there is a tendency to favor CEOs for board  positions, according to board directors, representatives of corporate  governance organizations, and academic researchers with whom we  spoke. The likelihood of identifying a woman or minority candidate  increases when member institutions look beyond CEOs to other  officers, such as chief financial officers or board directors. For  example, the FHLBank of Des Moines expanded its outreach to  women and minority candidates to include board directors at member  institutions. In 2017, a female director who is a board member of her  member institution was elected."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 emphasized the  importance of diversity at the FHLBank System, and FHFA and  FHLBanks have undertaken efforts to encourage diversity at the banks\u2019  boards.

While FHFA regulation allows directors to choose not to report  this information, the banks\u2019 varying data collection processes did not  always allow banks to accurately account for missing information (as in  the case of directors forgetting to respond to the data questions or fill out  forms). Reviewing the processes the banks use to collect the  demographic data could help FHFA and the banks identify practices to  produce data that would better allow FHFA to track trends in board  diversity.

While diversity has many dimensions, this  report focuses on gender, race, and ethnicity.", "To understand the steps FHFA has taken to encourage FHLBank board  diversity, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations related to FHLBank  boards, including FHFA regulations on director elections and diversity  reporting requirements. For example, we reviewed the relevant sections  in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 pertaining to FHFA  and the banks and FHFA\u2019s 2010 Minority and Women Inclusion rule and  its 2015 amendments. We also reviewed other FHFA and bank  documentation related to board director elections and diversity  considerations. For example, we reviewed FHFA\u2019s annual board director  analysis for 2016\u20132018 to identify actions the agency took to help  maintain or increase the number of female or minority directors at the  FHLBank boards. Additionally, we interviewed FHFA staff to understand  the agency\u2019s role in overseeing FHLBank board diversity and the  agency\u2019s efforts in helping the banks maintain or increase board diversity.", "To describe trends in FHLBank board diversity, we analyzed gender and  race/ethnicity data self-reported by board directors in FHLBanks\u2019 annual  reports to FHFA as of the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017. The banks\u2019  annual reports use the gender and race/ethnicity classifications from the  Employer Information Report (EEO-1) of the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEO-1 report race/ethnicity  categories are Hispanic or Latino, White, Black or African-American,  Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, Native American or  Alaska Native, and Two or More Races. The Hispanic or Latino category  in EEO-1 incorporates Hispanics or Latinos of all races. For our report,  we used the following categories: Hispanic, White, African-American,  Asian, and \u201cOther.\u201d We included only non-Hispanic members under  White, African-American, Asian, and \u201cOther.\u201d We included Asian  American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander under the Asian category,  and we included Native American or Alaskan Native, and Two or More  Races under \u201cOther.\u201d", "To provide more recent data on gender composition, we also analyzed  data on the gender of directors who were on boards as of October 17,  2018. Specifically, we compiled a list of board directors who started or  continued their terms on the boards in 2018, based on board director  information from the banks\u2019 2017 Form 10-K filings with the Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filings include the names and  brief biographies of board directors, which we used to derive the gender  data for directors. For example, if directors were referred to as \u201cMr.\u201d in the  Form 10-Ks, we counted them as male. If they were referred to as \u201cMs.,\u201d  we counted them as female. We then confirmed with each FHLBank the  compiled list of board directors, as of October 17, 2018. Because some  directors did not self-identify their gender in 2015\u20132017 annual reports,  we also used information in the banks\u2019 2014\u20132016 Form 10-Ks to derive  data on the gender of the banks\u2019 board directors. As a result, we were  able to report the gender information for all FHLBank board of directors  from 2015 through October 2018. We separately requested the names of  the chairs and vice chairs for the committees of each bank\u2019s board as of  October 26, 2018. We then derived the gender of the chairs and vice  chairs for these committees based on the information in the banks\u2019 Form  10-Ks.", "To analyze data on board director race/ethnicity, we relied on FHLBanks\u2019  2015\u20132017 annual reports. However, we were not able to use banks\u2019  Form 10-Ks to derive data on race/ethnicity for board directors who did  not self-identify race/ethnicity in the annual reports because the 10-Ks do  not include such information. We also requested and analyzed from each  bank data on the gender and race/ethnicity of their board chair and vice  chair as of October 17, 2018. We assessed the reliability of the data from  the banks\u2019 annual reports and Form 10-Ks through electronic testing, a  review of documentation, and interviews with knowledgeable agency  staff, and we determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for  describing the overall trends and composition of gender and race/ethnicity  at the FHLBank boards, except the data for directors who did not self- identify their race/ethnicity, as discussed in the report.", "We also compared the most recently available demographic information  on FHLBank board directors with the demographic composition of senior  management in the financial services industry and the overall private  sector (excluding financial services), based on data from the 2016 EEO-1  report from EEOC. Senior management in the financial services industry  represents a pool of comparable candidates that could provide directors  for FHLBank boards. The EEO-1 report data are annually submitted to  EEOC by most private-sector firms with 100 or more employees. The  data include gender and race/ethnicity of the employees by job category.  We included workforce from all sites of multi-establishment companies  (companies with multiple locations). Consequently, the analysis included  in this report may not match the analysis found on EEOC\u2019s website, which  excludes workforce from sites of multi-establishment companies with less  than 50 employees. In our analysis of senior management-level diversity  in the financial services sector, we included companies in the finance and  insurance industry categorized under code 52 of the North American  Industry Classification System. We assessed the reliability of the data  from the EEO-1 report through electronic testing, a review of  documentation, and interviews with knowledgeable agency staff. We  determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for comparing the  composition of gender and race/ethnicity in the financial services sector  and the overall private sector with that of the FHLBank boards.  Furthermore, to provide a general comparison of FHLBank board diversity  composition with corporate boards of U.S. companies, we reviewed  research that discussed data related to diversity at corporate boards of  U.S. companies in recent years.", "In addition, from each FHLBank, we requested and reviewed the  instrument they used to collect gender and race/ethnicity information from  their board directors. We also obtained and reviewed information on the  methods the banks used to distribute and collect the data collection  instruments, and any instructions FHFA provided to the banks or that the  banks provided to the board directors on collecting this information. We  reviewed relevant information from the banks\u2019 annual reports and relevant  regulations on collecting and submitting board directors\u2019 gender and  race/ethnicity information. We also compared the banks\u2019 data collection  processes with relevant federal internal control standards.", "To determine the challenges the FHLBanks face and practices they use  to recruit and maintain a diverse board, we interviewed staff at FHLBanks  and FHFA to learn about the Bank Presidents Conference Board Diversity  Task Force and the list of diversity practices compiled by the task force.  We reviewed and analyzed the banks\u2019 2017 annual reports to learn about  the most recent practices the banks implemented. We also reviewed the  banks\u2019 websites and bank documents, such as election materials and  skills assessments for all 11 banks. In addition, we conducted semi- structured interviews with 10 board directors and one bank president, who  act as representatives on the system-wide board diversity task force. We  also conducted semi-structured interviews with a nongeneralizable  sample of FHLBank board chairs from six banks (Atlanta, Boston, Des  Moines, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Topeka). We selected these  banks to achieve variation in board diversity composition (share of  women and minority directors), asset size, and geographic locations. In  these interviews, we asked directors and staff about the challenges their  banks faced as they sought to increase or maintain diverse boards. We  also asked about their participation on the task force, the task force  diversity practices, and any other practices their banks had implemented  related to board diversity efforts.", "To determine if the task force diversity practices generally followed  commonly cited practices used to improve board diversity, we compared  the task force practices against commonly cited practices we identified in  previous work in 2015. To verify that the practices we identified in 2015  were still relevant and useful, we interviewed three academics and  representatives of four organizations that advocate for board diversity,  including gender and racial/ethnic diversity. We selected these external  stakeholders based on their research and experience related to  increasing board diversity and referrals from others knowledgeable in the  field. In our interviews with external stakeholders, we also asked about  the challenges that financial organizations or other publicly traded  companies may face as they work to increase or maintain board diversity.
