In the fiscal year 2017 congressional justification (CJ), IRS linked requests for increased funding to themes and included details on how much would be funded by each appropriation account. However, IRS did not provide data on how much it spends in support of each theme or the amount of funding needed to maintain current levels by theme. IRS is working to develop such data, but officials cited challenges with data availability and tracking spending by themes. Such information would provide transparency on the current funding levels which assist Congress in making informed budget decisions.", "User fee spending . IRS has permanent, indefinite authority to obligate and spend user fee collections, which it obligates as part of its budget execution process. IRS's user fee spend plan must be approved by both the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget. IRS was directed to wait 30 days following the submission of the user fee spend plan to Congress before obligating funds. As seen in the table, planned user fee spending increased more than $220 million (79 percent) between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. Of the $509 million planned user fee obligations in fiscal year 2016, the largest amounts are for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ($204 million) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ($62 million).", "Information technology data . The President's budget requested $2.8 billion for IRS's information technology (IT) investments which accounted for 21 percent of IRS's budget request for fiscal year 2017. Instead of presenting its IT investment data in its CJ, IRS moved them to a Treasury website. This is consistent with other Treasury bureaus and was intended to provide time for an enhanced data review process. However, despite the review process, Treasury did not detect an error which resulted in IRS underreporting its total IT investments by about $4 million.

IRS agreed with the recommendation we  made in June 2012, but stated it had other  methods in place to document delivered  functionality of a project throughout the life- cycle. However, these methods did not  provide a quantitative measure of  performance. In responding to a related report  we issued in April 2014, IRS maintained its  position and therefore did not take action to  address the recommendation. In the  December 2015 quarterly report on  information technology to Congress, however,  IRS proposed a solution for one investment:  specifically, it listed specific \u201cscope elements\u201d  for the Return Review Program investment  and identified the elements it had implemented  to date. In addition, during our recent review of  IRS\u2019s major IT investments, we found that IRS  had developed a quantitative measure of  scope for two investments, although we noted  that the measure could be improved by  accounting for the work performed by IRS staff  in accordance with best practices  (GAO-16-545). The measure used in the  quarterly report to Congress and the one we  noted during our June 2016 review are  positive steps. Similar, continued efforts by  IRS would help fully address our  recommendation to develop a quantitative  measure of scope for all major IT investments.", "Developing a cost  estimate that meets  additional best practices,  will foster accountability,  improve insight, and  provide objective  information. capture actual costs and use  them as a basis for future  updates.

In February 2015, IRS released  version 3 of the PPACA cost estimate, which  reflects best practices to a greater extent.  However, four elements of this  recommendation remain open. IRS improved  the variance from the prior estimate, but IRS  has not improved its practices related to the  use of earned value management, risk and  uncertainty analysis, or validating the  estimate.
