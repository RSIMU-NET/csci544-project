Since the Arctic region has a substantial maritime domain, the Coast Guard plays a significant role in Arctic policy implementation and enforcement. GAO was asked to examine the Coast Guard's responsibilities, capabilities, and plans for the Arctic. This report discusses, among other things, the extent to which the Coast Guard has (1) reported progress in implementing its Arctic strategy, (2) assessed its Arctic capabilities and taken actions to mitigate any identified gaps, and (3) reported being able to carry out polar icebreaking operations. GAO reviewed relevant laws and policies and Coast Guard documents that detail its Arctic plans.

For example, the Coast Guard reported conducting exercises related to Arctic oil spill response and search and rescue, and facilitating the formation of a safety committee in the Arctic, among other tasks in its strategy. To track the status of these efforts, the Coast Guard is developing a web-based tool and anticipates finalizing the tool in mid-2016.", "The Coast Guard assessed its capability to perform its Arctic missions and identified various capability gaps\u2014including communications, infrastructure, and icebreaking, and has worked to mitigate these gaps with its Arctic partners, such as other federal agencies. Specifically, Coast Guard officials stated that the agency's actions to implement the various Arctic strategies and carry out annual Arctic operations have helped to mitigate Arctic capability gaps. However, the Coast Guard has not systematically assessed the extent to which its actions agency-wide have helped to mitigate these gaps. Coast Guard officials attributed this, in part, to not being able to unilaterally close the gaps. While mitigating these gaps requires joint efforts among Arctic partners, the Coast Guard has taken actions in the Arctic that are specific to its missions and therefore has responsibility for assessing the extent to which these actions have helped to mitigate capability gaps. By systematically assessing and measuring its progress, the Coast Guard will better understand the status of these gaps and be better positioned to effectively plan its Arctic operations.", "The Coast Guard has been unable to fulfill some of its polar icebreaking responsibilities with its aging icebreaker fleet, which currently includes two active polar icebreakers. In 2011 and 2012, the Coast Guard was unable to maintain assured, year-round access to the Arctic and did not meet 4 of 11 requests for polar icebreaking services. With its one active heavy icebreaker\u2014which has greater icebreaking capability\u2014nearing the end of its service life, the Coast Guard initiated a program in 2013 to acquire a new one and is working to determine the optimal acquisition strategy. However, the Coast Guard's efforts to acquire an icebreaker, whether by lease or purchase, will be limited by legal and operational requirements. In addition, current projections show that the Coast Guard is likely to have a 3- to 6-year gap in its heavy icebreaking capability before a new icebreaker becomes operational, as shown below.

The retreat of polar sea ice in the  Arctic, as reported by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center,  combined with an expected increase in human activity there, has  heightened U.S. and other nations\u2019 interests in the Arctic region in recent  years. Diminishing sea ice has made some Arctic waters navigable for  longer periods and, as a result, may contribute to new economic  opportunities in commercial shipping, resource exploitation (i.e., oil and  gas exploration, mineral extraction), tourism, and commercial fishing.  Growth in these commercial activities in the Arctic could also increase the  risk of maritime accidents, such as ship collisions or oil spills. Growth in  Arctic activity is also expected to increase demand for services such as  search and rescue, and maritime navigation support, which can be a  challenge to provide given the harsh and unpredictable weather and vast  distances that responding agencies must travel to reach the Arctic. U.S.  interest in the Arctic was further heightened in anticipation of the United  States taking over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council\u2014a voluntary  intergovernmental forum\u2014in 2015. With this heightened focus, various  Arctic strategies and policies have been released by the White House and  other federal entities to supplement long-standing U.S. Arctic policy. For  example, the White House issued an Arctic national strategy in 2013 and  its corresponding implementation plan in 2014. The U.S. Coast Guard,  within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), also plays a  significant role in U.S. Arctic policy and thus has issued its corresponding  Arctic strategy and implementation plan.", "We have previously examined emerging issues and challenges for the  United States in the Arctic. For example, in 2010, GAO reported that the  Coast Guard faced several challenges operating in the Arctic\u2014including  limited maritime domain awareness and a lack of communication  infrastructure\u2014but was taking actions to address these challenges.  Additionally, in March 2014, we examined U.S. Arctic maritime  infrastructure and the actions taken by federal, state, and local  stakeholders to plan for future U.S. Arctic maritime infrastructure  investments. In that report, we analyzed the Committee on the Marine  Transportation System\u2019s 2013 study which prioritized actions for  developing U.S. Arctic maritime infrastructure. Also in 2014, we  assessed U.S. involvement in the Arctic Council to help clarify the  direction of future U.S. participation and to position the United States for a  successful Arctic Council chairmanship, which began in 2015. In 2015,  we reported that the Department of Defense (DOD) expects to play a  supporting role to other federal agencies involved in the Arctic based on  its assessments of a low level of military threat.

We also reviewed  national strategies and plans that delineated Arctic-specific tasks to the  Coast Guard and which the Coast Guard also considers to be binding,  pursuant to available resources. As such, we analyzed the National  Ocean Policy Implementation Plan and the White House\u2019s National  Strategy for the Arctic Region and its implementation plan. We also  interviewed the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Special Representative for the  Arctic to discuss U.S. strategic priorities in the Arctic.

In addition, we  compared how the Coast Guard monitors its efforts to help mitigate  capability gaps with best practices for agency monitoring as detailed in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. To determine  the extent to which the Coast Guard has utilized data to plan for Arctic  operations, and what, if any, challenges it faces, we analyzed Coast  Guard Arctic Shield planning documents, such as the annual Arctic Shield  operations orders and after-action reports (AAR) from 2012 to 2015\u2014all  available reports since the Arctic Shield operation was formalized. To  determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is currently able to carry  out polar icebreaking operations, and what plans, if any, it has for  maintaining this capability, we analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s reports related  to mission needs in the Arctic and icebreaker acquisition and the number  of internal and interagency requests received and fulfilled for polar  icebreaking services.

Further, Coast Guard officials stated  that the capability gaps identified above do not completely impair or  eliminate the ability to perform operations. For example, while  communications can be a challenge in remote regions, the risk of lost  communications can be mitigated by, for example, using multiple assets  working together to mitigate risk if lost communications are anticipated. In  addition, Coast Guard officials stated that lack of infrastructure and  logistical and communications challenges have been mitigated through  the use of offshore cutter-based command and control platforms, shore- based mobile command and control platforms, and seasonal air and  communications capabilities through leased facilities and deployable  assets.", "Coast Guard officials stated that, given its current activity levels, its Arctic  presence being mobile and seasonal, and its ability to leverage partners\u2019  resources, it has had sufficient resources to fulfill current Arctic  responsibilities.

Coast Guard officials  stated they will reassess their approach as Arctic activity and resulting  mission requirements change over time, but if Arctic activity continues to  increase, as anticipated, they may have insufficient resources to meet  expanded Arctic requirements with current funding levels. Coast Guard  officials also stated that federal efforts are underway to better understand  capabilities and these efforts often include tasking or decision making  outside of the Coast Guard. For example, Coast Guard officials stated  that until national priorities are better articulated by the AESC, the Coast  Guard will not be able to identify all of its Arctic requirements.

In addition, as discussed later in this report, the Coast Guard is also  taking action to address the icebreaking capacity gap.", "In addition to the implementing tasks from the Arctic strategies that can  help mitigate capability gaps, Coast Guard officials reported that they  utilize Arctic Shield as the primary operational method to better  understand agency capabilities and associated gaps in the Arctic and to  take actions to help mitigate them. The Coast Guard Research,  Development, Test, and Evaluation Program has also helped to test  Arctic capabilities, such as navigation systems\u2014in part through Arctic  Shield operations. The Coast Guard reported that upon the publication of  the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic Strategy, it aligned its Arctic Shield operations  with the strategy\u2019s objectives. According to our review of the Coast  Guard\u2019s Arctic Shield operational planning documents and AARs, among  other actions, the Coast Guard executed select Coast Guard missions;  tested a variety of equipment, technologies, and processes; conducted  internal training exercises; and improved maritime domain awareness by  conducting operations, research, and outreach to partners. For example,  during Arctic Shield 2015, the Coast Guard tested communications  equipment belonging to DOD, extending communications capabilities  further north than previously possible. During Arctic Shield 2014, the  Coast Guard tested response equipment and communications systems to  assess capabilities and refine Arctic resource requirements. According to  Coast Guard officials, they will continue with mobile and seasonal  operations, which will provide them with opportunities to continue  assessing and testing operational capabilities.", "Although the Coast Guard has reported that these various actions have  improved its Arctic capabilities, it has not systematically assessed the  extent to which these actions have helped mitigate the identified  capability gaps. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  provide that ongoing monitoring should occur in the course of normal  operations and should help ensure that the findings of reviews, such as  the capability gaps identified in the previously mentioned reports, are  resolved. This monitoring should be built into the Coast Guard\u2019s  operations, performed continually, and be responsive to change.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also calls for  management to establish performance measures and indicators that help  ensure that management\u2019s directives are carried out. Coast Guard  officials stated that they have not systematically assessed their progress  in mitigating capability gaps, or developed measures for them, because  the Coast Guard cannot unilaterally mitigate these gaps, not all of them  are easily measurable, and because not enough is known about them.  However, while taking actions to help mitigate these capability gaps  requires joint efforts among Arctic partners, the Coast Guard has taken  actions in the Arctic that are specific to its missions and therefore has  responsibility for assessing the extent to which its actions have helped to  mitigate its part of these capability gaps. Assessing relevant information  on how its actions have helped to mitigate these gaps could also increase  agency knowledge about capabilities.", "Coast Guard officials also stated that they track some of their Arctic  activities through various mechanisms, but do not assess how these  actions have helped to mitigate capability gaps. For example, the Coast  Guard\u2019s AARs for Arctic Shield document information on activities that the  Coast Guard has conducted during each annual operation, as well as any  lessons learned, key observations, best practices, challenges, and  recommendations. In addition, the Coast Guard reported it has efforts  underway to track its progress in implementing the national and Coast  Guard Arctic strategies which will help it to more systematically track  Arctic activities, as discussed previously. But, it does not plan to assess  how the completion of these activities will affect capability gaps. While the  Coast Guard\u2019s various tracking efforts may inform the Coast Guard about  its overall status in conducting Arctic activities, it does not provide a  systematic assessment, across the agency, of how these actions have  helped to mitigate the capability gaps\u2014efforts which also help it  determine resource needs. Systematically assessing the impact of its  actions agency-wide\u2014including using measures for gauging its progress,  when feasible\u2014is critical for the Coast Guard to be able to fully assess  the status of its efforts to help mitigate the various Arctic capability gaps.  By systematically assessing its own progress, the Coast Guard will better  understand the status of the gaps and be better positioned to effectively  plan its Arctic operations, including its allocation of resources and  prioritization of activities to help mitigate them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Affect Planning for Arctic Shield Activities", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard officials stated several factors affect their Arctic Shield  planning, including data limitations, uncertainty surrounding future Arctic  activity, and limited resources. To carry out Arctic Shield, the Coast  Guard manages a year-round process to plan, execute, and evaluate this  annual operation. The Coast Guard also reported that this operation is to  be scalable to match the level and type of threats and risks, opportunities,  and mission responsibilities in the Arctic each year, and flexible to  accommodate varying needs for Coast Guard services and the availability  of resources. As part of its year-round planning process, Coast Guard  officials hold a series of planning meetings with internal and external  stakeholders, during which they finalize operational documents.  According to the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic strategy implementation plan,  outreach activities conducted during this planning process are to include  regular engagement with tribal communities to ensure the operation does  not interfere with tribal rights, interests, or subsistence activities. In  addition, following each year\u2019s Arctic Shield operation, Coast Guard  officials assess the operation, develop lessons learned, and propose  changes for the next year\u2019s operation. The Coast Guard also produces an  AAR each year, which describes the activities conducted during Arctic  Shield that year and discusses challenges encountered and lessons  learned.", "Coast Guard officials stated that when planning the size and scope of  Arctic Shield operations they use information learned from prior  operations, as well as review a wide variety of external sources that  analyze present conditions and forecast future conditions. Specifically,  these officials stated that they review commercial trends analyses, ice  and weather forecasting, vessel tracking data, information on local fish  stocks and subsistence hunting times, and law enforcement intelligence.  Because commercial activity is the primary determinant of Arctic maritime  activity levels, Coast Guard officials stated that they also review analyses  that predict trends in oil and gas, mining, tourism, shipping, and other  commercial sectors. Coast Guard officials reported that they discuss  this information with various federal, state, industry, academic, and not- for-profit entities.", "Although Coast Guard officials reported using these data, they also stated  that one factor affecting their planning for Arctic operations is the limited  amount of data on regional activity, which they attributed to various  factors. For example, because Arctic activity is limited, changes in year- to-year data do not always provide useful statistics. Further, the Coast  Guard cannot always access some companies\u2019 proprietary information on  Arctic commercial trends, which also limits the robustness of the Coast  Guard\u2019s data sources. In addition, Coast Guard officials stated that recent  commercial marine traffic in the Arctic has been variable rather than  trending predictably, providing inconsistent data trends. As a result, Coast  Guard officials stated that there are limited data to help them make  planning decisions and as a result they are taking steps to improve their  data collection on their own operations and as well as continuing to  develop partnerships to collect external data. For example, during the  course of our review, the Coast Guard began collecting data on its aircraft  and cutter resource hours expended on 2015 Arctic Shield activities to  improve its mission management and resource allocation. The Coast  Guard also established an Arctic Information Fusion Center as part of its  2015 Arctic Shield operation, which helped to track the number of  deployed Coast Guard personnel. Further, Coast Guard officials reported  that they are working toward more systematically documenting AAR  information\u2014including lessons learned, best practices, and  recommended improvements\u2014to better track the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic  activities. Specifically, Coast Guard officials stated that they are starting  to accomplish this through their Contingency Preparedness System, the  Coast Guard\u2019s web-based data management tool that links, among other  items, after action reporting and corrective actions. Although the Coast  Guard designed the Contingency Preparedness System as a tracking tool  for discrete exercises, not large operations like Arctic Shield which  incorporate multiple exercises, Coast Guard officials stated that they are  determining how to best use this system\u2014and have begun to enter  data\u2014to better track Arctic Shield activities and increase their senior  leadership\u2019s awareness of Arctic challenges and opportunities. Coast  Guard officials reported that they are also identifying ways to work with  other agencies to better collect data. For example, Coast Guard officials  stated they participate in conference calls with Arctic stakeholders that  provide information on subsistence hunting activities to help with their  planning. Coast Guard officials stated they continue to look for  opportunities to gain better information on Arctic activities.", "The Coast Guard also faces inherent uncertainty surrounding drivers of  future Arctic maritime activity and the potential corresponding increase in  commercial activity in the region. These drivers of activity include the  pace and effects of climate change in the Arctic and economic trends,  and could affect the need for Coast Guard services. Many projections  about future Arctic activity look forward only 2 to 3 years because of this  uncertainty. According to Coast Guard officials, the uncertainty of these  drivers of maritime activity render long-term planning beyond the 10-year  time frame particularly difficult, and as a result, the Coast Guard must  remain flexible to adjust its planning as conditions change.", "Limited resources is another factor that Coast Guard officials have  reported affecting their Arctic planning process. Coast Guard officials  stated that they must make tradeoffs on how to best deploy limited  resources and among potential courses of action. Further, officials  noted that funding uncertainty has also affected Coast Guard planning  and operations for Arctic Shield. For example, the Coast Guard was not  able to establish its forward operating base in the preferred location  because funding for Arctic Shield 2015 had not been secured before a  private entity leased that space. As a result, the Coast Guard stationed  aircraft for monitoring Arctic activity at an alternate location farther from  active oil rigs, which increased its travel time to sites being monitored.  Coast Guard officials stated that despite these challenges, they have  received support from Coast Guard leadership and were able to achieve  Arctic Shield objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Been Unable to Fulfill All Polar Icebreaking Operations and Is Taking Steps to Begin Icebreaker Acquisition", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Been Unable to Reliably Fulfill Polar Icebreaking Responsibilities with Current Fleet", "paragraphs": ["Various requirements drive the Coast Guard\u2019s icebreaking mission  responsibilities, and since 2010 the Coast Guard has been unable to fulfill  some of these responsibilities. The Coast Guard\u2019s icebreaking  responsibilities are based in statute, presidential directive, strategies, and  interagency agreements. Under statutory law, the Coast Guard has  responsibility for operating the nation\u2019s polar icebreaker fleet, which  supports the Coast Guard in carrying out its missions. For example, the  Coast Guard\u2019s icebreaker fleet supports scientific research as part of its  Ice Operations mission and promotes maritime security as part of its  Defense Readiness mission, according to a 2013 Coast Guard report. In  addition, the goals and activities set forth in the National Strategy for the  Arctic Region and the 2009 presidential directive on the Arctic region  drive the Coast Guard\u2019s need to maintain the ability to project a sovereign  presence in the Arctic\u2014a standard which requires the use of a polar  icebreaker at certain times when seasonal ice covers large portions of the  Arctic region. The Coast Guard\u2019s icebreaking responsibilities are also  derived from interagency agreements that commit it to providing  icebreaking services to other departments and agencies in support of  various strategic and scientific missions, including national defense. For  example, the Coast Guard assumed responsibility for the Navy\u2019s  icebreaker fleet in1965 and a memorandum of agreement first signed in  2008 identifies how the Coast Guard\u2019s icebreakers would be used to  support DOD. More recently, Coast Guard officials stated that the  President\u2019s September 2015 announcement about national priorities in  the Arctic further emphasized the importance of the nation\u2019s capability for  year-round access to this region. Appendix III provides a selection of the  laws and policies that are cited as sources for the Coast Guard\u2019s need to  maintain polar icebreaking capability.", "Coast Guard officials reported being able to minimally complete agency  polar icebreaking responsibilities, that is, carrying out the annual  McMurdo Station resupply in the Antarctic region and scientific research  in the Arctic, with two functional icebreakers. However, when neither the  Polar Sea nor the Polar Star was active in 2011 and 2012, the Coast  Guard did not maintain assured, year-round access to both the Arctic and  Antarctic, as the Healy cannot reach ice-covered areas with more than 4  \u00bd feet of ice. For these years, and in prior and subsequent years, the  National Science Foundation chartered foreign icebreakers to support the  resupply of the McMurdo Station, although National Science Foundation  officials reported that this was challenging. Coast Guard officials stated  that a short-term charter would not meet the Coast Guard\u2019s needs in the  Antarctic region because a sovereign U.S. presence can only be  established by a vessel that is available year-round, able to fly the U.S.  flag, and perform Antarctic treaty inspections. Further, the Coast Guard  has set a target of meeting 100 percent of its internal and interagency  requests for polar icebreaking, and it annually calculates its success rate  in meeting this target. In the last 6 years of available data (fiscal years  2010 through 2015), the Coast Guard reported that it failed to attain this  target for 3 years\u2014primarily when neither heavy icebreaker was  operational. Specifically, the Coast Guard was unable to complete 5 out  of 26 requests for polar icebreaking, including 4 out of 11 requests in  2011 and 2012 when both heavy icebreakers were unavailable. These  unfulfilled requests included support for the resupply of McMurdo Station,  Arctic Shield activities, and an Arctic science deployment, some of which  would have required weeks or months of icebreaker use. See Table 2  below for specific results.", "The Coast Guard reported in acquisition documentation that the addition  of one heavy icebreaker would allow it to maintain current icebreaking  capacity by replacing the Polar Star after its useful service life ends in 4 to  7 years. However, the Coast Guard reported that increased heavy  icebreaking capacity is needed to fully meet requirements in the Arctic  and Antarctic regions. Although record lows for recent summer and early  autumn sea ice extent have made seasonal maritime navigation more  feasible in the Arctic, the Coast Guard reported that polar icebreakers can  still be necessary during these seasons to conduct research or to assist  other vessels. Winter sea travel is also still severely limited due to  extensive ice coverage across the Arctic region, necessitating heavy  icebreaker assistance. Furthermore, although slightly decreased in 2015,  the maximum ice extent in the Antarctic has expanded in recent years.  The Coast Guard reported that a medium icebreaker, like the Healy, can  complete many of the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic missions, but cannot operate  independently in the presence of thick ice. Even with melting Arctic ice,  Coast Guard officials noted that it would be risky to assume that a  medium icebreaker would be sufficient to provide year-round access to  the Arctic. In addition, Coast Guard officials anticipate that heavy  icebreaking capability may continue to be necessary in an operating  environment with much less ice overall because ice sometimes piles up,  creating thicker ice. Because only heavy polar icebreakers can provide  assured, year-round access to both polar regions, the Coast Guard  maintains that it must have heavy icebreaking capability to fully meet its  responsibilities as outlined above and in Appendix III.", "A 2010 Coast Guard-commissioned study found an even greater need for  icebreakers, if the Coast Guard were to fully accomplish all of its polar  icebreaking responsibilities. Specifically, this study determined that at  least six icebreakers\u2014three heavy and three medium\u2014would be required  to carry out the Coast Guard\u2019s statutory missions. To carry out its  statutory missions as well as fulfill all interagency responsibilities for  defense readiness, the report states that the Coast Guard would need  four to six heavy and two to four medium icebreakers depending on  various operational factors, such as whether the Coast Guard employs  multiple crewing models and where the Coast Guard homeports the  icebreakers. Recognizing the fiscal challenges posed by such a request,  Coast Guard officials have stated that obtaining a minimum of two heavy  icebreakers is needed to at least maintain the fleet\u2019s self-rescue capability  in the event one vessel became beset in ice\u2014a capability the Coast  Guard does not currently have. In addition, without two or more heavy  icebreakers, the Coast Guard reports that it may not be able to: (1)  complete its polar icebreaking missions if one vessel suffered a disabling  casualty, (2) conduct the McMurdo Station resupply and also ensure the  continued ability to operate in the Arctic, or (3) conduct the McMurdo  Station resupply if the mission required more than one icebreaker as it did  in prior years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Initiated an Icebreaker Acquisition Program and Is Considering Various Strategies", "paragraphs": ["To maintain polar icebreaking capability after the Polar Star\u2019s projected  service life ends between 2020 and 2023, the Coast Guard initiated a  program in 2013 to acquire a new heavy icebreaker and is currently  working to determine the optimal acquisition strategy. From fiscal years  2013 to 2016, Congress directed that $16 million of appropriated funds  were for the Coast Guard to conduct early acquisition activities, and the  President\u2019s budget has since requested $150 million to continue pre- acquisition and design activities over multiple years starting in fiscal year  2017. As of May 2016, the acquisition program was in the Analyze/Select  phase, during which the Coast Guard was establishing asset  requirements, evaluating the feasibility of alternatives, and developing a  cost estimate for the preferred acquisition strategy. As part of this  phase, the Coast Guard reports that it will identify the optimal acquisition  strategy and will consider several options including new construction,  parent craft, and parent craft design, as well as leasing arrangements.", "The President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget request outlined plans to  accelerate the acquisition process, so that production activities  commence by 2020.", "The Coast Guard expects a new heavy icebreaker to cost approximately  $1.09 billion, according to a 2013 preliminary estimate, which included  development, procurement, and Coast Guard facilities improvements for  one vessel. Although they have yet to complete a more detailed cost  estimate, Coast Guard officials stated that they believe the primary  construction cost drivers are likely to be the icebreaker\u2019s size, weight, and  horsepower. While the Coast Guard\u2019s icebreaker fleet supports other  federal agencies and departments, Coast Guard officials\u2014as well as  other federal officials\u2014stated that these other agencies and departments  do not require specific operational capabilities that would significantly  increase the overall acquisition cost of an icebreaker. Coast Guard  officials also noted that it would be unreasonable to build an icebreaker  that could operate in the Arctic but not the Antarctic because that would  limit the type of operations it could conduct.", "To move forward with the acquisition process, the Coast Guard would  need to receive funding and ensure that a U.S.-based commercial  shipyard would be able to build the vessel. However, the Coast Guard\u2019s  annual acquisition budget\u2014which averaged $1.5 billion from fiscal year  2012 to fiscal year 2016\u2014has primarily been allocated to other projects,  such as the National Security and Fast Response cutters. The Coast  Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2016 acquisition budget was $1.945 billion\u2014 approximately 60 percent higher than the prior year, largely due to the  addition of a ninth National Security Cutter for which the Coast Guard had  not planned. We previously found when reviewing the Coast Guard\u2019s  acquisition portfolio in 2014 that the Coast Guard was further from fielding  its planned fleet in 2014 than it was in 2009, in terms of the funding  needed to complete these programs.", "The Coast Guard reported that it believes that the U.S. shipbuilding  industry\u2014which must be used to build all Coast Guard vessels unless the  President has authorized a national security exception\u2014is capable of  building a heavy icebreaker. Specifically, the Coast Guard reported that  several U.S. shipyards responded to a March 2013 market survey and  indicated that they have the ability or could make necessary infrastructure  upgrades to build a vessel similar to the Polar Star. Coast Guard officials  told us that the selected shipyard or shipyards would likely need to  upgrade their facilities because of the size, weight, and complexity of an  icebreaker and that facility upgrades represent a calculated risk on the  part of the shipyard, particularly if the Coast Guard only orders one  vessel. The Coast Guard met with industry representatives in March 2016  to learn about industry capabilities.", "Prior GAO work on Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding indicates that new  icebreaker construction is likely to be an expensive and lengthy process  because of cost growth associated with lead ships\u2014that is, the first ship  constructed in a class of ships, which the Coast Guard icebreaker would  be. In September 2014, we identified cost growth that totaled over 150  percent for the first two lead ships of the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship.  We also reported in May 2009 that lead ships often experience schedule  delays, such as the Navy\u2019s first San Antonio-class ship which was  delivered 52 months late, and in June 2008 we reported that the lead  ship of the Coast Guard\u2019s National Security Cutter was delayed by  approximately 2 years. Thus, the potential for costly delays on lead  ships has some precedent. The Coast Guard reported in 2015 that it will  begin to plan for the acquisition of additional heavy icebreakers in line  with the President\u2019s September 2015 announcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Affect the Coast Guard\u2019s Options for Maintaining Icebreaking Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Various factors limit the options available to the Coast Guard to maintain,  or increase, its icebreaker capacity, and the Coast Guard has reported  that the long-term lease of a polar icebreaker is unlikely to result in cost  savings when compared with a purchase. Specifically, as figure 6 depicts,  two key factors limiting the Coast Guard\u2019s options are the lack of an  available icebreaker for lease that meets agency and legal requirements,  and the total cost associated with leasing.", "Availability. The Coast Guard reported in October 2015 that no existing  icebreakers were available to lease or purchase that met both its legal  and operational requirements. First, with respect to legal requirements,  the Coast Guard would need to either purchase or demise charter an  icebreaker, as legal requirements associated with several Coast Guard  missions prohibit a short-term lease. Specifically, under federal law, to be  capable of conducting all of its statutory missions, the Coast Guard must  use a public vessel, which federal law defines as one that the United  States owns or demise charters. For example, federal law states that  the Coast Guard\u2019s Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security Mission may  be carried out with public vessels or private vessels tendered gratuitously  for that purpose. Similarly, for the Coast Guard to employ its law  enforcement authorities in the conduct of certain missions, the icebreaker  would need to operate as a warship, and warships are necessarily  sovereign immune, public vessels, according to Coast Guard officials.", "In addition, federal law also provides that no Coast Guard vessel may be  constructed in a foreign shipyard. According to the Coast Guard,  besides the Polar Star and the Polar Sea, the only existing icebreakers  that are powerful enough to meet the Coast Guard\u2019s operational  requirements were built in and are owned by Russia, and, thus, would not  comply with this legal requirement. As a result of these constraints, that  is, the lack of a U.S.-built icebreaker available to purchase or demise  charter with sufficient horsepower to conduct all of the Coast Guard\u2019s  missions, the Coast Guard\u2019s only procurement options are for a U.S.- based shipyard to agree to build a new icebreaker for the Coast Guard to  lease or purchase outright. However, the Coast Guard has also reported  that the long-term lease of a polar icebreaker built expressly for the Coast  Guard is likely to be more costly than purchasing an icebreaker for  several reasons.", "Budgeting and Total Cost. Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidelines require federal agencies to acquire assets in the manner least  costly overall to the government. For a large acquisition like a heavy  icebreaker, OMB Circular A-94 requires the Coast Guard to conduct a  lease-purchase analysis based on total lifecycle costs. To then proceed  with a lease, the Coast Guard would need to show that leasing is  preferable to direct government purchase and ownership. The purpose of  this requirement is to promote efficient resource allocation through well- informed decision-making by the federal government. Budget  scorekeepers\u2014specifically, OMB, the Congressional Budget Office, and  the House and Senate Budget Committees\u2014score purchases and capital  leases at the outset of the acquisition. Based on scoring rules, the long- term lease of a polar icebreaker would not qualify as an operating lease,  which is intended for short-term needs and would allow the costs to be  recognized over time. As a result, whether the Coast Guard purchased  or leased an icebreaker, it would need full funding up front to enter into a  legal obligation with a shipbuilder, unless the Coast Guard uses  incremental funding, as was authorized in the Coast Guard Authorization  Act of 2015. With incremental funding authority, the Coast Guard would  be able to proceed with the acquisition with only part of the estimated  costs of a capital acquisition. However, we have previously discouraged  the use of incremental funding, except in cases with especially high  research and development costs, because incremental funding erodes  future fiscal flexibility and limits cost transparency.", "The Coast Guard has also reported that the total cost of a long term lease  is likely to exceed the total cost of a purchase. A 2011 preliminary cost  analysis prepared for the Coast Guard indicated that the lease option  would be more costly to the federal government over an icebreaker\u2019s  expected 30-year service life. According to this analysis, the prospective  ship owner\u2019s profit rate would increase the overall expense as this profit  rate is priced into the lease, such that government ownership would be  less costly in the long run. Moreover, because a demise charter requires  the lessee to operate and maintain the vessel, the Coast Guard would not  be able to outsource crewing or maintenance activities, actions which we  previously reported could reduce ongoing operating costs. According to  a subsequent 2012 report prepared for the Coast Guard, legal and  operational requirements render additional cost-benefit analysis of leasing  unnecessary. Nevertheless, Coast Guard officials stated that they will  consider leasing as a possible acquisition strategy in a forthcoming  report, as directed by language in committee reports accompanying the  fiscal year 2014 DHS appropriations bill.", "Previous GAO work on the question of leasing versus buying an  icebreaker identified important assumptions in comparing the costs to the  federal government and suggests that outright purchase could be a less  costly alternative than a long-term vessel lease. Assuming that the cost  of building and operating the vessel was the same under both the buy  and the lease scenarios, the cost advantage to government purchase  over leasing in our previous work was based on two factors. First, the  costs of private sector financing under a lease arrangement\u2014which were  higher than the government\u2019s borrowing costs\u2014could be expected to be  passed on to the federal government in lease payments, thereby  increasing the vessel\u2019s financing costs over what they would be under  outright government purchase. Second, under a lease arrangement, an  additional profit would accrue to the lessor for services related to its  retained ownership of the vessel. Separately, in multiple other reports we  found that when other agencies sought to enter into long-term lease  arrangements, they did so for reasons unrelated to cost, such as  acquiring already-built aircraft sooner, and these explanations are not  pertinent in this case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Is Developing a Bridging Strategy to Address Expected Heavy Icebreaker Service Gap", "paragraphs": ["Anticipating a likely gap in heavy icebreaker capability between the end of  the Polar Star\u2019s service life and the deployment of a new icebreaker, the  Coast Guard is developing a bridging strategy, as required by law, to  determine how to address this expected gap.

Currently, the Coast Guard estimates that the Polar Star\u2019s  service life will likely extend until 2020 to 2023, while the Coast Guard\u2019s  2016 timeline for a new icebreaker indicates that it would not achieve its  operational requirements until fiscal year 2026, leaving a potential gap in  heavy icebreaking capability of 3 to 6 years.

The Coast Guard is the  lead for 7 of the 36 total tasks (or objectives) in the January 2014  implementation plan, and DHS and the Coast Guard support another 19.  Each task also has various, actionable next steps. According to Coast  Guard officials, the agency is responsible for coordinating the completion  of tasks for which it has been identified as the lead agency, as funding  and resources allow. To complete its tasks, the Coast Guard must  coordinate with other agencies. As described in the implementation plan,  federal departments and agencies are to report on their progress on the  tasks, and the plan is to be revisited after 5 years to ensure that it still  meets the intent and priorities of the nation. The implementation plan  includes timeframes for some, but not all, next steps, and Coast Guard  officials stated that tasks are being completed as resources permit.  According to a March 2016 White House report describing federal  agencies\u2019 progress on Arctic strategy tasks, the Coast Guard, along with  supporting agencies, has taken action toward implementing all the  strategy tasks for which the Coast Guard is assigned as the lead, as  detailed in table 4.", "In March 2016, the White House issued the Implementation Framework  for the National Strategy for the Arctic Region which is to supersede its  2014 implementation plan. The AESC led the efforts to develop the  revised framework, which updates the 2014 implementation plan by (1)  incorporating the Administration\u2019s new priorities into the existing lines of  efforts, particularly placing greater importance on community  sustainability and resilience; (2) removing actions listed in the 2014  implementation plan that have been completed, or are no longer  considered an actionable priority; (3) including factors to improve  efficiency by reducing redundancies and closing interagency coordination  gaps; and (4) increasing the importance of science by incorporating the  entire Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee Arctic Research  Plan by reference into the Pursuing Responsible Arctic Region  Stewardship line of effort. In addition, the revised framework assigned an  overall coordination lead for each line of effort from the national strategy.  The 2016 framework includes 28 tasks that encompass various next  steps and, unlike the 2014 plan, assigned a lead agency to each next  step rather than to the overarching task. The Coast Guard was assigned  to lead next steps that fall within 8 of the 28 tasks\u20147 of which it was also  assigned as the lead in the 2014 plan. For the additional 2016 task, the  Coast Guard has the lead for one of the next steps, which involves the  analysis and monitoring of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in  the Arctic. The 2016 framework is to be revisited in 5 years; however, the  framework states that because the Arctic is undergoing changes, the  AESC may make adjustments before then. According to Coast Guard  officials, the AESC\u2019s efforts to update the implementation plan\u2019s priorities  are important because the tasks in the national strategy need to be  balanced with new priorities announced by the President\u2014some of which  may be difficult to accomplish because they are evolving and may be  planned further into the future than the 10-year national strategy.  Further, Coast Guard officials stated that better prioritization of the  national efforts will help the Coast Guard in making decisions about what  it needs to achieve in the Arctic given its limited resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Coast Guard-Involved Actions to Implement the National Ocean Policy", "paragraphs": ["The April 2013 National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan and its  appendix\u2014developed by the National Ocean Council\u2014identify the Arctic  as one of nine key objectives and include tasks for federal agencies  consistent with their existing missions and activities.

The National Ocean Council developed and  maintains a U.S. government-authorized, web-based site for federal  agencies to report the status of the tasks under the National Ocean  Policy. The Coast Guard, along with supporting agencies, has taken  steps toward implementing all three of its assigned tasks, as detailed in  table 5. For example, the National Ocean Council reported that the Coast  Guard and its partners completed one task in its entirety, and that the two  other tasks and related next steps were from 55 to 95 percent complete,  as of December 2015.
