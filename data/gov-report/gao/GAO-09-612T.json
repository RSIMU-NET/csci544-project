According to the National Strategy for Aviation  Security, issued in March 2007, and officials from U.S. intelligence  agencies with whom we met, air attacks are still a threat to the United  States and its people. To address this threat, NORAD and DOD have fully  fueled, fully armed aircraft and trained personnel on alert 24 hours a day,  365 days a year, at 18 ASA sites across the United States, as shown in  appendix I.

ASA units are tasked to conduct and train for both  expeditionary missions (e.g., military operations in Iraq) and ASA  operations.", "ASA operations consist of ground operations that take place before fighter  aircraft take off, such as maintaining the fighter aircraft. They also include  those activities that take place after a unit receives an alert from NORAD  but before the aircraft are airborne. Once aircraft take off, \u201calert\u201d  operations end and the operation becomes a homeland defense air mission  under Operation NOBLE EAGLE. For example, aircraft and personnel  from three ASA units\u2014Duluth, Minnesota; Madison, Wisconsin; and New  Orleans, Louisiana\u2014responded to the April 6, 2009, cross-border incident  in which a stolen Cessna aircraft entered into U.S. airspace from Canada  without approval. When the transition occurs from ground operations to  airborne operations, an ANG pilot converts from Title 32 status under the  command and control of the state governor to federal Title 10 status,  because they are performing a federal mission under the command and  control of NORAD. Active duty units are always in a Title 10 status, but  command and control of pilots and aircraft conducting ASA operations  passes from the local commander to NORAD when performing air defense  operations.", "My testimony today, which is based on our January 2009 report on ASA  operations, will discuss whether (1) NORAD routinely conducts risk  assessments to determine the appropriate operational requirements; (2)  the Air Force has implemented ASA operations as a steady-state mission,  which would require programming funding and measuring readiness, in  accordance with NORAD, DOD, and Air Force guidance; and (3) the Air  Force has developed a plan to address the recapitalization challenges to  sustaining ASA operations for the future. I will conclude with some  observations regarding our recommendations and DOD\u2019s response to our  recommendations.", "Our work on that report was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards from April 2008 to January 2009.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Our work included  reviews of pertinent documents and structured interviews of the  commanders of the 20 alert units at all 18 sites performing ASA operations.  We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

NORAD completed the first of these  assessments after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when it  worked with other federal agencies and determined, based on  vulnerabilities and criticality, which sites should be protected by ASA  operations. NORAD conducted two other assessments, in 2005 and 2006,  primarily in response to the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment  Commission process and efforts to cut costs for Operation NOBLE  EAGLE. On both of these occasions, NORAD conducted a cost evaluation,  considering aviation security improvements\u2014such as secured cockpits  and enhanced passenger screening\u2014that were made by the  Transportation Security Administration since 2001. At the time of our  review, DOD had not required NORAD to manage ASA operations using a  risk management approach, which includes routine risk assessments. By  performing routine risk assessments, NORAD could better evaluate the  extent to which previous threats have been mitigated by DOD or other  government agencies, better evaluate current and emerging threats to  determine which ones require the most urgent attention, and determine  operational requirements to address changing conditions. Routine risk  assessments could also help NORAD determine the appropriate level and  type of resources, including units, personnel, and aircraft for ASA  operations, especially in a resource-restricted environment.

Commanders at the ASA sites that we visited told us that they had lost  some of their most experienced personnel due to job instability caused by  the manner in which ASA operations are programmed.

Implementing ASA operations as a steady-state mission  may help to mitigate the challenges associated with ASA operations, as  well as provide Congress and DOD leaders cost visibility into ASA  operations, which support DOD\u2019s high-priority homeland defense mission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Had Not Developed a Plan to Address Fighter Aircraft Challenges for Units Conducting Both ASA Operations and Expeditionary Missions", "paragraphs": ["Of the 18 ASA sites, 13 sites are currently equipped with F-16s, which,  according to ANG estimates, will reach the end of their useful service lives  between fiscal years 2015 and 2020. Five sites have F-15s, which were  grounded for 3 months in late 2007 and early 2008 after an F-15 broke  apart during a normal flying operation in November 2007. According to Air  Force and ANG officials, the F-15s\u2019 useful service lives could end earlier  than the expected time frame of 2025 if the aircraft are used increasingly  for overseas deployments or other missions. Depending on when the F-16s  reach the end of their useful service lives and on the availability of next- generation F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, a gap in the number of available  aircraft may affect units performing ASA operations. Figure 2 shows the  projected number of current ASA sites with and without viable aircraft to  conduct ASA operations through 2032. As the figure reflects, unless the  Air Force modifies its current fielding schedules or extends the service  lives of its F-15s and F-16s to the extent that this option is possible, it will  lack viable aircraft to conduct ASA operations at some of the 18 current  ASA sites after fiscal year 2015. The figure also shows that 2 of the current  ASA sites will not be equipped with viable aircraft and thus will be unable  to conduct ASA operations even after the Air Force fields all of its  currently planned F-22s and F-35s in fiscal year 2031. This figure is based  on our analysis of documentation on the expected service lives of the F- 15s and F-16s and the Air Force\u2019s fielding schedules for the F-22s and F- 35s at the time of our review, and represents one possible scenario.", "The House report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2008 directed the Secretary of the Air Force, in  consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the  Secretary of Homeland Security, to conduct a study on the feasibility and  desirability of equipping certain ASA units with F-35s. The Air Force  study, which was submitted to Congress in December 2008, states that,  although the F-35\u2019s capabilities make it a desirable platform to conduct air  defense operations, a number of factors\u2014such as fiscal, operational, and  environmental considerations\u2014will affect where F-35s are based.  Consequently, it is unclear whether or when the current ASA sites will  receive F-35 aircraft. For the purpose of our analysis, however, we  assumed that the Air Force would provide the F-35s to ANG sites  conducting ASA operations. Our March 2009 reports about the F-35  acquisition program have also questioned the reliability of its production  schedule and cost estimates.  For example, we reported that despite the  program\u2019s continued manufacturing problems and the infancy of the flight  test program, DOD officials wanted to accelerate F-35 production from 485  to 654 aircraft over a 6-year time frame from fiscal years 2010 through  2015. On April 6, 2009, the Secretary of Defense announced that DOD  intends to increase F-35 production to 513 aircraft across the 5-year  defense plan. We continue to believe DOD\u2019s increased production  approach is overly optimistic.", "During our review, we discussed some options with Air Force and ANG  officials that could reduce the potential gap between retired aging aircraft  and the replacements needed to conduct ASA operations, but these  options are not without challenges. The options we discussed included the  following:    Replace the F-16s with either F-22s or F-35s, both of which the Air Force is  acquiring. However, according to the F-22 and F-35 fielding schedules at  the time of our review, only 1 of the 12 units\u2014Shaw Air Force Base, South  Carolina\u2014will receive the new aircraft before its fleet of F-16s reaches the  end of its useful service life.", "Replace the F-16s with F-15 models from the current inventory. However,  F-15s, like F-16s, are beginning to reach the end of their useful service  lives for reasons including structural problems and accelerated use for  overseas deployments and other missions.", "Extend the service life of the F-15 and F-16 aircraft. However, at the time  of our review, the Air Force had not determined the extent to which such  actions were viable.", "Until the Air Force plans accordingly, the extent to which replacement  aircraft will be available to conduct ASA operations and mitigate this  fighter shortage is unclear.
