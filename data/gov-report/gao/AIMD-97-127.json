At the 37 Federal Reserve Banks and Branches which make up the Federal Reserve System, the cash operations function is responsible for shipping cash to meet the needs of depository institutions, receiving shipments of new currency from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, new coin from the U.S. Mint, and incoming deposits of excess and unfit currency and coin from depository institutions.

The review\u2019s objectives were to determine the nature of currency reporting inaccuracies and review actions intended to resolve them. Our review found that certain data needed for the October through December 1995 currency activity reports were forced to ensure that the reports agreed with the Los Angeles Branch\u2019s end-of-month balance sheet. As a result, analysis by a bank analyst showed that receipts from circulation were understated by $5.8 million in October, overstated by $61.8 million in November and understated by $111 million in December.

In performing its examinations and concluding on the reliability of managements\u2019 assertions, Coopers & Lybrand performed an attest engagement which is governed by the AICPA\u2019s Attestation Standards.", "The attestation standards provide both general and specific guidance which is intended to enhance the consistency and quality of these engagements. The attestation standards consist of general, fieldwork, and reporting standards which apply to all attestation engagements and individual standards which apply to specific types of attestation engagements. The attestation standards supplement existing auditing standards by reenforcing the need for technical competence, independence in attitude, due professional care, adequate planning and supervision, sufficient evidence, and appropriate reporting.", "In addition to the general, fieldwork, and reporting attestation standards, Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s examination at the three Reserve Banks was also subject to requirements of a specific attestation standard\u2014Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 2, Reporting on an Entity\u2019s Internal Control Structure Over Financial Reporting. This standard provides guidance on planning, conducting, and reporting on the engagement, including evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. A key provision of the standard is that management use reasonable control criteria which have been established by a recognized body in evaluating the internal control structure\u2019s effectiveness. This requirement ensures that management uses commonly understood and/or accepted control criteria in concluding on the internal control structure\u2019s effectiveness and that the practitioner uses the same criteria in forming an opinion on management\u2019s assertion. Management for each of the Federal Reserve Banks covered by Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s examinations based their assessments of internal control effectiveness on criteria contained in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in September 1992 by the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).", "To develop a broad understanding of internal control and establish standards for assessing its effectiveness, COSO developed a structured approach\u2014the Integrated Framework\u2014which defines internal control and describes how it relates to an entity\u2019s operations. Internal control represents the process, designed and operated by an entity\u2019s management and personnel, to provide reasonable assurance that fundamental organizational objectives are achieved. The Integrated Framework describes internal control in terms of objectives, essential components of internal control, and criteria for assessing internal control effectiveness.", "Internal control objectives\u2014what internal controls are intended to achieve\u2014fall into three distinct but overlapping categories: operations\u2014relating to effective and efficient use of an entity\u2019s resources; financial reporting\u2014relating to preparing reliable financial statements; and compliance\u2014relating to an entity\u2019s compliance with laws and regulations. Safeguarding controls are a subcategory within each of these control objectives. Safeguarding controls\u2014those designed to prevent or promptly detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an entity\u2019s resources\u2014are primarily operations controls. However, certain aspects of safeguarding controls can also be considered compliance and financial reporting controls. When legal or regulatory requirements apply to use of resources, operations controls designed to safeguard the efficient and effective use of resources also address compliance objectives. Similarly, objectives designed to ensure that losses associated with the use or disposition of resources are properly recognized and reflected in the entity\u2019s financial statements also address financial reporting objectives.", "In May 1994, COSO issued an addendum to its Integrated Framework to provide specific reporting guidance on controls concerning safeguarding of assets. COSO stated that there is a reasonable expectation that a management report will cover not only controls to help ensure that transactions involving an entity\u2019s assets are properly reflected in the financial statements, but also controls to help prevent or promptly detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the underlying assets. COSO believes it is important that this expectation be met. The addendum provided suggested wording for management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting to also specifically state safeguarding of assets when covered by management\u2019s report.", "Internal control, as described in the Integrated Framework, consists of five essential and interrelated components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The control environment represents the control consciousness of an entity, its management, and staff. Risk assessment refers to the awareness and management of relevant internal and external risk associated with achieving established objectives. Control activities represent the operating policies and procedures designed to help ensure that management\u2019s directives\u2014desired actions intended to address risks\u2014are carried out. Information and communication refers to the need for relevant and useful information to be communicated promptly to management and staff for use in carrying out their responsibilities. The monitoring component refers to the need to monitor and assess over time the effectiveness of internal control policies and procedures in achieving their intended objectives.", "The nature and extent to which an entity\u2019s internal control structure incorporates the five control components represent criteria that can be used in assessing the internal control effectiveness of operating, financial reporting, and compliance controls. Management can assess and report on the effectiveness of any of the three categories of control objectives. Internal controls can be judged effective if, for each category of control objective reported on, management has reasonable assurance that each of the five control components has been effectively incorporated into the entity\u2019s internal control structure. COSO recognized that determining effectiveness was a subjective judgment. Similarly, with respect to effectiveness of safeguarding controls, controls can be judged effective if management has reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an entity\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements are being prevented or detected promptly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Results of External Reviews of Control Over Cash Operations", "paragraphs": ["For each examination, Coopers & Lybrand concluded that Federal Reserve Bank management fairly stated its assertion that the bank maintained an effective internal control structure over financial reporting and safeguarding for cash as of the date specified by management based on criteria established in the Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by COSO.", "Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s examinations were conducted at different times during the late summer and fall of 1996 because management for each of the three Reserve Banks made their assertions about the effectiveness of internal controls as of different specified dates (Atlanta, September 30, 1996; Los Angeles, August 31, 1996; and Philadelphia, October 31, 1996).

Internal controls usually involve two elements: a policy establishing what should be done and procedures to effect the policy. The procedures include a range of activities such as approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, physical security, and separation of duties.", "Coopers & Lybrand found that the Federal Reserve has developed custody control standards and procedures that provide a framework for establishing systems of internal controls to protect cash processed and stored at the banks. Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s working papers described the cash operating process the banks followed in managing, controlling, and accounting for cash operations. This process is broken down into four major areas: (1) receiving/shipping of cash, (2) processing of currency to check the accuracy of deposits from depository institutions, identify counterfeit currency, and determine the currency\u2019s fitness for recirculation, (3) vault storage of cash, and (4) cash administration. The cash operations followed by the banks are discussed in more detail in appendix I.", "Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s work focused on the internal controls designed to properly record, process, and summarize transactions to permit the preparation of reliable financial statements and to maintain accountability for assets (financial reporting controls) and safeguard assets against loss from unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition (safeguarding controls). These controls include two categories of information system control activities which serve to ensure completeness, accuracy, and validity of the financial information in the system.", "In order to determine whether the internal controls provided reasonable assurance that losses or misstatements material in relation to the financial statements would be prevented or detected as of the date of management\u2019s assertion, Coopers & Lybrand tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls. The testing methods included observation, inquiry, and inspection.", "No one specific control test is necessary, applicable, or equally effective in every circumstance. Generally, a combination of these types of control tests is performed to provide the necessary level of assurance. The types of tests performed for each control activity are determined by the auditor using professional judgment and depend on the nature of the control to be tested and the timing of the control test. For example, documentation of some control activities may not be available or relevant and evidence about the effectiveness of operation is obtained through observation or inquiry. Also, some activities, such as those relating to the resolution of exception items, may not occur on the date that the auditor is conducting the tests. In those cases, the auditor needs to inquire about the procedures performed when exceptions occur.", "Observation tests are conducted by observing entity personnel actually performing control activities in the normal course of their duties. For example, Coopers & Lybrand observed the physical separation between the carriers and the receiving and shipping teams, the use of locks and seals on the containers used for storing currency, and the preparation of the end of day proof by each of the teams. In currency processing, Coopers & Lybrand observed preparation of the processing unit proof, transfer of currency to and from the processing teams, and processing team operations. Observation of processing operations documented in their working papers included the handling of currency rejected by the high speed machine and its processing on the slower speed machine, and the physical transfer of rejected currency from the processing team to the cancellation team.", "Inquiry tests are conducted by making either oral or written inquiries of entity personnel involved in the application of specific control activities to determine what they do or how they perform the specific control activity. For example, Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s inquiries of bank personnel included asking about procedures performed when containers stored in the vault are found to have broken seals and when discrepancies in shipments are reported by the depository institutions.", "Inspection tests are conducted by examining documents and records for evidence (such as the existence of initials, signatures, or other indications) that a control activity was applied to those documents and records. Coopers & Lybrand used inspection to test controls such as the daily reconciliation of CAS and the general ledger system, the end of day proofs prepared by each team, vault inventories, and monitoring logs prepared by cash department management personnel.", "Similarly, Coopers & Lybrand tested computer controls through observation, inquiry, and inspection. For example, they observed the enforcement of physical access controls such as logging of visitors and video surveillance. They asked management about the control procedures over changes to the CAS program code and corroborated the information they were given by interviewing system users and application developers. They inspected a system log to verify that backup tapes were being produced on schedule.", "For many of the computer controls tests in their work program, Coopers & Lybrand consulted with Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s General Auditors to gain an understanding of the computer controls and/or examined their working papers to further corroborate information that Coopers & Lybrand obtained through observation, inquiry, and inspection. In addition to other tests conducted by inspection, observation, and inquiry, the banks\u2019 internal audit working papers evidenced tests based upon independent verification of compliance with computer control procedures. For example, the General Auditors for the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia selected five days of work for each of five cash processing rooms and examined system reports and manual logs to verify that the high-speed currency processing machines were tested daily and that they returned acceptable results before being put into production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of GAO\u2019s Review of Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s Examination", "paragraphs": ["The results of our review disclosed no instances in which Coopers & Lybrand did not comply, in all material respects, with the AICPA\u2019s Attestation Standards in the work described above.

The notification includes the dollar amount and denominational breakdown for the deposit or order. The cash is transported between the Federal Reserve Banks and depository institutions by armored carriers which enter the bank buildings through secured entrances. To ensure the integrity of the currency received from or transferred to the carriers, the Federal Reserve Banks use a minimum of two-person receiving or shipping teams. These teams are always physically separated from the carriers as shipments are unloaded or loaded by the carriers. For example, carriers unload or load the currency into a glass-walled room (sometimes called an anteroom) which is bordered on one end by the carriers\u2019 entrance and on the other end by the receiving or shipping room. Each anteroom has two sets of locking doors on either end. The receiving or shipping team cannot enter the anteroom when the carrier is unloading or loading currency.

These reports are also used to adjust the depository institution\u2019s account with the Federal Reserve Bank for the amount of the difference.", "Currency rejected by the slower speed machine is sorted for off-line destruction or transfer. Counterfeit items are stamped \u201cCounterfeit\u201d and transferred daily from the processing team to independent clerks who examine, count, and collect counterfeit currency for shipment to the U.S. Secret Service for follow-up and analysis. Currency rejected for denomination and soil level is transferred daily to a separate team for cancellation and subsequent off-line destruction. In the presence of the processing team, a cancellation team counts and accepts the transfer of the rejected currency for cancellation. The transfer is recorded in the CAS system. The team takes the rejected currency in a locked container to a cancellation room where the currency is cancelled by punching bank-specific-shaped holes into the currency. The cancellation process is monitored by an independent observer who also monitors the transfer of the cancelled currency to a separate off-line destruction team. Upon verification and approval by the off-line destruction team, the transfer of cancelled currency is recorded in CAS.", "Off-line destruction occurs periodically throughout the week and is monitored by an independent observer who counts the number and denomination of the currency straps to be destroyed and matches it to the strap count performed by the off-line destruction team. In addition, the destruction team and independent observer follow prescribed policies which include sample counts of individual low value currency notes and a 100 percent count of higher value currency notes. Once this count is completed, the off-line destruction team, along with the independent observer, takes the cancelled currency to a special room where it is destroyed in a shredder. Once all currency has been destroyed, the destruction team and the independent observer inspect the shredder to ensure that all cancelled currency was destroyed. Following the off-line destruction, the team generates from CAS a certificate of destruction based on the earlier currency transferred to the off-line destruction team. The certificate of destruction is signed by the team and the observer and forwarded to Cash Administration for use in the end-of-day reconciliation.", "At the end of each shift, each processing team prepares its unit proof. The proof is designed to ensure that the processing team can account for the team\u2019s currency holdings and processing activities by tracking the value of its beginning and ending inventory, its currency transfers in and out, and any adjustments arising during processing. After the team completes and accepts the proof data, it is transmitted electronically to CAS where it is compared to related currency data entered into CAS during the shift. If the proof data balance and agree with related currency data in CAS, the unit proof is accepted. If the proof data do not agree with related currency data in CAS, the processing team must request management assistance to identify and resolve differences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vault Storage", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Reserve Banks use vaults to safeguard the currency they hold. The vault is a separate room within the cash department and a record is maintained of all persons who enter and exit the vault each day. Access to the vault may also be restricted through the use of keys or swipe cards. When stored in the vault, currency of the same denomination is stacked in locked containers. Cash department employees have a set of locks with their own personal key or combination. The employees use these locks to secure the containers for which they are accountable. In addition to the locks, each two-person team secures the containers with two prenumbered seals. In some Federal Reserve Banks, the locks are removed while the containers are stored in the vault. When this occurs, the integrity of the seals is verified when accountability for the container is transferred to another team.", "In some Federal Reserve Banks, accountability for the currency is transferred to vault custodians when the currency is stored in the vault. In other Federal Reserve Banks, accountability for currency stored in the vault stays with either the receiving or shipping team, and the vault custodians serve more of an administrative function. In both cases, the vault custodians periodically conduct a rack count of the currency in the vault (i.e., daily in Atlanta and Los Angeles, weekly in Philadelphia) and reconcile the count to CAS.

The department proof lists all of the transactions and current inventory balances for each of the department\u2019s teams (receiving, shipping, processing, and vault).
