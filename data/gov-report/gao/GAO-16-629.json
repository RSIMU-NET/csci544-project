Active conflict creates a dangerous environment characterized by attacks on aid facilities and workers, and humanitarian organizations face difficulties accessing those in need. Additionally, U.S. agency officials must manage programs in Syria remotely, increasing risks to the program, including opportunities for fraud. Despite these challenges, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.S. humanitarian assistance has reached 4 million people inside Syria per month.", "The Department of State (State), USAID, and their implementing partners have assessed some types of risk to their programs inside Syria, but most partners have not assessed the risk of fraud. Of the 9 implementing partners in GAO's sample of funding instruments, most assessed risks related to safety and security, but only 4 of 9 assessed fraud risks. Such an assessment is important as USAID's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has uncovered multiple instances of fraud affecting U.S. programs delivering humanitarian assistance to Syria. In May 2016, USAID OIG reported that 1 of its active fraud investigations resulted in the suspension of 14 entities and individuals. Given the challenging environment in Syria, fraud risk assessments could help U.S. agencies better identify and address risks to help ensure aid reaches those in need.", "Partners have implemented controls to mitigate certain risks, but U.S. agencies could improve financial oversight. For example, almost all partners in our sample have controls to mitigate safety risks and some use technology to monitor the transport of goods. Additionally, U.S. agencies have taken steps to oversee activities in Syria, such as quarterly meetings with partners and spot checks of partner warehouses. Further, in October 2015, USAID hired a third party monitor to improve oversight of its activities and help verify progress of its programs. However, the monitors' training curriculum lacks modules on identifying fraud risks. Without such training, monitors may overlook potential fraud risks and miss opportunities to collect data that could help USAID improve its financial oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To provide more complete information to assist oversight activities, State and USAID should require their implementing partners to conduct fraud risk assessments.

In  addition, a number of other countries, including Russia, Saudi Arabia, and  Iran, have strategic interests in Syria and have been directly or indirectly  involved in the conflict. In February 2016, the United States and Russia  brokered a cessation of hostilities, excluding ISIS and the al-Nusrah  Front.

USAID\u2019s Office of  Food for Peace (FFP) and Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance  (OFDA) require some implementing partners to create a Safety and  Security Plan, which addresses security threats and vulnerabilities related  to program locations and provides information such as contingency  planning and risk mitigation measures.

One of the investigations found that the  subawardee of the implementing partner failed to distribute nonfood items  in southern Syria, instead subcontracting the distribution to another  organization, but nevertheless billed USAID for the full cost of the project.  Additionally, the subawardee was reliant on one individual to facilitate the  transfer of materials and salaries, and this individual was involved in the  alteration and falsification of records related to the distribution of the  nonfood items. According to the USAID OIG, senior leadership at the  subawardee was aware of these facts. Further, in May 2016, USAID  OIG reported the identification of bid-rigging and multiple bribery and  kickback schemes related to contracts to deliver humanitarian aid in  Syria, investigations of which resulted in the suspension of 14 entities and  individuals involved with aid programs from Turkey.

Another partner  with field sites in Damascus identified the risk of ambush as a  vulnerability and provided its drivers with instructions on taking evasive  actions and fleeing to safety.", "Partners in our sample had also implemented controls to mitigate risks of  fraud and loss within their operations; however, the majority of these  efforts were not informed by a risk assessment. Four of the nine partners  in our sample conducted cross-border delivery operations from  neighboring countries such as Turkey or Jordan and, therefore, procured  goods in the host country or the region and warehoused them prior to  transport into Syria. Officials from two implementing partners we  interviewed in Amman stated that they conducted spot checks of  assistance packages in warehouses to confirm the quantity of the  contents and ensure that the quality of the items complied with the terms  of the contract. According to another implementing partner, officials from  its organization visit the vendor warehouses before signing contracts to  verify that U.S. government commodity safety and quality assurance  guidelines are met. In addition, partners used documentation such as  packing slips and waybills to verify the contents of shipments. Once  parcels arrived at warehouses in Syria, partners we interviewed stated  that staff used technology, such as geotagged photographs, to document  the arrival and contents of the shipment. Nonetheless, these partners  stated that the lack of visibility over the assistance while in transit in Syria,  and managing the projects remotely from Jordan, were risks to their  operations and therefore required mitigating actions. Furthermore,  partners we interviewed that relied on transporters to deliver assistance  within Syria mitigated the risk of loss\u2014including loss due to theft by the  Syrian Army or armed opposition groups at checkpoints\u2014by shifting  liability to the transporter and only paying for parcels that were delivered  to the intended destinations. According to one of the partners, the shift of  liability to the transporter has limited the instances of diversion, although  we did not confirm this.", "Partners also implemented controls to mitigate fraud risks during the  distribution process. For example, partners developed criteria for  identifying and selecting eligible beneficiaries, and compiled this  information into beneficiary lists to assist the process. Examples of people  meeting selection criteria included internally displaced people, people  with disabilities, and female heads of household. In addition, partners  mentioned working with local councils to develop beneficiary lists.  Officials at a partner organization we interviewed stated that during the  distribution process, staff crosschecked the names of beneficiaries on the  list with identification provided by the beneficiary, and then relayed that  information to the partner\u2019s field office in Jordan for verification. Officials  added that this method for verifying beneficiaries was an ongoing  process, as the lists sometimes changed due to the movement of people.", "Two implementing partners that we visited in Jordan, who delivered food  and medical supplies, among other types of assistance in southern Syria,  provide examples of the types of controls implemented.", "Emergency food items. By 2015, USAID had awarded roughly $50  million to an international NGO to deliver emergency food items to  beneficiaries in southern Syria.

State officials noted that  State conducts a variety of oversight activities. For instance, State  officials in the region conduct quarterly meetings with partners and collect  information on programmatic objectives and on partner programs. State  also has enhanced monitoring plans in place with its implementing  partners to augment quarterly reporting with information on risks of  diversion of assistance. State officials also told us that they ask partners  to notify them upon discovering incidents of diversion. For example, one  implementing partner provided frequent updates to State on losses it  sustained from its transporters until the issue was resolved.", "Similarly, USAID officials provided information on several measures taken  to oversee programs implemented by partners. For example, USAID  officials we spoke with in Washington explained that officials screen  proposals from prospective partners to identify those that have  appropriate measures to mitigate risks and operate in a hazardous  environment such as Syria. They added that USAID officials in the region  maintain regular contact with partners, attend monthly meetings with  them, conduct random spot checks of aid packages at warehouse  facilities, and coordinate activities among partners to reduce or eliminate  duplication or overlap of assistance. USAID officials in the region also  receive quarterly reports from partners to monitor progress before  submitting them to USAID headquarters for additional review. USAID also  noted that it has implemented an informal biweekly reporting system for  all partners to provide reports notifying USAID of any challenges or  potential risks facing the partner in the preceding two weeks. According to  USAID officials in Washington, USAID officials in the region are the  immediate officials to oversee programs and detect incidents of fraud;  and, USAID officials in the region explained that the USAID OIG has  conducted fraud awareness training for officials in the region to improve  their ability to detect fraud, such as product substitution, when they  conduct spot checks of aid packages at warehouse facilities. Further, in  October 2015, USAID\u2019s OFDA hired a third party monitoring organization  to review its projects in Syria. By February 2016, field monitors had  conducted site visits and submitted monitoring reports to USAID,  providing information on the status of projects and including major  concerns that field monitors identified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fraud Oversight Could Be Strengthened", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis, USAID\u2019s third party monitoring contract and  supporting documentation contain guidelines for verifying the progress of  activities in Syria; however, they do not clearly instruct field monitors to  identify potential fraud risks as they conduct site assessments of projects  in Syria. Furthermore, the monitoring plan and site visit templates do not  contain specific guidance on how to recognize fraud, and field monitors  have not received the USAID OIG fraud awareness training, according to  USAID officials. Leading practices in fraud risk management suggest  evaluating outcomes using a risk-based approach and adapting activities  to improve fraud risk management. This includes conducting risk-based  monitoring and evaluation of fraud risk management activities with a  focus on outcome measurement, and using the results to improve  prevention, detection, and response.", "The monitoring plan associated with the contract contains guidelines for  field monitors to document their assessment of the project at the  completion of a site visit. However, it lacks specific guidelines to identify  potential fraud risks during site visits. For example, the guidelines in the  monitoring plan instruct field monitors to use color-coded indicators, one  of which states that issues at a project site require immediate attention  and action, such as highly significant implementation problems, fraud,  diversion, or other highly concerning findings. While fraud is mentioned  with the indicator, it is presented as one of several examples of highly  concerning findings to document, and could potentially be overlooked by  the field monitor. Additionally, the templates created by the third party  monitoring organization to document site visits instruct monitors to verify  the presence or absence of supplies, and the quality of them, among  other instructions. For example, templates we reviewed related to water  and sanitation projects instructed field monitors to verify that water was  delivered to a location, and that water quality tests had been conducted,  when applicable, among other things. However, the template lacks  specific indicators to alert field monitors to collect information on and  identify potential fraud. Furthermore, the monitoring plan contains a  training curriculum for field monitors, which has several objectives  designed to familiarize them with the protocols, procedures, and  instruments used for data collection and reporting. For example, training  categories in the curriculum include basic monitoring and verification  vocabulary, sampling of records and other secondary data, and color  coding issues of concern. However, the curriculum lacks specific courses  for recognizing potential or actual instances of fraud that may occur on  site. Additionally, USAID officials told us that the field monitors supporting  the third party monitoring contract had not received fraud awareness  training from USAID OIG, which has been provided to other implementing  partners with which USAID works to provide humanitarian assistance to  people in Syria. Given the opportunity for fraud that exists in humanitarian  assistance programs, as well as the ongoing USAID OIG investigations,  without instructions to specifically collect data on fraud and training to  identify it, USAID may be missing an opportunity to assist in its activities  to mitigate fraud risks and design appropriate controls."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The ongoing conflict in Syria has created a complex humanitarian  emergency. As the largest donor, the United States has taken a leading  role in providing humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of  individuals inside Syria who are affected by the conflict and delivers  assistance to millions per month. Given the significant challenges of  providing humanitarian assistance in a conflict zone, as well as State and  USAID\u2019s inability to directly monitor programs inside Syria, the importance  of financial oversight\u2014which includes conducting risk assessments to  identify, analyze, and respond to risks and implementing appropriate  controls\u2014is elevated. Despite the fact that fraud has been detected in  these assistance programs, most of the partners in our sample did not  assess fraud risks. Further, while USAID\u2019s third party monitoring contract  provides a mechanism to gather additional information about its programs  in Syria, providing clearer instructions to collect data on and training to  recognize fraud risks may better assist USAID in its efforts to mitigate  fraud. In the absence of such activities, fraudulent practices may go  unnoticed or take longer to detect.
