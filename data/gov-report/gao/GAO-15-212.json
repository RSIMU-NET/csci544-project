Contractors reported about 5,800 inventions and 700 patents developed with DOE funding during this time period. To ensure disclosure of these agency funded inventions, DOE relies primarily on contractor self-reporting and financial assistance award closeout procedures. Contractors are generally required to adhere to specific time frames for invention disclosure. Following contractor invention disclosure, DOE patent counsel monitor the invention through the end of a financial assistance award to ensure contractor compliance with time frame requirements for electing to retain ownership and applying for patent protection of the invention.", "DOE faces challenges in (1) ensuring that contractors disclose agency funded inventions and (2) managing information related to these disclosures and is taking steps to address them.", "Limited ability to ensure invention disclosure after funding ends: DOE does not have a documented process to ensure contractors disclose inventions after financial assistance awards end. To address this, DOE recently began two pilot efforts to determine the extent of undisclosed inventions. One is an audit of a sample of previously completed financial assistance awards and the other involves cross-referencing U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data against DOE information on inventions it funded. DOE is still implementing these efforts but reported identifying more than 100 potential undisclosed inventions. DOE will assess the results of the pilots to determine whether to continue them, according to DOE patent counsel.", "Data management limitations: DOE faces a challenge in managing information related to agency funded inventions because it relies on two different data systems that are outdated, unable to communicate with each other, and do not allow for electronic reporting. Under federal internal control standards, information should be recorded and communicated to management and others within the entity who need it and in a form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their responsibilities. DOE is in the process of updating its data systems and is planning the development of an electronic reporting function but has not established an implementation plan with milestones against which it can track its progress toward completing these efforts. By developing such a plan, DOE would have greater assurance that it is making timely progress toward these efforts.", "In addition, DOE faces challenges in its ability to monitor and influence the utilization and domestic manufacture of inventions it funded to protect its interests in them. DOE has proposed regulatory changes to address these challenges that would (1) require contractors to report on the utilization and domestic manufacture of agency funded inventions, (2) allow DOE to assess manufacturing plans as criteria for funding decisions, and (3) require contractors to obtain DOE authorization for changes in their control\u2014including ownership\u2014under certain circumstances.

The 1980  Bayh-Dole Act and other laws and implementing regulations provide the  legal framework for the ownership of inventions developed by nonfederal  recipients of federal research and development funding, commonly  referred to as contractors. To better transfer the results of federally  funded research to the public, this framework allows contractors\u2014rather  than the government\u2014to manage invention utilization by retaining  ownership of inventions they develop with federal funds. At the same  time, this framework requires contractors to take steps to protect the  government\u2019s interests in these inventions. Specifically, DOE has an  interest in facilitating the utilization of inventions resulting from the  research it funds because the public benefits when technological  advances become new goods and services in the marketplace.  Additionally, DOE generally has an interest in federally funded inventions  being made in the United States. To help protect these interests, the  Bayh-Dole Act and DOE\u2019s large business patent waivers establish time  frames in which contractors must disclose the development of federally  funded inventions, determine whether to retain ownership, and apply for  patent protection, among other things. Contractor compliance with these  requirements provides information on federally funded inventions that  agencies can use to protect the government\u2019s interests in them.", "In recent years, some congressional hearings raised concerns about  whether inventions funded by agencies, such as DOE, are being used to  support U.S. economic growth and competitiveness.

The Bayh-Dole Act allows nonprofits, small businesses,  and universities to retain ownership of federally funded inventions to  promote the utilization of inventions created through federal research and  development programs, and to provide an incentive for contractors to  commercialize federally funded inventions for sale in the marketplace.  The Bayh-Dole Act applies to universities, nonprofit organizations, and  small businesses that receive federal research funding. Federal agencies  that enter into financial assistance awards with these types of entities  must adhere to the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and its  implementing regulation developed by the Department of Commerce.particular, the Bayh-Dole Act requires agencies, including DOE, to  incorporate specific provisions into research and development financial  assistance awards that contractors must comply with to help protect the  government\u2019s interests in any resulting inventions.", "Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 \u00a7 9, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  5908.", "3.  apply for a patent on an invention, typically within 1 year of electing to  retain ownership.", "DOE generally requires similar actions from large businesses in order to  retain ownership of agency funded inventions, but the time frames can  vary depending on the specific provisions of an individual financial  assistance agreement.", "Compliance with these provisions informs agencies, such as DOE, of an  invention\u2019s existence, and helps ensure that a contractor takes timely  steps to patent the intellectual property embodied in the invention, should  the contractor wish to retain ownership of it. If a contractor does not  comply with these requirements, agencies have the authority to demand  ownership of a federally funded invention to provide the government the  opportunity to take steps to protect its interests in it. Once contractors  own a patented invention, they are generally free to use or transfer their  patent rights at their discretion, in compliance with applicable laws, such  as those regarding export control.", "The Bayh-Dole Act also identifies certain interests the government has in  federally funded inventions, including their utilization and domestic  manufacture. DOE\u2019s Patent Waiver Regulation does not explicitly identify  these interests with regard to inventions developed by large business  contractors, but the waivers themselves generally will outline specific  requirements related to invention utilization and domestic manufacture as  shown below.", "Utilization.

However, DOE has no  documented process to monitor inventions after award closeout. Due to  the time that may elapse between when a contractor files a patent  application and when a patent is granted by the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office, DOE funded inventions may exist that are not  identifiable through public searches at the time a financial assistance  award ends. Under such a scenario, if the contractor did not voluntarily  disclose an invention, the invention would not be identifiable during  DOE\u2019s closeout procedures. Instead, DOE patent counsel told us they  rely on contractors to voluntarily disclose such information following  financial assistance award closeout. As a result, the potential exists for  DOE to be unaware of inventions that it funded and in which it would  retain interests.", "To address this challenge, DOE recently launched two pilot projects  aimed at better understanding the extent of undisclosed inventions. One  pilot project is an audit of a sample of previously completed financial  assistance awards to determine the extent to which contractors did not  disclose DOE funded inventions. The second pilot project involves cross- referencing U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data against DOE  information on inventions it funded.", "In the first pilot project, which began in December 2013, DOE developed  draft audit procedures to sample previously completed financial  assistance awards and determine the extent to which contractors did not  disclose agency funded inventions. Under the draft audit procedures,  DOE patent counsel (1) audit contractor activities for any indication of  patents, patent applications, or inventions that might have been  developed with DOE funding but were not disclosed to DOE; (2) submit  demand letters to contractors to obtain ownership of any potentially  undisclosed inventions; and (3) work with contractors, depending on the  circumstances of nondisclosure, to allow them to retain ownership of the  inventions. The draft audit procedures set a target of annually sampling  100 randomly selected financial assistance awards completed during the  previous 5 years, which represents approximately 5 percent of the  agreements closed out during that period, according to DOE  documentation. As of December 2014, DOE patent counsel told us that  they had reviewed 99 financial assistance awards completed during the  previous 5 years and identified three undisclosed inventions for which  they sent demand letters to the relevant contractors. DOE patent counsel  told us that they granted one of the contractors an extension of time to  retain ownership of the undisclosed invention because DOE determined  that the nondisclosure was an oversight. DOE patent counsel said that  they resolved another as a data entry error. As of December 2014, DOE  had not received a response to the third demand letter. DOE modified its  draft audit procedures based on initial testing, and patent counsel told us  that they might conduct another phase of pilot testing before assessing  the overall results of the audit procedures and making a determination  about whether to implement the pilot project on a permanent basis. They  told us that this decision will depend on the extent to which the pilot  project identifies undisclosed inventions compared with the resources\u2014 principally staff hours\u2014necessary to conduct it. For example, if the audit  procedures identify few undisclosed inventions, DOE could be less likely  to implement it permanently.", "DOE\u2019s second pilot project involves cross-referencing U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office data against DOE information on inventions it funded.  For this pilot project, DOE patent counsel analyzed data from a U.S.  Patent and Trademark Office database to identify inventions or patents  with a government interest clause indicating the patent stemmed from  DOE funding. Then, DOE patent counsel reviewed the data to determine  if information on issued patents or published patent applications also  existed in DOE\u2019s PATMIS data system, with patent files not identified in  DOE\u2019s data system representing possible unreported inventions or  patents. For the pilot, DOE patent counsel told us that they reviewed 549  patented inventions that they identified as absent from DOE\u2019s data  system. Through this effort, DOE patent counsel told us they identified  100 patented inventions that may have been undisclosed and issued 40  demand letters covering 64 undisclosed inventions to contractors.

They told us that, in each instance, DOE determined that the  contractor had acted in good faith and allowed an extension of time for  the contractors to file the required disclosure paperwork to retain  ownership. According to DOE patent counsel, the 5 other contractors to  which DOE issued demand letters demonstrated that they had not failed  to comply with invention disclosure requirements. DOE patent counsel  explained that the related inventions were either disclosed to DOE but not  logged into its data systems, or were logged incorrectly into its data  systems, among other reasons. DOE patent counsel said that this effort  helped DOE identify several inventions that were not properly disclosed.

DOE patent counsel explained that this  would enhance DOE\u2019s ability to share invention information across the  agency to better enable it to manage information to track contractor  compliance with financial assistance award provisions. DOE patent  counsel told us the agency has created a workgroup composed of  representatives from federal agencies and DOE laboratories to determine  the requirements for this new \u201cone click invention reporting\u201d capability and  tentatively plans to begin software development in the spring of 2015,  with an initial pilot capability scheduled for fall of 2015 and full deployment  in early 2016, subject to available funding.", "While DOE transitioned its IP Master system to IP Manager, and has  developed an implementation plan with milestones for the additional  capability it wants to add to the IP Manager system, DOE patent counsel  said the agency does not have an implementation plan with milestones  for when PATMIS would be migrated to IP Manager.

According to DOE patent counsel, as of November 2014, DOE  had not prioritized funding to migrate the data and consolidate the  databases. DOE also has not established milestones for its efforts to (1)  identify requirements for the \u201cone click invention reporting\u201d capability it  plans to add to IP Manager or (2) evaluate any system modifications  necessary as a result of migrating IP Master to IP Manager and  associated system requirements.", "Under federal standards for internal control, information should be  recorded and communicated to management and others within the entity  who need it and in a form and within a time frame that enables them to  carry out their internal control and other responsibilities.

Specifically, they noted that it is not a routine process and  often requires substantial internal agency analysis, as well as  coordination with other agencies, including the Department of Commerce.  Additionally, any broadened requirements apply only to the specific  programs or activities covered by the determination. For example, in  2011, DOE determined that an exceptional circumstance existed  regarding DOE\u2019s SunShot Initiative. Specifically, DOE proposed  requiring a certain level of domestic manufacture for all inventions  developed under the SunShot Initiative by all contractors, as well as their  licensees.following a review to identify international trade and other issues,   However, this proposed requirement was not implemented  according to DOE patent counsel. DOE patent counsel also said that the  limitations of U.S. Preference provisions\u2014which apply to small  businesses, academia, and nonprofits\u2014constitute a challenge to  protecting the agency\u2019s interest in domestic manufacture. Specifically,  such provisions require the exclusive licensees of contractors, but not the  contractors themselves, to substantially manufacture agency funded  inventions domestically. To address this limitation, DOE\u2019s proposed  regulatory change would allow programs to require that potential for-profit  contractors submit a U.S. Manufacturing Plan as part of any funding  proposal. In turn, DOE would be able to use these plans as criteria in  assessing funding proposals and making financial assistance award  decisions. Under the proposed regulatory change, and consistent with  applicable law, DOE could make such plans binding for any licensee or  entity that subsequently acquired ownership of an invention or technology  developed under a DOE financial assistance award. DOE patent counsel  explained that requiring and enforcing U.S. Manufacturing Plans  increases the agency\u2019s ability to influence the domestic manufacture of  inventions it funded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Limited Ability to Influence Changes in Control of Contractors", "paragraphs": ["DOE faces a challenge in influencing the change in control\u2014such as  ownership\u2014of contractors engaged in DOE financial assistance awards.  A change in control may affect a contractor\u2019s ability to carry out the  project that DOE is funding and, according to DOE patent counsel, the  agency currently does not require contractors to notify it of such changes.  DOE\u2019s proposed regulation would require contractors to notify the agency  of changes in their control in certain circumstances.regulation would establish procedures for the change of control, including  ownership, of a contractor that received a DOE funding award of more   The proposed  than $10 million. The affected contractor would be required to notify the  agency within 30 days of a change of control, or within 30 days if the  contractor had a reason to know that such a change is likely. Failure to  notify DOE would be grounds for suspension or termination of the  financial assistance award.

DOE recently upgraded one of its data  systems\u2014IP Master\u2014to a new system called IP Manager, which became  operational in November 2014 and has developed an implementation  plan with milestones for the additional capability it wants to add to the IP  Manager system. However, DOE has not developed an implementation  plan with appropriate milestones to help assess its progress toward  completing key steps, such as moving the data in its primary PATMIS  database\u2014which contains the majority of the agency\u2019s invention  records\u2014into the new IP Manager system, or for defining the  requirements for planned or potential upgrades to that system.
