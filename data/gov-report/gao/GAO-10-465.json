But in Iraq and Afghanistan--both in U.S. Central Command's (CENTCOM) area of responsibility--there is no clear distinction between front lines and rear areas, and support forces are sometimes exposed to hostile fire without help from combat arms units. The House report to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010 directed GAO to report on combat skills training for support forces. GAO assessed the extent to which (1) Army and Marine Corps support forces are completing required combat skills training; (2) the services and CENTCOM have information to validate completion of required training; and (3) the services have used lessons learned to adjust combat skills training for support forces. To do so, GAO analyzed current training requirements, documentation of training completion, and lessons learned guidance; observed support force training; and interviewed headquarters officials, trainers, and trainees between August 2009 and February 2010."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Army and Marine Corps support forces undergo significant combat skills training, but additional actions could help clarify CENTCOM's training requirements, ensure the services fully incorporate those requirements into their training requirements, and improve the consistency of training that is being conducted. CENTCOM has issued a list of training tasks to be completed, in addition to the services' training requirements, before deploying to its area of operations. However, there is confusion over which forces the CENTCOM requirements apply to, the conditions under which the tasks are to be trained, and the standards for successfully completing the training. As a result, interpretations of the requirements vary and some trainees receive detailed, hands-on training for a particular task while others simply observe a demonstration of the task. In addition, while the Army and Marine Corps are training their forces on most of CENTCOM's required tasks, servicemembers are not being trained on some required tasks prior to deploying. While units collect information on the completion of training tasks, additional actions would help higher level decision-makers assess the readiness of deploying units and servicemembers. Currently, both CENTCOM and the services lack complete information on the extent to which Army and Marine Corps support forces are completing required combat skills training. The Army has recently designated the Digital Training Management System as its system of record for tracking the completion of required training, but guidance concerning system implementation is unclear and the system lacks some needed capabilities. As a result, support forces are not fully utilizing the system, and are inconsistently tracking completion of individual and unit training using paper records, stand-alone spreadsheets, and other automated systems. The Marine Corps also uses inconsistent approaches to document training completion. Furthermore, as GAO reported in May 2008, CENTCOM does not have a clearly defined waiver process to provide visibility over the extent to which personnel are deploying to its area of operations without having completed its required training tasks. As a result, CENTCOM and the services have limited visibility over the extent to which servicemembers have or have not completed all required training. While trainers at Army and Marine Corps training sites have applied lessons learned information and made significant changes to the combat skills training they provide support forces, the changes to training have varied across sites. Army and Marine Corps doctrine requires the collection of after action reports, the primary formal vehicle for collecting lessons learned. Lessons are also shared informally, such as through communication between deployed forces and units training to replace them. While the services have these formal and informal means to facilitate the sharing of lessons learned information, trainers at the various training sites are not consistently sharing information about the changes they have made to their training programs. As a result, servicemembers are trained inconsistently and units that are deploying for similar missions sometimes receive different types and amounts of training."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the Army and Marine Corps have deployed a large number of  support forces to U.S. Central Command\u2019s (CENTCOM) area of  responsibility to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We also  observed support force training, interviewed Army and Marine Corps  trainers, and active and reserve component units participating in  predeployment training, and analyzed information from training sites.  Specifically, we conducted discussions with trainers and members of four  Army active component, five Army Reserve, and one Army National Guard  support units and three active component Marine Corps combat logistics  battalions.

To assess the extent to  which the services and Central Command have information to validate the  completion of required combat skills training, we reviewed joint and  service guidance to determine the requirements for documenting the  completion or waiving of training requirements. We also interviewed  combatant command and service headquarters and training command  officials as well as members of the previously listed Army and Marine  Corps units and reviewed service documentation concerning the extent to  which servicemembers were completing required training. To assess the  extent to which the Army and Marine Corps have applied lessons learned  information to adjust combat skills training for support forces, we  evaluated service policies on the collection and dissemination of this  information. At the sites we visited, we also interviewed training command  officials, trainers, unit officials in charge of developing training plans, and  liaisons from the service lessons learned centers.

Task  conditions identify all equipment, tools, materials, references, job aids,  and supporting personnel required to perform the task, while standards  indicate the basis for judging effectiveness of task performance. For some  training tasks, CENTCOM includes specific guidance. For example,  weapons qualification requirements include a detailed discussion of when  the qualification must take place, equipment that must be worn, and range  distances.", "For some training tasks, however, CENTCOM does not provide any  conditions or standards. For example, as noted above, CENTCOM requires  that all deploying forces complete HMMWV rollover training, but it does  not specify how the training should be conducted. Consequently, service  training has varied within and among the Army and Marine Corps. At one  Marine Corps site, training officials explained that HMMWV rollover  training could be completed in less than a half hour. On the other hand,  trainers at one Army training site noted that their HMMWV rollover  training consisted of a full day of training that included a classroom  overview and hands-on practice in a simulator with both day and night  scenarios, pyrotechnics to simulate improvised explosive devices, and the  incorporation of casualty evacuation procedures.", "For other training tasks, the CENTCOM requirements contain only general  guidance on training conditions. For example, for some tasks such as first  aid and improvised explosive device training, CENTCOM requires that  classroom training be followed up with practical application during field  training that mimics the harsh, chaotic, and stressful conditions  servicemembers encounter in the CENTCOM area of operations. However,  the requirements do not identify the materials or training aides to be used  in conducting the training and they do not indicate the standard for  successfully completing the training. While service officials acknowledged  that, as outlined in Title 10 of the U.S. Code, it is their responsibility to  train servicemembers, they stated that CENTCOM\u2019s list of minimum  theater entry training tasks was unclear, which resulted in varying service  interpretations of the tasks.", "Furthermore, CENTCOM training requirements are communicated to the  services in a document that also outlines training requirements for joint  sourced forces.

Service officials reported  that changes to training requirements have also added to the confusion  over training requirements and priorities. While the latest set of  CENTCOM requirements contained in the joint sourced forces document  was issued on May 7, 2009, ground commanders have issued several  requirements since then.

For example, neither service has  provided MRAP vehicle rollover training to all of their support forces.  MRAP vehicle rollover training has been identified as a key combat skill  for deploying forces. MRAP vehicles have much larger profiles and  weights than the vehicles they replaced in theater, and as a result, pose a  greater risk of tip or rollover when negotiating slopes, trenches, ditches,  and other obstacles. Further, rollover risks are higher in Afghanistan due  to uneven terrain and sub-par road conditions.", "A November 2009 DOD study on MRAP vehicle rollovers noted that since  2007, 178 MRAP vehicle mishaps involved some type of rollover that  resulted in a total of 215 injuries and 11 fatalities. The study  recommended more practice on rollover drills, and CENTCOM has  required this training for all deploying forces. According to Marine Corps  officials, the Marine Corps is prioritizing MRAP vehicle rollover training,  and current Marine Corps guidance requires this training only for marines  expected to utilize MRAP vehicles. However, use of these vehicles in  theater has been increasing, and officials at I Marine Expeditionary Force  explained that they are trying to train deploying forces to meet the MRAP  vehicle rollover training requirement. A rollover trainer was originally  scheduled to arrive at their training area in February 2010, but the delivery  has been delayed and there is currently not a projected delivery date.", "Army officials explained that they have attempted to meet the CENTCOM  requirement, but that a lack of MRAP rollover trainers at the Army\u2019s  training bases in the United States has prevented them from fully training  all forces on this task prior to deployment. In the meantime, some support  forces are getting required training after they deploy, but Army officials  were unable to confirm whether all forces were getting the required  training.", "Moreover, neither the Army nor the Marine Corps have provided non- lethal weapons training to all deploying support forces. CENTCOM  requires that all individuals deploying to its area of responsibility complete  training in non-lethal weapons usage, planning, and understanding of non- lethal weapons capability sets. DOD reported in December 2009 that  operational experience dictates the need for forces to be trained in non- lethal weapons and that current operations have highlighted the  imperative for the discriminate use of force to minimize civilian casualties  and the integral role that non-lethal weapons capabilities provide in  achieving that objective. In that report, DOD noted that non-lethal  weapons training has been mandated by CENTCOM for all deploying  forces and that non-lethal weapons training must be further integrated into  service training. Further, GAO has previously reported that DOD needed to  provide clearer weapons employment guidance for non-lethal weapons  and incorporate this guidance into training curricula. Due to the  confusion over what forces CENTCOM\u2019s joint sourced training  requirements apply to, Marine Corps officials explained that they do not  believe the non-lethal weapons training requirement applies to them and  do not require this training. The Army requires non-lethal weapons training  only for combat arms units.

Army and Marine Corps officials explained that if a  support unit does not demonstrate combat skills proficiency during the  final event, when and where remediation is to occur is left to the  discretion of the individual unit commander and can be completed in  theater after deploying. For example, a Marine Corps combat logistics  battalion that deployed in January 2010 was assessed fully trained in its  logistics mission, but not proficient in basic warrior tasks during its final  collective training event at Exercise Mojave Viper. Specifically, the unit  was not proficient in fifteen of sixteen warrior tasks including reacting to  ambush, escalation of force, individual continuing actions, and casualty  evacuation procedures. The Marine Corps logistics training officer who  conducts the final unit after action reviews for combat logistics battalions  explained that poor ratings on basic warrior skills were not uncommon for  support units during their final collective training event. While the unit  conducted remedial training on casualty evacuation procedures prior to  deployment, it did not conduct remedial training in other areas, since the  unit had 15 days to complete both required training that they were unable  to accomplish prior to Exercise Mojave Viper and remedial training, and  the unit deployed on time. Service officials explained that it is the  responsibility of unit commanders to exercise judgment in assessing  whether the unit has the collective skills needed to accomplish its mission.

However, according to  Army officials, in the end, the final decision is largely based on individual  unit commanders\u2019 assessments of the readiness of their units.", "While the Army issued guidance requiring tracking of training completion  through a servicewide system, the system has not been fully utilized. In  December 2009, the Army updated a training regulation and required that  all individual and collective training tasks be documented for soldiers  through the Digital Training Management System (DTMS) in order to  better standardize training. Army units were required to report  completion of certain requirements, such as suicide prevention classes and  the Army physical fitness test tasks, in DTMS prior to the revision of this  regulation. However, the revised regulation designates DTMS as the only  authorized automated system for managing unit training and requires units  to track each individual soldier\u2019s completion of all required training tasks,  to include all predeployment individual and collective training. The  regulation was effective as of January 18, 2010, and states that DTMS will  be able to provide units with the ability to plan, resource, and manage unit  and individual training. However, as of February 2010, the system was not  fully operational, and while active component units were able to enter all  of their data into DTMS, reserve component units were not yet able to do  so because of a lack of interfaces among existing tracking systems and  DTMS. The Army has not yet developed a detailed schedule with  milestones and resource requirements for fully developing the capability  for reserve component units to input data. Neither has it established  milestones for active and reserve component units to enter data into the  system. Furthermore, the guidance does not assign responsibility for  ensuring compliance and does not make it clear whether previously  completed training needs to be entered into the system or only training  that is completed after the January 18, 2010, implementation date.", "The Army\u2019s active and reserve components have both begun using DTMS,  but DTMS is not being fully or consistently used by either component. U.S.  Army Forces Command officials reported that the capabilities of DTMS  are fully operational among the active component, but that units have not  consistently used the system. During our discussions with commanders  from four active component battalions in February 2010, we found that the  system, while operational, was not being fully utilized. We noted that the  battalions used DTMS to different degrees. Specifically, two commanders  said that their battalions relied on DTMS to track training schedules and  some tasks, such as weapons qualification and physical fitness, but they  said that their battalions did not track completion of all required tasks  down to the individual soldier level. The other two battalion commanders  noted that they did not use DTMS to track completion of any training  tasks. Overall, none of the four battalions used DTMS the way the Army  intended it to be used, but emphasized interest in incorporating the system  into how they track training. First Army officials reported that DTMS is  not fully operational among the reserve component. Army officials  reported that not all of the individual systems the reserve component used  to track completion of training were interchangeable with DTMS, and as  such, the system was not fully operational. Moreover, in our discussions  with unit commanders from five Army Reserve units and one National  Guard unit in November 2009, we noted that the system was not being  utilized. In fact, none of those commanders were familiar with DTMS  despite the fact that the Army had required the entry of suicide prevention  classes and the Army physical fitness test tasks into DTMS by September  2009.", "Instead of using DTMS, Army support units rely on tools such as paper  rosters and stand-alone spreadsheets and databases to track completion of  individual and unit training, and the tools used are not consistent among  units and commands. For the reserve component, First Army has  established an Excel spreadsheet, referred to as the Commander\u2019s  Training Tool, to track completion of individual training tasks. According  to officials, the tool, intended to serve as an \u201cin-lieu-of\u201d system until DTMS  reached full operational capability, is used as a model for tracking systems  at the individual mobilization training centers. Specifically, officials at one  mobilization training center told us that they had developed an  individualized tracking system based on the Commander\u2019s Training Tool,  but had tailored the system to meet the needs of the individual command.  Within the active component, unit commanders we spoke with noted that  they also rely on tools such as paper rosters and stand-alone spreadsheets  and databases to track completion of individual and unit training at the  battalion level and below, providing regular status updates to the brigade  and division commanders. Reliance on various inconsistent tracking  mechanisms instead of the servicewide DTMS limits the visibility unit  commanders have over completion of required training tasks.", "The Marine Corps also uses inconsistent approaches to track completion  of required training and relies instead on paper rosters and stand-alone  spreadsheets for tracking. Specifically, 2nd Marine Logistics Group  officials said that individual units are responsible for tracking completion  of individual training and that this tracking is completed through large  Excel spreadsheets, but that the information is regularly reviewed by the  Marine Logistics Group. A commander from a support unit within the 2nd  Marine Logistics Group noted that training was tracked and reviewed  using Excel spreadsheets. Further, the unit\u2019s operations officer noted that  within the battalion, individual training is tracked at the company level,  and once a week, the information is provided to the battalion operations  officer, who then briefs the battalion commander on overall percentages  of marines who have completed the required tasks.", "We also spoke with officials from the 1st Marine Logistics Group who  noted that the individual units are responsible for tracking the completion  of both individual and unit training requirements. While the 1st Marine  Logistics Group provides units with a summary level spreadsheet to report  the status of the unit training, the individual units are responsible for  tracking the completion of individual training and the Marine Logistics  Group does not track the completion of individual training. Officials from  the 1st Marine Logistics Group noted that unit operations officers have  visibility over individuals and their respective training, and this  information is rolled up and provided at a high level to the Commanding  Officer.", "A commander of a support unit we spoke with noted that his unit used the  Excel spreadsheet provided by the 1st Marine Logistics Group to track  completion of individual training requirements, with individual tracking  being done at the company level. Further, sometimes when marines  transfer among units, documentation of completed training tasks is not  provided to the receiving unit. For example, a support battalion operations  officer we spoke with noted that the battalion received many marines  throughout the deployment process, but some marines arrived without  documentation of the training they had previously completed. In the  absence of a consistent approach to track completion of training tasks, the  Marine Corps relies on inconsistent tracking mechanisms among  individual units and commands. These inconsistent tools limit the visibility  unit commanders have over completion of required training tasks,  particularly when marines are transferred from one unit to another for  deployment purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CENTCOM Lacks a Process for Waiving Training Requirements, Limiting the Command\u2019s Visibility over Whether Forces Are Completing Required Training", "paragraphs": ["While CENTCOM has issued a consolidated list of minimum theater entry  requirements for all individuals deploying to its area of responsibility, it  has not issued overarching waiver guidance or established a formal  process for waiving each of these requirements (e.g., basic marksmanship  and weapons qualification, law of land warfare, and HMMWV and MRAP  vehicle egress assistance training) in circumstances where the  requirements are not going to be met. However, CENTCOM officials  provided an example of a case where waiver requirements for one specific  task were outlined. In September 2007, the command issued a message  requiring HMMWV egress assistance training for all forces deploying to its  area of responsibility. This requirements message included steps the  services needed to take to waive the requirement in the event that the  training could not be completed by 100 percent of the deploying personnel  before deployment. However, a similar waiver process is not outlined for  other required CENTCOM tasks.", "Officials from both the Army and Marine Corps noted that there are  instances where servicemembers are not completing all of the required  training. Specifically, when we spoke to unit commanders and unit  training officers, we were told that some personnel were not meeting these  individual training requirements and that units were not requesting formal  waivers from CENTCOM or communicating this information to  CENTCOM. For example, an operations officer from a Marine Corps\u2019  combat logistics battalion reported that some of the unit\u2019s deploying  marines would not complete their required individual training tasks, such  as the CENTCOM-required MRAP vehicle egress training. Moreover, the  commander of an active component Army support battalion noted that in  validating his unit for deployment, he did not focus on completion of  individual tasks, instead assessing the unit\u2019s ability to complete tasks  collectively. As such, the unit commander\u2019s decision was not based on  whether all individuals completed all of the required individual training  tasks. There is no clearly defined process for waiving these training  requirements, and there is no clear or established method for the services  to report to CENTCOM that some servicemembers are not completing  CENTCOM\u2019s required training. As a result, CENTCOM cannot determine if  additional training is required following arrival in theater.", "In May 2008, we reported that the Air Force and Navy implemented  procedures for waiving CENTCOM-required training without fully  coordinating with the CENTCOM headquarters office responsible for  developing the training requirements. Specifically, we reported that Navy  nonstandard forces that completed Navy combat skills training more than  90 days prior to their deployment would normally have to update their  training by repeating the course, but that they could waive this  requirement if they completed relevant combat skills training that  significantly exceeded what they would have received in the Navy course.  We further reported that the Air Force granted waivers for combat skills  training on a case-by-case basis. At the time, CENTCOM officials noted  that the services had not consistently coordinated these waiver policies  with their command. Therefore, CENTCOM did not have full visibility over  the extent to which its assigned forces had met its established training  requirements. At the time, we recommended that the Office of the  Secretary of Defense develop a policy to guide the training and use of  nonstandard forces, and the policy include training waiver responsibilities  and procedures. In February 2010, an official from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense reported that they planned to issue a revised policy  on non-standard forces by the end of the year, and that the revised  guidance would address the issue of granting waivers. Furthermore,  during our review, we learned that CENTCOM\u2019s lack of visibility applies to  a larger population of forces than just the Air Force and Navy nonstandard  forces, instead applying to all forces deploying to the CENTCOM area of  responsibility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Army and Marine Corps Have Made Significant Changes to Combat Skills Training as a Result of Lessons Learned, but Information Concerning These Changes Is Not Being Consistently Shared", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Marine Corps have made significant changes to their  combat skills training for support forces as a result of lessons learned, but  the services have not uniformly applied lessons learned.

Trainers and units noted that they prepare after action reports at several  different times including after final collective training exercises and during  and after deployment. Depending on the complexity of the deficiency that  is addressed in an after action report and the resources required to  address the deficiency, it can sometimes take considerable time to see  actions that result from formal after action reports. However, after action  reports have resulted in changes to the way the services train and deploy  their forces, as the following examples illustrate.", "In July 2009, the Marine Corps officially established and began training  Female Engagement Teams, small detachments of female marines  whose goal was to engage Afghan women. The concept of a Female  Engagement Team was first introduced in February 2009 as part of a  special operations mission in Afghanistan. An after action report  emphasizing the need for forces to be organized and trained to engage  Afghan women was submitted in response to an incident in May 2009,  in which the enemy escaped dressed as women because male Marines  were not allowed to engage Afghan women. As a result, the Marine  Corps expanded the use of the Female Engagement Team concept,  developing an actual program and implementing a training plan. In  December 2009, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan released a memorandum that  emphasized the need for increased training and use of Female  Engagement Teams. Prior to that time, the use of Female Engagement  Teams was primarily a Marine Corps effort. However, the  memorandum stated that all services should create these teams, and  since the memorandum was issued, officials noted that the Army has  begun to assess how it can best meet the needs in theater for these  teams with its available personnel.  In November 2009, the 1st Marine Logistics Group established and  conducted a new predeployment training course for support forces that  focused on combat logistics patrols. The course was developed in  response to at least two different units\u2019 after action reports, one  submitted by a unit returning from Afghanistan and another submitted  by a unit undergoing final predeployment training, which highlighted  the need for leaders of support units to receive additional training and  experience with combat patrols. The redeploying unit\u2019s after action  report identified shortcomings in how support units conducting convoy  missions outside of forward operating bases were trained, and the unit  undergoing final training\u2019s after action report identified deficiencies in  the amount of time spent on training. The new 5-day course\u2014the  Combat Logistics Patrol Leaders Course\u2014focuses on providing  support units with the skills they need to conduct combat logistics  patrols, which require support forces to leave protected areas where  they can become the target for enemies, as opposed to simply convoy  missions conducted inside protected forward operating bases.", "The services also rely on lessons collected through informal means when  adjusting predeployment training. Informal collection methods include  obtaining feedback from units currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  through informal discussions, observations made by trainers or deploying  unit leaders during brief visits to theater, and informal conversations  among personnel within service commands and training organizations.  Army and Marine Corps officials stated that there is regular  communication between personnel who are deployed in theater and the  personnel who are preparing to deploy to replace them. Furthermore, they  said that the deployed personnel often provide vital information regarding  the current conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which the deploying unit  commander and trainers can use to make immediate adjustments to  training. Much like changes made as a result of formal lessons learned, the  informal collections have also resulted in changes to the way the services  train and deploy their forces, as the following examples illustrate.", "An Army installation established an Individual Replacement Training  program to provide individual replacement soldiers with the combat  skills needed to join their parent units in theater. Army officials noted  that approximately 2 years ago, certain units were tasked to train these  individual replacements on a 4- to 5-month rotating basis. However, the  units that conducted the training were unable to keep pace with the  flow of individual replacements because of their high pace of  operations. Based on feedback obtained from the units and  observations by unit leadership, Army civilians were assigned  responsibility for the training, which resulted in the Individual  Replacement Training program. As of 2009, the Individual Replacement  Training program trained approximately 3,400 soldiers, and combat  skills have been trained more consistently.", "Since improvised explosive devices are commonly used against military  forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, training regarding the defeat of these  devices is a CENTCOM predeployment training requirement and was  cited as a key focus at the training facilities we visited. Officials we  spoke with explained that improvised explosive devices pose a serious  threat to military forces because the types of devices the enemies use  constantly change. While training facilities have incorporated the most  recent improvised explosive device defeat tactics into their training  based on information provided by the Joint Improvised Explosive  Device Defeat Organization, they also obtain and immediately  incorporate the tactics provided informally by individuals in theater."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Services Would Benefit from Sharing Changes Made as a Result of Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["Trainers at the sites we visited told us that they had made adjustments to  training based on both informal and formal lessons learned information  that they had received.

For example:    One site significantly enhanced its HMMWV rollover training based on  informal feedback. Specifically, the training was enhanced to include  hands-on practice in a simulator with both day and night and land and  water scenarios, as well as an emphasis on new vehicle features, such  as the dual release seatbelts, when exiting the vehicle in an emergency.  While trainers from this site provided information about these  enhancements to some of their counterparts at other training facilities,  HMMWV rollover training varies significantly from site to site. At one of  the sites we visited, HMMWV rollover training consisted simply of a  short demonstration.", "At one training site we visited, trainers were teaching Army Reserve  support forces who had not been mobilized specific tactics for entering  and clearing buildings, while other trainers at the same site were  teaching soldiers who had been mobilized different tactics for the same  task. Officials we spoke with stated that these differences in tactics are  a result of a lack of sharing of information among trainers. Specifically,  the First Army trainers who were training soldiers after mobilization  were not consistently sharing information with U.S. Army Reserve  trainers who were training soldiers prior to mobilization. Since one of  the primary purposes for conducting repetitive training is to develop an  intuitive response to certain circumstances, repetitive training that  employs different tactics may not be as effective as repetitive training  that uses consistent tactics.", "Although officials at the training facilities we visited note that they have  made efforts to share some of the information obtained and subsequent  changes made as a result of lessons learned with their counterparts at  other training facilities, the sharing has been inconsistent. According to a  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction, organizations  participating in the joint lessons learned program are to coordinate  activities and collaboratively exchange observations, findings, and  recommendations to the maximum extent possible. While the services  have formal and informal means to facilitate the sharing of lessons learned  information, trainers at the various training sites are not consistently  sharing information about the changes they have made to their training  programs.

The Army,  Marine Corps, and CENTCOM continue to emphasize the importance of  training and have identified specific tasks to be accomplished as part of  predeployment training that they believe will better prepare forces to  operate in the current operational environment. While forces clearly  undergo significant training, clarifying CENTCOM\u2019s training requirements,  including more clearly defining the specific tasks to be completed by  different types of forces and the conditions and standards for the content  of training, would enhance the service\u2019s ability to ensure that forces are  consistently trained on required tasks. Furthermore, in order to make  informed decisions on deploying forces and assigning missions once  deployed, the services and CENTCOM need information on the extent of  training completed by forces prior to deployment. Inconsistencies in  existing approaches for documenting the completion of training and the  lack of a formal process for granting waivers to training and  communicating waiver decisions hamper the services and CENTCOM in  their ability to get a clear picture of which units or individuals have been  fully trained for certain missions and whether any capability gaps might  exist upon the forces\u2019 arrival in theater.

In its comments, DOD stated  that the Army\u2019s training management system of record has been directed  to be implemented and that in order to fully leverage this capability, it will  take time, training and resources to extend the system to the entire  organization. Instead of stipulating DTMS, DOD requested that GAO  address (in our recommendation) more generally the Army\u2019s training  management system of record. We recognize that it will take time for the  Army to fully implement the system, but also note that it has not set a  specific schedule, with key elements, such as work to be performed,  resources needed, and milestones for start and completion of activities,  which we believe will add discipline to the process, help guide its efforts,  and help the Army to plan for any schedule deviations. We recognize that  the Army continues to refine DTMS and that changes could occur.  However, at this point in time, Army guidance specifically characterizes  DTMS as the Army\u2019s training management system of record; therefore, we  do not agree that our recommendation should be adjusted.", "Furthermore, DOD stated that some findings in the draft report are  partially accurate, but that a number of points of information and  clarification related to DTMS provided by the Department of the Army do  not appear in the findings. For example, DOD noted that ongoing efforts  by the Army designed to improve DTMS will expand existing functionality  and interfaces to enhance and broaden operational use of the application  by Army units. It noted the Army has a review process that, among other  things, monitors progress of DTMS implementation and allows for the  establishment and approval of priorities for developing interfaces with  other existing legacy systems and manual processes. In addition, DOD  stated that the report cites that DTMS is not fully operational because all  interfaces are not completed to the satisfaction of a subordinate  organization, which, in DOD\u2019s view, does not drive the level of program  functionality or define the point in time when the system is fully  operational. DOD noted that the inclusion of updated interfaces enables  data input from other sources and that the basic functionality of DTMS is  in place, operational, and available for use by units across the Army. DOD  also noted some Army units are still using spreadsheets and/ or legacy  systems to track individual training rather than DTMS, but that this is a  function of compliance, not operational capability or the availability of  system interfaces. It further stated that the Army is currently working to  institute methods to improve compliance as outlined in AR 350-1, the  Army\u2019s regulation that guides training.", "We recognize that the basic functionality of DTMS exists and that the  Army is continuing to take steps to implement DTMS, improve the  interfaces between DTMS and legacy systems and processes, and improve  overall compliance with the requirement for units to report in DTMS.  However, our work suggests that it is not only a lack of compliance  preventing full utilization of the system, but also a lack of awareness  among all of the operational units that DTMS even exists. For example,  within the reserve component, some unit commanders we interviewed  were unfamiliar with DTMS or that they were required, by Army guidance,  to use the system to report training completion. Further, while we  recognize interfaces exist, our work shows they are not fully mature to the  point where they are compatible with existing tracking systems, thereby  limiting the ability of the reserve component to fully use DTMS as  intended.", "DOD further noted that the report infers that DTMS could or should be the  source for CENTCOM and the Army to certify and/ or validate unit training  for deployments, but due to it not being fully utilized, the completion of  combat skills training could be in question. DOD explained that DTMS is a  training management system, and it is the responsibility of Commanders  and Army Service Component Commands to certify and validate units. As  stated in our report, we recognize that commanders and the service  component commands are responsible for the certification and validation  of units for deployment. However, in order to be more fully informed  about the training and readiness status of units before making decisions  about deployments, those making these decisions need visibility over the  completion of the combatant command and service pre-deployment  training requirements. Currently, DTMS does not provide unit  commanders or service component commands with this type of visibility,  and therefore, these individuals and commands must rely on the tracking  mechanisms we outlined in this report when certifying and validating  units, and these tracking mechanisms are not always complete or  consistent.

To conduct these discussion sessions, we  traveled to one Army installation and three Marine Corps installations in  the continental United States from August 2009 through December 2009  and conducted telephone discussions with representatives from one active  duty Army installation in February 2010. In selecting units to speak with,  we asked the service headquarters and force providers to identify all  support units that would be in pre-mobilization or predeployment training  during the time frame of our visit. The basic criteria used in selecting these  units was that they were an Army or Marine Corps support unit  participating in pre-mobilization or predeployment training and preparing  to deploy to or recently redeployed from either Iraq or Afghanistan. Thus,  our selection was limited since the time frame was so narrow. Once units  were identified, we spoke with the unit command elements and senior  enlisted servicemembers from nine support units that were available at the  individual sites we visited. Overall, we spoke with Army and Marine Corps  support units preparing to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan, and within  these units, some servicemembers who had previously deployed to Iraq or  Afghanistan. We also spoke with four available active component Army  support unit representatives who had recently returned from Iraq. Topics  of discussion during the sessions included development and  implementation of unit training plans, verification of training completion,  and equipment and manning challenges that impact training.
