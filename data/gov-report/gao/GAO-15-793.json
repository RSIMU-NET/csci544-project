This potential threat underscores the importance of a national biosurveillance capability\u2014that is, the ability to detect biological events of national significance to provide early warning and information to guide public health and emergency response. The 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 addresses this capability, in part, by creating NBIC within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); it was tasked with integrating information from human health, animal, plant, food, and environmental monitoring systems across the federal government, to improve the likelihood of identifying a biological event at an earlier stage. In recent years, NBIC's budget has ranged from $10 million to $13 million annually.", "GAO was asked to evaluate NBIC. This report discusses the (1) extent to which NBIC is implementing its roles as a biosurveillance integrator, and (2) options for improving such integration. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed NBIC products and activities; conducted interviews and surveyed 19 federal partners, 11 of which have key roles in biosurveillance; interviewed NBIC officials; and analyzed the 9/11 Commission Act, NBIC Strategic Plan , and National Strategy for Biosurveillance ."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) has activities that support its integration mission, but faces challenges that limit its ability to enhance the national biosurveillance capability. In the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Commission Act) and NBIC Strategic Plan , GAO identified three roles that NBIC must fulfill to meet its biosurveillance integration mission. The following describes actions and challenges in each role:", "Analyzer: NBIC is to use technology and subject matter expertise, including using analytical tools, to meaningfully connect disparate datasets and information for earlier warning and better situational awareness of biological events. GAO found that NBIC produces reports on biological events using open-source data, but faces challenges obtaining data and creating meaningful new information. For example, most of the federal partners with key roles in biosurveillance (8 of 11) stated that NBIC's products help their agencies identify biological events to little or no extent, generally because they already obtain such information directly from other federal partners more quickly. In addition, data that could help to identify and characterize a biological event may not exist or are not in a usable form. Further, few federal partners (5 of 19) reported that they share the data they do have with NBIC, citing legal and regulatory restrictions, among other reasons..", "Coordinator: NBIC is to bring together partners across the federal biosurveillance community to enhance understanding of biological events. NBIC has developed procedures and activities to coordinate with partners, such as daily and biweekly calls, but faces challenges related to the limited partner participation in the center's activities, lack of partner personnel detailed to NBIC, and competing structures for convening federal partners. For example, although NBIC would like to obtain liaisons from each of its federal partners, only 3 of 19 partners provided NBIC with dedicated liaisons.", "Innovator: NBIC is to facilitate the development of new tools to address gaps in biosurveillance integration. GAO found that NBIC has efforts underway to develop some tools, such as pilot projects examining the use of social media data to identify health trends, but faces challenges prioritizing developmental efforts. For example, partners noted limitations in NBIC's ability to address gaps, like limited resources and the difficulty in prioritizing the center's innovation efforts because its partners have diverse needs.", "GAO identified various options that could address these challenges, ranging from strengthening the center's ability to implement its current roles to repealing NBIC's statute. GAO also identified potential benefits and limitations with each option. For example, one option would be to provide NBIC with additional authorities to obtain data to better develop meaningful information; however this may also require additional investments. Another option is to not pursue national biosurveillance integration through NBIC and to consider designating one of the other federal partners with key roles in biosurveillance as the federal integrator. The options identified are not exhaustive, and some could be implemented together or in part. GAO did not evaluate the financial implications of each option, but acknowledges some options may require additional investment or shifting of resources or priorities to result in significant long lasting change."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations.

Further, because the data needed to detect an emerging  infectious disease or bioterrorism threat may come from a variety of  sources, the ability to share and analyze data from multiple sources may  help officials better collaborate to analyze data and quickly recognize the  nature of a disease event and its scope.", "The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of  2007 (9/11 Commission Act) established the National Biosurveillance  Integration Center (NBIC) within the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS); it was specifically tasked with integrating and analyzing  information from human health, animal, plant, food, and environmental  monitoring systems across the federal government and supporting the  interagency biosurveillance community. In analyzing this act, as well as  the August 2012 NBIC Strategic Plan, we identified three general roles  that NBIC, as a federal-level biosurveillance integrator, must carry out to  achieve the duties and outcomes described by NBIC\u2019s authorizing  legislation: (1) Analyzer, (2) Coordinator, and (3) Innovator.", "As an Analyzer, NBIC is to use technological tools and subject matter  expertise to develop shared situational awareness by creating  meaningful new insights from disparate datasets and information that  could not be gleaned in isolation.", "As a Coordinator, NBIC is to bring together multi-disciplinary partners  across interagency organizations to enhance understanding of new or  potential biological events, such as through the collaborative  development of products and services.", "As an Innovator, NBIC is to facilitate the development of new tools,  technology, and approaches to address gaps in biosurveillance  integration.", "In December 2009, we reported that NBIC was not fully equipped to carry  out its mission because it lacked key resources\u2014data and personnel\u2014 from its partner agencies, which may have been at least partially the  result of collaboration challenges it faced. For example, some partners  reported that they did not trust NBIC to use their information and  resources appropriately, while others were not convinced of the value that  working with NBIC provided because NBIC\u2019s mission was not clearly  articulated. In order to help NBIC enhance and sustain collaboration,  including the provision of data, personnel, and other resources, we  recommended that NBIC develop a strategy for addressing barriers to  collaboration and develop accountability mechanisms to monitor these  efforts. As previously noted, in August 2012, NBIC issued the NBIC  Strategic Plan, which is intended to provide NBIC\u2019s strategic vision, clarify  the center\u2019s mission and purpose, articulate the value that NBIC seeks to  provide to its partners, and lay the groundwork for setting interagency  roles, responsibilities, and procedures. Further, in November 2014, NBIC  completed its first biannual NBIC Federal Stakeholder Survey, which  NBIC uses to assess the usefulness of its products and activities and to  determine what improvements should be made on the basis of those  results. We believe these actions addressed the recommendations in our  prior report.", "You expressed interest in determining what progress NBIC has made in  contributing to the national biosurveillance capability. This report\u2019s  objectives are:  1.  To what extent is NBIC implementing its roles as a biosurveillance  integrator?  2.  What are options for improving federal biosurveillance integration, and  what are their benefits and limitations?", "To determine the extent to which NBIC is implementing its role as a  biosurveillance integrator, we conducted structured interviews with 19  federal departments and their component agencies across 13 of the 14  departments and agencies that compose the National Biosurveillance  Integration System (NBIS)\u2014the federal partners that NBIC is responsible  for coordinating because they have missions and resources that can  contribute to earlier detection and shared situational awareness for  biological events of national significance. Although NBIC has interaction  with other stakeholders, we selected these 19 federal agencies based on  their biosurveillance roles and responsibilities and because they were  federal departments or components within federal departments that have  signed the NBIC Advisory Board charter\u2014signifying their participation in  the NBIS. Prior to conducting our structured interviews, we provided a  list of these agencies to NBIC and senior NBIC officials agreed that the  agencies we identified represented the partners with which the center had  the most interaction and collaboration. We discussed with these NBIS  partners the extent to which NBIC has enhanced the national  biosurveillance capability by carrying out its national integrator roles and  any challenges the center has faced in doing so, including the extent to  which NBIC\u2019s products and activities enhance the agency\u2019s situational  awareness of biological events. Within these agencies, we interviewed  officials who serve on NBIC\u2019s Advisory Board or its Interagency Working  Group, as well as other relevant officials that regularly interact with NBIC,  review the center\u2019s products, or participate in the center\u2019s activities. As  part of this review, we did not interview or survey NBIC\u2019s nonfederal  stakeholders, such as state, local, tribal, or territorial agencies.", "We also conducted a Web-based survey of the 19 agencies to identify the  federal agencies from which they obtain information that contributes to  their agency\u2019s situational awareness of biological events, the methods  through which they share information from NBIC, and the extent to which  they participate in NBIC activities. We obtained a 100 percent response  rate on this survey.  In the survey, we asked each agency whether it  obtains information from each of the other agencies in our population, as  well as which types of information it obtains from them (perception-,  comprehension-, or projection-related information). We performed a  network analysis of these survey data, which is a quantitative and  graphical technique for identifying the underlying patterns in a complex  system of relationships among entities of interest. Additional information  on our survey methodology can be found in Appendix II.", "Further, we reviewed NBIC products, such as its daily Monitoring List e- mail and Biosurveillance Event Reports, and observed some NBIC  activities, such as its daily and bi-weekly calls. We reviewed key  documents that guide NBIC\u2019s activities and products, such as the August  2012 NBIC Strategic Plan, the July 2012 National Strategy for  Biosurveillance, and the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology  Policy\u2019s June 2013 National Biosurveillance Science and Technology  Roadmap (S&T Roadmap). We also reviewed other relevant documents,  such as NBIC\u2019s Advisory Board\u2019s charter, standard operating procedures  for the center\u2019s activities and protocols, memorandums of understanding  and interagency agreements between NBIC and its federal partners, the  results of NBIC\u2019s Federal Stakeholder Survey, and evaluations of NBIC\u2019s  pilot projects. We also interviewed NBIC officials to obtain their opinions  on the extent to which NBIC is implementing its roles as a biosurveillance  integrator and enhancing the national biosurveillance capability.", "To identify options for improving federal biosurveillance integration, as  well as their benefits and limitations, we examined the 9/11 Commission  Act to identify tasks and responsibilities that NBIC, as a federal-level  biosurveillance integrator, is to carry out. We analyzed documents that  identify potential gaps and needs in biosurveillance integration, including  the National Strategy for Biosurveillance and the S&T Roadmap. We also  obtained information from our structured interviews with NBIC\u2019s federal  partners on their views about what else, if anything, the center could be  doing to better enhance the national biosurveillance capability. Given the  challenges described by NBIC\u2019s federal partners, we identified options for  policy or structural changes. Although these options are not exhaustive,  they represent a range of potential actions that could be taken to better  fulfill the biosurveillance integration mission described in the 9/11  Commission Act.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to September 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As defined  in the NBIC Strategic Plan, biosurveillance integration is combining  biosurveillance information from different sources and domains (e.g.,  human, animal, and plant health; food and environmental safety and  security; and homeland security) to provide partners and stakeholders  with a synthesized view of the information, and what it could mean. The  goal is to create new meaning\u2014that is, to provide insights that cannot be  gleaned in isolation, leading to earlier warning of emerging events and  shared situational awareness.", "Example of a biological event monitored  by the National Biosurveillance Integration  Center:   Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (MERS-CoV)  Since first recognized in September 2012 in  Saudi Arabia, MERS-CoV has been detected  in nearly 30 countries, including the United  States.

According  to the NBIC Strategic Plan, shared situational awareness across the  biosurveillance community is achieved cooperatively by entities that  integrate mission essential, overlapping portions of their individual  situational awareness for a unified purpose, leading to a common picture  or understanding of potential and ongoing biological events. Further, the  plan notes that shared situational awareness of the broader biological  domain may provide insights that cannot be gleaned in isolation, and thus  enhance the likelihood of identifying an event earlier and with more  certainty.", "The importance of biosurveillance integration has also been described by  key national planning documents. In July 2012, the White House issued  the National Strategy for Biosurveillance, which describes the U.S.  government\u2019s approach to strengthening biosurveillance. Although the  strategy does not specifically identify roles for NBIC, it does emphasize  the need for integration across disparate information sources, including  data derived from intelligence, law enforcement, environmental, plant,  animal, and other relevant areas. In June 2013, the White House\u2019s Office  of Science and Technology Policy issued the S&T Roadmap. Building  upon the National Strategy for Biosurveillance, the Roadmap identifies  biosurveillance capability needs and key research and development  priorities, including those related to integration.

For example,  officials from a support biosurveillance agency reported that because the  agency did not have the capacity to review all of the relevant  biosurveillance information that it collected, NBIC\u2019s products filled a  critical information gap in its intelligence. Some NBIS partners suggested  that NBIC\u2019s reports might be useful for state and local entities that might  not have access to the same breadth of information or the capacity to  integrate biosurveillance information themselves.", "Further, as illustrated by figure 4, 5 of the 8 biosurveillance support  agencies and information consumers stated that NBIC\u2019s products and  activities help their agencies understand the nature and scope of  emerging biological events (i.e., comprehension) to a great or moderate  extent. Officials from these agencies generally stated that NBIC\u2019s  products were easy to understand and provided useful context for events  outside their scope of expertise. For example, officials from a support  biosurveillance agency praised one of NBIC\u2019s Biosurveillance Event  Reports on the recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza,  which included information from CDC, APHIS, and USDA\u2019s Food Safety  and Inspection Service (FSIS) on how the disease will affect the food  chain, if it could cross to the human population, and what information is  known locally.", "Regardless of their role in biosurveillance, partners noted that NBIC\u2019s  products and activities do not generally contribute new meaning or  analysis\u2014that is, insights that cannot be gleaned in isolation. For  example, as shown in figure 5, 10 NBIS partners stated that NBIC\u2019s  products and activities enhance their agencies\u2019 ability to carry out their  biosurveillance roles and responsibilities to little or no extent, 4 responded  to a moderate extent, and 5 responded that they did not have a basis to  judge. Generally, partners that responded to little or no extent noted that  NBIC products and activities do not, for example, identify trends and  patterns or describe potential impacts of a biological event. For example,  officials from a primary biosurveillance agency stated that NBIC\u2019s  products and activities do not \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between dissimilar  information, provide novel synthesis of information, or recommend  possible courses of action.", "Further, as shown in figure 6, 11 of the 19 NBIS partners stated that  NBIC\u2019s products and activities help their agencies understand how  emerging and ongoing biological events are likely to progress into the  near future (i.e., projection) to little or no extent. Officials noted that  forecasting and projection are inherently difficult, but suggested that NBIC  could develop other kinds of analysis that would be useful for the  projection element of situational awareness. For example, officials from a  primary biosurveillance agency suggested that NBIC could integrate more  data and information from other DHS components into its reports, which  would help to provide a homeland security perspective on biological  events. Officials from another agency stated that NBIC could combine  information across multiple domains on a local disease outbreak with  known travel and weather patterns to predict how a disease might spread.", "NBIC officials stated that the center is working to improve its products and  its ability to contextualize the information it collects from open sources,  and has sought partner input to do so. For example, beginning in late  June 2015, partly on the basis of feedback the center received from its  November 2014 Federal Stakeholder Survey, NBIC modified its daily  Monitoring List to include an up-front summary that identifies the status of  ongoing biological events as worsening, improving, unchanged, or  undetermined. During our interviews with the NBIS partners, several  agency officials suggested that the center make a similar change to this  product because it would help them to more quickly scan the report to  determine which events might be worth further examination. Although we  are not able to analyze the effect this change had on partner views  because the change took place after our interviews, it appears to be a  positive step in response to one issue that partners raised. Further, NBIC  officials noted that the center is also working to better integrate forecasts  and projections into its products and activities. Specifically, NBIC is  participating in a working group led by the Office of Science and  Technology Policy to support the priorities articulated in the S&T  Roadmap by developing a common interagency vision for specific federal  capabilities and practical next steps leading to the application of reliable  infectious disease forecasting models in decision-making processes.", "Data that NBIC could use to identify and characterize a biological event of  national concern using statistical and analytical tools, as called for in the  9/11 Commission Act, are limited. Apart from searches of global news  reports and other publically available reports generated by NBIS partners,  NBIC has been unable to secure streams of raw data from multiple  domains across the biosurveillance enterprise that would lend themselves  to near-time quantitative analysis that could reveal unusual patterns and  trends. NBIC acknowledged in its strategic plan that the data required to  carry out its mission as envisioned in the 9/11 Commission Act either do  not exist or are subject to a variety of information sharing challenges that  make a large information technology-centered solution less feasible than  originally imagined.", "NBIC and NBIS partners noted that there were several kinds of data that  could be useful for this kind of biosurveillance integration, but these data  may not exist or may not be in a usable form. For example, EPA officials  stated that under the existing statutory framework, the federal  government does not collect real-time data on water quality and  contamination from drinking water utilities. Instead, water systems report  violations of drinking water standards to EPA on a quarterly basis. In  addition, officials from CBP and DOI\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  reported that there is a significant gap in the availability of animal health  data, particularly data on wildlife disease, which makes it difficult to fully  understand the dynamics of zoonotic diseases. NBIC officials also noted  that other kinds of data are maintained in formats that make them difficult  to analyze, such as paper health records. Further, the S&T Roadmap  noted that many livestock health records are held by private industry and  are not broadly accessible or standardized in a manner that would make  such data usable.", "In our survey, few\u20145 of 19\u2014NBIS partners reported that they shared raw  data with NBIC, and during structured interviews NBIS partners discussed  a variety of challenges they faced in sharing certain data with NBIC.  Some agencies are reluctant to share their data with NBIC because they  are unsure how the information will be used. For example, officials from a  primary biosurveillance agency stated that the agency does not share  some data with NBIC because sharing such information too broadly might  have substantial implications on agricultural trade or public perception of  safety. Further, officials from another primary biosurveillance agency  noted that there is sometimes reticence to share information and data  with components of DHS because, given the department\u2019s roles in law  enforcement and national security, the information might be shared  outside of the health security community in a way that lacks appropriate  context and perspective.", "Other agencies stated that they are unable to share data for regulatory or  legal reasons, or because appropriately protecting the data would take  too long. For example, officials from HHS\u2019s Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) stated that their agency is unable to share some of its data on food  and drug contamination because this information is confidential  commercial information that FDA is restricted from sharing outside the  agency. According to CDC officials, their agency receives electronic data  from state, territorial, local, and tribal sources for a variety of programs  and purposes that are covered by data use agreements that do not allow  CDC to share the data outside the terms of those agreements and as  allowed or required by applicable federal laws, such as the Privacy Act of  1974 and the Freedom of Information Act. Pursuant to federal law and  the terms of these agreements, CDC may share aggregated information  as long as it protects an individual\u2019s privacy. However, according to CDC  officials, some of these data cannot be shared without extensive, time- consuming work to appropriately redact the data to ensure that individuals  may not be identified and that privacy is protected, which results in the  release of the data being postponed to the point that the data are no  longer actionable. Further, officials from VA noted that the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing  regulations also restrict their ability to share some data because it  requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal health  information, and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures  that may be made of such information without patient authorization.", "Concerns over data are a long-standing issue with NBIC and the federal  biosurveillance integration mission. We have previously reported that  scant availability of data throughout the federal government, a lack of  trust, and partners\u2019 concerns over sharing sensitive information with NBIC  were major barriers in NBIC\u2019s ability to obtain the data and other  information that it needed to support data integration. NBIC officials  recognize that these barriers inhibit the ability of their partners to share  some data with the center, but noted that they are trying to work with  some of their partners to address these issues. For example, NBIC is  currently developing a project with VA to determine how the center can  use VA\u2019s data for biosurveillance purposes while ensuring that sensitive  data are properly managed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NBIC Has Developed Procedures to Coordinate with Biosurveillance Partners, but Faces Limited Participation and Provision of Partner Personnel", "paragraphs": ["To fulfill its Coordinator role, NBIC has established procedures that occur  daily, weekly, and as emerging or significant biological event occur, but  the center faces challenges related to participation of NBIS partners in the  center\u2019s activities, the provision of partner personnel to NBIC, and  competing structures for convening NBIS partners."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NBIC\u2019s Coordinator Role Products and Activities", "paragraphs": ["in.", "Biweekly Calls: Until recently NBIC hosted a Weekly Reporting Call  to present and discuss the most significant biosurveillance events  from the previous week.

For example, as shown in figure 7, about half  of the NBIS partners reported in our survey that they regularly  participated in NBIC\u2019s Weekly Reporting Calls (9 of 19) during the time  period between August 2012 and December 2014, and even fewer  reported regularly participating in the Daily Analyst Calls (2 of 19). Some  of the agencies that reported not regularly participating in the daily and  weekly calls are primary biosurveillance agencies that are generally  considered to be among the lead generators of biosurveillance  information in their respective domains. Officials from one of these  agencies noted that much of the information presented during the daily  and weekly calls was already provided in the daily Monitoring List e-mail,  and therefore provided relatively little new information.", "The National Strategy for Biosurveillance notes that in a reduced  resources environment, it is important to pursue activities that add value  for all participants, and officials across the NBIS noted that the  modification to the weekly call was a positive step. For example, officials  from a primary biosurveillance agency stated that the change provided  them with an opportunity to advertise the services their agency provides.  Officials from another primary biosurveillance agency noted that the new  presentation-focused format is more likely to benefit all partners across  the NBIS. NBIC officials stated that they plan to request feedback from  the partners in the future on the new format of these calls to determine  what, if any, additional changes are needed.", "Limited Provision of Partner Personnel  Another challenge faced by NBIC concerns its ability to obtain personnel  from its partners as originally envisioned in the 9/11 Commission Act.  NBIC officials told us that effective biosurveillance depends on subject  matter experts to interpret events and place them in context. Although all  of the NBIS partners provide key points of contact for NBIC, few (3 of 19)  partners currently provide a dedicated liaison as of July 2015. Officials  across the NBIS partners provided various reasons for why their agencies  did not provide a liaison. For example, officials from one primary  biosurveillance agency stated that for their agency, and likely other  agencies as well, it is difficult to provide personnel to NBIC on a full- or  part-time basis because of their own resource constraints. Further,  officials from a support biosurveillance agency noted that the lack of  clarity about NBIC\u2019s value to its partners is a barrier to providing the  center with detailees.", "In order to obtain more personnel from its partners, NBIC has agreed to  partially fund some of the liaisons. For example, according to NBIC  officials, the center already funds liaisons from VA, DOI, and USDA\u2019s  APHIS and is working to establish a liaison with CDC. .According to  NBIC, liaisons have provided great benefit to the center such as by  providing special knowledge of their agency\u2019s roles and areas of  responsibility and providing NBIC with the critical ability to reach-back into  their respective agency or department. According to the officials, NBIC  would like to more fully leverage the capabilities of its partners and obtain  a liaison from each NBIS partner; however, budget constraints currently  prohibit NBIC from obtaining fully funded liaisons from each partner.", "Competing Structures for Convening Partners  Federal partners noted that they were unclear about the differences  between two of the major structures used for convening federal  stakeholders to discuss emerging biological events. The NBIS Protocol,  as previously identified, is managed by NBIC, while the other, the  Biological Assessment Threat Response (BATR) Protocol, is managed by  the White House\u2019s National Security Council Staff. According to the NBIC  Strategic Plan, the BATR Protocol is a national-level interagency  consultation process with mid-to-high level decision makers that is  designed to achieve coordinated action and desired outcomes to prevent,  protect from, and respond to high-consequence bioterrorism and  biosecurity threats. According to NBIC, each of the protocols is  designed to serve a different purpose for a different set of participants  according to their respective roles in the recognition of, and response to,  a biological event. The NBIS Protocol is a mechanism to bring together  federal analysts and operators for information sharing early in a biological  event\u2019s discovery and development phase; whereas the BATR Protocol is  designed to enable the most senior level of federal leadership to achieve  situational awareness to effectively coordinate available resources for  incident response. However, although we did not ask a specific question  about the two protocols in our structured interviews, about a quarter of the  NBIS partners (5 of 19) we interviewed were unclear about the  differences between the two protocols.

According to NBIC, a  September 2014 prototype was capable  of real-time analysis of health data in a  geographic format, enabling users to  search data, for example, on clinical  symptoms and text within health records,  using data from Emergency Medical  Services, 911 phone calls, and Poison  Control Centers. According to NBIC, this  pilot program is intended to be offered to  state and local governments and the  private sector.   Social Media pilot projects: NBIC has  conducted several pilot projects to  examine the extent that social media can  augment existing biosurveillance  detection and analysis. The pilot projects  assessed the feasibility of using  commercial and government off-the-shelf  systems to aggregate social media  information for biosurveillance. The most  recent pilot, initiated in fiscal year 2012,  funds the Department of Defense\u2019s  Naval Surface Warfare Center to  develop analytical techniques to improve  the use of social media data for  biosurveillance. NBIC plans to conclude  the project at the end of fiscal year 2015,  and transition the project\u2019s algorithms for  operational use.", "The 2012 NBIC Strategic Plan also identified a number of pilot projects  designed to assess the extent to which such projects could be adopted  full-scale. According to the plan, each pilot project is intended to improve  collaboration or information sharing. According to NBIC, these pilots are  routinely assessed and evaluated to determine what is most helpful and  effective, and those that prove successful will be integrated into normal  operations, while those that are not will be discontinued. For example,  NBIC has jointly funded the National Collaborative for Bio-Preparedness  pilot project to develop a comprehensive, state-level system to analyze  public health trends and detect emerging biological incidents by using  data analytics and anomaly algorithms. Further, NBIC has also funded  three pilot projects examining the feasibility of using open-source data  from various social media applications in order to identify possible health  trends. NBIC has completed two of these pilots and one is ongoing.", "NBIC has been seeking new sources of data and information in order to  fulfill its mission for early warning and shared situational awareness of  acute biological events, including data and information from other DHS  components and NBIS partners, as well as classified information. First, in  September 2013, NBIC analyzed the usefulness of department-wide  absenteeism data from DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer,  which could be an indicator of an emerging epidemic. Based on an  analysis of 20 months of DHS workforce data from 2012 and 2013, the  study concluded that absenteeism data could be a useful component in  biosurveillance, as understanding differences between normal leave  behavior and expected rises in leave behavior during peak flu seasons  would help in establishing baseline values for comparison. In August  2014, NBIC, working with DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate and  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, evaluated the usefulness of  DHS components\u2019 data systems as potential biosurveillance data  sources. The assessment identified two Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) databases as the most useful to NBIC\u2019s mission, and in June 2014,  NBIC funded a part-time liaison to CBP\u2019s Office of Intelligence to  determine the extent to which NBIC can use CBP databases for  biosurveillance purposes. Second, NBIC has also sought to obtain new  sources of data from NBIS partners and other stakeholders. For example,  as of July 2011, VA has provided NBIC a liaison to, among other  responsibilities, identify ways NBIC can use VA\u2019s patient healthcare  information to support its early detection and situational awareness  mission. Finally, according to NBIC officials, the center has enhanced its  process for analyzing intelligence information and reviews various  intelligence sources to supplement, corroborate, or provide additional  context to the biosurveillance items identified through other sources. For  example, an NBIC intelligence analyst reviews all source intelligence  information to identify potential topics of interest, such as indications of  novel infectious disease or terrorism, and if necessary, reaches back to  partners in the intelligence community for further information.", "NBIC officials noted that the center\u2019s recent focus is on building its  internal IT infrastructure, rather than pilot projects. For example, through  its current Biofeeds project with the Pacific Northwest National  Laboratory, NBIC is seeking to build a visual and text analytics capability  that to enable the center to more effectively and efficiently identify  relevant information in open source data. Officials also noted that NBIC is  partnering with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency on the  Biosurveillance Ecosystem project to build a collaborative analytic  workbench for the center.

From fiscal  year 2012 through 2015, NBIC\u2019s budget ranged from $10 million to $13  million annually. Officials from 2 primary biosurveillance agencies noted  that NBIC\u2019s budget limits its ability to enhance its existing technology  systems to invest in innovations such as disease event modeling. Further,  officials from 3 primary biosurveillance agencies more generally  expressed concerns regarding the imbalance between the size and  nature of NBIC\u2019s mission, including its role as an innovator, and the  resources that it had available to achieve it. NBIC officials stated they  have never requested a budget increase, because their larger DHS office,  the Office of Health Affairs, has experienced budget reductions, and an  increase for NBIC would require a decrease for another program.  However, NBIC officials noted that they would likely use any increase in  its budget to help develop more analytical tools for itself and its partners.", "Related to its limited resources, NBIC also faces challenges prioritizing its  innovation efforts because its partners have diverse, and sometimes  conflicting, needs. The S&T Roadmap noted that active collaboration for  biosurveillance presents challenges because stakeholders have varying  missions and roles. As previously noted, NBIC asked its partners to  identify existing capability gaps. The 13 submissions covered a wide  variety of biosurveillance issues and domains, such as wildlife disease  surveillance, integration of pharmacy data, and analysis of Medicare  claims data. However, although NBIC asked partners to prioritize the 13  submissions identified as existing capability gaps, the proposal that was  selected had been ranked third by the partners, and officials from a  primary biosurveillance agency stated that it was unclear why the higher  ranking proposals were not selected. Further, officials from a primary  biosurveillance agency suggested that NBIC conduct its own needs  analysis to determine what tools and technology NBIC could invest in.  NBIC officials noted that the third ranked proposal was selected because  it was the highest ranked proposal that was \u201cshovel ready\u201d, thereby  allowing funding to be applied when funding was available, whereas the  top two proposals were not.

Among the specific reasons officials cited for the skepticism was their  uncertainty that the current model of biosurveillance integration was the  most effective investment for strengthening the national biosurveillance  capability. For example, officials from one agency noted that while the  concept makes sense intuitively, there is no reliable evidence, such as a  peer-reviewed study, that has confirmed the viability of the concept, nor  has there been a large-scale biological threat that has been detected  through integration; moreover, such a system\u2014by virtue of its being  federally-based\u2014would lack timely detection and response capabilities  because events occur at the local level. Officials from another agency  questioned the feasibility of NBIC\u2019s mission because the data and  technology that are currently available do not provide for the accurate  projection of biological events or facilitate the provision of early warning.  Additionally, an NBIC official told us that the ability to achieve early  detection of emerging events\u2014especially unexpected or novel events\u2014is  dubious because most of the tools and techniques used in surveillance  rely on contrasting current conditions with known baseline trends and  patterns, but as an event emerges, surveillance practitioners are not  necessarily going to be focused on those patterns and trends until  something prompts their attention.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey can introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors.

We conducted pretests with 3  agencies to help ensure that the questions were clear and unbiased, and  that the questionnaire did not place an undue burden on respondents. An  independent reviewer within GAO also reviewed a draft of the  questionnaire prior to its administration. We made appropriate revisions to  the content and format of the survey questionnaire based on the pretests  and independent review. The survey was administered on the Internet  from March 25, 2013, to May 15, 2013. To increase the response rate, we  followed up with emails and personal phone calls to the experts to  encourage participation in our survey. We received responses from all 19  agencies in our population (100 percent response rate). Based on  comments we received from two agencies, we also conducted two follow- up phone calls with officials at these agencies who responded to our  survey to verify their answers to survey questions about the federal  agencies from which their agency obtains information that contributes to  their agency\u2019s situational awareness of biological events. We made  appropriate changes to the responses recorded on these officials\u2019  questionnaires to reflect the clarifications made during these phone calls.

For the purposes of this report, we use the  definition of situational awareness that the NBIC Strategic Plan uses in  the articulation of its mission. The definition has its basis in the work of  Mica Endsley, who described situational awareness as having three  elements: (1) perception that a situation has occurred, (2) comprehension  of the situation\u2019s meaning, and (3) projection of the event\u2019s likely course  in the near future. We performed a network analysis of these survey  data, which is a quantitative and graphical technique for identifying the  underlying patterns in a complex system of relationships among entities  of interest. Figure 9 illustrates the agency sources from which the primary  and support biosurveillance agencies in our survey obtain data that  enhances their situational awareness of biological events. For example,  officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that  their agency obtains information that enhances all three elements of  situational awareness from seven agencies, including the Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service, Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, and National Biosurveillance Integration Center, among  others.
