The fluctuations were due to differences between receipts and disbursements, including the (1) receipt of collections from AWCF operations, (2) appropriations received in support of the wars, (3) disbursements made to pay for AWCF expenses, and (4) transfers made to fund other Army requirements. The Army transferred $4.8 billion out of AWCF from fiscal years 2004 through 2009. Most of the transfers funded requirements of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, or military personnel costs. These transfers helped to reduce the cash balance, but also resulted in the AWCF cash falling below the minimum cash requirement for a 6-month period in fiscal year 2006. GAO analysis of the AWCF fiscal year 2011 budget and cash plan showed that the projected monthly cash balances for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 would exceed DOD's minimum cash requirement for 22 out of 24 months. While the Army does not expect a cash shortfall due primarily to an increase in military build-up activities in Afghanistan, a cash shortfall may occur if certain Army actions are not implemented and monitored effectively. These actions include (1) reducing AWCF obligations to less than the amount of inventory sold, (2) collecting funds from Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for inventory items transferred from AWCF to DLA, and (3) reducing the amount of inventory at industrial operations activities.

AWCF supports  the combat readiness of Army units operating worldwide, especially in  Iraq and Afghanistan. AWCF generates revenue by billing customers at  predetermined, fixed prices as AWCF performs specifically agreed-upon  work for those customers. AWCF customers primarily use their  appropriated funds to pay for the work, and AWCF\u2019s income from the sale  of the goods and services is then used to fund continuing operations.

The Army industrial operations activity group provides the  Army with the in-house capability to conduct depot-level maintenance,  repair, and upgrade; produce quality munitions and large-caliber weapons;  and store, maintain, and demilitarize materiel (equipment and supplies) for  all branches of DOD. To perform its mission, the industrial operations  activity group employed 26,200 civilian personnel who, according to the  AWCF budget, performed approximately 31.1 million hours of direct labor  in fiscal year 2009. As figure 1 illustrates, the industrial operations  activities receive orders from customers to perform work. Customers  primarily use appropriated funds to finance orders placed with the  industrial operations activities. When industrial operations activities  accept customer orders, the customers\u2019 appropriations are obligated by  the amount of the orders. The industrial operations activities then incur  costs, such as materiel and labor costs as the work is performed, and  disburse funds to cover those costs. The industrial operation activities  then bill the customers for the work performed.", "The Supply Management Activity Group buys and manages spare and  repair parts for sale primarily to Army operating units located worldwide  and the Army industrial operations activity group. According to AWCF\u2019s  fiscal year 2011 budget, the supply group employed 3,000 civilian  personnel and managed 119,000 inventory items, received 1.1 million  requisitions from customers, and awarded 13,550 contracts in fiscal year  2009. As illustrated in figure 2, in anticipation of customer needs, supply  (1) buys new inventory items or (2) places orders with contractors and  DOD depot maintenance activities to repair existing inventory items. In  some cases, supply enters into contracts over a year in advance because of  the lead time required to obtain the inventory items. When supply receives  the items, it pays the vendors for those items. Customers primarily use  appropriated funds to finance the purchases of the inventory items from  supply. Supply provides the inventory items to the customers and bills the  customers for the items. Supply uses the payments from customers to  replenish the inventory sold to customers.", "A critical function for AWCF is cash management. Effective cash  management is largely dependent on Army managers receiving accurate  and timely data on AWCF cash balances, collections, disbursements, and  projections of anticipated activity. According to DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation, Volume 2B, chapter 9, AWCF is to maintain the  minimum cash balance necessary to meet both operational and  disbursement requirements in support of the capital asset program. AWCF  is to maintain a minimum cash balance sufficient to cover expenses, such  as paying (1) employees for repairing aircraft, weapon systems, and  equipment; and (2) vendors for inventory items. Currently, DOD\u2019s  regulation states that \u201ccash levels should be maintained at 7 to 10 days of  operational cost and cash adequate to meet six months of capital  disbursements.\u201d Thus, the minimum cash requirement consists of cash  that is sufficient to meet 6 months of capital requirements plus 7 days of  operational costs. The maximum cash requirement consists of 6 months of  capital requirements plus 10 days of operational costs. The regulation  further provides that a goal of AWCF is to minimize the use of advance  billing of customers to maintain cash solvency unless required to avoid  Antideficiency Act violations.", "Cash generated from the sale of goods and services is AWCF\u2019s primary  means of maintaining an adequate level of cash to sustain its operations.  The ability to generate cash consistent with DOD\u2019s regulation is dependent  on (1) accurately setting prices to recover the full costs of producing  goods and services; (2) accurately projecting workload, such as the  number of tanks, missiles, and helicopters to be repaired during the year;  and (3) meeting established operational goals. If projections of cash  disbursements and collections indicate that cash balances will drop below  prescribed levels, AWCF can generate cash by adding a surcharge to one  or more of its activity groups\u2019 sales prices. In addition, if the cash balance  becomes too low and there is a possibility of an Antideficiency Act  violation, AWCF can raise additional cash by advance billing customers for  work not yet performed. Conversely, if the cash balances are too high,  DOD or the Secretary of Defense, under specific statutory authority, or  Congress can transfer the unneeded funds to other appropriations to  either reduce budget requests or finance additional requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AWCF Monthly Cash Balance Fluctuated Significantly but Generally Remained above the Maximum Cash Requirement", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of AWCF cash data showed that the AWCF monthly cash  balance fluctuated significantly between fiscal years 2000 and 2009, but  that it has generally remained above the maximum cash requirement.

First,  Congress appropriated $468 million to AWCF to (1) increase the Supply  Management Activity Group\u2019s inventory, such as war reserve inventory;  and (2) pay for ordnance and the depot maintenance activity group\u2019s fixed  overhead costs for maintaining plant and equipment required by the Army  to meet mobilization and wartime surge capability.

The previous guidance  stated that \u201cinventory items classified as operating materials and supplies  held for use, shall not exceed the amount expected to be used within         30 days unless justifying documentation supporting a supply in excess of  30 days is developed and maintained for review.\u201d The revised guidance  requires that materials and supplies should not exceed the amount  expected to be used within normal business operations unless  documentation justifying an excess supply is developed and maintained  for review. However, the term normal business operations was not  defined.

The Army is  transferring management responsibility for about 26,000 different types of  consumable items (known as national stock numbers), and it plans to  complete the transfers by August 2010. The Army estimates that DLA will  reimburse AWCF $383 million and $176 million in fiscal years 2010 and  2011, respectively, for the items transferred to DLA. These amounts are  included in the AWCF fiscal years 2010 and 2011 projected cash balances.", "When items are transferred from one activity to another, the gaining  activity generally receives a cash benefit and the losing activity incurs a  cash loss. Specifically, the AWCF Supply Management Activity Group  continues to pay for items on order at the time of the transfer even though  the items are delivered to and sold by DLA. Thus, the AWCF cash balance  decreases when the Army pays the suppliers for items delivered to DLA  and DLA\u2019s working capital fund cash balance increases when the items are  sold by DLA to its customers. To ensure cash neutrality, DLA is expected  to reimburse AWCF for the funds spent by AWCF for the inventory items  on order and purchased by AWCF at the time of the transfer. Army  headquarters officials informed us that the Army and DLA have formed a  team to determine (1) the quantities of each type of item to be transferred  from AWCF to DLA, and (2) the amount of the reimbursement. The team is  expected to complete its work by August 2010.", "Since the AWCF\u2019s projected monthly cash balances for fiscal years 2010  and 2011 are based on the reimbursement of the transferred items, it is  important that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) monitor this  effort, because the AWCF expects to receive the $383 million in September  2010, but the Army and DLA do not expect to complete their work on the  amount of reimbursement until August 2010. In the past, delays in  transfers have occurred when the military services and DLA were unable  to agree on the reimbursement amounts. Delays in transferring could  result in a lower cash balance by hundreds of millions of dollars in fiscal  year 2010 than the projected amount in the AWCF cash plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retaining Accumulated Operating Results Increases AWCF Cash Balance", "paragraphs": ["The DOD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 3, Chapter 19, dated  October 2008, states that the goal of working capital funds is to achieve  zero accumulated operating results over time. The stabilized prices that  customers are charged by working capital funds for goods and services are  set to achieve this result. Thus, the stabilized prices are adjusted annually  to either return gains or recoup losses. However, the Army did not return  $491 million in accumulated operating gains to its customers in fiscal years  2010 and 2011. According to the AWCF\u2019s fiscal year 2011 budget and Army  headquarters officials, the Army decided to retain the $491 million for  three reasons. First, if the Army returned the entire positive accumulated  operating results balance in one year, customer prices would decrease  significantly in that year and increase significantly in the following year.  Second, the Army reviewed the AWCF cash balance and projected cash  balance and determined that AWCF did not have sufficient cash to return  the entire accumulated gains to their customers. Third, AWCF retained  $491 million to partially offset prior-year cash transfers, as discussed  earlier in this report. The Army noted that it will evaluate its revised  accumulated operating results projections, cash position, and impact on  fiscal year 2012 rates in determining the amount of accumulated operating  results to retain in the next budget cycle."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While the trend of the AWCF cash balance has varied greatly over the last  10 years, the Army\u2019s ability to maintain the AWCF\u2019s cash balance above  the minimum cash requirement will largely depend on the actions the  Army takes now and in the future in relation to increases and decreases in  military build-up activities. While the Army does not expect a cash  shortfall in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 due primarily to an increase in  military build-up activities (sending more troops to Afghanistan), a cash  shortfall may occur if (1) the Supply Management Activity Group\u2019s sales  are significantly lower than the wartime assumptions, or (2) the Army\u2019s  management actions to improve the AWCF cash position are not  implemented and monitored effectively. Most notably, the Army reduced  its unit cost ratio at the AWCF supply management activities to less than  100 percent replacement. This action is expected to reduce inventory and  increase cash for AWCF in fiscal year 2010 and future years. In addition,  the Army is (1) collecting funds from DLA for consumable item transfers,  (2) retaining positive accumulated gains by not reducing its prices to  customers, and (3) reducing inventory by 38 percent at industrial  operations activities that should increase AWCF cash. Further, the  relevant DOD Financial Management Regulation lacks sufficient clarity to  determine the appropriate level of inventory to be held at industrial  operations activities. Continued monitoring of these actions and the  related impact on cash balances is needed as AWCF supports the  additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and the eventual drawdown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making four recommendations to the Secretary of Defense to       (1) improve the management of the AWCF\u2019s cash balances, and (2) clarify  the DOD Financial Management Regulation that contains guidance on  inventory levels to be maintained by the industrial operations activities.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to take the following actions:    Evaluate periodically the unit cost ratio (obligations to sales) and take  action to adjust the ratio as necessary, to support the war effort in Iraq  and Afghanistan and the eventual drawdown of troops.", "Take action if the industrial operations activities do not reduce their  inventory levels to the specified amount in the fiscal year 2011 budget.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller) to take the following actions:    Clarify the term normal business operations in the DOD Financial  Management Regulation as it pertains to the amount of inventory items  to be held for use by the industrial operations activities.", "Oversee Army and DLA efforts to reach agreement on the amount that  DLA will reimburse AWCF for the consumable items transferred to  DLA and ensure that DLA reimburses AWCF for the items transferred  in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report.
