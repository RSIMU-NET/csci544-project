In addition, CPAC is  authorized and has agreed to make broadcast feeds of oral  arguments available to other broadcast members of the Canadian  Parliamentary Press Gallery at a central node for news and public  affairs broadcasts only. The court and CPAC also provide archived  video recordings of oral arguments on their websites.", "Parties and individuals who are not members of the news media must  submit a request to the court to obtain permission to use oral  argument recordings. Requests are made using an electronic form on  the court\u2019s website, which requires information such as a description  of the video or webcast requested, how it will be used, and the  medium in which it will be used (e.g., Internet, video, film, DVD). If  approval is granted, the requester is required to sign an agreement  detailing the terms of use. Agreements may include provisions to, for  example, use footage in a context that presents the case and the  positions of the litigants in a fair and balanced way and does not harm  the reputation of the court or of the counsel or justices appearing in  the footage.", "The U.K. Supreme Court. The court records video of oral arguments  using its own equipment and, in October 2014, began streaming live  video of oral arguments on its website. In addition, Sky News, a U.K.  broadcasting organization, has streamed the court\u2019s live video of oral  arguments on its website since May 2011. According to the court\u2019s  Head of Communications, media organizations can access the court\u2019s  video feed in a nearby broadcast studio. He stated that the court\u2019s  recording of its own video allows it to control what is filmed and  interrupt or terminate coverage if necessary. The court also began  making archived video recordings of oral arguments available on its  website in May 2015. According to the court\u2019s press release, footage  is uploaded the next working day after an argument is heard and is  available until about a year after the date of the argument.", "The court has established rules for how videos of oral arguments can  be used by broadcasters. For example, the rules only allow use in  news, current affairs, and educational programs and prohibit use in  light entertainment, satirical, and other types of programs. In addition,  the rules state that any stills produced from the video must be used in  a way that has regard to the dignity of the court and its functions as a  working body. According to the Head of Communications, all of the  U.K.\u2019s main media broadcasting organizations have agreed to these  rules. He stated that the court enforces its policy to the best of its  ability with limited resources and that, to his knowledge, there have  not been any violations of the rules.", "See appendix VII for additional details about the video policies and  procedures, online video views, and policy implementation of these  foreign courts of last resort."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Cited Educational Benefits and Media Distortion, Among Others, as Potential Effects of Video or Audio Coverage in Appellate Courts, Including the U.S. Supreme Court", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Judges and Attorneys in Selected Appellate Courts Stated that Enhanced Access and Education Were Among Key Benefits of Video or Audio Coverage of Oral Arguments", "paragraphs": ["The judges and attorneys we interviewed in selected appellate courts who  have experience with video and audio coverage of oral arguments cited  several benefits of such coverage, including greater public access to the  courts and educating the public on the judicial system, among others.  Administrative officials in selected courts also provided additional  examples of these benefits.", "Public access. Fifteen of the 16 judges and all nine attorneys stated that  they believed that coverage has enhanced or could potentially enhance  the public\u2019s access to the courts, particularly as the public relies more  heavily on television as a principal source of information. For instance,  one attorney and one judge said that, in high-profile cases or those of  interest to the public, the public could be more informed about both the  process and the issues in the case through video coverage. Further, the  one attorney noted that providing greater access to the court through  video or audio coverage is valuable because, as more information about  court proceedings is available to the public, more people will understand  the courts and the judicial system. In addition, two judges with whom we  spoke said that a benefit of same-day audio coverage is that attorneys or  other interested persons do not have to physically go to the court to hear  an oral argument, but instead could access same-day audio recordings of  the argument on the court\u2019s website. Two attorneys who practice in the  same court voiced some of the same benefits, stating that they believed  that same-day audio coverage has provided more access to the court,  information about what happens in the court, and is useful for persons  who are not able to attend the oral argument. Moreover, another attorney  with whom we spoke stated that he believed video or audio coverage of  oral arguments increases the information available to the public and the  media, which could also result in a more complete and neutral  representation of oral arguments by the media.", "Administrative officials in selected courts also described instances in  which they believed that video or audio coverage of arguments in their  courts had enhanced public access. For example, according to a U.K.  Supreme Court official, one of the main reasons the court provides video  coverage of its proceedings is to ensure that the country\u2019s citizens are  able to watch the proceedings in their highest court and hear important  points related to principles in the development of common law. In  addition, an official in the High Court of Australia said that providing video  recordings of proceedings allows more of the public to view proceedings  because Australia is a large country and most of its population does not  reside in Canberra, where the court is located. Moreover, according to  officials from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, live  streaming oral arguments has increased public access to the court,  particularly in cases of high public interest. For example, in November  2014, the court heard arguments in a case regarding an incident in which  a high school student aimed a laser pointer at an incoming passenger jet  as it approached an airport near his home. Officials stated that the  courtroom was not able to accommodate the large number of students  from his high school who were interested in viewing oral arguments, but  students were able to watch the live-streamed video of arguments at the  school.", "Education. Fourteen of the 16 judges and seven of the nine attorneys  with whom we spoke cited public education on the judiciary as a benefit  or potential benefit of video or audio coverage of oral arguments. For  instance, one judge said that because the work of the courts can easily  be misunderstood and is not in the headlines as much as the work of  other branches of the government, video coverage is useful for providing  the public a window into how the courts think about the issues in a case.  Moreover, one attorney with whom we spoke stated that video coverage  of oral arguments is a useful learning tool because she can review her  arguments to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, this same  attorney said that video coverage is useful for junior attorneys to watch so  they can learn about how to conduct oral arguments and the legal issues  of the case. However, another attorney stated that coverage of oral  arguments may be more misleading than illuminating because, for those  watching to have an accurate view of the arguments, they would need to  understand the entire case and the judicial process. Additionally, ten of  the 16 judges stated that they believed that coverage of oral arguments,  which is only part of the decision making process, may not be helpful for  understanding the case in its entirety. For instance, one judge stated  that the public might attain a general understanding of the issues in a  case and what was of concern to the court, but may not have all the  information needed to fully understand a case after viewing arguments.  Another judge noted that the written briefs that parties submit to the court  are critical to understanding the case, and that oral arguments frequently  address narrow aspects of the case that the judges are concerned about.", "Court administrative officials with whom we spoke also provided  examples of instances in which video or audio coverage of oral  arguments in their courts has provided educational benefits. For example,  an official from the Florida Supreme Court stated that high-profile,  controversial cases can be misunderstood by the public and broadcasting  oral arguments in their entirety can help dispel misconceptions about the  case and how the court operates. For instance, this official stated that  broadcasting oral arguments in the 2000 presidential election cases that  were before the Florida Supreme Court helped educate the public about  the judicial system and noted that it was beneficial for the public to be  able to see the arguments and draw their own conclusions. In addition,  officials from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that  law schools have used live-streamed and archived oral arguments as a  learning tool for their students. A U.K. Supreme Court official also stated  that video coverage helps educate attorneys, law students, and others in  the legal profession who can watch the justices in action and see how  attorneys conduct arguments.", "Public confidence in the courts. Seven of the 16 judges and seven of  the nine attorneys with whom we spoke believed that coverage has  enhanced or could potentially enhance confidence in the courts. For  instance, 1 judge stated that if a good judicial system is in place, video or  audio coverage of arguments, which demonstrates how the system  works, would increase the public\u2019s understanding of and confidence in the  courts. Further, one attorney said that providing coverage of oral  arguments would show the public the work the courts conduct, as well as  the quality and quantity of the work the court puts into each case.  However, 7 judges with whom we spoke believed that coverage may not  enhance confidence. For instance, 4 judges noted that it would be hard to  identify the effect of coverage on the public\u2019s confidence in the courts. In  particular, 1 judge stated that it would depend greatly on what a person  already thinks of the court before seeing any video or audio coverage of  oral arguments, while 2 judges said that it would be hard to determine the  specific impact of coverage on public confidence.", "Judicial accountability. Eight of the 16 judges and five of the nine  attorneys with whom we spoke stated that coverage has increased or  could potentially increase judicial accountability, although 7 judges felt  that it did not affect accountability. For example, 1 judge stated that  video coverage is a form of accountability in that it demonstrates how  judges reason and think through cases, and helps explain the judicial  process and justify the court\u2019s results. Moreover, 1 judge said that he  believed that video or audio coverage would increase the accountability of  any public official whose work was covered, including judges, although he  noted that the public does not and should not have access to the judges\u2019  deliberative process. However, 4 U.S. courts of appeals judges explained  that judicial accountability is already very high, and if judges make  mistakes, they are documented in publicly issued opinions; therefore,  they did not believe that coverage would increase judicial accountability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Judges or Attorneys Said Video or Audio Coverage Affected Court Participants\u2019 Behavior, Privacy, or Security, but Many Had Concerns about the Media\u2019s Use of Such Coverage", "paragraphs": ["The judges and attorneys we interviewed in the selected appellate courts  raised some concerns with video or audio coverage of oral arguments,  including how the media might use such coverage, among others.", "Effect on court participants. Almost all judges and attorneys we  interviewed stated that they did not believe video or audio coverage had  affected court participants\u2019 behavior or did not believe that such coverage  would affect the behavior of court participants. For example, at least 12 of  the 16 judges and eight of the nine attorneys we interviewed said that  they personally were not affected by video or audio coverage and had not  observed judges or attorneys appearing to grandstand, talking in sound  bites, or being more attentive or courteous to others; judges altering their  methods of questioning; effects on court decorum; or other changes in  behavior. Three attorneys we interviewed explained that coverage did not  affect their behavior because, during oral arguments, they are so focused  on the arguments themselves that it is not possible to think about  anything else, including video coverage. Two judges stated that judges or  attorneys could grandstand and be more courteous, potentially because  their questioning might be misinterpreted as badgering attorneys.  However, one judge noted that he was not sure if this behavior would be  caused by audio coverage.", "Privacy and security. Fifteen of the 16 judges and all nine attorneys with  whom we spoke did not have concerns with the effect of coverage on  their own privacy and security, while 1 judge we interviewed expressed  concerns. Specifically, this judge recounted having personally  experienced security concerns in a particular case in which a video clip  during questioning by the judge was posted and disseminated on social  media. The judge received threats as a result of the video coverage. In  addition, 6 judges and four attorneys said that there was the potential for  coverage to affect the privacy and security of court participants even  though they had not experienced issues themselves.", "Media use of coverage. Some judges and most of the attorneys with  whom we spoke also raised some concerns with how the media might  use coverage of oral arguments. For instance, 5 of the 16 judges and  eight of the nine attorneys we interviewed stated that they believed that  video or audio coverage might potentially result in portions of the  proceeding being distorted by the media. However, 11 of the 16 judges  we interviewed stated that they did not believe that coverage might result  in such distortions. In addition, three attorneys noted that distortions  happen even without audio or video coverage. For instance, one attorney  stated that the media regularly distort proceedings, including some of her  own oral arguments, regardless of video or audio coverage. Another  attorney stated that, in her experience, proceedings have been  inaccurately covered by the media. For instance, the reporters listening to  an argument are often not lawyers and may not understand the oral  argument; as a result, members of the media may focus on a segment of  the case that they think is interesting and use that segment in their  reporting of the argument even if they have taken that segment out of  context. She noted that same-day audio coverage may help prevent  distortion because it allows reporters to review and confirm what actually  occurred before reporting on the case and allows the public to  independently listen to the entire oral argument.", "Four judges and four attorneys with whom we spoke stated that they  believe that coverage by the court itself\u2014such as the court recording oral  arguments using its own equipment\u2014versus coverage by the media,  might help or could potentially help mitigate these concerns, including  potential distortion of proceedings by the media. For example, one  attorney stated that if the court produces the coverage, then the court can  control it and release it as the court sees fit. He also noted that while the  media generally have an incentive to promote coverage to gain viewers,  the court does not have such an incentive. Further, 1 judge stated that  when the court shows coverage of the entire oral argument, people have  the opportunity to make their own judgements about what they see, while  the media may insert their own views. Moreover, 12 of the 16 judges and  five of seven attorneys with whom we spoke stated that the media  showing edited segments of oral arguments is not sufficient to provide a  complete or accurate understanding of court proceedings. For example,  one attorney stated that the public may misunderstand the proceeding if  the media show edited segments and do not provide proper context for  the case.", "In addition, 1 judge stated that a local channel broadcasts the court\u2019s oral  arguments in their entirety, which is preferable to the media showing  edited snippets. He noted that television networks rarely have the air time  to broadcast an entire oral argument and will not do so unless it is for a  landmark case. A representative from one media organization explained  that some media outlets selectively cover oral arguments, which may  appear to some as distortions, because they must report on the case in a  short news segment during their broadcast. He stated that, while his  organization generally broadcasts oral arguments in their entirety, other  media outlets have such time constraints and cannot do so. A small  number of studies have also addressed the effects of video coverage on  appellate courts.

Twelve of the 16 judges and eight of the  nine attorneys we interviewed in selected appellate courts said that they  believed that the potential benefits, concerns, and effects might apply to  the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, 3 of the 16 judges and two of the  nine attorneys we interviewed identified benefits to the public of video or  same-day audio coverage, such as providing the public with access to the  Court\u2019s proceedings, or enhancing the public\u2019s perception or  understanding of the Court\u2019s proceedings. One judge noted, however,  that video coverage of oral arguments could distort the public\u2019s perception  of what the Court does, as the coverage would likely focus on a small  number of high-profile cases and little attention would be given to the  other cases the Court hears.", "In addition, 7 of the judges and two of the attorneys noted that, given the  greater media or public interest in the U.S. Supreme Court and the higher  profile or sensitivity of the cases it hears, the potential concerns and  effects may be magnified. For instance, 3 judges and three attorneys felt  that coverage could affect the behavior of court participants, such as  justices adjusting their lines of questioning or attorneys grandstanding.  Further, 5 judges and one attorney said that privacy and security  concerns associated with coverage of oral arguments at the U.S.  Supreme Court would be greater than at the appellate level because of  the increased interest and profile of the Court and its cases. One judge  explained that, because U.S. Supreme Court cases are so often high- profile, the Justices could face threats against them after every argument,  compared to a small number of such instances at the appellate court  level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Perspectives of the U.S. Supreme Court and Attorneys Who Have Argued Before the Court", "paragraphs": ["We also requested perspectives on the potential benefits of and concerns  with video coverage of oral arguments from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s  Public Information Officer, as well as four attorneys who have argued  before the Court. Three of these four attorneys believed that the Court  should allow additional access to coverage of its oral arguments. Of these  three attorneys, two stated that the Court should allow video coverage  and one stated that allowing more same-day audio access to oral  arguments would be a good starting point. The fourth attorney stated that  he would support additional access to coverage if the Court allowed it but  that the Justices are in the best position to determine whether such  access should be allowed.", "All four attorneys stated that there would be potential benefits to allowing  video coverage of U.S. Supreme Court proceedings. Specifically, all of  them stated that they believed allowing video coverage of U.S. Supreme  Court oral arguments would enhance access to the Court. For example,  one attorney said that the courtroom has a limited number of seats  available and it can be costly to travel to the Court. He noted that allowing  video coverage would be more equitable because all members of the  public could view coverage on the television or the Internet. Another  attorney stated that there is a substantial difference between access to  transcripts of oral arguments, which the Court provides, and viewing oral  arguments. He noted that individuals are more likely to be interested in  viewing arguments. In addition, all four attorneys stated that they believed  allowing video coverage would help educate either the public about the  judicial system or law students and professionals on how to conduct  arguments. For instance, one attorney stated that video coverage would  allow individuals to see the judicial branch operating at the highest level  and help increase understanding of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s work.  Further, three of the four attorneys believed that allowing video coverage  would increase the public\u2019s confidence in the Court. For example, one  attorney stated that such coverage would allow the public to see the rigor  and seriousness with which the Court conducts its business. Another  attorney noted that it could help alleviate the potential public perception  that the Court is a partisan institution.", "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Public Information Officer (PIO) and the  attorneys with whom we spoke also raised potential concerns with video  coverage of oral arguments. According to the PIO, individual Justices  have commented on the need to ensure the fairness and efficiency of its  decision-making process. They have noted that televising U.S. Supreme  Court proceedings could adversely affect the dynamics of the oral  arguments, diminishing the frankness and extemporaneity of the  exchanges, and reducing their usefulness for both the counsel and  Justices. Three of the four attorneys also shared concerns related to  potential changes in the behavior of court participants, such as changes  to how attorneys prepare for oral arguments and the manner in which oral  arguments are conducted. For example, one attorney stated that allowing  video or live-audio coverage of the Court\u2019s oral arguments might change  the tenor of the argument, which currently focuses on the genuine search  for truth and is a very effective process. He noted that attorneys may feel  the need to choose their words more carefully during arguments because  of the potential for negative public reactions. In addition, three attorneys  stated that allowing video coverage might potentially result in  inexperienced attorneys playing to the public or grandstanding, but noted  that such behavior would be detrimental to their case.", "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s PIO and the attorneys we interviewed further  noted concerns related to the information and perceptions the public  could potentially get from viewing oral arguments. Specifically, the PIO  stated that Justices have observed that oral argument is a small part of  the advocacy process. According to the PIO, because oral argument  merely supplements the extensive and often technical written  submissions, it is generally indispensable to read the written briefs in  order to understand the oral arguments. She also noted that the  Justices have emphasized that the Court\u2019s written decisions stand as the  Court\u2019s most important and enduring work\u2014work that should not be  overshadowed by one piece of the decision-making process. All four  attorneys with whom we spoke stated that they believed viewing oral  arguments would not provide a complete understanding of a case, but  could still provide useful information. These four attorneys also stated that  there is the potential for the media to distort video coverage of oral  arguments to varying degrees. For example, one attorney stated that  there is the potential for statements to be taken out of context or  misrepresented but the benefits of coverage outweigh the risks, and  another attorney stated that such distortion could be a significant  problem. This attorney noted that the Court providing coverage of  arguments in their entirety, as opposed to edited coverage by the media,  could help alleviate this concern. Finally, the PIO stated that, above all,  the Justices are trustees of an institution that has functioned well and  earned the public\u2019s confidence. The Justices have expressed caution  about introducing changes that could diminish the public\u2019s respect for and  create misconceptions about the Court.

What do selected stakeholders report are the benefits of and  concerns with allowing video and audio coverage of oral arguments in  appellate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court?", "To address the first question, we analyzed information on the U.S.  Supreme Court\u2019s policy regarding access to video and audio of oral  arguments that we obtained from Court documents, the Court\u2019s website,  and its Public Information Officer, including the process by which the  Court decides whether to grant media requests to release audio  recordings of oral arguments on the same day of the arguments. We also  analyzed data from the Public Information Officer on the cases for which  the Court received requests for same-day audio recordings of oral  arguments and whether the requests were granted or declined from the  Court\u2019s 2000 term\u2014the term in which same-day audio was first made  available\u2014through the Court\u2019s 2014 term.

This assessment included comparing these data with other  available sources and obtaining information from the Court about the  accuracy and completeness of these data.", "We also analyzed information about policies regarding access to video  and audio of oral arguments from selected appellate courts. We focused  on appellate courts because these courts conduct oral arguments and, as  such, their proceedings and participants are most similar to those of the  U.S. Supreme Court. The selected appellate courts included the U.S.  courts of appeals for the 13 federal circuits and courts of last resort\u2014the  highest appellate courts in a given jurisdiction\u2014in the 50 states and the  District of Columbia. These courts were chosen because their decisions  may be directly appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court under certain  circumstances and/or because they are generally the highest court in  their respective jurisdictions. We also included foreign courts of last  resort because they are the highest appellate courts in their respective  countries. We selected the High Court of Australia, Supreme Court of  Canada, and United Kingdom Supreme Court because their countries  have common law legal systems in which judicial decisions establish legal  precedents of law that are unwritten in statutes or codes, as does the  United States; populations of over 20 million; and English as an official  language and the language predominantly spoken. We identified and  compiled rules, court and administrative orders, guidelines, and other  documentation of video and audio policies of the courts we selected by  searching court websites and lexis.com and reviewing literature that  discussed the video and audio policies of the courts. We also contacted  administrative officials in these courts to confirm that the written policies  we identified were complete and current and to obtain information on and  documentation of policies not available online. We compiled the  information on state courts of last resort from January through May 2015,  and confirmed that our analysis of the policies was accurate, complete,  and current as of January 2016 for 42 states and the District of Columbia  and June through August 2015 for the 9 remaining states.", "In addition, we conducted interviews in person and on the phone or had  written correspondence with court administrative officials in 8 selected  U.S. courts of appeals, state courts of last resort, and foreign courts of  last resort to obtain information on the implementation of video and audio  policies in the courts, such as resource requirements or challenges. We  selected U.S. courts of appeals to reflect a range of video and audio  policies. As such, we visited the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Second  and the Ninth Circuits because they are the two U.S. courts of appeals  that currently allow media video coverage of oral arguments, and the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit because it is one of the U.S. courts  of appeals that does not allow video coverage of oral arguments. We  selected state courts of last resort based on their (1) range of video and  audio policies, including limitations on coverage such as whether certain  types of cases are excluded from coverage and whether consent of  parties is required; (2) having relatively high caseloads to increase the  likelihood of cases with media interest and coverage; (3) extent of  experience in allowing video or audio coverage; and (4) proximity to  selected U.S. courts of appeals. Using these criteria, we visited state  courts of last resort in Florida and California. We also contacted courts of  last resort in 3 other states that require the consent of parties before  coverage is allowed or do not allow video coverage of oral arguments to  arrange interviews, but officials in these states either did not respond to  our requests or declined to meet with us.

However, the site visits and interviews  provided us with valuable information about court officials\u2019 experiences  with and perspectives on a variety of policies regarding access to video  and audio of oral arguments. In addition, where available, we obtained  data from these courts on the number of cases for which media video or  audio coverage has been requested or granted and the number of views  video or audio recordings of oral arguments that are posted online have  received.

According to one of two researchers we interviewed who have conducted  work in this area, more studies have been conducted in trial courts, rather  than appellate courts, because of a greater interest in the potential effects  on victims, witnesses, and jurors\u2014stakeholders who are not involved in  appellate court proceedings. Both of these researchers also stated that,  in general, there is insufficient empirical or experimental research on the  effects of coverage in courts. They said that conducting a rigorous study  on the effects of coverage in court proceedings requires funding and time  from both researchers and stakeholders involved, such as judges,  attorneys, and court personnel.", "Neither of the two studies we identified used an experimental or quasi- experimental methodology. Instead, they reported findings on the  perceived effects of video coverage in appellate courts and relied on data  from surveys and interviews with stakeholders, which provided useful  information on stakeholder experiences with video coverage. Table 4  describes these studies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: U.S. Supreme Court Cases in Which Media Organizations Requested Same-Day Audio of Oral Arguments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "October Term Date Argued 2000 12/1/00", "paragraphs": ["Case  Bush v.

Courts of last resort in 42 states and  the District of Columbia confirmed their policies as of January 2016 and those in the 9 remaining  states were confirmed as of June through August 2015. The states with asterisks were confirmed as  of January 2016.  This category does not include policies that prohibit media video or audio coverage of oral  arguments that are not conducted in open court, such as arguments for cases that are closed to the  public, sealed, or confidential under law.  The D.C. Court of Appeals has no written policies on media video or audio coverage of oral  arguments, and according to the court\u2019s Clerk, does not allow such media coverage.  The Florida Supreme Court partners with WFSU-Television, a public broadcasting station, to provide  video coverage of oral arguments. Freestanding video cameras are not permitted in the courtroom  during arguments.  Although oral arguments in the Supreme Court of Illinois are not generally streamed live, video of  arguments for four cases in the court were streamed live on another website in November 2015.  Louisiana Canon 3 states that a judge should prohibit broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking  photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto at least during sessions of  court or recesses between sessions except as provided by guidelines on media coverage. The  guidelines for extended media coverage in appellate courts require media organizations to notify the  court clerk of their intention to provide such coverage at least 20 days in advance of the proceedings  and allow the chief justice to prohibit or limit coverage of Louisiana Supreme Court proceedings,  among other provisions. According to the Deputy Judicial Administrator of the Louisiana Supreme  Court, there is a presumption that coverage is not allowed, although exceptions may be made for  cases with high public interest.  Mississippi Rules for Electronic and Photographic Coverage of Judicial Proceedings prohibit media  coverage of certain matters, such as those involving divorce, neglect of minors, domestic abuse, and  trade secrets, but the presiding justice can allow coverage by order.  Missouri Court Operating Rules prohibit media video and audio coverage of juvenile, adoption,  domestic relations, and child custody hearings. The Communications Counsel of the Supreme Court  of Missouri stated that this limitation does not apply to the supreme court, although the court reserves  the right to make a case-by-case determination about whether such coverage would be allowed.  Supreme Court Guidelines for Still and Television Camera and Audio Coverage of Proceedings in  the Courts of New Jersey state that coverage is prohibited in certain proceedings, such as juvenile  proceedings and those involving trade secrets, child abuse or neglect, and charges of sexual contact  when the victim is alive. The Director of Communications and Community Relations for the New  Jersey Courts stated that this limitation does not apply to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.  North Carolina court rules state that media video and audio coverage is prohibited in certain judicial  proceedings, such as juvenile and child custody proceedings and proceedings involving trade  secrets. The Clerk of the Supreme Court of North Carolina stated that this limitation does not apply to  the supreme court.  Oklahoma\u2019s two courts of last resort\u2014the Supreme Court, which determines all issues of a civil  nature, and the Court of Criminal Appeals, which decides all criminal matters\u2014do not have written  policies on media video and audio coverage. The office of the Chief Justice of the Oklahoma  Supreme Court noted that the supreme court has left it up to each presiding judge to determine  whether to allow coverage. According to the Chief Justice, the supreme court has allowed video  coverage of oral arguments on a few occasions and is in the process of developing a written policy for  such coverage.
