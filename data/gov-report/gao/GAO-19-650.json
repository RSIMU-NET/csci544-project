As of April 2019, 70 percent of the U.S. population lived less than 5 miles from permanent collection sites, which are often located at pharmacies. If collection sites, take-back events, or mail-back programs are not feasible, FDA recommends quickly and permanently removing the most dangerous prescription opioids, such as hydrocodone and fentanyl, from the home by flushing them down the toilet. For all other prescription opioids, the agencies recommend disposal in the trash after mixing them with unpalatable substances, such as cat litter. Commercial products to facilitate in-home disposal also exist, and FDA is aware that patients may opt to use these products for disposal in the trash.", "Available studies suggest that many patients are unaware of federally recommended disposal methods or choose not to dispose of unused prescription opioids. For example, five studies found that between one-quarter and three-quarters of patients stored unused opioids for future use or had misplaced their unused opioids. Further, federal data indicate that 85 percent of intentional misuse occurs with the patient's knowledge\u2014for example, when a patient sells or gives away unused prescription opioids. To educate and motivate patients to dispose of unused opioids, FDA launched a public awareness campaign called \u201cRemove the Risk\u201d in April 2019.

Health care providers prescribe opioids to  treat chronic pain and after an acute medical event, such as a surgery, to  help patients manage pain while they heal. Because patients may not  take all of the opioids that their providers prescribe, many possess excess  opioids that could be misused by the patient or someone else. This  misuse contributes to opioid abuse and can lead to overdoses.  Overdoses involving prescription opioids\u2014hereafter referred to as  opioids\u2014were five times higher in 2017 than in 1999, accounting for  about 17,000 deaths in 2017.", "Federal, state and local government agencies, drug manufacturers,  communities, and others have attempted to address the potential for  misuse and abuse by identifying or providing safe, secure, and  convenient methods for disposing of unused, unneeded, or expired  opioids.

We analyzed data from DEA as of April 2019  indicating the locations of permanent drug take-back collection sites in  conjunction with data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s population  estimates through 2017. We used these data to estimate the percentage  of the U.S. population living within varying distances of a permanent  collection site. For all data used in these analyses, we reviewed related  documentation and conducted electronic testing and, based on these  steps, determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  To describe other disposal methods, we reviewed documents and studies  from vendors of three commercial in-home disposal products that patients  can use to help them dispose of prescription and nonprescription  medication in their home trash. We identified these products and  documents through stakeholder interviews, a related study, a patent  search using Google Patents, and a review of product websites.  Additionally, we conducted interviews with other stakeholders\u2014including  researchers, a representative from the AmerisourceBergen Foundation,  and representatives from three companies that manufacture in-home drug  disposal products. We asked these stakeholders about the effectiveness  of these other disposal methods at preventing misuse of opioids.", "To describe what is known about which methods patients use to dispose  of unused opioids, we conducted interviews with stakeholders, such as  the Association for Accessible Medicines and the American Medical  Association (AMA), and reviewed results of SAMHSA\u2019s 2017 National  Survey on Drug Use and Health. We also conducted a literature review.  Specifically, we performed a structured search of research databases\u2014 such as Scopus, ProQuest, ProQuest Dialog, and Harvard Think Tank\u2014 to identify literature published from January 1, 2009 through February  2019.

We selected 25 studies  based on the following criteria: if the study was published after January 1,  2014 and (1) presented findings that assessed the effectiveness of  certain methods for disposing of opioids and other medications, (2)  documented the quantity of unused opioids in the community, (3)  examined how patients disposed of unused opioids, or (4) evaluated  patient attitudes toward opioid disposal. The findings from each  individual study are limited by the studies\u2019 overall lack of national  representation and small patient populations; however, taken together,  we found that the methods and conclusions were sufficient for our  purposes.

A study that surveyed U.S. adults who had received opioids  found that approximately 60 percent of patients who were no longer using  the medication had unused opioids. Two studies reported that over one- half of patients did not use all of the opioids prescribed to them after  surgery; these studies found that patients reported leaving 15 to 20 pills  unused, representing 54 percent to 72 percent of the opioids they were  prescribed.

DEA hosts semi- annual events called National Prescription Drug Take-Back Days, where  temporary collection sites are set up in locations such as police stations.  Advertisements encourage community participation in the events and  educate the community on safe disposal of unused medications, including  opioids. DEA also registers collectors and provides information to the  public about the location of permanent collection sites for take-back, such  as at local retail pharmacies or hospital pharmacies, and sets  requirements for the provision of postage-paid envelopes that patients  can use to mail unused drugs to a collector for destruction.", "DEA regulations establish a standard for the destruction of controlled  substances that applies to DEA registrants, which can destroy opioids on  patients\u2019 behalf. DEA registrants include pharmaceutical companies that  manufacture controlled substances, health care providers who prescribe  them, and pharmacies that dispense them. The standard for destruction  requires that controlled substances maintained or collected by DEA  registrants be rendered non-retrievable. This means that the physical and  chemical conditions of the controlled substance must be permanently  altered, thereby rendering the controlled substance unavailable and  unusable for all practical purposes. According to DEA, as of May 2019,  the only method currently used to meet this standard is incineration, and  DEA rulemaking states that DEA will not evaluate, review, or approve  methods used to render a controlled substance non-retrievable.", "FDA has broad authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  to evaluate whether a drug is safe and effective and ensure the benefits  of drugs outweigh the risks. FDA may require manufacturers to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for drugs with serious  safety risks, including the risk of abuse, to ensure that the benefits  outweigh the risks. Under one REMS, for example, manufacturers of  opioids intended for outpatient use must make training available to health  care providers involved in the treatment and monitoring of patients who  receive opioids. The training must contain certain elements, including how  providers should counsel patients and caregivers about the safe use and  disposal of these opioids, among other things.", "In October 2018, the SUPPORT Act authorized FDA to, at its discretion,  require specific packaging or disposal systems as a part of certain drugs\u2019  REMS. For drugs with a serious risk of overdose or abuse, FDA may  require the drug to be made available for dispensing to certain patients  with \u201csafe disposal packaging\u201d or a \u201csafe disposal system\u201d for purposes of  rendering the drug non-retrievable in accordance with DEA regulations.  Before imposing these requirements, FDA must consider the potential  burden on patient access to the drug and the health care delivery system.  As of May 2019, FDA had not imposed any REMS requirements using the  new SUPPORT Act authority.", "Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), EPA has  authority to regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage,  and disposal of hazardous waste, including certain discarded opioids.  However, hazardous waste pharmaceuticals generated by households  are not regulated as hazardous waste even if the waste would otherwise  be considered hazardous. Opioids and other household waste  pharmaceuticals collected through a take-back option are also exempt  from most hazardous waste regulations, provided certain conditions are  met. Some states and localities have imposed additional requirements  for pharmaceutical disposal, such as requirements for drug manufacturers  to manage or fund the disposal of collected household pharmaceuticals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Recommend Take- Back Options as the Preferred Disposal Method", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Recommend Take-Back Options Whenever Feasible, Followed by Disposal Using the Toilet or Trash", "paragraphs": ["According to DEA, FDA, and EPA, patients should use take-back options  to dispose of unused opioids, whenever feasible. Only if take-back  options are not feasible, FDA recommends flushing opioids on FDA\u2019s  flush list down the toilet to remove them from the home as soon as  possible. For opioids not on the flush list, the agencies recommend  placing the drugs in the household trash mixed with an unpalatable  substance. (See fig. 1). Officials from FDA said that the primary goal of  these recommendations is to remove dangerous substances from the  home as soon as possible to reduce accidental poisoning, which also  may address issues related to intentional misuse. FDA officials explained  that the agency has not measured the effects of its recommendations for  disposing of opioids on opioid misuse, as of May 2019, because it is  difficult to establish a causal link between the recommendations and any  reductions in misuse.", "DEA, FDA, and EPA recommend using a take-back option as the  preferred method for patients to dispose of unused prescription opioids.  Under this method, patients can bring unused opioids to DEA\u2019s semi- annual take-back events or to DEA-registered permanent collection sites,  or use mail-back to deliver opioids to a DEA-registered collector for  destruction. When patients use these take-back options, the drugs they  dispose of are ultimately incinerated, which is the only method that DEA  officials said is known to render the drugs non-retrievable, that is,  permanently and irreversibly destroyed.", "Our analysis of DEA and U.S. Census Bureau data shows that as of April  2019, 71 percent of the country\u2019s population lived less than 5 miles from a  permanent collection site, and in 42 states, at least half of the population  lived within 5 miles of a site. (See fig. 2). This number has increased  since our April 2017 report, when we found that about half of the country\u2019s  population lived less than 5 miles away from a site. Our analysis also  shows that 90 percent of the population lived within 15 miles of a site,  though in rural areas only 57 percent lived within 15 miles. In addition,  two studies found that patients were willing to bring unused opioids to a  take-back location as long as it was located within 5 to 8 miles of their  home address.", "If take-back options are not feasible, FDA recommends flushing the  opioids on its flush list down the toilet, because a single dose can be fatal  to a child or a pet. Flushing is a permanent way to remove opioids from  the home. FDA confirmed that as of June 2019, 11 of 14 drugs on the  flush list are opioids, which represents about three-quarters of the  approved opioid active ingredients intended for outpatient use (see  sidebar). Some portion of drugs that are flushed down the toilet ultimately  enter surface and wastewater streams. However, a 2017 FDA study on  the environmental impact of drugs listed on the flush list concluded that  flushing these opioids has negligible effects on the environment and  human health, particularly relative to the amount of opioids that are  excreted after taking them as prescribed, because not all of the drug is  metabolized. (See text box for a summary of the effects of disposal  options on the environment.)", "Environmental Effects of Disposal Options  The environmental impact of opioid disposal depends on the method used\u2014take-back  options, flushing, or trash. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and  Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials, disposal of drugs through take-back options  results in disposal by permitted incineration, which fully destroys the active form of the  drugs. EPA officials told us that flushing or placing opioids in the trash can introduce  active opioids into wastewater streams, groundwater, and surface waters.   Incineration of Drugs from Take-Back Options. Opioids disposed of using take-back  options are destroyed by incineration, which, according to DEA officials, is the only  method currently used to meet its non-retrievable standard for destruction. EPA officials  told us that based on data from DEA, the amount of household pharmaceutical waste  gathered and incinerated during DEA\u2019s semi-annual take-back events is small compared  to the total amount of waste one incinerator burns on an average day.  EPA officials  recommended take-back options as the preferred method of opioid disposal.  Flushing. Opioids enter the water supply when excreted by patients who take opioids as  prescribed and when patients intentionally flush unused opioids down the toilet. EPA  officials told us that most wastewater treatment facilities are not designed to eliminate  opioids from wastewater streams. Further, measureable concentrations of opioids have  been reported in surface and ground water sources around the world.  Trash. Disposal of unused opioids in the trash often introduces opioids into landfills.  Studies in scientific literature show that pharmaceutical ingredients have been observed  in the water that passes through landfills, called leachate. Similar to opioids that are  flushed, opioids in landfill leachate can end up in wastewater streams and other water  sources, according to EPA officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Household Trash", "paragraphs": ["If an opioid is not on the FDA flush list and a take-back option is not  feasible, the agencies direct patients to take a series of steps to dispose  of their opioids in household trash by:  (1)  mixing the drugs in an unpalatable substance such as dirt, cat  litter, or used coffee grounds,  (2)  placing the mixture in a sealed container or plastic bag, and  (3)  throwing the container in the trash.", "An EPA official said that mixing the drugs with an unpalatable substance  is meant to deter misusers from searching through the trash to retrieve  the drugs. Disposal of opioids in the trash\u2014either with an unpalatable  substance or in-home disposal product\u2014removes them from the home,  but this option may not be permanent and the drugs still may be available  for misuse.

FDA officials stated  that, as of May 2019, the agency had not evaluated the effectiveness of  these products or made any recommendations related to their use, but  they are aware that patients may opt to use these products. These  products, known as in-home disposal products, are proprietary  substances that patients can mix with their unused drugs, including  opioids, before disposing of them in the trash. In-home disposal product  vendors told us they sell or donate their products to pharmacies, local law  enforcement, and community groups, which then distribute them to  patients. A representative from a group that distributes these products,  the AmerisourceBergen Foundation, noted that in-home disposal  products may be a convenient option for patients for whom take-back  options are not feasible, and marketing materials from a product vendor  instruct patients to use their product if a take-back option is not available.  Vendors indicate that their products can prevent misuse of opioids by  rendering drugs non-retrievable at home and by motivating patients to  dispose of unused opioids. According to DEA officials, rendering opioids  non-retrievable by using an in-home disposal product is challenging,  because the drugs have a variety of chemical and physical properties and  potencies. Furthermore, according to DEA officials, a lethal dose of  fentanyl can be as low as 250 micrograms in adults\u2014and lower in  children\u2014underscoring the importance of effective disposal.", "Some vendors have presented evaluations of their commercial products.  A recent comprehensive review of eight in-home disposal products raised  concerns about the credibility of vendors\u2019 evaluations and concluded that  additional independent laboratory analysis is needed to fully examine  product performance and assess how well these products achieve stated  goals. Our review of evaluations from three vendors found that the  studies contained some inconsistencies and gaps in the evaluation  methods used, raising questions about the studies\u2019 conclusions that the  products are effective for disposing of opioids.", "In some cases, studies included detailed, but inconsistent, methods.  For example, in four studies about one product, the researchers  concluded that the product deactivated most of an opioid dissolved in  water. However, one of the earlier studies reported that whole pills did  not dissolve in water, which could impact the results, but later studies  did not include similar data.", "In other cases, companies\u2019 evaluations were summaries of results  that did not provide enough information to independently verify or  assess whether the products deactivate opioids and prevent misuse.  For example, one company\u2019s research documents presented images  of a mixture as evidence that the drugs had degraded, rather than  results of a test measuring if drugs were still detectable.", "In addition, the studies included little information about the products\u2019  effectiveness at treating mixtures of multiple drugs at the same time, a  scenario that stakeholders have referred to as \u201creal world\u201d use testing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Few Patients Use Federally Recommended Opioid Disposal Methods; FDA and Others Have Taken Steps to Educate the Public", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Few Patients Use Federally Recommended Methods to Dispose of Unused Opioids", "paragraphs": ["Disposal methods\u2014when patients use them promptly\u2014remove unused  opioids from the home and therefore can be effective at reducing opioid  misuse. FDA officials said that the federally recommended methods for  disposing unused opioids are intended to remove these substances from  the home as soon as possible, and stated that as long as individuals  dispose of opioids promptly rather than storing them, then FDA has  achieved its goal.", "However, the studies we reviewed suggest that most patients do not  dispose of unused opioids using a federally recommended method.  Specifically, three studies examined how patients disposed of unused  opioids and found that between 12 percent and 41 percent of patients  disposed of them using a federally recommended method. For example,  one of the studies found that of 570 survey respondents who had unused  opioids, 12 percent of respondents reported using a take-back option, 14  percent reported that they flushed them down the toilet, and 6 percent  reported that they threw them in the trash after mixing with an unpalatable  substance.", "Other studies we reviewed show that take-back options are often used to  dispose of drugs other than opioids. Two studies found that less than 10  percent of the catalogued drugs brought to DEA take-back days were  controlled substances, which included opioids, while another study  weighed drugs brought to take-back events and permanent collection  sites and reported less than 3 percent were controlled substances,  including opioids. The same study found that annually, controlled  substances disposed of at take-back events and permanent collection  sites accounted for about 0.3 percent of those dispensed in the area, and  concluded that take-back events may have a minimal impact on reducing  the availability of unused opioids for misuse.", "Studies indicate that patients who receive an in-home disposal product  may be more likely to dispose of unused opioids, but they may also be  less likely to use federally recommended options like take-back or  flushing. Two studies in our review found that patients who receive an in- home disposal product have reported that they are more likely to dispose  of unused opioids than those who did not receive the product. Use of in- home disposal products\u2014which may not be effective at permanently  destroying drugs\u2014may deter patients from using federally recommended  options, like take-back, that have been proven effective. For example,  one of these studies found that only one of the 70 patients who received  an in-home disposal product used a take-back option for disposal, despite  the study taking place in a state where we estimated that 77 percent of  the population lived less than 5 miles from a permanent collection site.", "Studies indicate that patients are often unaware of federally  recommended disposal options. Three of the 25 studies we reviewed  suggest that many patients were not aware of federally recommended  methods for disposing of opioids. For example, a study of cancer  patients who received opioid prescriptions reported that more than three- quarters of these patients were unaware of proper opioid disposal  methods. Another 2016 study of 1,032 patients found that nearly half of  the respondents did not recall receiving information on proper disposal  from pharmacists, medication packaging, or media outlets.", "Studies also indicate that patients choose not to dispose of unused  opioids, and that they knowingly participate in the majority of opioid  misuse. Five of the studies we reviewed found that between one-quarter  and three-quarters of patients stored unused opioids for future use or had  misplaced their unused opioids. For example, one of these studies  found that 49 percent of survey respondents kept or planned to keep  unused opioids for future use, and 14 percent were likely to let a family  member use their opioid medications in the future. Federal data about the sources of misused opioids indicate that patients are complicit with  most misuse. SAMHSA estimates that 5 percent of people nationwide  who misused opioids in 2017 took these drugs from someone else  without asking. In contrast, SAMHSA estimates that 85 percent of opioid  misuse occurs with the patient\u2019s knowledge or active participation, either  through the patient misusing his or her own prescription by taking the  drug for pain other than for which it was prescribed or by giving or selling  the prescribed opioids to another person.

Specifically, AMA representatives told us that the association has  compiled a two-page document for physicians containing information  about drug disposal, links to DEA information on nearby permanent  collection sites and take-back events, and FDA guidance on safe disposal  of medications. This document included recommendations for physicians  to talk to patients about safe use of prescription opioids, remind patients  to store their medications in a safe place out of reach from children, and  have a conversation with patients about the most appropriate ways to  dispose of expired, unwanted, or unused opioids.", "The AmerisourceBergen Foundation has also partnered with communities  to promote safe opioid disposal by providing education about take-back  options and commercial in-home disposal products to patients. A  representative from the Foundation explained that its Safe Disposal  Support Program provides non-profit organizations or municipalities with  commercial in-home disposal products, which then can be distributed free  of charge to other organizations, individuals, or households. It also  recommends that patients use take-back options when available. The  representative said that organizations are to demonstrate to patients how  these products work either through a brief in-person demonstration at an  event or through a video. According to the representative, these products  and demonstrations help people reflect on what is in their home and  needs to be disposed of, either using a product or a take-back option.", "Despite such efforts, little is known about the extent to which  stakeholders\u2019 efforts to educate the public are effective in increasing use  of federally recommended disposal methods. FDA officials said that they  are not aware of the extent to which providers are familiar with all  disposal methods or the extent to which providers discuss the importance  of proper disposal with patients. As part of FDA\u2019s REMS requirements for  outpatient opioids, manufacturers must make training available to health  care providers involved in the treatment and monitoring of patients who  receive opioids, which includes information about the need to  communicate with patients about disposal of unused drugs. FDA officials  said that opioid manufacturers must assess the effectiveness of their  REMS, including an assessment of prescribers\u2019, other health care  providers including pharmacists\u2019, and patients\u2019 understanding of the key  risk messages conveyed through the educational materials. FDA expects  to receive the next REMS assessment with the results of these analyses  in 2020.

For example, FDA officials said that  adding packaging configurations that contain smaller quantities of certain  opioids could help prescribers to more carefully consider the amount of  opioid pain medication they prescribe.  This in turn may reduce the  number of unused opioids available in the home that could be  inappropriately accessed by family members or visitors, and could  potentially reduce the risk for misuse and abuse. Representatives from  the AMA explained that it and other organizations are working to provide  opioid prescribing resources and guidance to help physicians effectively  manage patients\u2019 pain, which representatives said will reduce the number  of unused opioids available for misuse.
