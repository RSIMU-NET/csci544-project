NOAA first identifies areas in greatest need of surveying by analyzing data such as seafloor depth, shipping tonnage, and the time elapsed since the most recent survey. Second, the agency evaluates the availability of funding resources as well as the availability and capability of NOAA and private sector hydrographic survey vessels. Third, NOAA develops an annual hydrographic surveying plan that identifies survey priorities. To help inform the first step in this process, NOAA is developing a model to take advantage of new mapping technologies.", "NOAA prepares an annual report comparing the cost of collecting its own hydrographic survey data to the cost of procuring data from the private sector but does not include all costs in its cost comparisons. Under its standard operating procedure, NOAA is to report the full cost of the hydrographic survey program, including equipment, maintenance, and administrative costs. GAO's review of NOAA's cost comparison reports from fiscal years 2006 through 2016, however, found that NOAA did not in all instances report complete or accurate cost data. For example, NOAA did not include the acquisition of a $24 million vessel in 2012, and in some cases it did not report certain costs in the year to which those costs should be assigned. NOAA officials said they recognized the need to improve the agency's tracking of costs, and they identified actions they intend to take but did not always provide information about specific steps to carry out these actions or associated time frames. For example, NOAA officials said they planned to implement an improved process in fiscal year 2019 for tracking the costs of capital assets such as vessels but did not identify specific steps to do so. They also said they plan to develop a system to better track maintenance costs but did not provide specific details or a time frame to do this. Without ensuring that its efforts to improve its cost comparison reports include actions to fully track asset and maintenance costs, NOAA may be unable to prepare cost comparison reports that reflect the full cost of its survey program, as specified in the agency's standard operating procedure.", "NOAA has taken steps to increase private sector involvement in its hydrographic data collection program but has not developed a strategy for expanding such involvement as required by law. For example, NOAA moved to a centralized process for competing and awarding contracts, which NOAA officials said reduced administrative costs and contract award time and allowed NOAA to increase the number of private sector firms under contract from five to eight. However, NOAA did not develop a strategy for expanding its use of the private sector to minimize duplication and take maximum advantage of private sector capabilities, as required by law. NOAA officials said the agency intends to develop such a strategy but must first make improvements in its approach to comparing its own hydrographic survey costs to those of the private sector. However, NOAA officials did not provide specific information about how they intend to develop the strategy, what elements it will contain, or when it will be completed.

According to NOAA  documentation, nautical charts provide information critical to safe  navigation, such as symbols that inform ship captains or recreational  boaters if an area is shallow or has dangerous conditions that could  imperil navigation. Hydrography is the science that informs the surveying  methods for collecting the data used to create and update nautical charts.  In addition, information collected through hydrographic surveying  supports a variety of maritime functions such as port and harbor  maintenance, beach erosion and replenishment studies, management of  coastal areas, and offshore resource development.", "NOAA operates four ships that predominantly support hydrographic  surveys: the Fairweather, Ferdinand R.

In  addition, according to NOAA officials, NOAA works with other federal  agencies to collect hydrographic survey data. For example, the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers provides such data for the federal harbor waterways  that support the U.S. port system.", "NOAA primarily uses two kinds of sonar for hydrographic surveying\u2014 multibeam and side scan. Multibeam sonar measures the depth of the  water by analyzing the time it takes sound waves to travel from a vessel  to the bottom of the water body and back and provides detailed  information about the water body floor. Multibeam sonar is generally used  in areas such as the northeast United States and Alaska, where the water  body floor is complex and often strewn with rocks. See figure 2 for an  illustration of a NOAA ship using multibeam sonar.", "In contrast, in relatively shallow flat areas like those along the mid-Atlantic  coast, NOAA uses side scan sonar. Side scan sonar creates an image of  the water body floor but does not determine depths. If NOAA finds a  shipwreck or obstruction using side scan sonar, it will determine its depth  using multibeam sonar.

As a result of  this practice, NOAA\u2019s hydrographic survey costs may appear  artificially high during years in which NOAA incurs large equipment,  repair, and maintenance costs. NOAA officials said they recognize  that reporting equipment, repair, and maintenance costs in the year  they are incurred does not accurately represent agency costs.", "Cost and performance data for survey work conducted by the  private sector. NOAA does not track cost data in a way that allows  the agency to link the cost for private sector surveys to the amount of  survey work conducted. For example, in the cost comparison report  for fiscal year 2014, NOAA included funds that were obligated for two  contractors to conduct survey work, but the report showed that these  contractors did not survey any nautical miles during that year. NOAA  officials explained that they obligated funds in fiscal year 2014 to pay  for the contract survey work, but the contractors did not begin the  work until fiscal year 2015. These officials stated that they record  contractor costs in the year in which the obligation occurs, and they  record the miles surveyed in the year in which the surveying occurs.  However, the 2014 cost per square nautical mile may appear  artificially high because costs were recorded without including  corresponding mileage surveyed. In contrast, the 2015 cost per  square nautical mile may appear artificially low because survey miles  were recorded, but the costs for conducting those surveys were not  included in the 2015 report. NOAA officials acknowledged that their  current method for tracking contractor costs and work performed  needs improvement. They explained that the data inaccuracies arise  in part from NOAA\u2019s current process for tracking contractor cost and  performance through manual entry of data into multiple spreadsheets.", "Furthermore, we found that NOAA uses a single measure\u2014cost per  square nautical mile surveyed\u2014to compare its own survey costs to those  of its contractors. However, in 2005, the Hydrographic Services Review  Panel concluded that a single cost measure, such as the cost per square  nautical mile, should not be used as the primary factor to determine the  relative cost-effectiveness of NOAA and private sector efforts to collect  hydrographic data. The panel recommended that NOAA consider a wider  variety of measures to help provide additional insight. NOAA officials  acknowledged that the cost per square nautical mile was not a  comprehensive measure of cost-effectiveness and that having additional  measures would improve the accuracy of cost comparisons to account for  factors such as region and water depth.", "As a result of the concerns we identified, during our review, NOAA  officials began identifying actions they would take to improve NOAA\u2019s  cost data. In some instances, officials identified specific steps and  associated time frames to carry out these actions. For example, NOAA  officials said they started using new project management software in  fiscal year 2017 to help track contract administration costs for inclusion in  future cost comparison reports. In addition, to allow NOAA to better link  the costs for private sector surveys to the amount of survey work  conducted, NOAA officials said they plan to develop a new database by  March 2018; this database would help eliminate the need for manual data  entry and allow NOAA to track survey cost and performance data for  various time frames and regions. To improve NOAA\u2019s ability to compare  its own survey costs to those of contractors, NOAA officials said they  were in the process of developing additional survey measures beyond  cost per square nautical mile that could include a new \u201csurvey complexity  rating\u201d designed to account for factors such as region and water depth.", "Officials said they expect to have these additional measures in place by  October 2018.", "However, NOAA officials could not yet identify the steps or associated  time frames for carrying out other actions to improve the completeness  and accuracy of cost data. For example, to help improve NOAA\u2019s process  for tracking depreciation costs of capital assets\u2014such as vessel  acquisition or equipment, repair, and maintenance\u2014NOAA officials said  they planned to implement an improved process in fiscal year 2019 but  did not identify the specific steps to implement this process. In addition, to  account for ships that are in port undergoing major maintenance, NOAA  officials said they plan to develop a tracking system to help ensure such  maintenance costs are included in NOAA\u2019s cost comparison reports, but  they did not provide additional specific details or identify when they intend  to implement such a system. For these recently identified actions, NOAA  officials explained that it was uncertain how NOAA would proceed  because identifying and implementing certain steps requires the  coordination of multiple offices within NOAA such as the Office of Coast  Survey, Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, and Office of the Chief  Administrative Officer. Without ensuring that its efforts to improve its cost  comparison reports include actions to fully track capital asset depreciation  costs and account for ships in port undergoing major maintenance, NOAA  may be unable to prepare cost comparison reports that reflect the full cost  of its hydrographic survey program, as called for in the agency\u2019s standard  operating procedure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Has Taken Steps to Increase Private Sector Involvement in Data Collection, but Has Not Developed a Strategy for Expanding Such Involvement as Required by Law", "paragraphs": ["NOAA has taken steps aimed at increasing private sector involvement in  its hydrographic data collection program, such as streamlining its  contracting process and increasing communication with contractors.

For example, NOAA developed a centralized process for competing and  awarding contracts in 2003, which NOAA officials said reduced  administrative costs and contract award time. Before this change, NOAA  awarded contracts to individual contractors at the regional level, which  required expending resources to process each individual contract. As a  result of implementing a centralized process for competing and awarding  contracts, NOAA officials said they increased the number of private sector  firms under contract, from five during the 2003-2008 contract period to  eight during the current 2014-2019 contract period. However, NOAA  officials said they have not awarded task orders for surveys to all eight  private sector firms in the same fiscal year because of NOAA\u2019s  appropriation, which has remained mostly flat during the current contract  period.", "NOAA also took steps to increase communication with contractors,  according to NOAA officials. For example, starting in 2005, NOAA has  invited hydrographic survey contractors to its annual field procedures  workshop, which brings together officials from NOAA\u2019s headquarters, field  offices, and quality assurance processing branches, among others. The  purpose of the workshop is to discuss updates to hydrographic survey  requirements and new hydrographic survey technologies. Also, since  2005, according to NOAA officials, contracting officer representatives  have improved their communication with contractors through the various  stages of the contract and survey activities by answering contractors\u2019  questions regarding project requirements, expected deliverables, data  processing, and unanticipated challenges that may occur when  conducting surveys.", "In addition, NOAA officials said that in 2010, the agency implemented  procedures for obtaining contractor input on changes to its hydrographic  survey technical specifications document, the Hydrographic Surveys  Specifications and Deliverables. The document is updated annually, and  contractors are asked to provide input through their respective contracting  officer representatives.

NOAA officials could not provide us  any documentation indicating what information the agency provided to  Congress in response to this statutory requirement.", "In 2010, NOAA issued its Ocean and Coastal Mapping and Contracting  Policy, which states that the policy was developed in response to the  act. However, rather than describing a strategy for expanding  contracting with the private sector, as required by the 2009 law, the policy  states that it is NOAA\u2019s intent to contract with the private sector for ocean  and coastal mapping services when the agency determines it is cost- effective to do so and funds are available. NOAA officials acknowledged  that the contracting policy does not meet the statutory requirement that  the agency develop a strategy for expanding contracting with the private  sector.", "NOAA officials said the agency is limited in its ability to expand private  sector contracting because of congressional direction on the use of the  agency\u2019s appropriations. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s hydrographic survey  program is supported by two separate funding elements, known as  \u201cPrograms, Projects, and Activities\u201d (PPA), within NOAA\u2019s Operations,  Research, and Facilities appropriation account. One PPA is for private  sector hydrographic data collection, and the other is for general  operations, maintenance, and repair of NOAA\u2019s entire fleet of ships,  including the hydrographic survey vessels. According to NOAA officials,  the agency has limited authority to reprogram funds between these two  PPAs without congressional notification and agreement that such  reprogramming is warranted. To propose a reprogramming of funds,  NOAA officials said they would need to evaluate the prioritization of all  fleet missions. In addition, NOAA officials said they would have to  continue to fund fixed operational costs and agency expenses for NOAA\u2019s  entire fleet even if operations funds were reprogrammed to hydrographic  data acquisition contracts.", "NOAA officials said the agency intends to develop a strategy describing  how it plans to expand private sector involvement in the hydrographic  data collection program\u2014which the Ocean and Coastal Mapping  Integration Act required the agency to submit in a report to relevant  congressional committees in 2009\u2014and it will use the 2010 Ocean and  Coastal Mapping and Contracting Policy to guide this effort. These  officials said the agency must first implement its planned improvements in  collecting both NOAA and private sector hydrographic survey costs; once  NOAA has a more accurate basis on which to compare costs, the agency  will assess the extent to which it can expand its use of the private sector  and develop a strategy accordingly. These officials said that if their  analysis indicates the agency should expand its use of the private sector  beyond what is currently possible given agency appropriations, the  agency will request changes to its appropriations to allow it more flexibility  in expanding its use of the private sector.

NOAA maintains a quality  assurance program for these data that includes three main review  procedures (described below). The HSSD standards for conducting  hydrographic surveys are based in part on the International Hydrographic  Organization\u2019s Standards for Hydrographic Surveys. These standards  pertain to hydrographic surveys that are intended for harbors, harbor  approach channels, inland navigation channels, and coastal areas of high  commercial traffic density, and they generally pertain to shallower areas  less than 100 meters in depth.", "According to NOAA officials, the HSSD has been reviewed annually since  its initial publication in 2000, and NOAA has procedures in place to obtain  suggestions from private sector contractors regarding changes to the  HSSD. For example, at its annual field procedures workshop, NOAA  conducts a session on data quality review standards and practices, and it  solicits recommendations for changes to the HSSD from both NOAA staff  and private sector hydrographers. According to NOAA officials,  contractors submitted fewer than 10 recommendations in 2016 but  submitted more than 30 recommendations in 2017. All recommended  changes to the HSSD are reviewed by the Office of Coast Survey\u2019s  Hydrographic Surveys Division, Operations Branch. Recommendations  are then forwarded to the Office of Coast Survey Board of Hydrographers  for review, and the survey board submits its recommendations to the  Chief of the Hydrographic Surveys Division for final approval. NOAA\u2019s  hydrographers test the feasibility of many significant changes to the  HSSD before they are put into practice by private sector hydrographers.  In June 2016, NOAA approved a new position specifically to oversee and  coordinate efforts related to hydrographic specifications, recommended  procedures, and training. According to NOAA officials, they intend to fill  the position in August 2017.", "NOAA officials said the HSSD is also the standard on which many other  international hydrographic entities base their hydrographic surveying requirements and is widely utilized by the hydrographic mapping  community.

NOAA\u2019s hydrographic survey data  processing branches located in Seattle, Washington, and Norfolk,  Virginia, are responsible for initiating a hydrographic survey data \u201crapid  survey assessment\u201d within 5 working days of survey data being delivered  to NOAA by private sector contractors and NOAA staff. According to  NOAA documentation, the assessment, which should be completed within  2 working days, is intended to improve data quality by quickly identifying  significant deficiencies in hydrographic survey data products. The  assessment helps ensure the survey data meet HSSD technical  requirements and project-specific instructions that are issued at the start  of each survey project. If the assessment finds significant deficiencies,  NOAA\u2019s assessment team may make corrections itself or may return the  survey to the hydrographer for rework and resubmission. The  hydrographic data processing branches take several factors into  consideration when deciding whether to return a survey for rework, such  as whether the hydrographers are capable of fixing the error, whether  there is value in returning a survey for the purpose of educating the  hydrographers to prevent future similar errors, and whether it is faster and  more efficient for the processing branch to make corrections. According to  NOAA documentation, even if no deficiencies are found, passing the data  through this initial assessment does not preclude the processing branch  from returning the survey to the field hydrographers for rework and  resubmission later in the quality assurance process if significant  deficiencies are subsequently found.", "Survey Acceptance Review. The survey acceptance review is a detailed  evaluation and acceptance of hydrographic survey data conducted by the  data processing branches in Seattle, Washington, and Norfolk, Virginia.
