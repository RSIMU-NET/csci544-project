These thinning efforts generate considerable quantities of woody material, including many smaller trees, limbs, and brush--referred to as woody biomass--that currently have little or no commercial value. GAO was asked to determine (1) which federal agencies are involved in efforts to promote the use of woody biomass, and the actions they are undertaking; (2) how these agencies coordinate their activities; and (3) what the agencies see as obstacles to increasing the use of woody biomass, and the extent to which they are addressing the obstacles.

Most of USDA's woody biomass utilization activities are undertaken by the Forest Service and include grants for woody biomass utilization, research into the use of woody biomass in wood products, and education on potential uses for woody biomass. DOE's woody biomass activities focus on research into using the material for renewable energy, while Interior's efforts consist primarily of education and outreach. Other agencies also provide technical assistance or fund research activities. Federal agencies coordinate their woody biomass activities through formal and informal mechanisms. Although the agencies have established two interagency groups to coordinate their activities, most officials we spoke with emphasized informal communication--through e-mails, participation in conferences, and other means--as the primary vehicle for interagency coordination. Internally, DOE coordinates its woody biomass activities through its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, while Interior and the Forest Service--the USDA agency with the most woody biomass activities--have appointed officials to oversee, and have issued guidance on, their woody biomass activities. The obstacles to using woody biomass cited most often by agency officials were the difficulty of using woody biomass cost-effectively and the lack of a reliable supply of the material; agency activities generally are targeted toward addressing these obstacles. Some officials told us their agencies are limited in their ability to address these obstacles and that incentives--such as subsidies and tax credits--beyond the agencies' authority are needed. However, others disagreed with this approach for a variety of reasons, including the concern that expanding the market for woody biomass could lead to adverse ecological consequences if the demand for woody biomass leads to excessive thinning."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss federal agency efforts to increase  the utilization of woody biomass. As you know, federal land management  agencies\u2014including the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture  (USDA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of  the Interior\u2014continue to focus on the threat that wildland fire poses to  our nation\u2019s communities and ecosystems. In addressing this threat,  agencies are placing greater emphasis on thinning forests and rangelands  to help reduce the buildup of potentially hazardous fuels. These thinning  efforts will generate considerable quantities of woody material, including  some larger trees that are commercially valuable timber and many smaller  trees, limbs, and brush that generally have little or no commercial value  today. This low commercial value material is often referred to as woody  biomass.", "Unlike commercial timber, this material typically has been piled and  burned, left in the forest, or deposited in landfills because there is often  little or no demand for it. Some industries make use of this woody  biomass, however\u2014for example, by burning it to generate electricity or  turning it into products such as road signs or animal bedding. Using woody  biomass in these and other ways can have several beneficial side effects,  including stimulating local economies and potentially facilitating fuel  reduction efforts by creating a demand for thinned material. However, the  cost of harvesting and transporting the material, combined with the  relatively low value of the products produced, has meant that woody  biomass has not been widely utilized.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings of our report being released  today that discusses federal agency activities to promote woody biomass  utilization, agency efforts to coordinate their activities, and the primary  obstacles that agencies believe are standing in the way of increased woody  biomass utilization. This report is based on our interviews of officials  from a wide range of federal and nonfederal organizations, including the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, the Interior, and  Transportation, as well as various agencies within these departments;  state governments; Indian tribes; environmental organizations; academia;  and others. We also reviewed agency documents, federal and nonfederal  studies of woody biomass utilization issues, and pertinent laws and other  documents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service and Interior collectively manage about 700 million  acres of federal land, much of which is considered to be at high risk of fire.  Federal researchers estimate that from 90 million to 200 million acres of  federal lands in the contiguous United States are at an elevated risk of fire  because of abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation, and that these  conditions also exist on many nonfederal lands. Addressing this fire risk  has become a priority for the federal government, which in recent years  has significantly increased funding for fuels reduction. Fuels reduction is  generally done through prescribed burning, in which fires are deliberately  lit in order to burn excess vegetation, and mechanical treatments, in which  mechanical equipment is used to cut vegetation.", "Although prescribed burning is generally less expensive on a per-acre  basis than mechanical treatment, prescribed fire may not always be the  most appropriate method for accomplishing land management  objectives\u2014and in many locations it is not an option, because of concerns  about smoke pollution, for example, or because vegetation is so dense that  agency officials fear a prescribed fire could escape and burn out of  control. In such situations, mechanical treatments are required, generating  large amounts of wood\u2014particularly small-diameter trees, limbs, brush,  and other material that serve as fuel for wildland fires.", "Woody biomass can be used in many ways. Small logs can be peeled and  used as fence posts, or can be joined together with specialized hardware  to construct pole-frame buildings. Trees also can be milled into structural  lumber or made into other wood products, such as furniture, flooring, and  paneling. Woody biomass also can be chipped for use in paper pulp  production and for other uses\u2014for example, a New Mexico company  combines juniper chips with plastic to create a composite material used to  make road signs\u2014and can be converted into other products such as  ethanol and adhesives. Finally, woody biomass can be chipped or ground  for energy production in power plants and other applications.", "Citing biomass\u2019s potential to serve as a source of electricity, fuel,  chemicals, and other materials, the President and the Congress have  encouraged federal activities regarding biomass utilization\u2014but until  recently, woody biomass received relatively little emphasis. Major  congressional direction includes the Biomass Research and Development  Act of 2000, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, the  Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003, and the American Jobs Creation  Act of 2004. Utilization of woody biomass also is emphasized in the federal  government\u2019s National Fire Plan, a strategy for planning and implementing  agency activities related to wildland fire management. For example, a  National Fire Plan strategy document cites biomass utilization as one of its  guiding principles, recommending that the agencies \u201cemploy all  appropriate means to stimulate industries that will utilize small-diameter  woody material resulting from hazardous fuel reduction activities.\u201d  Federal agencies also are carrying out research concerning the utilization  of small-diameter wood products as part of the Healthy Forests Initiative,  the administration\u2019s initiative for wildland fire prevention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Woody Biomass Utilization Activities Are Implemented by the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and the Interior and Include Grants, Research, and Education", "paragraphs": ["Most of the federal government\u2019s woody biomass utilization efforts are  being undertaken by USDA, DOE, and Interior.

In June 2003, the three departments signed a  memorandum of understanding on woody biomass utilization, and the  departments sponsored a 3-day conference on woody biomass in January  2004. The departments also have established an interagency Woody  Biomass Utilization Group, which meets quarterly to discuss relevant  developments and to coordinate departmental efforts.", "Another interdepartmental collaboration effort is the Joint Biomass  Research and Development Initiative, a grant program conducted by  USDA and DOE and authorized under the Biomass Research and  Development Act of 2000. The program provides funds for research on  biobased products. DOE also has collaborated with both USDA and BLM  on assessment of biomass availability, while USDA and Interior have  entered into a cooperative agreement with the National Association of  Conservation Districts to promote woody biomass utilization.", "USDA, DOE, and Interior also participate in joint activities at the field  level. For example, DOE\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)  and the Forest Service have collaborated in developing and demonstrating  small power generators that use woody biomass for fuel. The Forest  Service also collaborates with Interior in funding and awarding grants  under the Fuels Utilization and Marketing program, which targets woody  biomass utilization efforts in the Pacific Northwest. The agencies also  collaborate with state and local governments to promote the use of woody  biomass\u2014for example, the Forest Service, NREL, and BLM entered into a  memorandum of understanding with Jefferson County, Colorado, to study  the feasibility of developing an electricity-generating facility that would  use woody biomass."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA\u2019s Efforts Related to Woody Biomass Utilization Are Concentrated in the Forest Service, with Some Efforts Under Way in Other USDA Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Most of USDA\u2019s woody biomass utilization activities are undertaken by the  Forest Service and involve grants, research and development, and  education, outreach, and technical assistance. The Forest Service provides  grants through its Economic Action Programs, created to help rural  communities and businesses dependent on natural resources become  sustainable and self-sufficient. The Forest Service also has created a grant  program in response to a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act  for Fiscal Year 2005, which authorized up to $5 million for grants to create  incentives for increased use of biomass from national forest lands. Two  other USDA agencies\u2014the Cooperative State Research, Education and  Extension Service (CSREES) and USDA Rural Development\u2014maintain  programs that could include woody biomass utilization activities. CSREES  oversees the Biobased Products and Bioenergy Production Research grant  program and the McIntyre-Stennis grant program, which provides grants  to states for research into forestry issues under the McIntyre-Stennis Act  of 1962. Within USDA Rural Development, the Rural Business-Cooperative  Service oversees a grant program emphasizing renewable energy systems  and energy efficiency among rural small businesses, farmers, and  ranchers, and the Rural Utilities Service maintains a loan program for  renewable energy projects.", "Forest Service researchers are conducting research into a variety of  woody biomass issues. Researchers have conducted assessments of the  woody biomass potentially available through land management projects  and have developed models of the costs and revenues associated with  thinning projects. Researchers also are studying the economics of woody  biomass use in other ways; one researcher, for example, is beginning an  assessment of the economic, environmental, and energy-related impacts of  using woody biomass for power generation. The Forest Service also  conducts extensive research, primarily at its Forest Products Laboratory,  into uses for woody biomass, including wood-plastic composites and  water filtration systems that use woody biomass fibers, as well as less  expensive ways of converting woody biomass to liquid fuels.", "In addition, the Forest Service conducts extensive education, outreach,  and technical assistance activities. Much of this activity is conducted by  the Technology Marketing Unit (TMU) at the Forest Products Laboratory,  which provides woody biomass users with technical assistance and  expertise in wood products utilization and marketing. Forest Service field  office staff also provide education, outreach, and technical assistance, and  each Forest Service region has an Economic Action Program coordinator  who has involvement in woody biomass issues. For example, one such  coordinator organized a \u201cSawmill Improvement Short Course\u201d designed to  provide information to small-sawmill owners regarding how to better  handle and use small-diameter material.

One  factor contributing to the difficulty in using woody biomass cost- effectively is the cost incurred in harvesting and transporting woody  biomass.", "Numerous officials told us that even if cost-effective means of using  woody biomass were found, the lack of a reliable supply of woody  biomass from federal lands presents an obstacle because business owners  or investors will not establish businesses without assurances of a  dependable supply of material. Officials identified several factors  contributing to the lack of a reliable supply, including the lack of widely  available long-term contracts for forest products, environmental groups\u2019  opposition to federal projects, and the shortage of agency staff to conduct  activities. A few officials cited internal barriers that hamper agency  effectiveness in promoting woody biomass utilization, including limited  agency expertise related to woody biomass and limited agency  commitment to the issue.

Among these steps are  subsidies and tax credits, which officials told us are necessary to develop  a market for woody biomass but which are beyond the agencies\u2019 authority.  According to several officials, the obstacles to using woody biomass cost- effectively are simply too great to overcome by using the tools\u2014grants,  outreach and education, and so forth\u2014currently at the agencies\u2019 disposal.

One official told us that, although he supports these activities,  tax incentives and subsidies would create enormous administrative and  monitoring requirements. Another official stated that although increased  subsidies could address obstacles to woody biomass utilization, he does  not believe they should be implemented, preferring instead to allow  research and development efforts and market forces to establish the  extent of woody biomass utilization. Further, not all agree that the market  for woody biomass should be expanded. One agency official told us he is  concerned that developing a market for woody biomass could result in  overuse of mechanical treatment (rather than prescribed burning) as the  market begins to drive the preferred treatment, and representatives of one  national environmental group told us that relying on woody biomass as a  renewable energy source will lead to overthinning, as demand exceeds the  supply that is generated through responsible thinning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The amount of woody biomass resulting from increased thinning activities  could be substantial, adding importance to the search for ways to use the  material cost-effectively rather than simply disposing of it. However, the  use of woody biomass will become commonplace only when doing so  becomes economically advantageous for users\u2014whether small forest  businesses or large utilities. Federal agencies are targeting their activities  toward overcoming economic and other obstacles, but some agency  officials believe that these efforts alone will not be sufficient to stimulate a  market that can accommodate the vast quantities of material expected\u2014 and that additional action may be necessary at the federal and state levels.  Nevertheless, we believe the agencies will continue to play an important  role in stimulating woody biomass use. The Forest Service took a  significant step recently by designating an agency lead for woody biomass  activities, responding to a need we had identified in our draft report and  enhancing the agency\u2019s ability to ensure that its multiple activities  contribute to its overall objectives. Given the magnitude of the woody  biomass issue and the finite nature of agency budgets, it is essential that  federal agencies appropriately coordinate their woody biomass  activities\u2014both within and across agencies\u2014to maximize their potential  for addressing the issue.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
