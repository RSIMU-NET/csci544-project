The task team has one additional project in the planning phase.", "In planning and implementing these efforts, USAID has generally addressed nine of 11 key practices for organizational transformation and partially addressed two. For example, USAID generally addressed the key practice of involving employees and key stakeholders such as the Department of State and Congress through a variety of mechanisms, such as briefings and town halls. USAID also used data and evidence to guide its reform efforts by integrating employee and external input into its reform plans. Morever, USAID addressed fragmentation, overlap, and duplication by planning a restructuring effort to streamline operations and achieve efficiencies. Further, it generally addressed leadership focus and attention by designating a reform coordinator and establishing a dedicated team responsible for managing and planning USAID's reform efforts.", "However, while USAID established goals for its reform efforts, it established outcome-oriented performance measures for only four of its 32 projects. Establishing such measures would improve its ability to assess the results of the changes it is making. In addition, while USAID is developing a strategic workforce plan, it has yet to develop the tools needed to identify and meet staffing needs arising from the reforms in order to fully assess its workforce. Completing a strategic workforce plan with these tools could help USAID ensure it has the workforce needed to meet existing and emergent program demands.

Our prior work also indicates the importance of  preceding any staff realignments or downsizing with strategic workforce  planning so that changed staff levels do not inadvertently result in skills  gaps or other adverse effects that could increase use of overtime and  contracting.", "USAID has taken a number of steps since 2017 to develop an agency- wide strategic workforce plan both prior to and during the current reform  effort, including developing staff realignment plans as part of its process  for standing up the proposed new bureau structures. However, USAID  has not yet developed or implemented the data collection and  measurement tools that it has identified as necessary to gauge current  workforce capabilities, assess staffing needs arising from the proposed  reorganization, and identify ways to close gaps arising from changes in  workforce requirements.

This new structure would include an  optimally sized workforce with an effective mix of all USAID employee  types created through the use of a new workforce planning model.", "Project documents note, however, that developing this planning model  in turn would require developing a Workforce Planning Tool to define  workforce baselines and existing assets, identify future workforce  needs, assess gaps, and build capacity where needed. In June 2016,  USAID\u2019s 2016\u20132021 Human Resource Transformation Strategy and  Action Plan stated that developing this model would be difficult but  nevertheless estimated that implementing this effort would require no  more than 2 years. However, USAID officials noted that the Human  Resources Transformation efforts did not \u201cfully begin\u201d until 2018.", "T3 is implementing two projects associated with its objective titled  \u201cEmpower People to Lead.\u201d First, T3\u2019s Manage Human Capital Talent  project instituted an Employee Portal to provide all direct-hire  employees access to their human resources data in one centralized  online location. According to USAID documents, this project is also  developing for management an automated assignment, performance  management, and workforce planning tools, including separate  automated planning, performance, and assignment tools for its Civil  Service and Foreign Service personnel. The agency originally  intended to implement these tools by the end of calendar year 2018.  USAID\u2019s April 2019 performance monitoring plan indicates that the  tools\u2014particularly the workforce planning model that USAID  describes as a human-capital data analytics system to automate  various standardized and ad hoc reports and access previously  unconnected personnel data sources\u2014will not be available before the  end of fiscal year 2019. Second, T3\u2019s \u201cWorkforce Flexibility and  Mobility\u201d project is focused on implementing a demonstration project,  the \u201cAdaptive Personnel Project,\u201d to replace non-career, program- funded positions with an excepted-service management system. The  \u201cAdaptive Personnel Project\u201d is to be launched as a pilot project in two  USAID bureaus in fiscal year 2020.", "As of April 2019, USAID documents and USAID and employee union  officials noted that the strategic workforce plan has not yet been  completed. Moreover, the April 2019 Human Resources Performance  Monitoring Plan notes that the workforce planning tool needed to gauge  current capabilities and close gaps is not yet deployed and in use due to  competing programmatic and budgetary priorities. In addition, USAID\u2019s T3 project data tracking system indicates that the agency has delayed the  implementation of the projects needed to establish baselines and create  pilot projects until late 2019 or later in order to focus on broader strategic  workforce planning objectives, such as the Strategic Workforce plan and  \u201cAdaptive Personnel Project.\u201d", "The lack of a strategic workforce plan may limit USAID\u2019s efforts to  estimate how its proposed reorganization will affect future staffing needs.  For example, USAID officials indicated in 2018 that the proposed  reorganization of its headquarters bureaus was intended to be \u201cstaff  neutral.\u201d Its congressional notification pertaining to this reorganization  projected no net increase in its total combined headquarters workforce  level of 3,262 employees. Nevertheless, in its Fiscal Year 2020  Congressional Budget Justification, USAID identified a need for 40  additional Civil Service positions to \u201crefocus Washington bureaus and  offices toward being effective service providers to the field consistent with  the vision of ending the need of foreign assistance.\u201d USAID requested  $7.2 million to fund those positions in the restructured bureaus.

Specifically, USAID\u2019s reform efforts generally  addressed nine of the 11 key practices we assessed. However, taking  additional steps in two areas could further improve its reform efforts. First,  while it established goals and desired outcomes for its reform efforts, it  has not yet generally established outcome-oriented performance  measures necessary to assess the effectiveness and success of these  efforts. Second, while USAID has been developing a strategic workforce  plan since 2017, it has yet to complete this plan, which includes  developing the associated workforce planning tools to identify the staff  needed to meet existing and emergent program demands associated with  its transformation goals.

We did not apply criteria from  the \u201cWorkforce Reduction Strategies\u201d subcategory of our June 2018  report.

We defined  \u201csignificant gaps\u201d as the areas we identified, based on our analysis of the  key questions of each subcategory, that were both relevant to USAID as  an agency and important for the success of the reform efforts. Each of  two analysts made an independent qualitative judgment as to whether or  not USAID had generally, partially, or had not addressed those criteria.  The two analysts then reviewed and reconciled any differences in the  data used to reach each determination, and their results were subject to  supervisory review.
