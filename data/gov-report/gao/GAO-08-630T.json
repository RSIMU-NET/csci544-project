As experienced employees retire, they leave behind critical gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge, increasing the challenges government agencies face in maintaining a skilled workforce. We and others have emphasized the need to hire and retain older workers as one part of a comprehensive strategy to address expected labor shortages. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as the government's central personnel management agency, is responsible for helping agencies manage their human capital. The Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging asked GAO to discuss (1) the age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce, (2) the strategies federal agencies are using to hire and retain older workers, and (3) our observations on how these strategies position federal agencies to engage and retain older workers. To address these objectives, we analyzed demographic data from OPM's Central Personnel Data File, and interviewed officials at OPM and selected federal agencies. OPM is taking action to address past recommendations related to better assisting agencies in using personnel flexibilities. GAO is making no new recommendations at this time."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Governmentwide, about one-third of federal career employees on board at the end of fiscal year 2007 are eligible to retire between now and 2012. Many of these workers are concentrated in certain agencies. For example, nearly half of employees on board at the end of fiscal year 2007 at the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Transportation, and at the Agency for International Development and the Small Business Administration, will be eligible to retire by 2012. The proportion of workers eligible to retire is also expected to be high in certain occupations, including those considered mission critical, such as air traffic controllers and customs and border protection agents, where more than half of the employees will be eligible at that time. Retirement eligibility will be especially pronounced among the agencies' executives and supervisors--over 60 percent of career executives are projected to be eligible by 2012. Federal agencies have a variety of flexibilities at their disposal to help them recruit and retain older workers, including using temporary hires to address short-term needs and rehiring retired federal workers. However, we found that agencies have not always been aware of the full range of available flexibilities. One agency we reviewed--the Social Security Administration--is particularly at risk of losing a substantial portion of its workforce to retirement and has used a variety of strategies to hire and retain older workers, including offering recruitment, retention, and relocation bonuses. Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, have developed alternative approaches to attract experienced workers to meet their mission needs. Moreover, certain governmentwide flexibilities, such as flexible and part-time schedules, while not focused directly toward older workers, are particularly attractive to them. Overall, the federal government already has a number of characteristics that appeal to all employees and is making progress toward becoming a model employer of older, experienced workers. For example, federal employees can telecommute, work flexible hours, and receive health and retirement benefits that older workers find especially attractive. OPM and Congress are taking steps to minimize some challenges that agencies face, but opportunities for improvement remain. For example, OPM has developed online decision support tools to provide agencies with guidance on how to use available hiring flexibilities and retention strategies. Congress has legislation pending that incorporates OPM's proposals to enhance agencies' ability to hire and retain older workers by giving agencies the authority, without OPM approval, to rehire retirees without penalty. Agencies have a shared responsibility to pursue the full range of flexibilities and authorities available and to communicate this information within their own agencies. Collectively, these measures will help make federal agencies more competitive in the labor market for all demographic groups."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Like the nation\u2019s workforce as a whole, the federal workforce is aging and  ever larger proportions are nearing retirement eligibility. When they retire,  these older, experienced workers may leave behind critical gaps in  leadership, skills, and institutional knowledge. At the same time, the rate  of growth for the pool of younger workers is declining, and by 2025 overall  labor force growth is expected to be only one-fifth of what it is today and  much less than the projected growth in the number of retirees. As a result,  the federal government and other employers may face increased  competition in hiring skilled workers, and unless they develop effective  retention strategies, employers will need to look more aggressively for  workers with the right skills to meet their needs.", "Historically, the federal government has faced challenges hiring and  retaining talented workers in key fields, and the looming retirement wave  in federal agencies will only exacerbate these challenges. Older,  experienced workers represent a large and underutilized national  resource. Many experts maintain that older workers offer competitive  advantages to employers because they often possess management and  organizational skills that can be used in a variety of settings, and they  bring to the job knowledge, experience, and productive work habits. In  addition, today\u2019s older workers are better educated and healthier, and are  expected to live longer than previous generations. As the nation\u2019s largest  employer, the federal government is well positioned to serve as a role  model for other employers. As with private sector employers, efforts  directed at recruiting, engaging, and retaining a diverse workforce,  including older workers, may serve to make the federal government a  more competitive and productive employer overall.", "Because of this committee\u2019s continuing interest in older workers, we are  especially pleased to be here today to discuss work that we have  conducted at your request. In this work, we examined federal government  efforts to tap the pool of older workers to meet its workforce needs. As  requested, our testimony today, will discuss (1) the age and retirement  eligibility trends of the current federal workforce; (2) the strategies federal  agencies are using to recruit, hire, and retain older workers; and (3) our  observations on how these strategies position federal agencies to engage  and retain older workers.", "To describe demographic trends relating to the retirement eligibility and  aging of the federal workforce, we analyzed information on the 24 Chief  Financial Officer Act (CFO) agencies from the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) human resource reporting system, the Central  Personnel Data File (CPDF). Based on our previous work, we have  determined that the CPDF is sufficiently reliable for the informational  purpose of this testimony. In reviewing strategies federal agencies use to  recruit, hire, and retain older workers, we interviewed officials in selected  agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), Labor, and State, as well as the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the Social Security Administration  (SSA). We chose these agencies because they had relatively large  proportions of employees who were eligible to retire or because they were  implementing different approaches to hiring and retaining older workers.  In addition, we interviewed officials at OPM to obtain their perspective on  government retirement trends, and how agencies can address them. For  the purposes of this testimony, we define an older worker as an employee  aged 55 or over. We conducted our work from November 2007 to April  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence we obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions. See appendix I for a detailed discussion of our scope and  methodology.", "In summary, the large proportion of federal workers who are eligible to  retire now and will be in the near future presents challenges and  opportunities for federal agencies. While the proportion of older workers  eligible to retire varies across agencies, four agencies\u2014Small Business  Administration, the Agency for International Development, HUD, and the  Department of Transportation\u2014are well above the governmentwide  average of 33 percent. Proportions of workers eligible to retire are  projected to be especially high in certain occupations and in key  leadership positions\u201464 percent of career executives are projected to be  eligible by 2012. These trends underscore the importance of strategic  workforce planning. As the government\u2019s human capital leader, OPM is  responsible for helping agencies develop their human capital management  strategies. Federal agencies have a range of flexibilities and authorities  available that they may use to hire, engage, and retain workers. While only  one of these flexibilities is largely focused on older workers\u2014one that  allows agencies to rehire retirees without offsetting the annuity\u2014many,  such as flexible and part time work schedules, are particularly appealing  to older workers. One agency we reviewed\u2014the Social Security  Administration\u2014is particularly at risk of losing a substantial portion of its  workforce\u2014at a time when it will experience unprecedented growth in  demand for services. To deal with these losses, SSA has largely focused on  using governmentwide authorities, including paying recruitment and  retention bonuses for hard-to-fill positions and providing workplace  flexibilities, such as flexible work schedules and alternative work sites.  Other federal agencies are developing alternative approaches to hire and  engage older workers. For example, the State Department maintains  databases with information on retirees\u2019 skills and experience that it uses  to identify individuals who may be able to assist when special needs arise,  such as to provide tsunami relief for Indonesia. Overall, the federal  government is making progress toward becoming a model employer of  older, experienced workers.

One  such practice is strategic workforce planning, which addresses two critical  needs: (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human capital program with its  current and emerging mission and programmatic goals, and (2) developing  long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to  achieve these goals. In developing these strategies, we have reported that  leading organizations go beyond a succession-planning approach that  focuses on simply replacing individuals. Rather they engage in broad,  integrated succession planning and management efforts directed to  strengthening both current and future organizational capacity. In  implementing its personnel policies, the federal government is required to  uphold federal merit system principles in recruiting, engaging, and  retaining employees. Among other provisions, the merit system principles  require agencies to recruit and select candidates based on fair and open  competition, as well as treat employees fairly and equitably. Federal  agencies can recruit skilled or experienced workers, many of whom tend  to be older, to fill positions requiring demonstrated expertise.", "OPM is also responsible for administering retirement, health benefits, and  other insurance services to government employees, annuitants, and  beneficiaries.

In so doing,  we have called upon the federal government to assume a leadership role in  developing strategies to recruit and retain older workers. At our  recommendation, Labor convened a task force composed of senior  representatives from nine federal agencies and issued its first report in  February of this year. The report provides information on strategies to  support the employment of older workers, strategies for businesses to use  that leverage the skills of an aging labor pool, individual opportunities for  employment of older workers, and legal and regulatory issues associated  with work and retirement.

The agency is experiencing service delays, even at current staffing  levels. For example, SSA had over 750,000 disability claims awaiting a  decision at the hearing level at the end of January 2008, leading to an  average waiting time in fiscal year 2008 of almost 500 days. These backlogs  could increase in the future, given SSA\u2019s demographic profile. Indeed,  according to SSA\u2019s data, about 40 percent of its current workforce will be  eligible to retire by 2012, and by 2017 that proportion will grow to more  than half. The prospects for hiring new employees to replace retirees over  this timeframe remains unclear. According to SSA officials, while the fiscal  year 2008 budget provided sufficient funding to allow SSA to replace all of  the employees that leave\u2014and to add additional employees in some  areas\u2014budgetary constraints have prevented the agency from hiring  enough new workers in the past and future hiring will depend upon the  resources available.

According to officials, this technology has allowed them  to identify individuals with specialized skills and specific job  experience within hours. Before these systems were in place, the  search for specific individuals would have taken days or weeks, and  even then, the list of individuals would have been incomplete. Because  different personnel rules apply to Foreign Service and Civil Service  positions, the agency typically brings Civil Service retirees on as  contractors\u2014nonfederal employees without any reduction to earnings  or annuities\u2014and may hire Foreign Service retirees as federal  employees who may earn their full salaries and annuities.", "Hiring older workers through nonfederal approaches. The  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designed a program that  places older workers (55 years and over) in administrative and  technical support positions within EPA and other federal and state  environmental agencies nationwide. Instead of hiring older workers  directly into the government as federal employees, EPA has  cooperative agreements with nonprofit organizations to recruit, hire,  and pay older workers. Under these agreements, workers are  considered program enrollees, not federal employees. EPA\u2019s Senior  Environmental Employment (SEE) program started as a pilot project in  the late 1970s, and was authorized by the Environmental Programs  Assistance Act in 1984.

Recently, the  Partnership for Public Service reported that older workers face a number of  challenges to getting a federal job. Many of the issues they raise affect  applicants of all age groups. For example, for many of the jobs open to the  public, too little time was allowed between the time the job was announced  and the deadline for submitting a complete application. For this and other  reasons, a majority of older workers they surveyed thought that applying for a  federal job is difficult. To address the cumbersome and complicated federal  hiring process, the report recommended that federal agencies publicize  federal jobs beyond the internet, make federal job announcements and the  application process more user-friendly, and keep applicants informed of their  application status.", "Furthermore, the dual compensation rule, which requires annuitants\u2019  salaries to be offset by the amount of the annuities they receive, can create  a financial disincentive for retirees wishing to return to federal service.  Unless federal agencies receive authority to grant waivers of this rule,  retired federal workers\u2014unlike private sector or military retirees\u2014would  be working for reduced rates of pay. Other rules make it difficult to use  flexibilities. For example, federal employees close to retirement may face  reductions in the monthly retirement benefit if they choose to work part- time\u2014or use a phased retirement approach\u2014near the end of their careers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Employment Has a Number of Attributes Attractive to Older Workers", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the federal government is making progress toward becoming a  model employer of older, experienced workers.

For example, in the fall of 2005, OPM  put a hiring flexibilities decision support tool online to assist agencies in  assessing which flexibilities would best meet their needs. This Hiring  Flexibilities Resource Center provides in-depth information on a variety of  flexibilities, including Direct Hire and Excepted Service. In January 2008,  OPM updated its handbook on federal flexibilities and authorities, also  online, which provides more information on both recruiting and retention  strategies agencies can use to promote the positive aspects of the federal  government. Responding to past findings about the length of time it takes  to hire new employees, OPM has established a strategic goal to improve  recruitment and retention, including faster hiring, hiring more veterans,  rehiring annuitants, and faster application processing.", "OPM has also encouraged federal agencies to consider a broad spectrum  of employees as they seek to meet workforce needs. According to OPM,  federal human capital managers are facing increasing competition in  attracting and retaining talent. To meet this challenge, OPM has developed  a new approach, called the Career Patterns initiative, for bringing the next  generation of employees into federal positions. In its Career Patterns  guidance to agencies, OPM identifies, among other things, scenarios that  describe the particular characteristics of 10 types of individuals, including  students, new professionals, experienced professionals, and retirees who  could help broaden the pool of potential employees for federal jobs.", "OPM has also recently proposed legislation to Congress that would  enhance agencies\u2019 ability to hire and retain older workers. One proposal  would give agencies the authority to grant dual compensation waivers  without having to obtain OPM approval. The proposal calls for a yearly  and lifetime limitation on how many hours an individual can be  reemployed. A second proposal would increase the ability of employees to  work on a part time basis during their pre-retirement years by changing  the way the CSRS annuities based on part time services are computed.", "Congress has taken action to address the retirement risks in selected  occupations. For example, in 2006, Congress enacted legislation allowing  federal agencies to hire federal retirees to fill acquisition-related positions  without requiring annuity offset. The authority to use this provision  expires on December 31, 2011. Agencies are required to consult with OPM  and OMB in developing their plans for reemploying annuitants in  acquisition-related positions and to submit their plans to OPM. OPM  officials indicated that they have reviewed and approved 9 agencies\u2019 plans  for consistency with the statutory criteria for reemploying annuitants in  those positions. In addition, bills incorporating OPM\u2019s proposals related to  dual compensation waivers and part time employment are currently  pending in Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Employment Already Has a Number of Characteristics Appealing to Older Workers and Other Employees", "paragraphs": ["Although the availability of flexibilities generally varies by agency,  agencies already have the authority to offer a number of the flexibilities  and practices older workers find appealing in an employer. For example,  AARP\u2014one of the largest interest groups for individuals age 50 and  older\u2014developed criteria to evaluate an organization\u2019s performance in  recruiting, engaging, and retaining this cohort and has, since 2001, used  these criteria to identify the best employers for workers over 50. Features  of these criteria, as described by AARP, overlap with many of the  flexibilities that federal employment offers. Their availability and usage in  the federal government are shown in table 1.", "One area where the government is particularly strong is the availability of  health benefits. Federal agencies offer health benefits and pay a sizable  portion of the cost. Health insurance may be an especially attractive  recruitment and retention tool to older workers since employees generally  need only 5 years of federal service with health insurance while employed  to carry that benefit into retirement. The federal government also offers  retirement benefits and life insurance, and provides the opportunity for  employees to purchase long-term care insurance.", "In other areas, agencies generally have the authority to offer a particular  practice, but their actual usage varies by agency depending on the  agency\u2019s needs, the nature of the work and other factors. For example,  with respect to alternative work arrangements, the federal government  offers a number of programs that help employees balance their personal  and professional responsibilities, including telecommuting, part time  employment, and flexible schedules."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["A looming retirement wave could result in a possible \u201cbrain drain\u201d for  federal agencies unless they employ effective succession planning  strategies\u2014strategies that include hiring younger workers as well as  retaining older workers who possess needed talents and skills and who  can share these talents and skills with the next generation. Importantly,  the government already has a number of tools in its human capital tool kit  that provide agencies with flexibility they need to recruit and retain older  workers. Moreover, federal employment offers a range of benefits and  employment flexibilities, such as the availability of part-time employment  that can make these jobs particularly attractive to older workers, as well  as all demographic groups.", "Still, while the federal government is making progress toward becoming a  model employer of older workers, opportunities for improvement remain.  First, our demographic analysis shows that while the federal workforce is  aging, and an increasing number of employees will become eligible for  retirement in the coming years, these trends will have varying degrees of  impact within particular agencies. As a result, it will be important for  agencies to fully understand and forecast the implications of these trends  so they can implement timely and appropriate succession strategies.  Second, as certain federal agencies have developed alternative approaches  to hire and engage older workers, it will be important for agencies to share  lessons learned from these practices governmentwide. And third, despite  the availability of employment flexibilities and practices that allow  employees to balance their professional and personal responsibilities,  individual agencies do not always take advantage of them.", "Consequently, it is incumbent upon OPM to continue to work with federal  agencies to help ensure they have (1) the flexibilities they need to attract  and retain a diverse workforce that includes older workers; (2) the  awareness of these flexibilities, as well as guidance and technical  assistance needed to implement them; and (3) mechanisms to share best  practices and lessons learned in attracting and retaining older workers.  Becoming a model employer is a shared responsibility and it will be  important for agencies to, among other actions, take advantage of  available flexibilities and guidance on their use and communicate this  information throughout the agency. Collectively, these measures will help  make federal agencies more competitive in the labor market for all  demographic groups.", "Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee, this  concludes our prepared statement.
