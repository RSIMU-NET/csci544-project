GAO and others have previously identified challenges related to shortages in experienced and trained FEMA PA staff and high turnover among these staff. These challenges often led to applicants receiving inconsistent guidance and to PA project delays. As part of its new model, FEMA is creating consolidated resource centers to standardize and centralize PA staff responsible for managing grant applications, and new specialized positions, such as hazard mitigation liaisons, program delivery managers, and site inspectors, to ensure more consistent guidance to applicants. However, FEMA has not assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the new model, such as the number of staff needed to fill certain new positions, or to achieve staffing goals for supporting hazard mitigation on PA projects. Fully assessing workforce needs will help to ensure that FEMA has the people and the skills needed to fully implement the new PA model and help to avoid the long-standing workforce challenges the program encountered in the past.", "FEMA designed a new PA information and case management system\u2014called the FEMA Applicant Case Tracker (FAC-Trax)\u2014to address past information sharing challenges, such as difficulties in sharing grant documentation among FEMA, state, and local officials and tracking the status of PA projects, but additional actions could better ensure effective implementation. Both FEMA and state officials involved in testing of the new model stated that the new information system allows them to better manage and track PA applications and documentation, which could lead to greater transparency and efficiencies in the program. Further, GAO found that this new system fully addresses two of four key information technology (IT) management controls\u2014project planning and risk management\u2014that are necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. However, GAO found that FEMA has not fully addressed the other two controls\u2014requirements development and systems testing and integration.

While federal agencies support the evacuation, rescue, and relief to  hundreds of thousands of residents, projections of damages exceed $50  billion. In the weeks that followed, Hurricanes Irma and Maria brought  winds and storm surge, which caused damage across the U.S. Virgin  Islands, Puerto Rico, and the southeast United States, adding to the  projected disaster costs. These events are emblematic of a trend of rising  costs from natural disasters. In both 2016 and 2017, 15 separate U.S.  disasters resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion each. Each year, the  federal government obligates billions of dollars to programs and activities  that provide assistance to state and local governments, tribes, certain  nonprofit organizations, and individuals that have suffered injury or  damages from major disaster or emergency incidents, such as  hurricanes, tornados, or fires. We reported in 2016 that the federal  government obligated at least $277.6 billion in disaster assistance during  fiscal years 2005 through 2014 and have recognized the rise in the  number\u2014and the increase in severity\u2014of disasters as a key source of  federal fiscal exposure.", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), leads the federal effort to  mitigate, respond to, and recover from disasters, both natural and  manmade. FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance (PA) grant program provides  financial assistance to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments for  debris removal; emergency protective measures; and the repair,  replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities.", "For example, flooding across northern and central California in early  February 2017 resulted in substantial property and infrastructure damage,  including severe damage to the Oroville Dam spillway. Shortly thereafter,  the governor of California requested federal assistance, and the President  subsequently issued an emergency declaration that made funding  available for repairs to the spillway through the PA program. PA is  FEMA\u2019s largest disaster assistance grant program and from fiscal years  2009 through 2016, the agency obligated more than $36 billion in grants  for such projects.", "PA is a complex and multistep grant program administered through a  partnership between FEMA and the state grantee, which provides funding  to local officials who are the subrecipients of a PA grant award. Thus, it  entails an extensive paperwork and review process between FEMA and  grantee officials based on specific eligibility rules that outline the types of  damage that can be reimbursed by the federal government and steps that  federal, state, and local governments must take in order to document  eligibility. Due in part to the complexity of the process, we identified a  number of past challenges in various aspects of the program. Specifically,  we assessed the PA program in 2008 during the Gulf Coast states\u2019  recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We identified a number of  challenges related to FEMA\u2019s management of its PA workforce, including  lack of training and high turnover among PA staff, which led to project  delays and other problems. We also identified challenges related to  information sharing between FEMA and PA grant applicants, which led to  problems in tracking the status of projects, among other things. Moreover,  in 2015 we identified challenges in effectively incorporating mitigation into  PA projects and grant guidance during the recovery from Hurricane  Sandy in the northeastern United States. To address these various  challenges, we have made a number of recommendations, and FEMA  has taken or is taking various actions to address them, as we discuss  later in this report.", "In recent years, FEMA has taken steps to redesign the PA program to  address past challenges and make the program easier for FEMA and  grantee officials to manage. As part of this effort, FEMA redesigned  processes for developing, reviewing, and approving grant applications.  The agency is also developing new PA staff positions; implementing a  centralized and standardized grant processing approach; and developing  a new information system to better maintain and share grant  documentation. FEMA officials also report taking steps to better  incorporate hazard mitigation during the PA grant process. Taken  together, these efforts represent FEMA\u2019s \u201cnew delivery model\u201d for  managing project development in the PA program, which we refer to as  the preaward process. FEMA has been testing the new delivery model at  certain disaster locations since 2015, in preparation for implementing it  nationwide for all new disasters.", "In light of past challenges and recent changes to the PA program  preaward process, you asked us to assess FEMA\u2019s progress in  addressing these challenges and implementing the new delivery model.  Specifically, this report addresses the extent to which FEMA designed the  new delivery model to address previously identified challenges related to  1.  managing its PA program workforce and the extent that FEMA  assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the new delivery  model;  2.  information sharing between FEMA and grant applicants and the  extent that FEMA\u2019s new information sharing system satisfies key  information technology (IT) management controls; and  3.  incorporating hazard mitigation into the PA grant process.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed prior reports from GAO, the  DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and FEMA\u2019s own internal  assessments identifying past PA program management challenges  related to workforce management, information sharing, and hazard  mitigation. We compared information from these reports to information  and documentation of FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement the new PA delivery  model to determine the extent that the new model is being designed to  address these challenges. We also reviewed program documentation,  such as after-action reports that FEMA developed after testing the new  model in disaster locations. We conducted 62 semistructured interviews  with FEMA officials at headquarters and in two selected regions out of the  10 FEMA regional offices, including interviews with members of FEMA\u2019s  PA workforce at the centralized processing center in Denton, Texas, and  the Joint Field Office (JFO) in Savannah, Georgia, for Hurricane Matthew  recovery efforts in the state. We identified relevant officials based on job  title, responsibilities, and referrals from other officials. We asked  questions to identify their role in the implementation of the new delivery  model, their experiences with implementation, and their assessment of  the benefits and challenges of the model as it relates to our objectives  and scope. We also conducted 11 semistructured interviews with selected  state officials responsible for PA operations, to include those with and  without new delivery model experience. Lastly, we conducted three semistructured interviews with randomly selected applicants who applied  for PA funding after the Hurricane Matthew disaster in Georgia.  Although their responses are not generalizable across all applicants, they  helped inform our understanding of the experiences of recipients using  the new delivery model for the first time.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed FEMA documentation,  including the 2014 PA Program Realignment report, the PA Cadre  Training Plan, and after-action reports from different tests of the new  delivery model implementation to identify key workforce management  changes under the new model. We also reviewed position descriptions,  job aids, and training materials developed by FEMA to support new  workforce roles and responsibilities under the new model. As part of the  interviews previously described, we interviewed officials managing  workforce activities under the new delivery model, including a PA  program coordinator for workforce. We compared FEMA\u2019s workforce  management efforts under the new model to leading practices we have  identified for business process reengineering and strategic workforce  management.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed documents related to  FEMA\u2019s acquisition and development of the new information system for  the PA program. We interviewed program staff, stakeholders, and officials  from FEMA\u2019s Recovery Technology Programs Division that are  responsible for developing the new system, to understand changes to  information sharing under the new model. We then compared FEMA\u2019s  development efforts to key IT management control practices in the areas  of risk management, requirements development, project planning, and  systems testing and integration to determine the extent to which FEMA\u2019s  efforts met these practices. We drew these key control practices from the  Software Engineering Institute\u2019s Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration for  Acquisition and Development, the Project Management Institute\u2019s Guide  to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide), and  the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\u2019 (IEEE) Standard for  Software and System Test Documentation.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed documentation such as  FEMA PA policies and operations guidance related to incorporating  hazard mitigation into PA projects, as well as process guides, job aids,  and training materials developed under the new delivery model, to better  understand how mitigation is addressed. In addition, we interviewed PA  program officials; officials from FEMA\u2019s Federal Insurance and Mitigation  Administration (FIMA), who assist PA officials to incorporate mitigation  into the recovery process; and state officials involved with the second and  third test implementations of the new model in Oregon and Georgia. We  also reviewed after-action reports from the second and third test  implementations of the new model and new delivery model performance  measures in the PA New Delivery Model Assessment Plan. We then  compared the information derived from the documentation and interviews  to the goals and objectives identified in FEMA strategic plans, the  National Disaster Recovery Framework, the National Mitigation  Framework, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, to determine the extent that FEMA\u2019s new delivery model  incorporates hazard mitigation planning into the PA process and includes  goals aligned with broader FEMA mitigation goals. Also, we obtained  data from FEMA\u2019s existing PA information system\u2014the Emergency  Management Mission Integrated Environment (EMMIE)\u2014on the number  of PA projects that incorporated hazard mitigation in the third test  implementation of the new delivery model in Georgia.

FEMA officials establish a temporary Joint Field Office (JFO)  to house staff who will manage response and recovery functions after a  declared disaster (including operations, emergency response and support  teams, planning, administration, finance, and logistics). Once the  President has declared a disaster, PA staff work with grant applicants to  help them document damages, identify eligible costs and work, and  prepare requests for PA grant funds by developing project proposals.  These proposals may include proposals for hazard mitigation if the  hazard mitigation work is related to the repair of damaged facilities,  referred to as permanent work projects. Immediate emergency measures,  such as debris removal, are not eligible for hazard mitigation.

There is no preset limit to the  amount of PA funds a community may receive; however, PA hazard  mitigation measures must be determined to be cost effective. Some  examples of hazard mitigation measures that FEMA has predetermined to  be cost effective, if they meet certain requirements, include  installing shut-off valves on underground pipelines so that damaged  sections can be isolated during or following a disaster;  securing a roof using straps, clips, or other anchoring systems in  locations subject to high winds; and  installing shutters on windows or replacing glass with impact-resistant  material.", "Applicants can also propose mitigation measures that are separate from  the damaged portions of a facility, such as constructing floodwalls around  damaged facilities to avoid future flooding.

For example,  we reported in 2008 that the PA program had a shortage of experienced  and knowledgeable staff, relied on temporary rotating staff, and provided  limited training to their workforce, which impaired PA program delivery  and delayed recovery efforts after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We  found that staff turnover, coupled with information sharing challenges,  delayed projects when applicants had to provide the same information  each time FEMA assigned new staff and that poorly trained staff provided  incomplete and inaccurate information during their initial meetings with  applicants or made inaccurate eligibility determinations, which also  caused processing delays. We recommended that FEMA strengthen  continuity among staff involved in administering the PA program by  developing protocols to improve information and document sharing  among FEMA staff. In response, in 2013 FEMA instituted a PA  Consistency Initiative, which included hiring new managers for FEMA  regional offices, stakeholder training on PA program administration, and  using a newly developed internal website to allow staff to post and share  information to address continuity and knowledge sharing concerns during  disaster operations. FEMA also developed the Public Assistance Program  Delivery Transition Standard Operating Procedure to facilitate the transfer  of responsibility for PA program activities during cases of staff turnover  during recovery operations. Despite FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement our  recommendations, the DHS-OIG, in 2016, found continuing challenges  after Hurricane Sandy with workforce levels, skills, and performance of  reservists, who make up the majority of the PA workforce.", "Regarding information sharing, in 2008, we also identified difficulties  sharing documents among federal, state, and local participants in the PA  process and difficulties tracking the status of projects. We recommended  that FEMA improve information sharing within the PA process by  identifying and disseminating practices that facilitate more effective  communication among federal, state, and local entities. In response,  FEMA proceeded with the implementation of a grant tracking and  management system, called EMMIE, which was used previously in 2007.  However, in subsequent years we found weaknesses in how FEMA  developed the system and the DHS-OIG found that information sharing  problems similar to the ones identified in our 2008 report persisted.", "Regarding hazard mitigation, we reported in 2015 that state and local  officials experienced challenges in using PA hazard mitigation during the  Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts because PA officials did not consistently  prioritize hazard mitigation, and in some cases discouraged mitigation  projects during the PA grant application process, among other  challenges. We recommended that FEMA assess the challenges state  and local officials reported, including the extent to which they can be  addressed, and implement corrective actions, as needed. In response to  our recommendation, FEMA developed a corrective action plan that  included actions and milestones for reviewing, updating, and  implementing PA hazard mitigation policy. FEMA also identified the PA  new delivery model as a solution for some of the challenges state and  local officials reported. Previously, the OIG also reported that PA program  officials did not consistently identify eligible PA hazard mitigation projects,  and that PA officials did not prioritize the identification of PA hazard  mitigation opportunities at the onset of recovery efforts after the 2005 Gulf  Coast hurricanes. See appendix I for a summary of findings and the  status of our past recommendations on challenges with workforce  management, information sharing, and hazard mitigation related to the  PA program since our last review in December 2008.", "FEMA\u2019s own internal reviews and outreach efforts have also identified  similar challenges. For example, at FEMA\u2019s request the Homeland  Security Studies and Analysis Institute assessed the effectiveness and  efficiency of the PA program in 2011. The institute\u2019s report outlined 3  key findings and 23 recommendations relating to the PA preaward  process. For example, the report found that FEMA could enhance training  programs to develop a skilled and experienced workforce; utilize  technology and employ web-based tools to support centralized  processing, transparency, and efficient decision making; and identify and  address potential special considerations, such as hazard mitigation  proposals, as early as possible in the preaward process to improve  consistency. In 2014, PA program officials analyzed the PA grant process  and used input from agency staff and officials involved in various aspects  of the program to identify potential improvements. The resulting Public  Assistance Program Realignment report found that challenges in  workforce management, information sharing, and hazard mitigation  continued, and included recommendations for improvement. For example,  the report concluded that a shortage of qualified staff, high turnover,  unclear organizational responsibilities, and inconsistent training were  long-standing and continuing challenges that impaired the PA pre-award  process. In addition, from January 2015 to April 2015, FEMA conducted  extensive outreach with more than 260 stakeholders across FEMA  headquarters, all 10 regions, 43 states, and 4 tribal nations to discuss  challenges in the PA program and opportunities for improvement. For  example, stakeholders identified challenges with ineffective information  collection during the preaward process and suggested identifying special  considerations, such as hazard mitigation, earlier in the PA process as an  idea for improvement.

Specialists and managers at the CRC noted that poorly trained  site inspectors did not consistently provide the necessary information  from the field, which resulted in delays for the CRC staff to process  projects, and after-action reports also identified challenges with site  inspector skills. According to a PA applicant in Georgia, the inconsistency  of skills and experience of their site inspector resulted in the need to  conduct a \u201cdo-over\u201d site inspection on one of the applicant\u2019s projects,  causing delays. PA staff and state officials attribute much of the site  inspectors\u2019 skill gaps to their lack of training and experience in the  program. According to PA Region officials, providing timely training will be  a resource-intensive challenge for implementing the new delivery model  for all future disasters. For example, it can be difficult to train reservists  before FEMA deploys them to disasters, and many of the program\u2019s  experienced reservists have retired or resigned, resulting in few mentors  for the program and a high need to provide training to inexperienced and  newly hired staff.", "PA officials and stakeholders also emphasized the need for FEMA to  provide additional training for state and local officials to build capacity and  support the goals of the new delivery model. For example, according to  JFO officials at the third implementation, the new delivery model  increases responsibilities for applicants, who will require more applicant  training than FEMA currently provides. According to state officials,  applicant capabilities vary, and FEMA should provide training to state and  local officials on the new delivery model and the information system  before a disaster. Skill gaps among applicants could result in inconsistent  implementation of the new process, according to PA staff and  stakeholders, and PA staff said that training was important to prevent  applicants from reverting back to the legacy PA grant application process.", "To support full implementation of the new delivery model for all disasters,  PA program officials have updated training courses for PA staff and  applicants, and planned additional training to address these challenges  and other lessons learned through the test implementation. For example,  PA officials told us they updated the site inspector training program in  May 2017 and scheduled a new site inspector training session in August  2017 to include more hands-on training to help address the skill gaps  identified for site inspectors. PA officials created a new training course for  FEMA\u2019s regional offices, in part to enable regional PA staff to provide new  delivery model training to state and local officials.

PA  program officials developed an initial assessment of the total number of  staff needed in the field and the CRCs in 2016 to estimate cost savings  associated with consolidating and specializing positions at the CRCs and  deploying fewer staff to JFOs. However, the assessment did not identify  the number of staff required to fill specific positions, including program  delivery managers and hazard mitigation specialists, needed to support  the new delivery model for full implementation. In reviewing the test  implementations of the new delivery model, we found that inadequate  staffing levels at the JFOs and CRCs, and with FIMA\u2019s hazard mitigation  staff, affected staffs\u2019 ability to achieve the goals of the new delivery  model.", "Staff levels at the JFO. We identified challenges with having the right  number of program delivery managers and site inspection specialists  to achieve program goals for customer satisfaction, efficiency, and  quality in test implementations of the new delivery model. For  example, in the second test implementation of the new delivery model  in Oregon in 2016, PA did not deploy enough program delivery  managers to the disaster, which resulted in unmanageable caseloads  for program delivery managers, according to state and PA officials.  PA program officials assigned program delivery managers an average  caseload of 12 PA applicants, which was more than they could  effectively manage, according to PA staff, and program officials aim  for a caseload of 8 to 10 applicants. According to state officials, local  officials reported they did not always receive the support they needed  from program delivery managers who managed caseloads consisting  of dozens of projects at multiple sites for each applicant during the  Oregon implementation. As a result of overwhelmed program delivery  managers, local officials faced challenges understanding their  responsibilities, such as recognizing when they needed to provide  information for the project development to proceed, according to state  officials. PA staff involved with the third test implementation in  Georgia in 2016 and 2017 said there were not enough site inspectors  or program delivery managers to fully manage the workload at the  JFO. Because of the specialization of roles, projects could not move  forward when there were not enough staff to execute the next step in  the process. For example, PA staff at the JFO said program delivery  managers completed recovery scoping meetings rapidly, but faced a  bottleneck in scheduling site inspections because there were more  applicants awaiting site inspections than could be fulfilled by the  number of site inspection specialists available.", "Staff levels at the CRC. Staff at the CRC reported challenges with  staffing levels during the Oregon and Georgia test implementations,  and expressed concerns about when PA officials will staff the CRCs  to support full implementation of the new model for all disasters.  During the Oregon test implementation, a CRC specialist said there  were not enough technical specialists to manage the workload and, as  a result, PA program officials had to redeploy site inspectors from  their JFO field operations to the CRC to complete costing estimates.  During the third test in Georgia, quality assurance specialists said that  their workload resulted in added stress trying to complete the work in  time while adhering to quality standards. According to CRC specialists  in Denton, Texas, PA officials had not determined required staff levels  for full implementation, but agreed that workload was too high and  program officials needed to determine the appropriate staff levels for  each CRC to support full implementation. PA officials were still  evaluating CRC processing times and workload management from the  Oregon and Georgia test implementations to determine staffing  needs, according to PA officials. Further, PA program officials plan to  establish a second CRC in Winchester, Virginia, before the end of  2017, but have not determined the number of additional permanent  full-time staff needed to support the CRCs for full implementation of  the new delivery model.", "Staff levels for the hazard mitigation specialists. PA officials have  not identified the number of hazard mitigation specialists in FIMA\u2019s  hazard mitigation cadre needed for full implementation of the new  delivery model. According to JFO staff, current hazard mitigation staff  levels are insufficient to provide the desired in-person participation of  hazard mitigation staff on all recovery scoping meetings to share  information on hazard mitigation with applicants and help them  identify potential mitigation opportunities. A PA program official said  officials missed opportunities to pursue hazard mitigation during the  test implementation after Hurricane Matthew in Georgia due to lack of  hazard mitigation specialists. In addition, for the test implementation in  Oregon, there were not enough hazard mitigation specialists to cover  all site inspections and implement their new delivery model  responsibilities, according to FEMA\u2019s after-action reports. The  absence of hazard mitigation specialists in the early stages of PA  project development may cause delays in officials\u2019 identifying hazard  mitigation opportunities, according to a FIMA official. PA program  officials said they did not work with FIMA to determine the appropriate  levels of hazard mitigation staff under the new delivery model  because they were refining the new process, but as of June 2017  were working with FIMA to do so.", "One of the key implementation activities in our Business Process  Reengineering Assessment Guide includes addressing workforce  management issues. Specifically, this includes identifying how many and  which employees will be affected by the position changes and  retraining. Further, our prior work has found that high-performing  organizations identify their current and future workforce needs\u2014including  the appropriate number and deployment of staff across the organization\u2014 and address workforce gaps, to improve the contribution of critical skills  and competencies needed for mission success.", "According to a PA program official, their initial workforce assessment was  not comprehensive because they were still collecting data required to  make informed decisions. PA officials agreed that updating their  workforce assessments prior to full implementation could be helpful, and  acknowledged that program officials needed to be more proactive  applying the lessons learned as they pivot from testing to full  implementation of the new delivery model in 2018. FEMA also conducts a  standard agency wide workforce structure review every 2 to 3 years,  which helps officials determine the appropriate disaster workforce levels.  As of June 2017, PA officials were working with other offices within FEMA  to expedite the agency-wide assessment of the PA and FIMA hazard  mitigation cadres, but did not know when they would complete the  assessment. PA officials also acknowledged that they faced an  aggressive schedule to complete various planned activities for workforce  management, training, and other efforts, in support of full implementation,  and that they may not be able to complete all efforts as thoroughly as  they would like in order to expedite the transition of the PA program to the  new delivery model.", "The gaps in PA workforce assessment in the JFOs, CRCs, and for  FIMA\u2019s hazard mitigation cadre present a risk that PA program managers  will not have a sufficient workforce to support the goals of the new  delivery model. In addition, the timing and implementation of the hiring  and training activities for new PA program staff could take multiple  months, and program officials will need to know what staff levels are  necessary for full implementation of the new delivery model to inform  resource decisions for the program in coordination with other agency  offices. According to PA program officials, workforce assessment efforts  have been delayed as a result of disaster response and recovery efforts  related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

Further, PA officials said that FAC-Trax could reduce  challenges associated with staff turnover during the project development  process because the system stores and maintains applicant information  and project documentation, making it easier for transitioning staff to assist  an applicant. They also said they use FAC-Trax to gather and analyze  data that supports management of the PA process, including measuring  the timeliness of the grant application process. For example, during the  test implementation of the new delivery model in Georgia following  Hurricane Matthew, officials were able to document that, on average,  program delivery managers took 5 days to conduct the exploratory call  and 14 days to hold the recovery scoping meeting with applicants, and  CRC officials took 33 days to develop and review grant proposals.

To address the first and second practices, program  officials identified key risks that could negatively affect FAC-Trax in a \u201crisk  register\u201d\u2014an online site used to track risks, issues, and mitigating  actions. As of May 2017, officials had identified 13 risks in the risk  register\u2014four open and nine closed\u2014and evaluated and categorized the  identified risks based on the probability of occurrence and scope,  schedule, and cost impacts.

For example, although program officials reviewed change  requests for completeness and followed up with users to verify  requirements, officials did not track system enhancements, made in  response to detailed user requirements (e.g., allowing users to search PA  projects by project number), back to the high-level requirements (e.g.,  storing data and information provided by the applicant) identified in the  FAC-Trax functional requirements document and performance work  statement. Officials did not track system enhancements back to high-level  requirements because they did not have a complete understanding of  basic user needs and system requirements at the beginning of the FAC- Trax effort, according to the PA program manager. A PA official also said  the change control process was a way to identify the basic capabilities  FAC-Trax needed to have and that tracking enhancements back to high- level requirements could have made the change control process more  difficult to manage, and reduced user participation if, for example, users  needed to understand how their change requests related to high-level  requirements. However, program officials could have tracked  enhancements back to high-level requirements themselves using the  change control process without putting any additional burden on users.  Despite not having a complete understanding of user needs and system  requirements at the beginning of the FAC-Trax effort, analyzing whether  users\u2019 change requests satisfy higher-level requirements identified in key  design and planning documents would have provided officials with a basis  for more detailed and precise requirements throughout project  development and helped them better manage the project, according to IT  management controls.

However,  under the new model, FEMA officials developed performance objectives  (and associated measures) to increase the number of projects that  include hazard mitigation by 5 percent, and increase the total dollars  spent on hazard mitigation by 2 percent. While these measures could  help to incentivize mitigation, they are not tied to building codes and do  not include specific information that FEMA could use to continually  assess the PA program\u2019s contributions to meeting the agency\u2019s strategic  goal.", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  agency management should design control activities, such as  establishing and reviewing performance measures, to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. In addition, our work on leading public sector  organizations has found that such organizations assess the extent to  which their programs and activities contribute to meeting their mission  and desired outcomes, and strive to establish clear hierarchies of  performance goals and measures. A clear connection between  performance measures and program offices helps to both reinforce  accountability and ensure that, in their day-to-day activities, managers  keep in mind the outcomes their organization is striving to achieve.  FEMA\u2019s ability to evaluate and report on PA hazard mitigation data is  constrained, but officials are addressing this challenge through the  development of data reporting and analytics capabilities for the PA  program\u2019s new information system, according to PA officials. PA program  officials developed measures they could use to evaluate the new model  during test implementation and compare new model performance to the  legacy PA process, and agreed that aligning PA program hazard  mitigation goals with FEMA\u2019s agency-wide strategic goals would be  helpful. As FEMA continues to develop and implement the new model,  developing performance measures and objectives to better inform and  support the agency\u2019s broader strategic goals could help to ensure that  FEMA capitalizes on hazard mitigation opportunities in PA recovery  efforts."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance grant program is a complicated, multi-billion  dollar program that is critical to helping state and local communities  rebuild and recover after a major disaster. In recent years, FEMA has  undertaken a major reengineering effort to make the PA preaward  process simpler and more efficient for applicants and to address  challenges encountered during recovery from past disasters. FEMA\u2019s new  delivery model represents a significant opportunity to strengthen the PA  program and address these past challenges, and growing pains are to be  expected when implementing any large reengineering effort. Further,  FEMA officials work to implement these changes while supporting  response and recovery following disasters, including the catastrophic  flooding from Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 and widespread damages  from Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. As such, it is critical  that feedback obtained and lessons learned while testing the new model  inform decisions and actions as FEMA proceeds with full implementation for all disasters, including the complex recovery efforts in the states and  territories affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.", "FEMA has redesigned the PA delivery model to address various  challenges related to workforce management, information sharing with  state and local grantees, and incorporating hazard mitigation into PA  projects. FEMA has developed new workforce processes, training, and  positions to address past challenges, but completing a workforce  assessment that identifies the number of staff needed will inform  workforce management and resource allocation decisions to help FEMA  ensure a more successful implementation. This is particularly important  as FEMA is using the new model for the long-term recovery from the  2017 hurricanes, and FEMA faces capacity challenges as its workforce is  stretched thin. Further, FEMA\u2019s new FAC-Trax information sharing  system provides FEMA and state and local applicants and grantees with  better capabilities to address past challenges in managing and tracking  PA projects. In developing FAC-Trax, FEMA implemented many of the  key IT management controls that can help ensure that new IT systems  are implemented effectively. However, additional steps are needed to fully  satisfy the areas of requirements development and systems testing and  integration. Finally, FEMA has taken some actions to better promote  hazard mitigation as part of its new PA model. However, more consistent  planning for hazard mitigation following a PA disaster and developing  specific performance measures and objectives that better align with and  support the agency\u2019s broader strategic goals related to hazard mitigation  could help to ensure that mitigation is incorporated into recovery efforts,  which presents an opportunity to encourage disaster resilience and  reduce federal fiscal exposure from recurring catastrophic natural  disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to FEMA\u2019s Assistant  Administrator for Recovery:", "The FEMA Assistant Administrator for Recovery should complete a  workforce staffing assessment that identifies the appropriate number  of staff needed at joint field offices, Consolidated Resource Centers,  and in FIMA\u2019s hazard mitigation cadre to implement the new delivery  model nationwide.
