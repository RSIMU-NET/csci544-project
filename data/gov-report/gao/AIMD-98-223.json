The Arena Tax is due on or before June 15 of each year. The Arena Tax Act requires the Mayor to raise the Arena Tax rates to provide for annual revenues of $9 million if the Arena Tax revenues are estimated to be less than $9 million. The Arena Tax Act also authorized RLA to pledge the Arena Tax as security to repay loans to finance predevelopment activities. The Arena Tax was first levied in fiscal year 1995 and mostly used to fund predevelopment activities. In subsequent years, the Arena Tax was used to pay principal and interest (debt service) on the bonds as required by the bond resolution.", "To initially finance the predevelopment costs of the sports arena, $2.5 million was advanced by the District\u2019s Sports Commission. The funds were provided with the understanding that they would be repaid from the proceeds of a loan the District would secure. In August 1995, the District received a $53 million loan commitment (line of credit) from a consortium of banks. In January 1996, RLA issued about $60 million in revenue bonds backed by the Arena Tax and paid off the $36.6 million portion of the line of credit used.", "The funds originally available to pay the arena\u2019s net predevelopment costs and to establish a debt service reserve totaled $66.6 million. These funds consisted of (1) $57.4 million in net bond proceeds from the sale of RLA Revenue Bonds in January 1996 and (2) about $9.2 million in 1995 net tax collections from the dedicated Arena Tax. Of the $66.6 million then available, $11 million was placed in two reserves. A mandatory $5 million capital reserve, which was required by the bond resolution, was established to pay for any insufficiency in the project fund. A reserve of about $6 million was established for debt service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine the status of the sports arena project\u2019s (1) predevelopment costs, (2) revenue collections, and (3) bond redemption status.", "To determine the status of expenditures for predevelopment activities for the sports arena, we interviewed District officials on the Arena Task Force, the District\u2019s Sports Commission and Corporation Counsel, and the D.C.

We discussed the construction costs of the arena and Metrorail connection with officials from DCALP and WMATA.", "We reviewed all expenditures made since the period covered by our last report, from October 8, 1997, to April 30, 1998. Payments were made from the funds obtained from the net proceeds of the bond sale. The universe of payments included 10 expenditure items, which, at the time of our audit, represented 100 percent of the total funds spent in the review period. We reviewed each expenditure item to determine whether it was made within the terms of the contract or invoice amounts, it had been approved for payment by a District official, and the funds had actually been disbursed.", "We did not audit the reported taxes collected and deposited for the sports arena project. Therefore, we did not determine if the District government accurately identified the universe of taxpayers or reported all dedicated taxes for this project. However, we reviewed monthly statements provided by the lockbox trustee to determine the amount of taxes collected and placed in escrow. In addition, we confirmed that all payments due to the District from the ground lease had been made. This review provides an update on the previous work we performed.

On April 29, 1998, the District reached an out of court settlement with the owners to pay $8.2 million for the land. The price of the land was $2.9 million more than the $5.25 million the District had originally deposited with the D.C. Superior Court in invoking its power of eminent domain.", "To pay the additional $2.9 million, the District used funds from a grant made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

WMATA officials informed us that they expect the project to be closed out (all bills reviewed and approved for payment) by September 1998. It is their expectation that after the project is closed out, there will be about a $285,000 residual from the funds associated with the Department of Transportation (DOT) Capital Assistance Grant.

In a letter dated October 6, 1997, DCALP cited seven infrastructure improvements it had made to the site, at a cost of $403,000, which it claimed under the terms of the Exclusive Development Rights Agreement (EDRA), that the District was responsible for.

District officials told us that they have budgeted sufficient funds to remove the concrete structures and cover the cost of remediation. They stated that based on tests done at the site, only limited amounts of the soil are contaminated.

Through April 30, 1998, the District had earned about $1.5 million in interest from the funds available to pay predevelopment costs.", "In our last report, we stated that all of the leasehold improvement costs associated with the relocated employees should have been paid from the District\u2019s sports arena project fund rather than from the District\u2019s appropriated funds because this activity was an allowable cost for the sports arena project. The project manager of the arena task force contends that $371,530 should be borne by the District since it was not factored into the original predevelopment activities budget. However, we have excluded the $371,530 District reimbursement since the cost should be borne by the sports arena project because these expenses were precipitated by the relocation action to allow arena construction.

These funds were sufficient to meet 1997 principal and interest payments (about $5.9 million annually) on the bonds issued to finance the predevelopment expenses.

As of April 30, 1998, the bond trustees had paid out $14.2 million in principal and interest payments. Approximately $5.7 million had been paid in interest and $6 million of the serial bonds and $2.5 million of the term bonds had been redeemed. The remaining $5.1 million of Arena Tax collections was held in the debt service reserve funds (see next section). The bond resolution requires that any additional tax collected over the amount needed to pay debt service on bonds be placed in a super sinker fund and be used to redeem term bonds earlier than their due dates. The serial bonds cannot be redeemed earlier than their stated maturity dates.", "Table 3 shows our analysis of when the Arena Tax bonds can be fully paid off. Our analysis, which assumes similar future collections of dedicated tax revenues, annual ground lease revenue from DCALP, use of outstanding debt service reserve funds (plus interest), and no recession or cyclical downturns of the local economy, shows that the bonds could be paid off in the year 2002, or 8 years before the last scheduled maturity date. Upon redemption of all bonds in 2002, excess funds of $7.7 million would be transferred to the District General Fund. This scenario would save about $16.4 million in interest payments (see table 4).

We questioned the bond trustee as to why additional term bonds were not redeemed on November 1, 1997. Her response was that because of a change in personnel, the early redemption of term bonds had been overlooked. This missed opportunity to redeem term bonds prior to their maturity date could have caused the District to incur additional interest expense for that period. However, the excess funds were deposited in an interest earning account and the interest earned on the funds available for bond redemption was substantially the same as the average interest rate on the bonds that would have been redeemed and, accordingly, the District did not incur any losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operating Arena Generates First Ground Lease Payment", "paragraphs": ["On April 3, 1998, the District received its first quarterly payment of $76,644 under the yearly ground lease for the arena site.
