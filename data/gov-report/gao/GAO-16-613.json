Use of an  unmanned self-defense test ship equipped with SPY-6 and the Aegis  combat system would allow a safety offset that is much closer to the ship  (less than 400 feet) and would permit the targets to conduct realistic  maneuvers, which provides the ability to ensure operationally realistic  stream raid effects are present and make the test adequate.", "The Navy has asserted that the end-to-end testing scenarios identified by  DOT&E for operationally testing Flight III self-defense capabilities can be  accomplished on a manned Flight III ship. Navy officials also stated that a  robust test approach that includes testing at land-based test sites, on the  currently-configured self-defense test ship, and on a manned Flight Ill  ship, can provide sufficient information to support their test needs and  accredit the modeling and simulation used in testing. Furthermore, the  Navy\u2019s position is that using an unmanned self-defense test ship  equipped with Aegis and SPY-6 for Flight Ill operational testing would only  minimally increase knowledge of operational performance beyond what  can be achieved without its use. Navy officials emphasized that (1) land- based testing is expected to provide nearly all data required to accredit  the Aegis modeling and simulation capability, (2) the Evolved Sea  Sparrow Missile Block 2\u2014a key element of Flight III\u2019s self-defense  capabilities\u2014will be tested on DDG Flight llA ships using ACB 16, and (3)  live-fire end-to-end testing of Flight Ill systems\u2014within the bounds of  range safety restrictions\u2014will be completed using a manned ship to  provide data on operational capability.", "Several factors have contributed to the different conclusions reached by  the Navy and DOT&E on the need for, and value of using, a test ship  equipped with the Flight III combat system to meet operational testing  needs. Table 4 explains the key factors that we identified as having  contributed to the different assessments of the need for a test ship.", "Recent actions taken by DOD indicate that the department is moving in  the direction of supporting the use of the unmanned self-defense test  ship.", "First, a December 2014 DOD resource management decision  supporting the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2016 directed the  Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) within the  Office of the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study of test ship  options that would satisfy DDG 51 Flight III self-defense operational  testing, including an assessment of the risks and benefits, cost  estimates for each option, and a recommended course of action.  The study, completed by CAPE in 2015 found that the lowest risk  option was to equip the Navy\u2019s existing USS Paul F. Foster self- defense test ship with Flight III combat systems\u2014at an estimated cost  of about $350 million\u2014to support operational test and evaluation. The  study recommended that the Navy and DOT&E collaborate to develop  an integrated test plan to determine the number of air targets and test  missiles needed to support developmental testing and operational  testing for key Flight III-related self-defense systems.", "Second, following the study of self-defense test ship options, a  February 2016 DOD resource management decision supporting the  President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2017 directed the Navy to adjust  funds within existing resources\u2014$175 million total across fiscal years  2019 through 2021\u2014to procure long-lead items in support of an  Aegis- and SPY-6-equipped self-defense test ship. The Navy\u2019s  subsequent fiscal year 2017 President\u2019s budget submission includes  funding in this amount for equipment associated with the self-defense  test ship starting in 2019.", "Third, as recommended in the 2015 self-defense test ship study, the  Secretary of Defense directed the Navy to work with DOT&E to  develop an integrated test strategy for the Flight III, AMDR, Aegis  Modernization, and Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile Block 2 programs,  and to document that strategy in a test and evaluation master plan or  plans by July 29, 2016.", "Officials from the Navy and DOT&E both questioned whether an  integrated test strategy could be completed as directed based on the  significant differences between the two sides. However, DOT&E officials  stated in April 2016 that the Navy\u2019s integrated warfare systems program  executive office had begun working on an integrated test strategy to  examine the ship\u2019s anti-ship cruise missile self-defense and integrated air  and missile defense capabilities in an effort to meet the intent of the July  2016 deadline.", "Although it appears progress is being made in support of the Secretary\u2019s  direction, the Navy has not yet fully responded to it. If the integrated test  strategy being developed by the Navy does not include the use of an  unmanned self-defense test ship as directed in DOD\u2019s recent resource  management decision, then DOT&E will not approve the Navy\u2019s  operational test plan. If the plan is not approved, a resolution is not likely  to be achieved until fiscal year 2019 when the Navy would need to begin  buying SPY-6 and Aegis-related long-lead items for the unmanned self- defense test ship to maintain its plan for Flight III initial operational test  and evaluation and initial operational capability in 2023."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Complex Flight III Design May Pose Challenges in Maintaining Planned Ship Construction Schedule", "paragraphs": ["Integrating the SPY-6 radar with the DDG 51 hull form will require  significant changes to the existing ship\u2019s hull, mechanical, and electrical  systems.

In particular, the positioning of the SPY-6 radar arrays high on the  deckhouse has a significant impact on the ship\u2019s estimated weight and  center of gravity. As part of the preliminary design, the Navy introduced  plans to widen the ship\u2019s stern by up to 4 feet on each side, allowing the  ship to carry more weight to accommodate SPY-6 and restore available  weight service life allowance.

Table 9 shows the degree to which the Navy is  completing the fundamental activities for the Flight III upgrade that are  required for new programs at Milestone B.", "Further, while the Navy held a Milestone B-like review for Flight III and is  going to establish a new acquisition program baseline, Flight III is not a  distinct acquisition program or major subprogram, which has implications  for reporting requirements related to cost and schedule performance. In  particular, since the Flight III upgrade is part of the existing DDG 51  program, certain oversight mechanisms that are generally set in motion  after passing through Milestone B\u2014such as reporting Nunn-McCurdy  breaches of unit cost growth thresholds and periodic reporting of the  program\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance progress\u2014do not apply to  Flight III separately from the overall program. Flight III performance  measures do not have to be broken out for the DDG 51 program Selected  Acquisition Report\u2014a report submitted by DOD that provides Congress  with information that is used to perform oversight functions\u2014which  diminishes transparency and encumbers oversight efforts. For example,  the DDG 51 program\u2019s December 2015 Selected Acquisition Report did  not include schedule estimates for any Flight III events with the SPY-6  radar. Additionally, the average procurement unit cost of approximately  $1.19 billion per DDG 51 ship reported in 2015 is significantly less than  the average procurement unit cost currently anticipated for Flight III ships  because it represents the unit cost for DDG 51 ships as a whole. Without  distinct Flight III information, decision makers will not be able to  distinguish cost growth associated with the overall DDG 51 program  baseline from Flight III cost growth, which may limit the effectiveness of  oversight mechanisms, such as Nunn-McCurdy unit cost thresholds.  Further, since the Navy is not reporting key events for Flight III as part of  the overall DDG 51 program, Congress and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense will not be made aware of any changes to Flight III\u2019s schedule  via this standard reporting mechanism for acquisition programs.", "USD (AT&L) has the authority to designate major subprograms within  major defense acquisition programs, like the DDG 51 program. DOD\u2019s  guidance states that establishing a major subprogram may be advisable  when increments or blocks of capability are acquired in a sequential  manner. In the case of the DDG 51 program, designating the Flight III  upgrade as a major subprogram would allow for oversight of the upgrade  separate from the overall DDG 51 program. For example, Nunn-McCurdy  breaches could be tracked and reported separately. Treating the upgrade  as a major subprogram would also offer the ability to separately baseline  and track cost (including unit cost), schedule, and performance for Flight  III within the overall DDG 51 Selected Acquisition Report.

The first three Flight III ships will not include all of the Navy\u2019s planned  capabilities, and full capability for a Flight III ship is expected in 2027. The  incremental approach is tied to the delivery of X-band radar and Aegis  combat system capabilities. For the X-band radar, the Navy changed its  original Flight III plans. Specifically, the Navy intended to develop two  new radars\u2014an X-band and an S-band\u2014under the AMDR program to  support Flight III ships. However, in 2012 the Navy altered its plans, with  the AMDR program reduced to a new S-band radar development effort  that would be paired with the existing SPQ-9B X-band radar for the first  12 Flight III ships. This decision helped reduce the risk associated with  conducting parallel radar development efforts, but also delayed the  timeline for the improved X-band capability planned for Flight III until the  13th ship, anticipated to be delivered in 2027.

MAMDJF  stated that a large radar was needed on a surface combatant to counter  the most stressing ballistic and cruise missile threats expected in the  2024 to 2030 time frame. In 2009, the Navy\u2019s Radar/Hull Study looked at  ways to leverage existing Navy destroyer designs to address less  stressing threats in the near-term at less cost.

Navy officials affirmed that the SPY-6 radar, if already  available to the fleet, would help combat current threats. Navy officials  also agreed that the threats identified in the 2007 Analysis of Alternatives  remain valid. The actual threat environment when the first Flight III ships  are delivered is more likely to reflect the threats outlined in the MAMDJF  Analysis of Alternatives, as opposed to the less stressful threats outlined  in the Radar/Hull Study. As shown in figure 10, the time frame for the  threat environment assumed by the Radar/Hull Study will have passed by  the time the lead Flight III ship is delivered to the fleet; at that point, the  more stressing threat environment outlined in the MAMDJF Analysis of  Alternatives timeframe will be imminent. Under the Navy\u2019s acquisition  approach, six of the Flight III ships planned for the fiscal year 2018-2022  multiyear procurement, and over three-fourths of the 22 total planned  ships, will be outpaced by the threat environment identified in the  MAMDJF Analysis of Alternatives.", "To account for the gap between the anticipated radar capability need and  what SPY-6 can provide, the Navy may consider other maritime platforms  that can accommodate a larger-scale version of SPY-6 or the use of  radars on multiple ships. For example, as we found in 2012, the Navy  altered its concept on the number of ships that will be operating in an  IAMD environment in an effort to address the gap that exists between the  2007 Analysis of Alternatives\u2019 stated need and the expected SPY-6  capability. Specifically, rather than one or a small number of ships  conducting IAMD alone and independently managing the most taxing  threat environments without support, the Navy has envisioned multiple  ships that can operate in concert with different ground- and space-based  sensor assets to provide cueing for SPY-6 when targets are in the  battlespace. The cueing would mean that the ship could be told by the off- board sensors where to look for a target, allowing for earlier detection and  increased size of the area that can be covered.

Weight and  center of gravity service life allowance limitations, in particular, affected  the Navy\u2019s decisions about Flight III capabilities from the outset.  Specifically, the SPY-6 radar was sized to provide the largest radar  feasible for the Flight III configuration without requiring major structural  changes to the hull form and design. A larger ship could have taken  advantage of the scalability of the SPY-6 radar by installing a larger radar  that would provide the Navy with increased capability. Thus, for any future  capability upgrades to Flight III related to the radar or other systems, the  Navy will have to consider significant changes to the DDG 51 hull form.  Navy officials stated that adding a new section (called a plug) to the  middle of the existing hull form is one option by which the Navy could  achieve the additional square footage necessary to accommodate a  larger radar. However, the Navy has never executed a plug for a  complex, large surface combatant ship and the associated design effort  would likely be complicated and costly.", "The Navy\u2019s weight estimate for Flight III ships has remained relatively  stable throughout design, with an overall weight growth of 159 tons since  2012. Navy officials acknowledged that the addition of the SPY-6 radar  consumed a significant amount of the ship\u2019s vertical center of gravity  service life allowance. Navy weight and vertical center of gravity  allowances enable future changes to the ships, such as adding  equipment, and reasonable growth during the ship\u2019s service life without  unacceptable impacts on the ship. Ten percent of weight and a 1-foot  vertical center of gravity are the Naval Sea Systems Command\u2019s  architecture standards for surface combatants. According to program  officials, the Navy accepts that Flight III will have less of an available  service life allowance margin because DDG 51-class ships are inherently  dense by design. As figure 11 shows, according to Navy estimates, Flight  III ships will essentially be right at the service life allowance standard for  weight and well below the vertical center of gravity standard, even with  the planned service life allowance improvements included as part of Flight  III design.", "According to Navy requirements officers, Flight III\u2019s upgrade potential will  require trade-offs with the currently planned systems and the Navy has  already identified several other Flight III capability limitations as a result of  DDG 51\u2019s hull size. For example, the Navy is unsure how the addition of  the future X-band radar would impact the Flight III ship\u2019s center of gravity.  In 2012, a Navy technical study on Flight III found that the addition of a  new X-band radar would most likely require additional electric and cooling  capacity beyond what is being introduced as part of Flight III  configuration, which would necessitate the addition of another generator  and air conditioning plant and subsequent equipment arrangement  challenges. Navy officials stated that based on their improved  understanding of Flight III design, they now expect that there may be  enough electric capacity to forgo the need for an additional generator.  Similarly, the Navy is planning to begin a study to determine if an  upgraded electronic warfare system\u2014 included in the initial Flight III  concept\u2014can be included within the ship\u2019s existing constraints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flight III\u2019s Ability to Fulfill Some Cruiser Responsibilities Is Being Considered as Navy Begins Planning for New Surface Combatant", "paragraphs": ["With the pending retirement of the CG 47 Ticonderoga-class of cruisers  and no new cruiser currently being developed, the Navy has expressed  concern about a destroyer supporting the Navy commander\u2019s role in  providing air and missile defense for a carrier strike group.

While  destroyers and cruisers both utilize the Aegis combat system and can  accommodate AWC staff, the Navy has noted that the cruisers were built  to support an AWC and are the most capable ships for fulfilling this role.  Further, the Navy found through analysis of a Flight III technical feasibility  study that the Flight III design does not have an increased capacity to  readily enable the functionality required by a major warfare commander.  A former Commander of Naval Surface Forces identified some notable  differences for meeting AWC responsibilities on the different ships,  including:", "The cruisers are commanded by a captain and have a more senior  staff on the ship, with more individuals dedicated to the planning and  execution of the air defense mission for the carrier strike group. By  contrast, the destroyers are commanded by a commander with a less  experienced, though capable, staff that will typically operate in a  support role. If the AWC role were to transition permanently to the  destroyers, additional training and expertise would be required for the  staff. In the second year of its analysis of DDG 51 Flight III technical  feasibility, the Navy estimated that for the AWC role to be executed on  a Flight III, personnel would need to be increased to fill 15-18  additional positions. The total amount needed is dependent on  ballistic missile defense capability requirements.", "Unlike destroyers, the cruisers have radar array and transmitter  redundancies that help avoid losing radar capability if the ship is  damaged in combat. The cruisers also have a greater capacity\u2014 about 25 percent more than a Flight IIA\u2014for launching surface-to-air  missiles in support of the air defense mission. The cruisers have  increased command-and-control capability over the guided-missile  destroyers.

While the Navy has made some good decisions in  support of DDG 51 Flight III, including taking an incremental approach to  developing and delivering new radar and Aegis combat system  capabilities, several challenges in design, development, integration and  testing of the radar, upgraded combat system, and the ship itself will need  to be overcome going forward. The Navy has implemented a number of  practices to reduce program risk. However, the Navy is still defining  requirements for an upgraded Aegis combat system, which must be  successfully developed, integrated, and tested with the SPY-6 radar  under a relatively compressed schedule that includes increased risk in  order to meet Flight III\u2019s schedule needs. Further, substantial design  changes remain before the Navy will have a sufficient understanding of  the resources required to support ship construction. Nevertheless, the  Navy intends to ask Congress to commit to the initial ships and the  succeeding multiyear procurement beginning in fiscal year 2018 with  limited design and cost information in hand. This approach portends risk  in the future, which amplifies the need for improved oversight  mechanisms to facilitate greater transparency of the cost, schedule, and  performance for Flight III.", "The considerable cost of the Flight III, AMDR, and Aegis programs, as  well as the challenges the Navy faces in working to effectively  synchronize their schedules, emphasizes the need to ensure a  knowledge-based contracting approach and adequate program oversight.  Many unknowns remain with regards to cost and the design of Flight III. In  particular, the Navy\u2019s plan to issue the lead Flight III ship construction  modifications with limited design knowledge puts the government at  greater risk that the contract modifications may not represent the true cost  to implement the changes during construction. A realistic assessment of  Flight III costs gained through completing more of the ship design prior to  procuring the lead ship would put the government in a better negotiating  position\u2014which is particularly important given that the lead ship is  anticipated to be awarded on a sole source basis. Further, the Navy\u2019s  estimate of $2.35 billion in cost savings that it expects to achieve through  the fiscal year 2013-2017 multiyear procurement has not been updated to  reflect the additional costs to design and construct the Flight IIIs. A more  accurate assessment of the estimated cost savings for this current  multiyear procurement would increase transparency into the expected  cost savings. It would also provide valuable insight into expected savings  for the next planned multiyear procurement of Flight III ships. The timing  of the Navy\u2019s request for authority for the next procurement is also a  matter of concern. The Navy\u2019s plan to request, in February 2017,  multiyear procurement authority for fiscal years 2018-2022, means it  would ask Congress to commit to procuring nearly half of the planned  Flight III ships with an incomplete understanding of cost and, effectively,  no Flight III construction history to support the decision.", "Although the department responded to our 2012 recommendation to  improve program oversight by elevating the program\u2019s milestone decision  authority, Flight III\u2019s status as a new configuration within the existing DDG  51 program, as opposed to its own acquisition program or a major  subprogram, reduces congressional insight into cost and schedule plans  and performance. Greater transparency of Flight III performance against  cost and schedule goals, for example, in standard Selected Acquisition  Reports to Congress on the DDG 51 class, would assist DOD and  Congress in performing their oversight responsibilities. This oversight  continues to be important, as the Navy still has risks to overcome in  achieving the intended capabilities of Flight III ships.

We continue to believe that waiting until  at least fiscal year 2017 to procure the lead Flight III ship would result in  additional time to develop the detail design for Flight III and would in turn  support a more refined understanding of design changes and their  implications on ship construction and costs prior to making significant  contractual commitments. As noted in our report, both shipbuilders  support this delay. Additionally, the Flight III program has yet to finalize its  request for proposal for the lead ship and receive a shipbuilder response,  both of which are required prior to the planned Defense Acquisition Board  review\u2014which was postponed indefinitely earlier this year\u2014and are  needed in order to proceed with the procurement of the lead Flight III  ship. The positive aspects of delaying the lead ship procurement, when  combined with the reality that the department will be challenged to  accomplish all of its requisite activities to procure the first Flight III ship  before the end of fiscal year 2016, support lead ship procurement based  on improved design knowledge in fiscal year 2017.", "Regarding our recommendation on the next planned multiyear  procurement for DDG 51 Flight III ships, the department agrees that the  criteria for seeking multiyear procurement authority must be met but  disagreed that it should refrain from seeking multiyear procurement  authority based on the current state of information available on the Flight  III configuration. As we have emphasized, the Navy is unlikely to meet all  of the criteria for requesting multiyear procurement authority using data  from Flight III\u2014particularly as they relate to cost and design stability\u2014in  time to seek authority to award the Flight III multiyear contracts planned  for fiscal year 2018. Flight III detail design will be nearly a year away from  completion when the President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2018  would need to be submitted for such a procurement. Further, construction  of the first Flight III ship will be about to begin, meaning there will be no  Flight III construction history to inform any estimates of ship costs or the  savings from use of multiyear procurement. We believe the Navy\u2019s Flight  III multiyear procurement strategy lacks sufficient knowledge on design  and cost, and poses significant risk to the government. This includes the  risk of Congress committing to procure nearly half of the planned Flight III  ships without adequate information to support such a decision.", "Finally, while the department agreed that visibility into Flight III cost,  schedule, and performance is important for oversight, and noted planned  activities to provide such visibility, DOD does not plan to designate Flight  III as a major subprogram. Instead, the department intends to continue  reporting on DDG 51-class ships as a single major program in the  Selected Acquisition Reports as it has done through previous Flight  upgrades. DOD stated that the major impediment to implementing our  recommendation is the difficulty in allocating research, development, test,  and evaluation costs for the Aegis weapon system. Although the Flight III  information that the department stated it intends to provide in next fiscal  year\u2019s budget documentation and future Selected Acquisition Reports  may help support oversight activities, we believe that designating Flight III  as a major subprogram would enhance Flight III oversight efforts and is  befitting for an acquisition that is expected to cost more than $50 billion  over the next decade. We acknowledge the challenge noted by the  department regarding the allocation of costs for the Aegis weapon  system. However, the Navy has demonstrated the ability to provide  sufficient Aegis funding information to support reporting on specific Aegis  advanced capability builds that are designated to specific DDG 51 ships.  For example, the fiscal year 2016 President\u2019s budget submission outlines  funding for different builds, including ACB 20 that is being developed for  Flight III. We understand that some elements of Aegis cost may be more  difficult to associate with Flight III because of software components  shared across different baselines of the system. The Navy could  communicate any limitations to the information as part of reporting Aegis  cost information for Flight III.

To understand Flight III cost  considerations, we interviewed CAPE about cost estimation activities for  the program.", "To assess what capabilities Flight III ships are expected to provide and  the extent to which these capabilities fulfill the Navy\u2019s existing and future  surface combatant needs, we compared the Navy\u2019s 2009 Radar/Hull  Study\u2014which was the main tool the Navy used to identify the DDG 51  Flight III as the platform for AMDR\u2014with the Navy\u2019s Maritime Air and  Missile Defense of Joint Forces (MAMDJF) Analysis of Alternatives, a  2007 Navy study related to ballistic missile defense and integrated air and  missile defense. We reviewed the Capability Development Documents for  both DDG 51 Flight III and AMDR and other Navy documentation to  determine the capabilities that the Navy had originally planned to include  as part of the Flight III configuration. We compared these capabilities  against those that are currently expected to be delivered as part of the  first three Flight III ships. We assessed the extent to which Flight III and  AMDR planned capabilities fulfill requirements for surface combatants  based on MAMDJF stated requirements. We also reviewed the potential  for Flight III to fulfill air and missile defense requirements that are  currently the responsibility of the Navy\u2019s cruiser fleet. We examined ship  weight reports and other Navy, DOD, and contractor documentation to  analyze Fight III\u2019s service life allowance and determine the extent to  which future upgrades can be introduced onto the ship. To further  corroborate documentary evidence and gather additional information to  support our review, we met with officials from the office of the Chief of  Naval Operations to discuss the status Navy\u2019s current and any future  studies related to surface combatants and integrated air and missile  defense capabilities. We also met with officials from the PEO Ships, PEO  IWS, and the Joint Staff.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to August 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Michele Mackin, 202-512-4841 or mackinm@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Diana Moldafsky, Assistant Director;  Pedro Almoguera; Laura Greifner; Laura Jezewski; C.
