With 1997 expenditures of about $400 billion\u2014constituting nearly one-fourth of the federal budget\u2014SSA\u2019s programs touch nearly every American family. When SSA became an independent agency in March 1995, it gained a new measure of control over its resources as well as the authority to deal with its management challenges and to help guide the policy debate regarding the future solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds. These challenges are many, and their solutions are complex, in part because they are closely linked to profound changes in our country. The baby boom generation is nearing retirement age, people are living longer, and technology and its applications are changing rapidly. At the same time, the public is expecting better services from government agencies even though resources are constrained.", "Over the past few years, we have commented on the challenges facing SSA several times: as it became an independent agency; after 1 year of independence; and, most recently, while the agency was awaiting a new commissioner. We identified as SSA\u2019s greatest challenges its need to strengthen its research and policy capacity in order to address the solvency issue, address management and oversight problems with its Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, redesign its disability programs and heighten their focus on work, and meet its future workload demands. Now that SSA has been an independent agency for nearly 3 years and has a new commissioner, you asked us to discuss SSA\u2019s progress in addressing these challenges. The information I am providing is based on our previous and ongoing work, much of it performed for these two Subcommittees. (See the list of related GAO products at the end of this statement.) most of its challenges within a meaningful time frame. For example, SSA\u2019s efforts to bolster its research, evaluation, and policy analysis capabilities have a long lead time before useful products will be available. In the meantime, SSA will not be able to fully contribute to the current debate on Social Security reform. In addition, in some areas, SSA\u2019s efforts have also been too limited. Its steps to date, for example, to address deep-seated problems in its SSI program have been piecemeal and have not addressed the root causes of the SSI problems. Given the long-standing nature of the challenges SSA faces and their far-reaching implications for current and future program beneficiaries, the new Commissioner will need to assert strong leadership to spell out the expected changes and marshal the agency\u2019s resources to translate SSA\u2019s plans into timely action."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SSA administers three major federal programs. The Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and the Disability Insurance (DI) programs, together commonly known as \u201cSocial Security,\u201d provide benefits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors. Monthly cash benefits are financed through payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers and self-employed people. The third program, SSI, provides means-tested assistance to needy aged, blind, or disabled people. SSI payments are financed from general tax revenues. In 1997, 50 million beneficiaries\u2014about one of every five individuals in this country\u2014 received benefits from SSA each month. SSA serves the public through a nationwide network that includes 1,300 field offices, 132 hearings offices, and a national toll-free telephone system.", "To administer these programs, SSA must perform certain essential tasks: issue Social Security numbers to individuals; maintain earnings records for individual workers by collecting wage reports from employers, using these records to determine the amount of benefits an applicant may receive; and process benefit claims for all three programs. In addition, SSA must determine beneficiaries\u2019 continuing eligibility, provide hearings and appeals for denied applicants, and disseminate information about its programs.", "The OASI and DI programs are facing significant financial problems as a result of profound demographic changes. As a share of the total U.S. population, the elderly population grew from 7 percent in 1940 to 13 percent in 1996; this share is expected to increase to 20 percent by 2050. As it ages, the baby boom generation will increase the size of the elderly population. However, other demographic trends are at least as important.", "Life expectancy has increased continually since the 1930s, and further increases are expected. Moreover, the fertility rate has declined from 3.6 children per woman in 1960 to around 2 children per woman today and is expected to level off at about 1.9 by 2020. Combined, increasing life expectancy and falling fertility rates mean that fewer workers will be contributing to Social Security for each aged, disabled, dependent, or surviving beneficiary. While 3.3 workers support each Social Security beneficiary today, only 2 workers are expected to be supporting each beneficiary by 2030. In addition, as the population ages, the number of disabled individuals is expected to rise. Beginning in 2012\u201414 years from now\u2014Social Security\u2019s expenditures are expected to exceed its tax income. By 2029, without corrective legislation, the trust funds are expected to be depleted, leaving insufficient funds to pay the current level of OASI and DI benefits.", "These demographic changes will also affect SSA\u2019s workload and approach to customer service. When the baby boom generation begins to retire shortly after the turn of the century, the agency must look for ways to cope efficiently with its increasing workloads without adding substantial numbers of employees. In addition, SSA knows that this new set of beneficiaries will likely prefer to be served differently from those whom SSA has served in the past. While SSA has traditionally delivered face-to-face service through its network of field offices, the public has begun to conduct more and more business by telephone. In the future, even more individuals may prefer to do business by telephone or other electronic means, such as the Internet. As a result, SSA must increasingly rely on the use of new technology to meet its workload challenges and provide service in the ways its new customers will expect. In addition, SSA currently relies heavily on information technology to support its administrative processes, and it has acknowledged that its goals for improved operations outlined in its strategic plan are not achievable unless the agency invests wisely in information technology. how the agency intends to achieve its goals and the measures it will use to hold itself accountable over the next year. The two documents together chart SSA\u2019s future course.", "SSA\u2019s strategic plan and its performance plan demonstrate that the agency recognizes its most pressing problems.

The Advisory Council on Social Security and others have advanced a range of proposals to address the system\u2019s solvency. Some proposals represent a significant departure from the current program. The President has made Social Security reform a top priority, and the Congress is beginning to discuss options. Given the magnitude of the financial problems facing the system, the nature of the proposals for change, and the growing interest in these topics across the country, we can expect the debate over Social Security\u2019s financing and structure to continue and intensify in the coming years. To understand and debate the proposals, policymakers and the general public need thoughtful and detailed analyses of their likely effect on workers, beneficiaries, and the economy\u2014as well as the impact of their implementation on SSA and other government agencies. SSA is in a unique position to inform policymakers and the public about the long-term financing issues, yet we have reported that the agency has not undertaken the range of research, evaluation, and policy analysis needed to fully contribute to the debate.", "In addition to the solvency debate, other issues call for enhanced research, evaluation, and policy analysis. For example, from 1988 to 1996, SSA\u2019s disability programs grew significantly. The number of beneficiaries receiving SSI increased by about 70 percent, while the number of DI beneficiaries grew by about 49 percent. In addition, beneficiaries are staying on the disability rolls longer. To better manage these programs, policymakers need more information on the causes of these changes, whether the programs are meeting their objectives, and the impact of possible changes. By improving its research and evaluation capacity, SSA also would be in a better position to propose legislative changes.", "In its current strategic plan, SSA committed itself to a new goal: \u201cto . . . conduct effective policy development, research, and program evaluation.\u201d The agency is taking steps to strengthen its capacity in these areas. It has increased its funding for external research; plans to expand its ability to use modeling techniques to predict the effects of proposed program changes; and, by the end of this fiscal year, plans to have established a research consortium to advise it on relevant research and policy activities. However, these efforts have a long lead time before useful products will become available. In the meantime, SSA will not be fully contributing to the current debate on Social Security reform. In addition, a recent report by a private consultant recommended that SSA substantially increase the number of its research and evaluation staff and combine the research and evaluation office with the policy analysis office. To date, the agency has added only a fraction of the recommended staff and does not have a long-range plan to add many more.", "SSA\u2019s need to strengthen its research, evaluation, and policy analysis capacity is not new; we and others have highlighted this weakness for a number of years. We are concerned that the agency has not seized the opportunity to build its capacity. Without an adequate number of skilled staff and a vital, responsive research, evaluation, and policy analysis agenda, the agency cannot fulfill its current and future role as the nation\u2019s expert on Social Security issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Standing SSI Problems Require Comprehensive Plan to Ensure Diligent Management and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["living arrangements to determine initial and continuing eligibility for the program.", "Our previous and ongoing reviews have highlighted long-standing problem areas. SSA does not pay enough attention to verifying eligibility information in a timely way, has failed to recover millions of dollars in SSI overpayments, has not installed adequate internal controls, and has failed to curb SSI program fraud and abuse. The program\u2019s complex policies and SSA\u2019s insufficient management attention exacerbate these problems. We have also criticized SSA for not initiating legislative proposals to improve program operations. Together, these deficiencies have eroded program integrity and contributed to significant annual increases in SSI overpayments to recipients. During 1997, current and former recipients owed SSA more than $2.6 billion, including $1 billion in newly detected overpayments for the year. On the basis of the agency\u2019s prior experience, SSA is likely to collect less than 15 percent of the outstanding debt in a given year.", "SSA has acknowledged the need to attack this problem aggressively, and the agency is taking steps to address some of the weaknesses in the SSI program. For example, it is developing a new automated system to track and recover SSI overpayments and is expanding its use of on-line access to state data to obtain real-time applicant and recipient financial information. To address the overpayment problem, the fiscal year 1999 budget requests $50 million to complete redeterminations for recipients who have been designated by SSA as having a high probability of having been overpaid.Finally, SSA has recently taken a stronger role in addressing fraud and abuse. For example, it has initiated several pilot programs aimed at detecting fraud and abuse earlier in the SSI application process. plan, SSA has made a commitment to complete a comprehensive action plan to improve the management of the SSI program in fiscal year 1998. This step links to SSA\u2019s strategic goal of making \u201cSSA programs the best in the business, with zero tolerance for fraud and abuse.\u201d To be effective, the SSI action plan must include a carefully designed set of measures to evaluate progress and hold the agency accountable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Work Needed to Implement New Definition of Childhood Disability Accurately and Consistently", "paragraphs": ["The 1996 welfare reform legislation changed the definition of childhood disability for the SSI program, and in February 1997, SSA issued regulations to implement the legislative changes. Under the new regulations, SSA reviewed the cases of 263,000 children and conducted an extensive review of the outcome of this process. The regulations represent a stricter standard of severity than existed in previous law. Under this standard, a child\u2019s impairment generally must result in marked limitations in two areas of functioning or an extreme limitation in one area, such as social functioning, cognition and communication, personal functioning, and motor functioning. Previously, a child was eligible if his or her impairment resulted in one marked and one moderate limitation or three moderate limitations.", "In supporting the \u201ctwo marked or one extreme\u201d severity standard in its regulatory analysis, SSA concluded that the Congress meant to establish a stricter standard of severity than had previously existed. Nevertheless, some children whose impairments are at the prior, less severe threshold have been awarded benefits because SSA has not updated some of its medical listings, which are set below the two marked or one extreme functional limitation level. SSA has not quantified how many children are in this situation and may have difficulty doing so because its listing codes are not always reliable. Some of these less severe listings, however, are for prevalent impairments, including mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and asthma. SSA is aware that these listings are below the two marked or one extreme level, but has not established a schedule for updating its listings. This update is necessary to ensure that all children are awarded benefits on the basis of a uniform standard of severity. standard. SSA is taking steps to improve decisional accuracy by training its adjudicators and quality assurance staff in areas SSA has found to be problematic.

To manage the disability caseload growth, increase efficiency, and improve service to its customers, SSA began a major effort in 1993 to redesign the way it makes disability decisions. The agency developed an ambitious plan for change that included testing and implementing 26 key initiatives over a period of 6 years.", "In December 1996, we reported that SSA was already one-third of the way through the 6-year period but had made little progress with testing and implementing the initiative. We identified a number of problems: SSA had delayed testing and project development, expanded the scope and complexity of certain initiatives, changed executive leadership, and risked losing stakeholder support. In that report, we recommended that SSA (1) focus on the initiatives most likely to reduce claims-processing time and administrative costs and (2) combine those initiatives in an integrated process and test them at a few sites before full-scale implementation.", "Responding to these concerns and those of other stakeholders, SSA revised its redesign plan in February 1997. It developed a scaled-down plan that focused on testing and implementing eight key initiatives. However, the new strategy retained plans to first test certain initiatives individually at a large number of sites nationwide.", "On the basis of our ongoing work, we have determined that the success of SSA\u2019s scaled-down plan may also be threatened. SSA continues to experience delays in testing or implementing initiatives\u2014anywhere from 2 months to 3 years. More importantly though, test results for the first two initiatives are disappointing. As tested, they will not result in dramatic improvements in efficiency and quality of claims processing. In addition, SSA has encountered performance problems with the software it considers vital to support the redesign effort, and the pilot tests have been delayed. On a more positive note, SSA is also conducting a test that combines a number of the initiatives into an integrated process, and the early results are more promising, according to SSA officials. It is too early to tell whether these positive results will continue and be significant enough to lead to the needed improvement in the claims process. If the results of these efforts do not demonstrate significant improvements, SSA will have some hard choices to make about whether and how to proceed with its current redesign plan. Even before receiving the disappointing test results, SSA had reduced or deferred its projected 5-year savings from disability redesign by more than 25 percent, or more than 4,500 work-years.", "Finally, as we have reported, one redesign initiative\u2014process unification\u2014is the linchpin of SSA\u2019s efforts to improve the integrity and efficiency of the disability claims process.

We have supported SSA\u2019s efforts to improve consistency and have also recommended that SSA develop a performance goal to measure and report its progress in doing so.", "While SSA does not believe such a goal is appropriate and has not included one in its new performance plan, the agency has taken some steps toward reducing the inconsistency between decisions. The agency has (1) provided initial common training to decisionmakers at all levels and developed plans for follow-up training, (2) issued several rulings to clarify and reinforce current policy, and (3) initiated a pilot effort in 10 states to study the effects of providing more detailed explanations of the reasons for decisions at the initial level. By improving these explanations, SSA hopes to give ALJs a better understanding of the basis for the initial decision and to lay the foundation for greater consistency.

Consequently, more than 4 million beneficiaries were due or overdue for CDRs by 1996. As a result of congressional attention to this problem, SSA developed a plan to conduct 8.2 million CDRs between 1996 and 2002, and the Congress authorized funding of about $4.1 billion over 7 years for this purpose.
