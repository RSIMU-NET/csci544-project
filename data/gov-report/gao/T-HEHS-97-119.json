In 1995, Medicare and Medicaid spending for the roughly 6 million dual eligibles totaled an estimated $106 billion, or almost a third of these programs\u2019 expenditures combined. This dually eligible population is expected to grow, resulting in ever greater health financing expenditures and care challenges. In addition, dual eligibles are, by definition, poor, and many are in poor health, with over 20 percent residing in nursing homes. While the very poor and very sick could benefit from a coordinated system of care, at times they can encounter a fragmented and confusing array of services.", "My comments today will focus on three major areas: (1) the health characteristics of those who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid and the key structural differences between the two programs that serve this population, (2) benefit overlaps between these two programs and the associated shifting of care and costs between federal and state levels, and (3) states\u2019 efforts to use managed care to serve this population. Our work is based on our recent products on efforts to reform Medicare posthospital benefit payments and Medicare and Medicaid managed care issues, an analysis of federal data on dually eligible beneficiaries, and other relevant research. (A list of related GAO products appears at the end of this statement.)", "In summary, the dually eligible population consists of people with a range of health needs\u2014from the young to the very old and from the healthy to the disabled or chronically ill in nursing homes. Compared with Medicare-only beneficiaries, however, dually eligible beneficiaries are more likely to have poorer health status and require costly care, including long-term care. Meeting their needs under two programs that are administered under different rules complicates matters in both fee-for-service and managed care environments. The potential to cover posthospital and long-term care benefits under either program has resulted in costs being shifted between programs. Because the federal government pays the full cost of Medicare and shares the cost of Medicaid with the states, the greater financial burden generally falls on the federal government.", "To better coordinate acute and long-term care needs while holding down costs, some states are assessing the potential for enrolling their dually eligible populations in a single managed care plan. However, differences in Medicare and Medicaid requirements for commercial managed care participation can create barriers to this approach. Because these barriers are largely related to certain statutory beneficiary guarantees, including beneficiaries\u2019 freedom to choose their own provider, granting waivers from federal requirements to states that are designing comprehensive managed care programs remains a delicate issue.", "The implications of managing the costs of care for this population are significant at both the federal and state levels. The issue is important to the federal government because it pays for Medicare as well as for over half of Medicaid\u2019s costs. It is also important to state governments, because they have little control over federal decisions\u2014such as the imposition of new Medicare cost-sharing requirements\u2014that make their budgets vulnerable to unplanned fiscal liabilities. As states pursue greater flexibility to design more efficient and effective service delivery programs for this population through waivers of certain beneficiary protections guaranteed by federal statute, federal and state governments\u2019 rigorous oversight of care delivery remains essential."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Poor Health Status, Program Differences Pose Challenges in Serving Dually Eligible Population", "paragraphs": ["In concept, Medicare and Medicaid provide essential and complementary services to dually eligible beneficiaries. Medicare is the primary provider of hospital, posthospital, and physician care, while Medicaid provides benefits beyond those covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs and long-term care. In practice, however, Medicare and Medicaid\u2019s respective roles do not sort this out neatly, and the health financing needs of the dually eligible population surface numerous contradictions and policy conundrums when attempts are made to mesh the two programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Poor Health Status Characterizes the Condition of Many of the Dually Eligible", "paragraphs": ["Dual eligibles are among the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries. Within this population, however, individuals\u2019 health needs and associated medical costs can vary substantially. Although some individuals incur few or no costs beyond those of the general population, many have substantially greater health care needs and fewer personal resources to meet those needs than the average Medicare beneficiary. By definition, dual eligibles are poor: about 20 percent have annual income of less than $5,000 a year; 80 percent have annual income of less than $10,000.", "Compared with Medicare-only beneficiaries, dually eligible beneficiaries are more likely to live in a nursing home or live alone; have a serious and chronic condition, and physical or cognitive have less access to a regular source of care and preventive services, and higher use of emergency room care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare and Medicaid Display Key Structural Differences", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). It covers almost all Americans 65 years old and older and certain individuals under 65 who are disabled or have chronic kidney disease. The program provides protection with an acute care focus under two parts. Part A covers inpatient hospital services, posthospital care in skilled nursing facilities (SNF), and care in patients\u2019 homes. Part B covers primarily physician and other outpatient services. In fiscal year 1996, Medicare covered an estimated 38 million beneficiaries at a cost of $197 billion.", "Medicaid is a health insurance program financed and administered by both the federal government and the states. Its beneficiaries include poor children and their parents as well as low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals. In addition to covering primary and acute care, Medicaid covers outpatient prescription drugs and long-term care both in the home and in nursing facilities.", "Medicaid, however, is not 1, but over 50 separate programs. Although federal law mandates coverage of certain medical services and population groups, it also permits states to choose whether to cover additional services or low-income population groups. Thus, under Medicaid, the populations served and benefits provided vary across states. The percentage of Medicaid expenditures covered by the federal government also varies by state, depending on the state\u2019s per capita income, with a range from 50 to 83 percent. In 1996, the federal government paid 57 percent of the aggregate Medicaid costs of about $160 billion, which provided health care coverage for about 37 million beneficiaries.", "Both programs have traditionally reimbursed providers through fee-for-service arrangements, but both have been developing managed care components in which beneficiaries obtain care from prepaid health plans. Managed care plans in both programs cover beneficiaries under terms that are different from those under fee-for-service arrangements. For example, managed care organizations are paid a fixed monthly amount for each enrollee to provide or arrange for medical services, which are typically coordinated through a primary care physician. In addition, Medicaid managed care programs differ among states. To implement these programs, states typically seek approval from HCFA to waive certain federal requirements. Named after sections of the Social Security Act that authorize the waivers, 1915(b) program waivers and 1115 demonstration waivers permit states to conduct managed care programs and experiment with plan participation and eligibility rules that would otherwise be prohibited by law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dual Eligibles Qualify for Medicare and Various Levels of Medicaid Support", "paragraphs": ["Dually eligible individuals are Medicare beneficiaries first. According to the level of support provided by Medicaid, the dually eligible population is divided into two major groups: (1) those receiving Medicare cost-sharing support and additional Medicaid health care benefits (\u201cfull-benefit\u201d individuals) and (2) those receiving help from Medicaid only to cover out-of-pocket costs after payment by Medicare. Collectively, both groups of dually eligible beneficiaries represent about 16 percent of the Medicare population but 30 percent of Medicare expenditures. Similarly, they account for about 17 percent of the Medicaid population but 35 percent of Medicaid expenditures.", "States vary dramatically in the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries also enrolled in their Medicaid programs. According to one source, in 1993, two states\u2019 Medicaid programs covered more than 20 percent of their Medicare beneficiary populations, whereas eight states\u2019 Medicaid programs covered fewer than 7 percent of their states\u2019 Medicare beneficiaries.

The first consists of Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries\u2014called QMBs. These people have incomes or assets that exceed the thresholds set for full-benefit eligibility but have incomes that are nevertheless at or below the federal poverty level. Medicaid pays these beneficiaries\u2019 Medicare monthly part B premiums and all copayments and deductibles required under Medicare. The second subgroup consists of Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries\u2014called SLMBs. These people have incomes slightly above the federal poverty level; Medicaid pays their Medicare premiums but not copayments or deductibles.", "The Congress enacted the QMB and SLMB programs in 1988 and 1990, respectively, out of concern for the financial hardship that Medicare cost-sharing requirements could pose for low-income people not eligible for Medicaid. As we reported in 1994 and others have stated more recently, since the programs were implemented, many individuals eligible for Medicaid\u2019s cost-sharing support have not taken advantage of it. In 1995, an estimated 37 percent of people eligible for the QMB program were not enrolled, and an estimated 90 percent of people eligible for the SLMB program were not enrolled."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefit Overlaps Foster Shifting of Fee-for-Service Costs Between Programs", "paragraphs": ["Both Medicare and Medicaid devote substantial resources to providing care to the dually eligible population.

The net burden is likely to fall more heavily on the federal government, as the payer for all Medicare and more than half of Medicaid expenditures.", "Dual eligibles can obtain similar services from both Medicare and Medicaid, especially home health and nursing facility care. Since 1989, when coverage guidelines were liberalized in response to court decisions, the home health care benefit has been essentially transformed from one focused on patients needing short-term care after hospitalization to one that serves chronic, long-term care patients as well. Between 1989 and 1996, Medicare\u2019s part A home health care payments rose sevenfold, from $2.4 billion to $17.7 billion. As we testified before congressional committees earlier this year, not only has the number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health care increased dramatically, but so has the intensity of visits for each beneficiary. reduce its costs by capitalizing on the movement of Medicare\u2019s home health benefit from a post-acute focus to include long-term care benefits.", "Alternatively, when Medicare\u2019s SNF coverage criteria for daily skilled care are applied more stringently, Medicare\u2019s coverage of a dually eligible patient\u2019s SNF stay may end earlier and Medicaid becomes the primary payer.

On the one hand, managed care, in principle, offers the potential for a single system of coordinated care to serve a population particularly likely to benefit from such a system. On the other hand, managed care plans\u2014both in Medicare and Medicaid\u2014have little experience serving a population with expensive medical and extensive long-term care needs. In addition, each of the respective programs has different terms for beneficiary and plan participation. Thus, as states consider enrolling dual eligibles in their managed care programs, they face certain barriers that require federal and state cooperation to overcome.

But dually eligible beneficiaries who exercise their Medicare right to leave the plan during the Medicaid lock-in period may expose the state to the cost-sharing obligations incurred with a fee-for-service or Medicare managed care provider and preclude the Medicaid plan\u2019s potential to organize a system of coordinated services. In addition, states may have existing contractual relationships with Medicaid managed care organizations that could serve the states\u2019 dual eligibles, but their public program membership exceeds the 50-percent threshold needed to comply with Medicare\u2019s rules for plans eligible to serve Medicare beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary Protection in Managed Care More Critical for Dually Eligible Population", "paragraphs": ["With its focus on coordinated care, managed care provides states an option for moving their dually eligible population into a single plan providing all or most required services.

However, if Medicare premiums and cost sharing are increased, these costs will consequently rise for the states, as payers of the dually eligibles\u2019 financial obligations under Medicare.", "Finally, states are likely to continue seeking flexibility under HCFA\u2019s waiver approval process to overcome existing barriers to dual eligibles\u2019 enrollment in managed care.
