Projections from GAO's analysis of 2010 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data show that most HCTC participants in 2014 will likely be eligible for less generous tax credits under PPACA than the HCTC. Specifically, about 69 percent of HCTC participants will likely be ineligible for either a PPACA premium tax credit or Medicaid, or they will likely receive a PPACA premium tax credit less generous than the HCTC. On the other hand, GAO's analysis also found that at least 23 percent will likely be eligible for PPACA premium tax credits more generous than the HCTC. In addition to the PPACA premium tax credit, up to 28 percent of all HCTC participants will likely be eligible for PPACA cost-sharing subsidies--subsidies that will help them pay for deductibles and copays--depending in part on whether or not their state expands Medicaid under PPACA. For HCTC nonparticipants, the projections from GAO's analysis of 2010 IRS data show that as many as 30 percent may be eligible for either Medicaid or a PPACA premium tax credit more generous than the HCTC in 2014, depending in part on whether or not their state expands Medicaid and whether they meet all other eligibility criteria for the PPACA premium tax credits.", "In general, the health plan coverage that will be available through the PPACA exchanges will be comparable to coverage in HCTC participants' current plans; however, HCTC participants may have an incentive to choose plans through the exchanges that have different levels of coverage than their HCTC plans. Plans purchased through the PPACA exchanges will be required to provide essential health benefits--including coverage for specific service categories, such as ambulatory care, prescription drugs, and hospitalization--and most HCTC plans cover these categories of services. In addition, the vast majority of HCTC plans in 2012 likely had actuarial values--the expected percentage of costs that a plan will incur for services provided to a standard population--above the minimum actuarial value of 60 percent that health plans sold through the PPACA exchanges will be required to meet. However, because the PPACA premium tax credit amount will be based on a plan with an actuarial value of 70 percent, HCTC participants who currently have plans with either higher or lower actuarial values and are eligible for PPACA premium tax credits may have an incentive to choose plans that will have different levels of coverage than their HCTC plans. For example, those who have HCTC plans with actuarial values that are higher than 70 percent may have an incentive to shift to health plans with an actuarial value of 70 percent to avoid paying any difference in premiums that could result from choosing plans with higher actuarial values. Similarly, those who now have plans with actuarial values below 70 percent could have the opposite incentive and may purchase plans that offer a higher level of coverage than their current HCTC plans.", "We provided draft copies of this report to the Department of Health and Human Services and IRS for review, and both provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The health coverage tax credit (HCTC) pays a share of health plan  premiums for certain workers who lost their jobs because of foreign  import competition and who are eligible for benefits in the Trade  Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program and for certain retirees age 55 and  over whose pensions from a former employer were terminated and are  now paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

For the  PPACA premium tax credit and the cost-sharing subsidies, we made  projections assuming that HCTC participants would meet many of the key  eligibility criteria\u2014namely that they would not be eligible for Medicare or  Medicaid and would not be enrolled in health plans in which employers  paid for the majority of the premium amounts. Using these data, we  determined whether each HCTC participant would be eligible for a  PPACA premium tax credit on the basis of their household income and,  if eligible, estimated the amount of that PPACA premium tax credit. We  compared the estimated PPACA premium tax credit amounts to the  estimated HCTC amounts for each participant. We also calculated the  percentage of income in 2010 that HCTC participants paid for their share  of premiums after the HCTC was applied, and compared these amounts  to the estimated percentage of their income they will likely pay for  premiums with the PPACA premium tax credit assuming their incomes  would remain constant. We also used these data to estimate the  percentage of HCTC participants who will likely be eligible for PPACA  cost-sharing subsidies and the number and percentage of participants  who will likely be eligible for Medicaid, depending in part on whether or  not their state expands Medicaid. We excluded from our analyses any  participants and nonparticipants aged 65 or older at any point in 2010  because they would have likely been eligible for Medicare and therefore  ineligible for either the HCTC, a PPACA premium tax credit, or PPACA  cost-sharing subsidies. We conducted the same analyses for HCTC  nonparticipants as we did for the HCTC participants using 2010 IRS  data. However, we did not make the same assumption that most  nonparticipants would meet many of the key eligibility criteria for the  PPACA premium tax credit or cost-sharing subsidies because we could  not determine why these individuals did not participate in the HCTC. For  example, nonparticipants may have been enrolled in health plans paid for  by an employer, which would make them ineligible for a PPACA premium  tax credit or cost-sharing subsidy. In light of this, our ability to draw  conclusions based on our analysis of the data on HCTC nonparticipants  was more limited than it was for HCTC participants. We also reviewed  regulations, guidance, and selected literature on the PPACA premium tax  credit and cost-sharing subsidies. To determine the reliability of IRS\u2019s  2010 HCTC program data and individual tax filer data, we reviewed  relevant documentation, conducted interviews with IRS officials  knowledgeable about the data, and conducted electronic testing of the  data to identify obvious errors or outliers. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report.", "To determine how the coverage that will be available through the PPACA  exchanges compares to the qualified health plans for HCTC participants  for each HCTC plan type\u2014COBRA, HCTC state-qualified, VEBA, and  individual market\u2014we compared the services that plans purchased  through the PPACA exchanges will cover, and actuarial values that plans  will be offered at through the exchanges, to the services and actuarial  values of HCTC-qualified plans. Since COBRA plans are an extension of  employer-sponsored health plans, we based our comparison on existing  data on the services covered by, and the actuarial values of, employer- sponsored health plans. For HCTC state-qualified plans, we used 2011  IRS HCTC program data to select a nongeneralizable sample of four  states to compare the services covered by the plans that will likely be  available through the PPACA exchanges in those states, and the  actuarial values at which plans will be offered through the exchanges, to  the services covered by and the actuarial values of, selected HCTC state- qualified plans. The four states selected\u2014California, Michigan, North  Carolina, and Ohio\u2014were among the states with the largest number in  2011 of both individuals potentially eligible for the HCTC and HCTC  monthly participants; were geographically varied; and offered different  types of HCTC state-qualified plans. In each state we identified the  state\u2019s likely EHB benchmark plan and the HCTC state-qualified plan with  the largest enrollment for our comparison. In California and Michigan we  used the benchmark plans that those states selected, and in the other two  states we used the largest small group health plan in each state as the  potential exchange benchmark plan because HHS has proposed this as  the default exchange benchmark if the state does not choose a  benchmark plan. In certain states, choosing an existing small group  health plan as a benchmark may lead to lower costs for the state than if it  chose a different plan. In the four states, we reviewed health plan  documents and interviewed health plan officials from the four potential  exchange benchmark plans and the four selected HCTC state-qualified  plans. For VEBA plans, we analyzed the HCTC data from the selected  states to identify the VEBA plan that had the largest number of HCTC  participants. We reviewed health plan documents and interviewed health  plan officials for the selected VEBA plan and compared the services  covered by the potential exchange benchmark for the state that contained  the majority of the VEBA plan\u2019s HCTC enrollees to the services covered  by the VEBA plan. We also compared the actuarial values at which plans  will be offered through the exchanges to the actuarial value of the VEBA  plan. For individual market plans, we used available data on this type of  plan to compare the services covered by, and the actuarial value of,  plans purchased through the PPACA exchanges to individual market  plans. We also reviewed regulations and guidance on EHB, actuarial  value, and other insurance market reforms that may affect premiums and  cost-sharing in 2014.

The actuarial values of the four HCTC state- qualified plans and the one VEBA plan that we reviewed in the selected  states vary. However, all of the plans have an actuarial value of at least  60 percent (bronze) and three of the five plans have an actuarial value of  80 percent (gold) or higher. See table 5.", "Individual market plans (1 percent of HCTC participants). The small  number of HCTC participants that have individual market plans are likely  to have a plan with a lower level of actuarial value. A recent study found  that about half of the plans (51 percent) in the individual market have an  actuarial value of less than 60 percent and another third (33 percent)  have an actuarial value at the 60 percent (bronze) level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain PPACA Provisions May Incentivize HCTC Participants to Change Their Level of Coverage in 2014", "paragraphs": ["The varied actuarial values of the HCTC plans suggest that the level of  coverage for many HCTC participants may change after the expiration of  the HCTC depending on the options available to participants and the  choices they make in 2014 under PPACA. Also, the way that the PPACA  tax credits will be calculated may incentivize HCTC participants to change  their level of coverage. The PPACA premium tax credits will be  calculated from a reference plan at the 70 percent (silver) level of  coverage, so individuals who choose other plans\u2014with either higher or  lower levels of actuarial value\u2014could face higher or lower out-of-pocket  costs for premiums. However, plans with higher levels of actuarial value  may result in lower out-of-pocket costs for copays and deductibles, and  plans with lower levels of actuarial value may result in higher out-of- pocket costs for copays and deductibles. Ultimately, for any HCTC  participant, the overall financial effect of a change from an HCTC plan to  a PPACA exchange plan will be the net effect of the choice between  higher or lower premium costs and higher or lower cost-sharing.  Further, out-of-pocket costs for premiums and cost-sharing for HCTC  participants will be affected by whether they are eligible for the PPACA  premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. Considering these  factors, current HCTC participants may choose to change their level of  coverage when the HCTC expires. For example:", "Some HCTC participants eligible for PPACA premium tax credits  could have an incentive to change to a higher level of coverage.  For example, if the HCTC participants who have coverage at the   60 percent (bronze) level of coverage are eligible for PPACA premium  tax credits, they may choose a PPACA exchange plan that has a  higher actuarial value than their current HCTC plan. This is because  PPACA premium tax credit amounts will be calculated on the basis of  the reference plan premium (the second-lowest-cost 70 percent   plan) for their exchange. Given this, it could be possible for  these HCTC participants to purchase a 70 percent (silver) plan that  would have on average lower out-of-pocket cost-sharing expenses  than their current HCTC plan.", "Alternatively, some HCTC participants who will be eligible for  PPACA premium tax credits could have an incentive to change to  a lower level of coverage. For example, if the HCTC participants  who have coverage at the 80 percent (gold) or 90 percent (platinum)  levels of coverage are eligible for a PPACA premium tax credit and  want to purchase a plan through a PPACA exchange with a  comparable actuarial value, they will have to pay the difference  between the premium for a plan with an actuarial value of 80 percent  (gold) or 90 percent (platinum) and their PPACA premium tax credit.  Again, this is because the PPACA premium tax credit amount will be  based on the reference plan premium (the second-lowest-cost   70 percent  plan) for their exchange. For example, if a  participant in a family of four with a household income at 300 percent  of the FPL purchases a plan in a PPACA exchange with an annual  reference (silver) plan premium for a family of four of $10,000, he or  she would receive a PPACA premium tax credit of $3,716 and would  have to pay $6,284 for the premium if he or she purchased the  reference plan. However, if the participant instead decided to  purchase a plan with an actuarial value of 80 percent (gold) having an  annual premium of $11,000, the PPACA premium tax credit would  remain the same ($3,716) but the premium amount the participant  would have to pay would increase by $1,000 to $7,284. Because  participants would have to pay this difference in premiums, they may  opt to purchase a plan with a lower level of actuarial value than their  current plan, such as a plan at the 70 percent level of coverage  (silver), even though it may have higher out-of-pocket cost-sharing  expenses on average than their current plan. In contrast, HCTC  participants may also have an incentive to choose a plan below the 70  percent (silver) level if obtaining the lowest possible premium is their  main factor in choosing a health plan. In this case, participants could  choose a plan at the 60 percent (bronze) level of coverage because  the premium cost would likely be lower than choosing a   70 percent (silver) level plan. However, a plan at this level would  mean that on average participants could have higher out-of-pocket  cost-sharing expenses than they would with a 70 percent (silver) plan.", "The health plan coverage options for HCTC participants not  eligible for a PPACA premium tax credit will vary depending on  their household income level. The HCTC participants\u2019 not eligible  for PPACA premium tax credits because their incomes are above   400 percent of the FPL could decide to purchase a health plan at any  level of coverage. However, the loss of the HCTC combined with their  ineligibility for PPACA premium tax credits because of their higher  incomes could affect the level of coverage that they choose or even  whether they purchase a health plan through a PPACA exchange or  elsewhere. The HCTC participants who have household incomes  below 138 percent of the FPL and live in states that expand Medicaid  will not be eligible for PPACA premium tax credits; instead they will be  eligible for Medicaid. However, in states that do not expand Medicaid,  it is uncertain what health plan, if any, that HCTC participants who  have household incomes below 100 percent of the FPL may purchase  in 2014. These individuals would not be eligible for PPACA premium  tax credit in any instance or Medicaid in most instances, and their  ability to pay for premiums will be limited. However, because of their  low incomes, these HCTC participants will likely be exempt from  certain PPACA provisions, such as the tax penalty that individuals will  have to pay beginning in 2014 if they do not have a health plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to HHS and IRS for review, and  both provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
