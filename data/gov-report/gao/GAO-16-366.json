When Medicare denies or reduces payment for a claim or a portion of a claim, providers, beneficiaries, and others may appeal these decisions through Medicare's appeals process.", "In recent years there have been increases in the number of filed and backlogged appeals (i.e., pending appeals that remain undecided after statutory time frames). GAO was asked to examine Levels 1 through 4 of Medicare's appeals process. This report examines (1) trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, (2) data HHS uses to monitor the appeals process, and (3) HHS efforts to reduce the number of appeals filed and backlogged. GAO analyzed data from the three data systems used to monitor appeals, reviewed relevant HHS agency documentation and policies, federal internal control standards, and interviewed HHS agency officials and others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The appeals process for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims consists of four administrative levels of review within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and a fifth level in which appeals are reviewed by federal courts. Appeals are generally reviewed by each level sequentially, as appellants may appeal a decision to the next level depending on the prior outcome. Under the administrative process, separate appeals bodies review appeals and issue decisions under time limits established by law, which can vary by level. From fiscal years 2010 and 2014, the total number of filed appeals at Levels 1 through 4 of Medicare's FFS appeals process increased significantly but varied by level. Level 3 experienced the largest rate of increase in appeals\u2014from 41,733 to 432,534 appeals (936 percent)\u2014during this period. A significant portion of the increase was driven by appeals of hospital and other inpatient stays, which increased from 12,938 to 275,791 appeals (over 2,000 percent) at Level 3. HHS attributed the growth in appeals to its increased program integrity efforts and a greater propensity of providers to appeal claims, among other things. GAO also found that the number of appeal decisions issued after statutory time frames generally increased during this time, with the largest increase in and largest proportion of late decisions occurring at appeal Levels 3 and 4. For example, in fiscal year 2014, 96 percent of Level 3 decisions were issued after the general 90-day statutory time frame for Level 3.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and two other components within HHS that are part of the Medicare appeals process use data collected in three appeal data systems\u2014such as the date when the appeal was filed, the type of service or claim appealed, and the length of time taken to issue appeal decisions\u2014to monitor the Medicare appeals process. However, these systems do not collect other data that HHS agencies could use to monitor important appeal trends, such as information related to the reasons for Level 3 decisions and the actual amount of Medicare reimbursement at issue. GAO also found variation in how appeals bodies record decisions across the three systems, including the use of different categories to track the type of Medicare service at issue in the appeal. Absent more complete and consistent appeals data, HHS's ability to monitor emerging trends in appeals is limited and is inconsistent with federal internal control standards that require agencies to run and control agency operations using relevant, reliable, and timely information.", "HHS agencies have taken several actions aimed at reducing the total number of Medicare appeals filed and the current appeals backlog. For example, in 2014, CMS agreed to pay a portion of the payable amount for certain denied hospital claims on the condition that pending appeals associated with those claims were withdrawn and rights to future appeals of them waived. However, despite this and other actions taken by HHS agencies, the Medicare appeals backlog continues to grow at a rate that outpaces the adjudication process and will likely persist. Further, HHS efforts do not address inefficiencies regarding the way appeals of certain repetitious claims\u2014such as claims for monthly oxygen equipment rentals\u2014are adjudicated, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards. Under the current process, if the initial claim is reversed in favor of the appellant, the decision generally cannot be applied to the other related claims. As a result, more appeals must go through the appeals process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS take four actions, including improving the completeness and consistency of the data used by HHS to monitor appeals and implementing a more efficient method of handling appeals associated with repetitious claims.

GAO agrees and has dropped that recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2014, Medicare processed 1.2 billion fee-for-service (FFS)  claims submitted by providers or suppliers on behalf of beneficiaries.  Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC), on behalf of the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), process and pay FFS claims for  health care items and services submitted by Medicare providers. MACs  and other CMS contractors also identify and deny for payment health care  claims that are invalid or otherwise improper as part of CMS\u2019s  responsibility to ensure payments to Medicare providers are made  correctly.

This process consists of five, in most  cases sequential, levels of review. Appellants typically appeal the  coverage decision at the first of the five levels, and, depending on the  outcome, may choose to appeal the decision at the next level. CMS  contractors and relevant HHS components decide appeals in the  administrative portion of the process\u2014that is, Levels 1 through 4. HHS  components monitor these appeals, including appeal outcomes and the  extent to which the decisions are made within time limits established by  law. Level 5 appeals are reviewed by federal courts.", "Recently, the administrative appeal levels (i.e., Levels 1 through 4) have  experienced pronounced increases in the number of Medicare FFS  appeals filed and some levels have also experienced increases in the  backlog of appeals, which are pending appeals that remain undecided  after statutory time frames. As a result, HHS and members of Congress  have considered ways to streamline the Medicare appeals process and  improve the timeliness with which appeals are decided.", "You asked us to study the administrative portion of the Medicare FFS  appeals process to better understand the increase in appeals and efforts  being taken at HHS to address the growth in the number of appeals and  the appeal backlog. In this report, we examine  1.  trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014;  2.  data HHS uses to monitor the Medicare appeals process; and  3.  HHS efforts to reduce the number of appeals and the appeal backlog.", "To examine trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014\u2014the 5  most recent and complete fiscal years at the time we began our  analysis\u2014we analyzed extracts of three data systems we obtained from  the HHS components responsible for the Medicare appeals process:  CMS; the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA), an HHS  staff division; and the Medicare Appeals Council (the Council) within the  Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), which is also an HHS staff division.  The three appeals data systems are the Contractor Reporting of  Operational and Workload Data (CROWD) system, the Medicare Appeals  System (MAS), and the Medicare Operations Division Automated Case  Tracking System (MODACTS). Using extracts of CROWD, MAS, and  MODACTS, we generally determined the number of Medicare FFS  appeals filed for Levels 1 through 4 overall, by level, by the type of  appellant, by type of service, by subcategory of service, and by whether  the appeal resulted from a claim review conducted by a Recovery Auditor  (RA), a type of contractor tasked by CMS to identify improper payments  after they have been made. We also calculated the percentage of appeal  decisions issued after the statutory time frames. Finally, we analyzed  reversal rates, which are the percentage of appeal decisions that  reversed a prior decision. To assess the reliability of these data, we  performed manual and electronic testing to identify and correct for  missing data and other anomalies, interviewed HHS agency officials to  confirm our understanding of the data, and reviewed related  documentation. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. To better understand the effect of appeal decisions made  after statutory time frames on the amount of interest paid by CMS for  successful appeals at Level 3, we also asked CMS officials to estimate  the amount of interest the agency has paid as a result.", "To examine data HHS uses to monitor the Medicare appeals process, we  reviewed documentation describing each appeals data system in use  during the time frame of our evaluation to understand the data that track  an appeal and appeal decision and how those data are collected and  used. In addition, we interviewed officials from HHS agencies about the  data systems and how they use the appeals data for monitoring.", "To examine actions taken by HHS agencies aimed at reducing the  appeals backlog, we identified actions taken that may reduce the number  of filed appeals, actions to reduce the number of appeals reaching Levels  3 and 4, and actions to reduce the appeals backlog. To identify these  actions, we reviewed relevant regulations, HHS agencies\u2019 reports and  guidance, and interviewed representatives from HHS agencies and  selected contractors that serve as appeals bodies at Levels 1 and 2.  When possible, we analyzed data from HHS agencies to determine how  some of these actions affected the number of filed appeals and the  appeals backlog, and the likelihood that the appeals backlog would  persist. Lastly, we examined what, if any, issues that affect the appeals  backlog have not been addressed by actions HHS agencies have taken  to date. To accomplish this, we interviewed representatives from HHS  agencies, contractors serving as Level 1 and 2 appeals bodies, and  seven provider associations that represent the service areas that  generated the greatest number of Medicare appeals in 2013.", "For all three objectives, we reviewed HHS documentation, including a  June 2015 report to Congress describing the origins of the Medicare  appeals backlog and HHS\u2019s plans for its resolution, and the HHS budget  justification materials accompanying the President\u2019s budget request for  fiscal years 2016 and 2017. We also reviewed applicable federal  standards for internal control. See appendix I for a more detailed  description of our scope, methodology, and related limitations.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to April 2016, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Many appeals originate from  claims denied on a prepayment basis, but the same appeal rights exist for  either scenario. To conduct a prepayment claim review, CMS contractors  conduct several checks to determine whether a claim received from a  provider should be paid. These checks include verifying that the provider  is enrolled in Medicare, the beneficiary is eligible to receive Medicare  benefits, and the service is covered by Medicare. In limited cases, before  paying a claim, contractors review the supporting medical documentation  for a claim to ensure the service was medically necessary. As a result of  these checks or reviews, CMS\u2019s contractors may deny Medicare payment  for the claim. Most prepayment reviews are conducted by MACs, which  are responsible for processing and paying FFS claims within 16  geographic jurisdictions. To conduct a postpayment review, contractors  generally select claims from among those that have already been  processed and paid, request and review documentation from providers to  support Medicare coverage of the services identified in those claims, and  apply Medicare coverage and coding requirements to determine if the  claims were paid properly, reviewing, for example, whether the service  was medically necessary or provided in the appropriate setting. The  majority of the postpayment reviews are conducted by RAs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Administrative Appeals Process", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare administrative appeals process allows appellants who are  dissatisfied with decisions at one level to appeal to the next level. The  entities tasked with resolving appeals are referred to as appeals bodies.  The statutory time frames for submitting and issuing appeal decisions can  vary by level. (See table 1.) When an appeals body cannot render a  decision within the applicable statutory time frame at levels 2 through 4,  the appellant has the opportunity to escalate the appeal to the next level  of appeal. CMS may also refer certain decisions made at Level 3 to  Level 4.", "Each level of appeal follows similar steps. First, the appellant files an  appeal and submits supporting documentation. The appeals body then  assigns the appeal to an adjudicator who reviews the appeal, including  the relevant Medicare policies and documentation. Adjudicators at all four  levels generally conduct what are known as de novo reviews, meaning  they conduct an independent evaluation of the claim(s) at issue and are  not bound by the prior findings and decisions made by other adjudicators.  Next, the appeals body issues the appeal decision and notifies the  appellant. If the appellant files an appeal at the next appeal level, the  documentation associated with the prior appeal is sent to the next appeal  level.", "Appeals must meet certain requirements in order to be reviewed. For  example, the appeal must be filed by an appropriate party, such as by the  provider who furnished the service to the beneficiary and submitted a  claim to Medicare for that service. In addition, the appeal must be filed  within the required time frame. To be reviewed at Level 3, an appeal must  meet or exceed a minimum dollar amount, known as the amount in  controversy. Under certain circumstances, appellants may combine  claims to meet the amount in controversy requirement, which is $150 in  calendar year 2016.", "Some differences exist in the criteria appeals bodies use to make their  decisions.", "While all levels are bound by statutes, regulations, national coverage  determinations, and CMS rulings, only Level 1 is subject to local  coverage determinations (LCD) and CMS program guidance, such as  program memoranda and manual instructions. In comparison,  Levels 2 through 4 are required to give substantial deference to LCDs  and other CMS program guidance if they are applicable to a particular  appeal. However, unlike Level 1, Levels 2 through 4 may exercise  discretion to decline to follow LCDs and CMS program guidance when  issuing an appeal decision, and must explain in the decision the basis  for doing so.", "Levels 1 and 2 can also accept and consider new evidence submitted  by appellants to support their appeals. For example, to pay claims  related to certain durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics,  and supplies (DMEPOS), CMS requires providers to submit a  certificate of medical necessity. If this document was not submitted  with the original claim, the provider may submit it as part of the  appeal. At Levels 3 and 4, new evidence can generally be accepted  only with \u201cgood cause.\u201d", "Unlike Levels 1, 2, and 4, which decide appeals generally by  reviewing the documentation upon which the initial denial was based  as well as any supporting documentation the appellant submitted with  the appeal, Level 3 Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) conduct  hearings during which appellants are permitted to explain their  positions, present evidence, and submit into the record a written  statement of the facts and law material to the issue.", "All four appeals bodies may issue appeal decisions that do not address  the merits of the case:", "Dismiss: The appellant withdraws the request for an appeal or the  appeals body determines that the appellant or appeal did not meet  certain procedural requirements; for example, the appellant did not file  the request within the required time frame.", "Remand: An action that can be taken at Level 2, 3, or 4 which vacates  a lower level appeal decision, or a portion of the decision, and returns  the case, or a portion of the case, to that level for a new decision.", "Appeal decisions for Levels 1 through 3 include the following categories  for decisions issued on the merits based upon a consideration of the facts  of the appeal:", "Fully reverse: The appeals body fully reverses a prior decision  denying coverage and all of the claim(s) in dispute are paid.", "Partially reverse: The appeals body partially reverses a prior decision  denying coverage, and those parts of the claim(s) in dispute are paid.", "Not reverse: The appeals body upholds a prior decision denying  coverage, and payment of the claim(s) in dispute is denied.", "Level 4 uses different categories for decisions issued on the merits.

For example, during this period, the  number of Level 1 appeals, which represented the vast majority of all  appeals, increased from 2.6 million to 4.2 million\u2014an increase of 62  percent\u2014which was the slowest rate of increase among the four levels.  While Level 3 handled fewer appeals overall, it experienced the largest  rate of increase in appeals from 41,733 to 432,534 appeals\u2014936  percent\u2014during this period. (See table 3.) For most levels, the largest  annual growth over the 5-year period occurred between fiscal years 2012  and 2013, and between fiscal years 2013 and 2014 the rate of growth  slowed at all levels.", "For all appeal levels, appeals of claim denials for Medicare Part A (Part  A) services showed the most dramatic increase. Among the four levels,  Level 3 experienced both the largest increase in appeals overall, as well  as the largest increase in Part A appeals, which increased over 2,000  percent between fiscal years 2010 and 2014. (See fig. 1.) Appeals of  denied DMEPOS claims also grew substantially during this time at all  levels. For example, DMEPOS-related appeals increased the most at  Level 3 at over 1,000 percent.", "HHS attributed the increases in appeals overall to several factors. For  example, HHS fiscal year 2016 budget justification materials noted that  CMS\u2019s increased focus in recent years on expanding new program  integrity activities to ensure proper payment has resulted in more denied  claims and, therefore, more appeals. Specifically, appeals resulting from  RA claim denials began entering the appeals process in fiscal year 2011  after Congress enacted legislation that expanded the RA program from a  demonstration operating in six states to a permanent national program,  which CMS implemented in fiscal year 2009. In expanding nationally, the  RA program added a new set of contractors with the specific purpose of  reviewing postpayment claims to identify improper payments. In addition  to the large volume of postpayment reviews conducted by the RAs, there  was also an increase in overall claim denials from fiscal years 2011 to  2014, according to HHS\u2019s June 2015 Process Improvement and Backlog  Reduction Plan. The number of overall claim denials during this time  period for Part A and B claims increased 12.5 and about 9 percent,  respectively. For all levels, we found that appeals related to RA denials  were a larger contributor to the increase in Part A appeals compared to  Part A appeals not related to RAs. For example, at Level 3, RA-related  appeals of Part A services grew from 1 percent (140 appeals) of filed Part  A appeals in fiscal year 2010 to 78 percent (216,271 appeals) in fiscal  year 2014.", "HHS also attributed the increase in appeals to a greater propensity  among providers to appeal denied claims. From fiscal year 2010 to fiscal  year 2014, the proportion of appeals filed by providers increased at  Levels 2 through 4. The proportion of appeals filed by state Medicaid  agencies also increased at Levels 2 and 4, while the proportion of  appeals filed by beneficiaries at Levels 2 through 4 declined. According to  HHS agency officials, a small number of providers and state Medicaid  agencies were responsible for a large share of the appeals. For example,  at Level 2, CMS noted that three DMEPOS suppliers filed 12 percent of  DMEPOS appeals in calendar year 2012 and 33 percent of Level 2  DMEPOS appeals in calendar year 2014. Similarly, at Level 3, OMHA  reported that four DMEPOS providers and one state Medicaid agency  filed 51 percent of appeals in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In  addition, the number of appeals filed by state Medicaid agencies more  than doubled at Levels 2 through 4 from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year  2014. At Level 3, state Medicaid agency appeals increased from 2,617 to  25,195 during that time period. According to HHS\u2019s Process Improvement  and Backlog Reduction Plan, appeals filed by state Medicaid agencies  that relate to home health care services provided to beneficiaries eligible  for both Medicare and Medicaid services have contributed to the growth  in Level 3 appeals, and CMS officials told us that four state Medicaid  agencies (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont)  generated the majority of these appeals.

Among  the four appeal levels, Levels 1 and 2 had a smaller proportion of  decisions exceeding statutory time frames over the period. For example,  CMS data show that in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, MACs generally  issued less than 10 percent of their Level 1 appeal decisions after the  statutory time frame (see table 4). In fiscal year 2012, MACs issued a  greater percentage of decisions after statutory time frames and, notably,  CMS data show that in the fourth quarter of that year, MACs issued about  68.5 percent of their appeal decisions related to DMEPOS claims after  the statutory time frame. CMS officials told us that the delays resulted  from two factors: two MACs received a high volume of appeals filed by  seven suppliers and one of those MACs also experienced challenges  implementing a new tool used to generate correspondence with  appellants. In fiscal year 2014, MACs again issued less than 10 percent  of Part A and DMEPOS appeals after statutory time frames, though  nearly 21 percent of Medicare Part B (Part B) appeal decisions were  issued after statutory time frames in one quarter.", "Like the MACs, the Qualified Independent Contractors (QIC) also  generally had a relatively small proportion of Level 2 decisions exceeding  the statutory time frame during this time. CMS data show that the QICs  began issuing appeal decisions after the statutory time frame in fiscal  year 2011, and the percentage of such appeal decisions increased to 44  percent (345,049 appeals) in fiscal year 2013. However, in fiscal 2014,  the QICs issued less than 5 percent of their appeal decisions after the  statutory time frame.", "In contrast, the increase in appeal decisions issued after statutory time  frames and the proportion of those appeal decisions were greater at  Levels 3 and 4. For example, OMHA data show that in fiscal year 2014,  ALJs issued 96 percent of their Level 3 appeal decisions after the  statutory time frame. Similarly, Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) data  show that in fiscal year 2014 the Council issued 91 percent of its Level 4  appeal decisions after the statutory time frame. (See fig. 2.) In fiscal year  2014, Levels 3 and 4 issued decisions within the statutory time frames for  a greater percentage of beneficiary-filed appeals than appeals filed by  providers or state Medicaid agencies. Recognizing that delays in issuing  appeal decisions affects this population most acutely, both levels have  instituted processes to move beneficiary appeals to the front of their  queues. Between the two appeals bodies, Level 3 ALJs took longer to  issue decisions. In fiscal year 2014, ALJs issued 93 percent of their Level  3 appeal decisions in 180 days or more\u2014the statutory time frame is  generally 90 days\u2014while the Council issued 67 percent of Level 4 appeal  decisions in 180 days or more.", "According to HHS\u2019s Process Improvement and Backlog Reduction Plan,  the increase in late appeal decisions for Levels 3 and 4 from fiscal year  2010 through 2014 resulted from the increase in the number of appeals  filed, as well as the relatively flat budgets of OMHA and the Council,  which have prevented the hiring of sufficient staff to address the growing  workload. For example, as previously noted, the number of filed appeals  at Level 3 increased over 900 percent from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year  2014, while OMHA\u2019s budget during the same period increased from about  $71 million to about $82 million (16 percent). (See table 5.) In addition,  HHS noted that neither HHS agency receives funds from recoveries  made by the RA program, although they review appeals of claims denied  by RAs.", "The increase in the number of decisions made after statutory time frames  at Levels 3 and 4 also increases the amount of interest paid by CMS to  providers whose postpayment claim denials are reversed upon appeal,  thus increasing Medicare\u2019s costs. Currently, CMS is prohibited by statute  from collecting overpayments from providers who file appeals until after a  Level 2 decision is made. CMS is also required to pay providers interest  on the overpayments it initially collects after the Level 2 decision is made  and then returns when the appellant wins appeals at Level 3 or higher.  In 2014, the annual interest rate paid by CMS to these providers ranged  from 9.625 percent to 10.375 percent. As a result, CMS interest payments  have increased. Specifically, CMS officials estimate that from fiscal years  2010 through 2015, the agency paid $17.8 million in interest payments to  Part A and B providers that it would not have paid had Level 3 issued  appeal decisions within statutory time frames. Moreover, CMS  estimates that the agency paid about 75 percent of this interest ($13  million) in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, when delays in issuing decisions  have been the longest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reversal Rates at Levels 1 through 3 Decreased from Fiscal Year 2010 to 2014 and Appeals Reaching Level 3 Were Most Likely to Be Reversed", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2010 through 2014, fully favorable reversal rates  decreased for Levels 1 through 3, but varied across levels, with appeals  reaching Level 3 the most likely to be reversed.

Furthermore, OMHA\u2019s most recent  quality assurance evaluation, completed in 2013, identified  compliance with and understanding of the role of LCDs and other  program guidance as a key issue for improvement.", "According to HHS\u2019s Process Improvement and Backlog Reduction Plan,  the qualified decisional independence afforded ALJs may result in a more  favorable result for appellants at Level 3. Furthermore, as anticipated by  the federal law governing administrative procedures, qualified decisional  independence leaves substantial room for subjectivity in ALJs\u2019 application  of policy to the facts of a given case, and consequently, two reasonable  reviewers can review the same facts and come to two legally defensible  conclusions. Similarly, OMHA\u2019s 2013 quality assurance evaluation found  that of 60 reviewed cases that were decided after a hearing that involved  an LCD or other CMS program guidance, in 30 cases the policy was  applied differently than how it was applied at the lower level.", "While reversal rates declined across Levels 1 through 3 from fiscal years  2010 through 2014, reversal rates varied by type of service, with Part B  appeals having the highest reversal rates.

These data  systems collect information such as the date when the appeal was filed,  the type of service or claim appealed, and the length of time taken to  issue appeal decisions. Among other things, HHS agencies use these  data to identify emerging trends, such as increases in appeals among  certain service categories and changes in reversal rates; determine the  extent to which the agencies or their contractors decide appeals within  the statutory time frames; and help HHS estimate resource needs. For  example, CMS officials told us that using data collected in MAS the  agency observed that the largest increases in filed DMEPOS appeals  were related to oxygen supplies and diabetic glucose testing supplies. As  a result, the agency developed a strategy to help reduce the growth in  these types of appeals.", "CMS and OMHA are also in the process of making changes to these  appeals data systems, and according to agency officials, these changes  will improve their monitoring activities. Specifically, CMS plans to  transition the collection of all Level 1 appeals data from CROWD into  MAS, a process that CMS officials expect could take a minimum of 27  months and is dependent on the receipt of additional funding. CROWD  currently collects the majority of Level 1 appeals data, which has less  specificity than MAS. For example, CROWD collects only aggregate  monthly totals of the number of appeals filed, which does not, for  example, enable the tracking of individual Level 1 appeal decisions.  Additionally, OMHA is developing the Electronic Case Adjudication and  Processing Environment (ECAPE) to help the agency transition from a  paper-based business process to a fully electronic one, enabling OMHA  officials to automate many aspects of the agency\u2019s appeals processes,  such as generating appellant correspondence. ECAPE will exchange  Level 3 data with MAS and MAS will continue to be the data system of  record for Level 3 decisions in order to enable the sharing of common  appeals data across the first three levels. According to OMHA officials,  the new system will also provide the agency with additional data with  which to monitor appeals at Level 3. For example, officials told us that  ECAPE will allow the tracking of the time it takes to conduct discrete  processes in Level 3, such as the time between when an ALJ provides  written instructions to an attorney to when an attorney completes the  decision letter draft. Additionally, OMHA officials told us that the data from  ECAPE will also provide the agency with additional functionalities not  present in MAS that could improve the efficiency with which Level 3  appeals are decided, such as the ability to allow appellants to view on a  website the documentation included in their appeal file. Officials expect  such a website could reduce the amount of redundant documentation  from prior appeal levels submitted by appellants that must be reviewed by  OMHA staff.", "However, MAS does not collect other information contained in ALJs\u2019  appeal decisions issued at Level 3, which is one data source CMS uses  to monitor Level 3 appeal decisions. Level 3 decision letters generally  document the facts of the case and the rationale for an appeal decision,  but MAS does not collect detailed information related to the reasons for  the appeal decisions that could be useful to HHS. For example, MAS  does not contain information on whether LCDs or other CMS program  guidance were among the issues disputed as part of the appeal, whether  the ALJ declined to follow such guidance in issuing the decision, whether  the ALJ admitted new evidence, or whether other factors contributed to  the Level 3 decision. While some information on the reasons for Level 3  denials is collected by a CMS contractor, this information is not  maintained in MAS.", "Of the three Medicare appeals systems, only MAS collects information on  the amount at stake in an appeal. In MAS, the amount is tied to the  amount billed by the provider, but this amount can vary substantially from  the Medicare allowed amount. According to HHS officials, CMS and  OMHA data analyses suggest that, on average, billed amounts are about  three times higher than the Medicare allowed amounts, but for some  types of service, such as DMEPOS, the billed amount can be as much as  eight times higher than the Medicare allowed amount. The Medicare  allowed amount is a better approximation of what Medicare will actually  pay if the item or service at issue in the appeal was covered. For  example, according to CMS data, we found that inpatient hospitals in the  United States billed Medicare an average of $6.3 billion for the top 100  diagnoses and procedures in fiscal year 2013, but the Medicare allowed  amount for these services averaged $1.4 billion. CMS officials told us  that MAS does not track the Medicare allowed amount for prepayment  claim denials because the MACs do not compute this amount for those  claims. CMS officials also indicated that tracking allowed amounts for all  appealed claims at Levels 1 and 2 would be extremely resource intensive  and the benefits would be minimal. However, several MACs told us that  they compute an estimate of the Medicare allowed amount to determine  the Medicare savings associated with their prepayment medical  reviews. Additionally, CMS officials told us that MAS currently collects  the data that would be used to calculate the Medicare allowed amount,  such as procedure codes.", "The collection of these types of data, specifically reasons for ALJ  decisions and the Medicare allowed amount associated with an appeal,  could help HHS agencies strengthen their existing monitoring and data  collection activities. This would be consistent with the federal standards  for internal control that require agencies to conduct ongoing monitoring to  assess the quality of performance over time to ensure operational  effectiveness, and to run and control agency operations using relevant,  reliable, and timely information. If HHS agencies collected information  on the key characteristics that contributed to the Level 3 appeal decision  in the appeals data systems, they would have information that could help  identify appeal trends, which could help identify payment or claim review  policies in need of clarification or additional guidance for appeals bodies  or appellants.", "Similarly, by not collecting the Medicare allowed amount for all pending  appeals, HHS agencies are lacking information that could be useful in  three ways.", "OMHA officials told us that the agency would like to base the amount  in controversy on the Medicare allowed amount, as they believe that  doing so could help reduce the number of Level 3 appeals filed in two  ways. First, by using the Medicare allowed amount, some appeals  might fall below the amount in controversy, and, therefore, would not  be appealed. Second, appellants could choose to aggregate appeals  that individually fall below the amount in controversy, which could also  reduce the number of appeals filed. Currently, per regulation, the  amount in controversy is computed using the provider billed amount.", "HHS agencies could use the Medicare allowed amount to calculate  reversal rates based upon the potential Medicare dollars payable.  Currently, HHS agencies calculate reversal rates based upon the  number of appeals or appealed claims. Such a methodology does not  account for differences in the dollar value of those appeals. Monthly  reports from 2014 prepared for CMS on the Medicare appeals  process state that the Level 3 reversal rate is higher when it is  calculated based upon the amount in controversy, which according to  monthly reports indicates that higher value claims are more likely to  be reversed on appeal.", "Without the Medicare allowed amount or an approximation of it, HHS  agencies do not know the amount of money at issue in the Medicare  appeals process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistencies across Appeals Data Systems Limit HHS Agencies\u2019 Ability to Monitor Appeals", "paragraphs": ["Our review found data inconsistencies across the three appeals data  systems and within the appeal levels that use MAS, such as variation in  how appeal decisions are recorded at the claim level and how HHS  agencies track appeal decisions. These data inconsistencies limit HHS  agencies\u2019 ability to monitor emerging trends in appeals using consistent  and reliable data. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies  to establish and control operations using reliable information.", "First, our review found variation in how appeal decisions at the claim level  are recorded across CROWD, MAS, and MODACTS. Specifically, MAS  has the capability to track appeal decisions by each claim, as well as by  each line item in a claim, while CROWD and MODACTS do not. A claim  for Medicare payment may identify a single procedure or item, or multiple  procedures or items. For example, a claim for a continuous positive  airway pressure device, a DMEPOS item, can have multiple line items  that represent the device, tubes, filters, and mask included on the claim.  Payment for some or all of these line items can be denied and then  appealed.", "We also found variation within MAS in how the Level 1 through 3 appeals  bodies record appeal decision data at the claim level. The Level 1 and 2  adjudicators that report appeals data in MAS record an appeal decision  for each line item within a claim. MAS then derives a claim-level decision,  that reflects the totality of decisions made for each of the claim lines  included in the appeal. Using the claim-level decision, CMS can  calculate a claim-level reversal rate. For example, the fully favorable  reversal rate at the claim-level for an appeal composed of 10 claims,  where 4 are fully reversed, would be 40 percent. In contrast, OMHA  officials told us that ALJ teams vary in how they record claim-level  decisions in MAS. Specifically, OMHA officials told us that while some  ALJ teams record the actual decision for every claim included in the  appeal, others record the decision for the appeal overall as the decision  for each claim in the appeal. In such a circumstance, a comparable claim- level reversal rate cannot be calculated using the hypothetical example of  the 10-claim appeal referenced above because all claims would be coded  as partially reversed even though 4 claims were reversed and 6 claims  were not reversed. Additionally, claim-level reversal rates cannot be  compared across Levels 2 and 3. These differences in how data are  entered into MAS limit HHS\u2019s ability to compare claim-level reversal rates  consistently across all appeal levels.", "Secondly, we found inconsistencies in how appeals are tracked by appeal  level in the three data systems. Specifically, the three data systems use  different categories to track the type of Medicare service at issue in the  appeal, such as whether the appeal relates primarily to an inpatient  hospital claim or a transportation claim. For example, Levels 1 and 3  cannot identify appeals submitted by hospice providers because these  appeals at Level 1 are categorized as \u201cother\u201d and at Level 3 they are  combined with home health appeals, even though hospice is tracked as  its own category at Levels 2 and 4. Some efforts are being made to track  appeals across appeal levels more consistently at Levels 2 and 3 in MAS.  For example, according to an OMHA official, the agency plans to begin  using the same appeal categories to track appeals at Level 3 that are  used at Level 2, but has not determined when it will implement this  planned change. There are also differences in how each appeal level  assigns the appeal category to each appeal. For example, for Level 2  appeals, MAS assigns the appeal category using an algorithm based  principally upon the type of claim filed. In contrast, Level 4 staff manually  assign and enter the Level 4 appeal category in MODACTS, generally  based upon information provided by the appellant in filing the appeal or  from the Level 3 decision, according to Council officials. Such differences  in how appeal categories are assigned can contribute to differences in  how appeals are classified across appeal levels.", "Finally, another inconsistency we identified across the appeals data  systems is the tracking of whether appeals are related to claims reviewed  by the different Medicare review contractors. This is information that CMS  can use to monitor the performance of its medical review contractors by  tracking their appeal reversal rates. Although CROWD, MAS, and  MODACTS track whether an appeal is RA-related, there are  inconsistencies in whether appeals related to other medical review  contractors are tracked in these systems. For example, only MAS tracks  appeals related to the contractor that investigates fraud, and none of the  three systems track whether the appeal was related to an improper  payment identified by a MAC or by another of CMS\u2019s review contractors,  the Supplemental Medical Review Contractor.", "CMS and OMHA officials told us that they agree that greater data  consistency across the Medicare appeals data systems and among the  appeal levels using MAS would be beneficial for monitoring purposes.  CMS officials told us that the agency awarded a contract in September  2015 to evaluate Levels 1 through 4 of the Medicare appeals process and  that the evaluation, which is due in spring 2016, could also identify ways  in which the appeals data could be improved. The specific objectives of  this evaluation are to identify any changes that could streamline the  Medicare appeals process, reduce the backlog of appeals, and reduce  the number of filed appeals or the number of appeals reaching Levels 3  and 4. CMS officials told us they also expect the evaluation to identify  additional appeals data that should be collected to improve the appeals  process; however, this activity was not identified as an objective in the  evaluation\u2019s statement of work, and therefore, we do not know to what  extent the evaluation will focus on the data in the appeals systems. While  conducting such an evaluation is a good first step and may allow HHS to  make improvements to the data systems that collect appeal information, it  is unclear what findings the evaluator will recommend related to data  consistency as this topic appears to be a small component of the overall  evaluation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Despite HHS Actions, the Appeals Backlog and Inefficiencies Related to Certain Repetitive Claims Remain", "paragraphs": ["HHS agencies have taken several actions to reduce the total number of  Medicare appeals filed and the current appeals backlog.

According to CMS officials, this  practice allows providers to work with MACs to address potential issues  with claims before the services are performed. Since 2012, CMS has  implemented three demonstrations that require providers in certain states  to obtain prior authorization for power wheelchairs and scooters,  repetitive scheduled non-emergent ambulance transports, and non- emergent hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In addition, CMS established a  prior authorization process for certain other DMEPOS items on February  29, 2016. In February 2016, a CMS official said that a recent decline in  the number of Level 1 and 2 appeals of denied DMEPOS claims is due, in  part, to the power mobility devices and non-emergent hyperbaric oxygen  therapy prior authorization demonstrations.", "CMS also made changes to the inpatient hospital coverage policy and the  RA program, which have reduced the number of Part A filed appeals at  Levels 1 and 2. For example, on October 1, 2013, CMS implemented a  rule intended to clarify the circumstances under which Medicare would  cover short stays in inpatient hospitals in an effort to help reduce the  number of providers billing inappropriately for inpatient care instead of  outpatient services. As a result of these new coverage policies, CMS  prohibited the RAs from conducting reviews of short-stay inpatient  hospital claims with dates of admission after October 1, 2013. After  several extensions imposed by CMS and Congress, the prohibition ended  in January 2016, at which time CMS allowed the RAs to conduct a limited  number of short-stay inpatient admission reviews. The number of  appeals filed related to hospital and other inpatient claims at Levels 1 and  2 declined in 2014 and 2015 from a high in 2013. In addition, in 2015,  CMS limited the RA look-back period to 6 months from the date of service  for certain patient status reviews instead of 3 years, which reduces the  number of claims eligible for RA review and possible denial.

CMS officials predict that these discussions will enable  the QIC to reverse more claim denials at Level 2, thereby reducing the  number of appeals that reach Levels 3 and 4. In future years, CMS plans  to expand the demonstration to providers with appeals related to other  DMEPOS services.", "In another change, effective August 2015, CMS instructed MACs and  QICs to focus their reviews of appeals of postpayment claim denials on  only the reason(s) for the denial at issue in the original appeal, without  introducing new reasons that appellants would need to address in further  appeals. Prior to this change, MACs and QICs reviewing appeals  involving prepayment and postpayment claim denials were able to identify  new claim denial reasons. CMS\u2019s policy change will address stakeholder  concerns that when MACs and QICs conducted independent reviews of  claims, they often found new reasons to deny the claim, and as a result,  appellants would have to file an appeal and provide evidence to address  the new denial reason(s) at the next level of appeal.

In exchange, the hospital withdrew its pending appeals and  waived its right to file a future appeal related to the claims. As of June 1,  2015, CMS paid approximately $1.3 billion to providers through the  settlement. We estimate that it reduced the number of undecided appeals  by 31 percent at Level 3 and 37 percent at Level 4. (See table 6.)", "In addition, OMHA has implemented three pilot programs\u2014the settlement  conference facilitation pilot, the statistical sampling pilot, and the senior  attorney pilot\u2014which focus on resolving appeals at Level 3 more  efficiently. OMHA\u2019s settlement conference facilitation pilot, which began in  June 2014, allows eligible appellants to have their appeals at Level 3  settled through an alternative dispute resolution process rather than an  ALJ hearing. OMHA offered the pilot to a limited number of providers  initially, and, according to OMHA officials, as of January 2016, had settled  with 10 appellants involving about 2,400 appeals. The agency expanded  the scope of appeals eligible for participation in the pilot to include  appeals of additional Part B claim denials in October 2015 and appeals of  certain Part A claim denials in February 2016. OMHA officials told us they  are also exploring expansion of the pilot in 2016 to appeals filed by state  Medicaid agencies that relate to home health services provided to dually  eligible beneficiaries. As noted earlier, appeals from these state Medicaid  agencies have increased. We identified approximately 47,000 pending  Level 3 appeals as of our June 2015 data extract that are related to this  issue, which could take over half of OMHA\u2019s ALJs at least a year to  adjudicate through a traditional hearing process.", "OMHA\u2019s statistical sampling pilot began in July 2014 and aims to reduce  the appeal backlog by deciding multiple appeals filed by a single  appellant using statistical sampling and extrapolation. Under this pilot,  an ALJ reviews and issues decisions on a random sample of the  appellant\u2019s eligible denied claims.

A beneficiary\u2019s one year supply of oxygen, for example, could  generate 12 claims, and therefore, 12 denials and possibly 12 appeals. If  the appeal for the initial claim is later reversed in favor of the appellant,  the appeals of the subsequent claims must continue to go through the  appeals process, awaiting separate decisions, because the favorable  appeal decision on the initial claim cannot generally be applied to the  other appeals of subsequently denied claims.", "Representatives from some MACs, OMHA, and a provider group we  interviewed said that this process is inefficient and suggested approaches  to change the way these repetitive claims are adjudicated. In addition, two  of the MACs we spoke to had developed their own processes to  adjudicate some of these appeals more efficiently. For example,  representatives from one of the MACs said that if a decision on an initial  repetitive claim is reversed at Level 1, the MAC will apply that decision to  related appeals pending within its jurisdiction. Given that these claims are  for recurring services that are typically appealed individually, they could  contribute substantially to the number of appeals related to DMEPOS.  Furthermore, OMHA representatives told us that addressing this issue  would achieve major efficiencies for the Medicare appeals process. Doing  so is also consistent with internal controls that call for agencies to  establish control activities that are effective and efficient in accomplishing  the agency\u2019s stated goals.", "HHS officials told us that the department could address this issue if  granted certain statutory authority described in the HHS fiscal year 2017  budget justification materials.

The reopening process  could allow appeals bodies discretion to give deference to a decision  made at a higher appeal level upon determining that the beneficiary\u2019s  condition or other facts and circumstances of the appeal had not  changed. For example, an appeals body could apply a decision of a  higher appeal level that the appellant met medical necessity  requirements, although it would still need to verify certain components of  the claim, such as verification of service delivery, in order to prevent fraud  and abuse.

HHS also expressed its willingness to modify the appeal data  systems in order to collect consistent data across the appeal data  systems and to implement a more efficient way to adjudicate certain  repetitive claims. In commenting, HHS provided further information for  two of the recommendations with which it generally agreed. Regarding  our recommendation to collect information on the reasons for appeal  decisions at Level 3, HHS indicated that collecting this information in the  planned ECAPE system instead of MAS, as we recommended, would be  more cost effective. We agree with the department\u2019s rationale and  modified our recommendation to remove the language specifying that this  information be collected in MAS. Regarding our recommendation that  HHS capture the amount of Medicare allowed charges; in its technical  comments, the department indicated that it would not do this for all  appeals. Specifically, HHS indicated that it has no plans to collect the  Medicare allowed amount for Levels 1 and 2 because doing so would  require changes to the claims processing system or require manual  pricing of all appeals, which would require additional funding for the  MACs.

In contrast,  HHS disagreed with a recommendation related to determining the costs  and benefits of delaying CMS\u2019s collection of overpayments until after a  Level 3 decision is made, stating that such a change would increase the  number of appeals filed at Level 3. We agree that this change might  increase the number of filed appeals and, therefore, we did not include  the recommendation in the final report.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Using  the CROWD data, we determined the number of appeals filed by counting  the number of requests received less the number of misrouted requests.  CMS officials indicated that this approach will likely produce an  approximate number of filed appeals for our purposes. However, agency  officials also noted that CMS uses the number of requests cleared instead  of requests received when representing appeals workload, because the  requests received line could overestimate the number of filed appeals.  For example, it could count duplicate requests or requests for reopenings  as opposed to appeals. CMS officials noted that the agency has made  changes, effective in January 2016, to improve the quality of the requests  received data. Using MAS data for the Part A appeals data for the  remaining six MAC jurisdictions, we also counted appeals filed and  excluded misrouted and misfiled appeals.

CMS officials told us that their data system did not enable them  to create similar estimates for appeals reversed at Levels 4 or 5. To  report on the amount of interest that CMS would not have paid if Level 3  had issued decisions within the statutory time frame, we subtracted  estimate (b) from (a).", "To respond to our inquiry, CMS developed an estimate, which is based  on several assumptions and is subject to certain limitations. To report on  the amount of interest paid, CMS identified transactions in its Healthcare  Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) that were  categorized as related to this type of interest payment. To report on the  amount of interest that CMS would have paid if Level 3 had adhered to a  90-day time frame for issuing appeal decisions, CMS created an  estimated date whereby the ALJ would have issued the appeal decision,  because this information is not calculated in HIGLAS. This date was set  equal to 180 days after HIGLAS indicated the overpayment collection was  initiated by the MAC, and accounts for the following: the time it would take  the MAC to collect the overpayment after the appellant lost the Level 2  appeal, the time it took for the appellant to file a Level 3 appeal, and the  90-day time frame for Level 3 to issue an appeal decision. Because  overpayments can be collected over multiple dates, CMS set the date of  the recoupment equal to the median date of all recoupment dates. CMS  officials acknowledged that their estimate has limitations. First, CMS  officials told us that the recording of overpayment adjustments, the  assignment of codes which categorize types of accounts receivable, and  the determination of interest payments is a manual process conducted by  the MACs and that MACs may not, for example, be using the appropriate  codes. Second, use of a median date to estimate the interest that would  have been payable results in different estimates than if CMS were able to  apply the interest rate separately for each recoupment made based on  the actual date the overpayment was recouped. Third, CMS\u2019s estimate is  limited to Part A and Part B appeals and excludes any interest associated  with DMEPOS appeals because CMS officials told us they did not have  the necessary data in-house to conduct the analysis and obtaining access  to the necessary data would have been administratively burdensome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["To assess the reliability of the data used in this report, we performed  manual and electronic testing to identify and correct for missing data and  other anomalies; interviewed or obtained written information from CMS,  OMHA, and DAB officials to confirm our understanding of the data; and  reviewed related documentation.
