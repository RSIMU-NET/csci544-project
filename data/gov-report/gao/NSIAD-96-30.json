NADEPs mainly repair the airframes, engines, and components associated with key aircraft such as the F-14 Tomcat and the P-3C Orion. Private contractors perform Navy aviation maintenance work such as the repair of certain cargo and training aircraft, selected engines, and designated components. A limited amount of Navy aviation maintenance work is performed by other service maintenance depots.", "The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which operates NADEPs, determines depot maintenance requirements for airframes and engines on the basis of fleet needs and administers the airframe and engine repair programs. Similarly, the Naval Aviation Supply Office (ASO) determines repair requirements for aircraft and engine components and administers the component repair program.", "Table 1.1 shows the Navy\u2019s funding for airframe, engine, and component depot-level maintenance in fiscal year 1994.", "In an April 12, 1994, testimony, we pointed out that previous reports of workload mix between the public and private sectors understate the portion of funding going to the private sector. We noted that an actual accounting of what percentage of the depot maintenance dollars ultimately going to the private sector, either directly or through the purchase of repair parts or secondary services is not readily available because of limitations in the way the Department of Defense (DOD) collects data. However, based on our review of available data, we projected that more than 50 percent of depot maintenance funding goes to the private sector."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public-Private Competition", "paragraphs": ["Competition between the public and private sectors for depot maintenance work initially began in fiscal year 1985 when the Congress authorized a test program to allow public and private shipyards to compete for the overhaul of selected ships on the basis of cost comparisons. The competition program\u2019s goal was to help balance public and private industrial base concerns while achieving economy through competition. The Congress believed that by allowing public and private shipyards to directly compete for work, depot performance would be improved and depot maintenance costs would be reduced. Our 1994 report provided the history and status of the Navy\u2019s ship competition program.In fiscal year 1987, the Congress authorized the Navy to expand the scope of the competition program to include public-private competitions for depot repair of aircraft. The first NAVAIR work package subjected to public-private competition was for F-14 standard depot-level maintenance.", "In December 1990, NAVAIR published plans to greatly expand its public-private competition program to meet the savings goal of a Defense Management Review initiative regarding aviation depot maintenance. The NAVAIR plan assumed that most airframe and engine overhaul work above the minimum levels required to support the depot industrial base would be subjected to public-private competition. The plan specifically included future competition for 10 different airframes and 4 different engines. Partly based on initial results from the F-14 competition, the plan also assumed that the new competitions would result in a 20-percent savings in maintenance costs, or about $550 million by fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1992, ASO began its public-private competition program for aviation components with a goal to achieve significant maintenance cost savings.", "Because of concerns over rapidly declining depot maintenance requirements, the need to reduce excess depot capacity and help preserve the private sector industrial base, NAVAIR announced a new depot industrial strategy in April 1993 that basically eliminated future use of public-private competition for Navy aviation maintenance. The new strategy called for NADEPs to perform core maintenance work and for private contractors to perform non-core work. Core work was defined as the work necessary to maintain fleet readiness throughout the life cycle of front line weapon systems. The strategy expected that as the public and private sectors specialized, the public depots would only compete against private companies when there was insufficient competition in the private sector to ensure reasonable repair prices. The strategy did not specify criteria for assessing insufficient competition. It also did not recognize the impact of the 10 U.S.C. 2469 provision that was enacted in October 1992 requiring that public depots be allowed to compete for depot maintenance workloads valued at $3 million or more before moving this work to the private sector.", "In a May 4, 1994, memorandum on depot maintenance operations policy, the Deputy Secretary of Defense discontinued the DOD\u2019s public-private competition program. He cited a report of the Defense Science Board that identified several concerns with continuing the program and recommended eliminating it. The report noted the difficulties in conducting fair competitions, the high costs associated with the competition program, and the divisive effects of a policy that asks private sector firms to aggressively compete with their major (sometimes only) customer.", "In its report on the fiscal year 1995 DOD appropriation bill, the conference committee disagreed with DOD\u2019s announced policy and directed DOD to reinstitute public-private competition. Additionally, the conferee\u2019s directed DOD to respond to issues raised in House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports regarding public-private competition for depot maintenance workloads.", "In its February 1995 report to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, DOD stated that the financial systems and databases within the Department are not capable of supporting the determination of actual cost of specific workloads. Further, DOD perceives that competitions involving the organic depots have had disruptive and divisive effects on the military services, particularly the depot maintenance community. Last, the report noted that since DOD is moving to size its organic capabilities consistent with its core depot maintenance policy, it is questionable whether additional capacity and resources should be retained in order to compete. The report also stated that DOD is developing policies, procedures, and automated systems that will permit actual cost accounting for specific workloads accomplished in organic depots to overcome these problems and concerns. However, substantial changes are required that will be time-consuming to complete and implement. The report concluded that DOD cannot reinstate public-private competition until cost accounting and data systems are in place to conduct fair and open competitions.

Our cost comparisons did not include the costs to perform the competitions or administer the awards and, except for the F-14 competition program, adjustments were not made to account for inflation. Because some competitions involved new maintenance work, our assessment was limited to those involving maintenance work that had been performed before the competition. Our assessment was also limited by the small number of competitions performed and by many factors that make historical cost comparisons difficult such as changes in the amount of maintenance work required, changes in total workload, changes in worker efficiency, and the impact of inflation.", "To examine the future potential of the program, we interviewed key managers at headquarters and NADEPs that have been involved with the public-private competition program.

In ASO, only $196 million, or about 6 percent, of the $3.2 billion spent on component repairs since 1992 was competed between the public and private sectors.

There was a statutory limitation on the amount of work that could be competed by the Army and the Air Force. However, because the DOD competition program was structured as a prototype program, the Navy adhered to the limitation as well. The Fiscal Year 1993 National Defense Authorization Act rescinded the limitation on the amount of depot maintenance funds eligible to be spent for workload that was awarded based on public-private competitions.", "While Navy planning documents suggested that the Navy expected to expand the program to incorporate much of its non-core engine and aircraft workload, NAVAIR officials stated that the planned expansion was not realistic. Although the Navy had been authorized to conduct public-private competitions for its aviation workloads since 1987, in May 1993 testimony, we noted that it had completed only four competitions\u2014two aircraft and two component parts. Additionally, a 1992 Naval Audit Service report concluded that the Naval Air Systems Command was not obtaining the full potential benefit of the competition program and attributed this condition to several factors, including a lack of guidance. Although the Navy subsequently initiated action that was expected to substantially increase the amount of competed work, the planned expansion never occurred for the following reasons:", "The time and cost of performing competitions. For example, in 1990 NAVAIR found that preparing the statements of work and request for proposals necessary to conduct the competitions was much more difficult and time-consuming than had been expected. As a result, about 2 years passed before additional workload packages were ready to compete. Navy officials conceded the amount of time required should have been anticipated since administering a competition program that only involves private sector bidders also requires significant time for performing required technical and administrative tasks.", "Defense downsizing resulted in rapidly declining maintenance workloads and less workload available for public-private competition. Since core workload was to be maintained in Navy depots, there were fewer opportunities to identify above-core workloads that were large enough to make it worthwhile to undertake a competition. Moreover, uncertainties involving workload shifts from closing depots made it difficult to plan for and accomplish additional public-private competitions. Implementation of a new Navy maintenance strategy that called for downsizing Navy depots to core and contracting out non-core workload with the private sector. The introduction of this strategy in the Navy basically terminated the Navy\u2019s public-private competition program, even though DOD did not cancel the program until May 1994. Moreover, this strategy did not recognize the 10 U.S.C. 2469 provision requiring that before privatizing workloads of $3 million or more, public depots be allowed to compete for the work.", "ASO officials also stated that their public-private competition program was limited for several reasons, including the relatively late start of the program in 1992. In addition, ASO officials agreed with NAVAIR that performing a public-private competition was difficult, time-consuming, and resource intensive. As a result, few competitions were completed before DOD\u2019s termination of the program in 1994. However, these officials pointed out that the same limitations impact this activity when it attempts to conduct competitive procedures that involve only the private sector. Officials noted that most of ASO\u2019s contract depot maintenance workload is awarded without competition\u2014generally to the original equipment manufacturer.

Each official had detailed experience with the program.", "All of the officials believed that public-private competition has been beneficial to the government and has resulted in maintenance savings for the involved workloads. They stated that, as competitions were performed for maintenance work that had always been assigned to the depots, NADEPs knew that many jobs could be eliminated if they lost the competitions. As a result, the program motivated NADEPs to streamline overhead, improve work processes, reduce labor and material requirements, and implement other cost-saving initiatives in order to submit the lowest possible bids. For example, in preparing their competition bids, we were told that NADEPs carefully evaluated the maintenance specifications to ensure that they would only perform required repair work and eliminate unnecessary tasks. Each required task was closely evaluated to ensure that the most efficient process would be used to accomplish the work. In addition, new staffing requirements were developed from the bottom up to ensure that only the minimum number of people with the correct skill levels were assigned to the repair process.", "As a result of the competition for the F-14 overhaul, the Norfolk NADEP went from a two-shift operation to a one-shift operation and reduced the number of personnel assigned to the program. In this process, Norfolk reduced the F-14 production staff by over 100 people. Norfolk also made other changes to increase cost awareness and control. For example, the number of cost centers was increased to provide better visibility of production overhead costs and cost center managers were made responsible for controlling these costs. General overhead costs also were reviewed to eliminate unnecessary expenses.", "In response to the public-private competition for the F/A-18 work, the North Island NADEP did a detailed review of the F/A-18 repair operations with a view to reduce costs. One of the changes adopted reduced labor and processing time by moving work crews to each aircraft as work progressed instead of physically moving the aircraft to different work stations. Other cost saving changes included establishing central approval authority for recommended repair tasks, having daily progress meetings between the managers and artisans at the site of each aircraft in the plant, and reducing component repair time by only repairing the items needed for safe operation instead of completely overhauling the entire component. Although North Island lost the F/A-18 competition to an Air Force depot, the changes were incorporated into the NADEP\u2019s operations for core aircraft that were not included in the competition package. Additionally, NADEP North Island submitted an unsolicited proposal for the F/A-18 workload being performed at the Air Force depot and the Navy decided not to exercise an option with the Air Force depot for the second year and returned the workload to North Island.", "Navy officials stated that the measures adopted by NADEPs in response to competition caused the depots to become more businesslike, with an increased focus on efficiency and bottom-line results. Similarly, public-private competition also provided an increased incentive for private companies to minimize their bids in order to win competed workload. As a result, the officials stated that public-private competition has helped to ensure that maintenance work was performed by the activity, public or private, that provided the best value to the government. However, officials acknowledged that after the public-private competition program was canceled, it no longer served as an impetus for implementing many of the program improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in Quantifying Competition Savings", "paragraphs": ["Although NADEP managers believe the public-private competition program had a positive impact on reducing depot maintenance costs, precisely quantifying the program\u2019s impact is difficult for several reasons. First, because relatively little workload has been subjected to public-private competition, only limited quantitative information is available for analysis. For example, only four of NAVAIR\u2019s six competitions (F-14 airframe, SH-2F airframe, F/A-18 airframe, and J-52 engine) involved existing workload where baseline data is available to allow a comparison of maintenance costs before and after competition. Further, although baseline data was available for the ASO component competitions, the 33 competitions represent a very small portion of the many thousands of different components managed by ASO.", "Second, of the competitions with baseline data, work was still in process on the J-52, F/A-18, and all ASO competition awards at the time of our review. Thus, only limited actual performance information was available for analysis.", "Third, a comparison of average maintenance costs per unit before and after competition is affected by many variables other than the competition itself. For example, as aircraft get older, generally more repair work is required, which increases repair costs. These cost increases can be a significant factor over a 5-year period such as that involving the F-14 competition work. Other factors making cost analyses difficult include decreases in total workload that increase overhead costs per unit, the impact of inflation, possible inconsistencies in cost accounting procedures, changes in worker efficiency, and possible productivity losses from decisions to close depots such as the 1993 decision to close the Norfolk NADEP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintenance Costs After Competition", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the limitations on quantifying savings, we compared actual average maintenance costs per unit for F-14 airframes, F/A-18 airframes, and J-52 engines before and after public-private competition.

Although never used, the package also gave the Navy an option to include up to five additional overhauls each year under the competition program.", "NADEPs won the competition with a bid substantially lower than the next closest private sector bid. The first F-14 airframes under the program began overhaul near the end of fiscal year 1988. Not all planned F-14 overhauls were included in the competition package because the Navy wanted to ensure that the NADEPs would retain a core capability for repairing F-14s in support of military contingencies even if they lost the competition work. As part of its December 1990 plan to reduce depot costs, the Navy decided to perform all F-14 overhaul work at the Norfolk NADEP. The last F-14 overhauled under the competition award was completed in November 1994. From fiscal year 1987, the year before the competition program, through fiscal year 1994, the Norfolk and North Island NADEPs completed 83 F-14 competition overhauls and 244 noncompetition overhauls.", "After the start of the competition program, our analysis of F-14 overhauls showed that, after adjusting for inflation, the average overhaul cost was substantially lower for the 5 years covered in the competition package\u20141988 through 1992. Before the competition in fiscal year 1987, the average F-14 overhaul cost was $1.69 million. In fiscal year 1988, the average overhaul cost had dropped to $1.29 million, a decrease of about 24 percent. Even as the workload began to decline and aircraft aged from 1988 through 1992, the inflation-adjusted cost remained significantly lower than the fiscal year 1987 noncompetitive cost. In 1993 and 1994, the number of F-14 overhauls dropped substantially and the average cost increased above the 1987 precompetition level. Table 3.1 summarizes our F-14 overhaul analysis. The analysis includes both competition and noncompetition overhauls and excludes the costs of airframe modifications, which vary from airframe to airframe. Costs have been adjusted to constant fiscal year 1987 dollars to account for inflation.", "Norfolk NADEP officials attribute the decline in F-14 costs to the cost saving measures adopted as a result of the public-private competition program. Although the savings were substantial, several factors limited the amount of savings. For example, they stated that as the F-14s aged, several maintenance problems developed that required more work to correct during the overhaul process than had been previously experienced. At the same time, many F-14 components had to be repaired concurrently with each overhaul rather than simply replaced because the components were not available in the Navy supply system. In addition, total workload assigned to the NADEP decreased sharply after 1990 resulting in an increase in the overhead costs charged to each overhaul.

Because the cost of government-furnished material was excluded from the prior contract but included in the competition award, we made an adjustment using Navy estimates to make the costs comparable.", "The analysis showed that the average SH-2F airframe overhaul cost was 60 percent higher after the public-private competition. NAVAIR officials attributed the cost increase to inflation and to differences in the work required by the two contracts.

Table 3.2 summarizes the changes in component repair costs after the public-private competition.", "As shown in table 3.2, the average repair costs decreased in 25 of the  33 cases after competition. Of these 25 cases, the work continued to be performed in the same sector after the competition in 15, or 60 percent, of the cases. Of the remaining cases, work shifted from the public sector to the private sector in seven cases, from the private sector to the public sector in two cases, and from both sectors to the private sector in one case. For example, depot maintenance for a generator component used on the P-3C aircraft had been performed by the Alameda NADEP before the competition. After the competition, the work was shifted to a private company that had bid 70 percent less than the average amount previously paid to the NADEP for the work. In another case, the Norfolk NADEP won the competition for repair of a fire control set component used on the F-14 aircraft. The NADEP had bid 85 percent less than the average amount paid to a private contractor that had performed the work before the competition.", "Table 3.2 also shows that average repair costs of competed components increased after competition in eight cases. For example, the repair of a turbine stator component used in a J-52 engine was performed by a private contractor before the competition.

Further, the consensus of Navy officials we interviewed is that several factors, such as declining workload and implementation of depot closure decisions may restrict the program\u2019s potential use. However, a current legislative requirement directs that public-private competition be used before depot maintenance workloads of $3 million or more can be shifted to the private sector.

Title 10 U.S.C. 2469 provides that the performance of a depot-level maintenance workload that has a threshold value of $3 million or more being performed by a depot-level activity of DOD may not be changed to the private sector without using competitive procedures that include both public and private entities. This provision is intended to assure that the work will be awarded based upon where it can be accomplished more cost-effectively.", "Following DOD\u2019s 1994 decision to terminate the public-private depot competition program, the fiscal year 1995 defense appropriations conference report directed DOD to reinstitute public-private competition and to report its policy regarding public versus private competition for depot maintenance workloads. In a report responding to the Committee\u2019s direction to reinstitute the program, DOD stated that the financial systems and data bases within DOD are not capable of supporting the determination of actual cost of specific workloads. The report concluded that DOD cannot reinstate public-private competition until cost accounting and data systems are in place to conduct fair and open competitions.

Each official had detailed experience with the program.", "All of the officials stated that barriers exist that limit the future use of the competition program. For example, the officials stated that the NADEPs are required to maintain the ability to perform depot repairs on front line weapon systems. To meet this requirement, the NADEPs must perform a defined minimum quantity of work, called core workload, on front line weapon systems. Thus, only workload requirements above the level defined as core are considered potentially available for public-private competition. Because of defense downsizing, funding for airframe and engine depot maintenance decreased about 30 percent between fiscal years 1991 and 1994 and further reductions are expected. As depot workload decreases, the above-core workload also decreases making less work potentially available for competition. However, we noted that findings of the Report of the Commission on Roles and Missions challenged the validity of the core concept. Likewise, the Secretary of Defense\u2019s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding this report noted that DOD agrees with the Commission\u2019s recommendation to outsource a significant portion of DOD\u2019s depot maintenance work. The Secretary\u2019s letter also noted that DOD believes it must retain a limited organic core to meet essential wartime surge demands, promote competition, and sustain institutional expertise.", "With smaller workloads to compete, officials stated that potential savings from public-private competitions are reduced. In addition, the reduced potential savings may be offset by the high cost to perform public-private competitions. These costs include the costs to prepare the request for proposal, evaluate proposals, make selections, and perform contract administration. Further, some officials also stated that additional savings from recompeting work previously subjected to public-private competition would be progressively smaller. We noted that the factors cited as costs of competition are also relevant for competitions conducted solely among private sector contractors; that is, in order to save money, it is necessary to spend money.", "Another potential barrier to public-private competition for aviation maintenance work is implementation of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission decisions. In 1993, decisions were made to close three of the six Navy NADEPs. Implementing these decisions involves much planning, management attention, and disruption to normal operations as maintenance capabilities and workload are shifted from the closing depots to other facilities. As a result, NAVAIR and NADEP managers say they have less time to manage the technical and administrative details of public-private competitions. Additional uncertainties over the future structure of DOD\u2019s aviation maintenance depots will continue to exist until the 1995 round of base closing decisions are implemented. A related concern is the potential socio-economic impacts of traditional maintenance organizations losing all or substantial work resulting from competitions.", "The officials interviewed noted additional concerns about the public-private competition program. For example, concerns exist in both the public and private sector over the fairness of competitions and the ability of DOD to create a level playing field. Several officials stated that while progress has been made in making competitions fair, problems remain. Also, some officials noted that NADEPs are required to maintain certain facilities, equipment, and skills to support national defense requirements. This requirement, particularly as total workload declines, increases depot overhead costs and makes NADEPs less competitive in comparison to the private sector.", "The officials further commented about problems with the NADEPs\u2019 cost accounting and work control systems in a competitive environment. The NADEPs\u2019 systems were designed to support budgetary, accounting, and work processing needs for Navy industrial activities where work is directly assigned. The systems have been certified by the Navy comptroller as meeting DOD principles and standards. However, the systems were not designed to support bid preparation and contract execution as required by the public-private competition program. As a result, NADEPs often use additional, costly manual efforts and processes to prepare competition bids and comply with contract administration procedures for competition awards.", "Further, DOD perceives that competitions involving the organic depots have had disruptive and divisive effects on the services, particularly the depot maintenance community. Last, given that DOD is moving to size its organic capabilities consistent with its core depot maintenance policy, DOD officials stated that it is questionable whether additional capacity and resources should be retained in order to compete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Improvements to the Program", "paragraphs": ["We asked Navy officials whether any additional changes were needed to improve the public-private competition program. Several officials stated that the program could be improved if it were recognized that the depots exist to support national defense requirements, and as such, cannot be operated entirely like a private business. For example, although the government cannot contract with itself, NAVAIR treats a competition award to a NADEP like a contract by establishing a separate contract administration function and requiring the NADEP to comply with private sector contract administration procedures. The officials interviewed stated that these procedures duplicate normal NADEP funding and work control processes and cause the NADEP to incur unnecessary costs in trying to execute competition awards like a private business.", "At other times, several officials stated that NADEPs are not expected to operate like a private business. For example, some NADEPs have experienced frustration when military command decisions occasionally shift NADEP work priorities or present other demands that conflict with the best execution of competition work from a contractual perspective. NADEP managers believe their primary mission is to support the fleet. Thus, they have tried to be responsive to what they believe are the needs of the customer, even though this may not be in the NADEP\u2019s best interest from a contractual perspective.", "The substantial contractual cost overrun on the F-14 overhaul competition shows the adjustments depots must make to operate in a competitive contractual environment. The actual costs incurred by the Norfolk and the North Island NADEPs in overhauling the F-14 will exceed the amounts the contract administrator approved for payment. Overall the potential overrun is about $59 million, or an average of about $700,000 for each of the 84 overhauls. Under precompetitive, noncontractual conditions the depot is paid a fixed price for the work performed, including work that is in addition to the original work order. Under the competitive environment, the NADEPs sometimes performed work that was over and above the contractual requirement without always getting approval from the contract administrator and thereby incurring overruns. A private contractor does not get paid for any work or costs that are over and above the contract requirements unless approved by the contract administrator.", "To address these concerns and reduce administration costs for competitions awarded to NADEPs, several officials suggested that NAVAIR (1) to the extent possible establish fixed prices for competed work based on the bid amounts, (2) execute the work like normal workload using existing control systems with no separate contract administration, (3) use independent auditors to validate depot performance after the work is completed, and (4) assess penalties for cost overruns to make the depot less competitive on future competitions.", "If no changes are made in the administration of competition awards to NADEPs, the officials interviewed suggested other improvements to the competition program. For example, several officials stated that NAVAIR maximize use of fixed prices to reduce the time and cost of negotiations for over and above work.

For example, we noted that actions taken to improve the process included (1) the development of a Cost Comparability Handbook that, among other things, identified adjustments that should be made to public depots\u2019 bids as a result of differences in the military services\u2019 accounting systems and (2) the Defense Contract Audit Agency certifying that successful bids included comparable estimates of all direct and indirect costs.

These officials noted that when multiple competition programs required follow-on reviews at a given depot, depot bids improved as public depots had to respond to the Defense Contract Audit Agency accounting system audits, which identified problems that had to be resolved and as depot officials became more familiar with required policies and procedures.", "Recognizing the need for improved internal controls throughout the DOD depot system, the Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics) has established an Integrated Process Team to assist in framing DOD\u2019s efforts to implement required improvements in financial management and internal controls. Coopers and Lybrand is working with one depot in each of the four military services to improve internal controls and accounting procedures. Finally, at our suggestion, the Commander of the Ogden Air Force depot implemented a broad-based financial management improvement program, including the development of a Depot Maintenance Business Area Policies and Procedures Handbook that states policy in support of maintenance activities and gives procedures and tasks necessary to implement the policy. This handbook was developed as a team effort crossing many functional lines and levels of management and production. It addresses financial management responsibility, labor, material, internal controls, and other key areas. Further, Defense Contract Audit Agency officials reviewed drafts of the handbook and worked with depot officials to refine the processes and procedures and conduct follow-up reviews of the program\u2019s implementation.

Further, they also only partially concurred with our recommendation regarding the reinstatement of the public-private competition program. DOD officials stated that a November 1994 Office of the Secretary of Defense memorandum implementing section 335 of the Fiscal Year 1995 National Defense Authorization Act reinstituted public-private competitions and noted the conditions under which military depots could bid on competition work. However, the officials stated that current DOD policy prohibits depots from competing until improvements to their financial accounting systems have been completed and the Defense Finance and Accounting service certifies that adequate procedures are in place to identify and track all pertinent costs.
