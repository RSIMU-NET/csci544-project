GAO is reporting on (1) efforts by HHS and states to assess the scientific accuracy of materials used in these programs and (2) efforts by HHS, states, and researchers to assess the effectiveness of these programs. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed HHS officials in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) that award grants for these programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Efforts by HHS and states to assess the scientific accuracy of materials used in abstinence-until-marriage education programs have been limited. This is because HHS's ACF--which awards grants to two programs that account for the largest portion of federal spending on abstinence-until-marriage education--does not review its grantees' education materials for scientific accuracy and does not require grantees of either program to review their own materials for scientific accuracy. In contrast, OPA does review the scientific accuracy of grantees' proposed educational materials. In addition, not all states that receive funding from ACF have chosen to review their program materials for scientific accuracy. In particular, 5 of the 10 states that GAO contacted conduct such reviews. Officials from these states reported using a variety of approaches in their reviews. While the extent to which federally funded abstinence-until-marriage education materials are inaccurate is not known, in the course of their reviews OPA and some states reported that they have found inaccuracies in abstinence-until-marriage education materials. For example, one state official described an instance in which abstinence-until-marriage materials incorrectly suggested that HIV can pass through condoms because the latex used in condoms is porous. HHS, states, and researchers have made a variety of efforts to assess the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs; however, a number of factors limit the conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs. ACF and OPA have required their grantees to report on various outcomes that the agencies use to measure the effectiveness of grantees' abstinence-until-marriage education programs. In addition, 6 of the 10 states in GAO's review have worked with third-party evaluators to assess the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs in their states. Several factors, however, limit the conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs. Most of the efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs included in GAO's review have not met certain minimum scientific criteria--such as random assignment of participants and sufficient follow-up periods and sample sizes--that experts have concluded are necessary in order for assessments of program effectiveness to be scientifically valid, in part because such designs can be expensive and time-consuming to carry out. In addition, the results of efforts that meet the criteria of a scientifically valid assessment have varied and two key studies funded by HHS that meet these criteria have not yet been completed. When completed, these HHS-funded studies may add substantively to the body of research on the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and unintended  pregnancies among adolescents is an important public health challenge.  Although pregnancy and birth rates among female adolescents in the  United States have been declining since the early 1990s, the rates continue  to be high when compared with those in other industrialized nations. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that about  141,000 children were born to girls 17 years old and younger in the United  States in 2003. CDC also reports that STDs disproportionately affect  adolescents, with adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24 acquiring  almost half of the estimated 19 million new infections each year.", "Reducing the incidence of STDs and unintended pregnancies among  adolescents is an important objective for the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), which identifies as one of its goals the need to  reduce major threats to the health and well-being of Americans. Among  the efforts it supports to reduce the incidence of STDs and unintended  pregnancies among adolescents, HHS funds abstinence-until-marriage  education programs. Abstinence-until-marriage education programs, also  referred to as abstinence-only education programs, teach adolescents to  abstain from sexual activity until marriage in order to avoid risks of  unintended pregnancy, STDs, and related health problems. The content of  federally funded abstinence-until-marriage programs is required to be  consistent with several principles, such as teaching that a mutually faithful  monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected  standard of human sexual activity, and that abstinence from sexual  activity is the only certain way to avoid STDs. Abstinence-until-marriage  education programs are delivered by a variety of entities, including  schools, human service agencies, faith-based organizations, youth  development groups, and pregnancy crisis centers. Instructors can  incorporate a variety of educational materials into their abstinence-until- marriage education programs, including textbooks, student manuals,  brochures, slide presentations, and videos.", "The three main federally funded abstinence-until-marriage programs are  the Abstinence Education Program (State Program), which is administered  by HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF); the Community- Based Abstinence Education Program (Community-Based Program),  which is also administered by ACF; and the Adolescent Family Life (AFL)  Program, which is administered by HHS\u2019s Office of Population Affairs  (OPA) within the Office of Public Health and Science.

These studies have reported that  some of the materials used in abstinence-until-marriage education  programs contain, for example, scientifically inaccurate information about  anatomy and physiology as they relate to reproductive health as well as  misleading information about contraceptive failure rates and STDs. State  and federal agencies have also documented inaccuracies in abstinence- until-marriage educational materials. Further, studies examining the  effectiveness of these programs have reported varied results. For example,  some researchers have reported that abstinence-until-marriage education  programs have resulted in adolescents reporting less frequent sexual  intercourse or fewer sexual partners, while other researchers have  reported that these types of programs did not affect the frequency of  sexual intercourse or were ineffective in delaying the initiation of sexual  intercourse.", "You asked us to describe certain aspects of the oversight of federally  funded abstinence-until-marriage education programs.

OPA officials stated that these inaccuracies are often the result  of information being out of date because, for example, medical and  statistical information on STDs changes frequently. OPA has addressed  these inaccuracies by either not approving the materials in which they  appeared or correcting the materials through discussions with the  grantees and, in some cases, the authors of the materials. In fiscal year  2005, OPA disapproved of a grantee using a specific pamphlet about STDs  because the pamphlet contained statements about STD prevention and  HIV transmission that were considered incomplete or inaccurate. For  example, the pamphlet stated that there was no cure for hepatitis B, but  the medical education specialist required the grantee to add that there was  a preventive vaccine for hepatitis B. In addition, OPA required that a  grantee correct several statements in a true/false quiz\u2014including  statements about STDs and condom use\u2014in order for the quiz to be  approved for use. For example, the medical education specialist changed a  sentence from \u201cThe only 100% effective way of avoiding STDs or unwanted  pregnancies is to not have sexual intercourse.\u201d to \u201cThe only 100% effective  way of avoiding STDs or unwanted pregnancies is to not have sexual  intercourse and engage in other risky behaviors.\u201d", "While OPA and some states have reviewed their grantees\u2019 abstinence-until- marriage education materials for scientific accuracy, these types of  reviews have the potential to affect abstinence-until-marriage education  providers more broadly. Such efforts may create an incentive for authors  of abstinence-until-marriage education materials to ensure they are  accurate. Thus, some authors of abstinence-until-marriage education  materials have recently updated materials in their curricula following  reports that questioned their accuracy.

In addition, the results of  some efforts that meet the criteria of a scientifically valid assessment have  varied, and two key studies that meet these criteria have not yet been  completed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HHS, States, and Researchers Have Made a Variety of Efforts to Assess the Effectiveness of Abstinence-until-Marriage Education Programs", "paragraphs": ["Efforts of HHS, states, and researchers to assess the effectiveness of  abstinence-until-marriage education programs have included ACF and  OPA requiring grantees to report data on outcomes of their abstinence- until-marriage education programs; ACF analyzing national data on  adolescent behavior and birth rates; and other HHS agencies, states, and  researchers funding or conducting studies to assess the effectiveness of  abstinence-until-marriage education programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ACF and OPA Have Required Grantee Reporting of Data on Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["ACF has made efforts to assess the effectiveness of abstinence-until- marriage education programs funded by the State Program and the  Community-Based Program. One of ACF\u2019s efforts has been to require  grantees of both programs to report data on outcomes, though the two  programs have different requirements for the outcomes grantees must  report. For the State Program, as of fiscal year 2006, grantees must report  annually on four measures of the prevalence of adolescent sexual behavior  in their states, such as the rate of pregnancy among adolescents aged 15 to  17 years, and compare these data to program targets over 5 years. To  report on these four measures, states may choose the data sources they  will use. States must also develop and report on two additional  performance measures that are related to the goals of their programs.  (See table 3 for a list of ACF\u2019s fiscal year 2006 reporting requirements for  the State Program.)", "As of fiscal year 2006, ACF requires Community-Based Program grantees  to develop and report on outcome measures designed to demonstrate the  extent to which grantees\u2019 community-based abstinence education  programs are accomplishing their program goals. ACF requires grantees  of the Community-Based Program to contract with third-party evaluators,  who are responsible for both helping grantees develop the outcome  measures and monitoring grantee performance against the measures, but  because this is a new requirement established for fiscal year 2006 grantees,  ACF has not yet received the results of these evaluations. In addition to  outcome reporting, ACF requires grantees of the Community-Based  Program to report on program \u201coutputs,\u201d which measure the quantity of  program activities and other deliverables, such as the number of  participants who are served by the abstinence-until-marriage education  programs. According to ACF officials, the agency requires grantees of both  the State Program and the Community-Based Program to report on  program outcomes in order to monitor grantees\u2019 performance, target  training, and technical assistance, and help grantees improve service  delivery. (See table 3 for a list of ACF\u2019s fiscal year 2006 reporting  requirements for the Community-Based Program.)", "ACF\u2019s fiscal year 2006 reporting requirements for grantees of the State  Program are the same as HRSA\u2019s when it administered the State Program.  In contrast, ACF\u2019s fiscal year 2006 reporting requirements for the  Community-Based Program differ from HRSA\u2019s reporting requirements for  the program. For example, for Community-Based Program grants awarded  in fiscal year 2001, HRSA required grantees to report on the effectiveness  of their programs, as measured by program participation as well as  behavioral and biological outcomes. These performance measures were  modified for fiscal year 2002, in part HHS officials explained, because of  concerns expressed by members of the abstinence-education community  that the original performance measures did not accurately reflect the  efforts of the grantees of the Community-Based Program. For grants  awarded from fiscal years 2002 through 2004, HRSA required grantees of  the Community-Based Program to report on a combination of program  outputs, such as the proportion of adolescents who completed an  abstinence-until-marriage education program, and measures of adolescent  intentions, such as the proportion of adolescents who committed to  abstaining from sexual activity until marriage. For grants awarded in  fiscal year 2005, when ACF assumed responsibility for the Community- Based Program from HRSA, grantees were not required to report on any  specific performance measures.", "OPA has also made efforts to assess the effectiveness of the AFL Program.  Specifically, OPA requires grantees of the AFL Program to develop and  report on outcome measures that are used to help demonstrate the extent  to which grantees\u2019 programs are having an effect on program  participants. According to OPA officials, the agency recommends that  grantees report on outcome measures, such as participants\u2019 knowledge of  the benefits of abstinence and their reported intentions to abstain from  sexually activity, reported beliefs in their ability to remain abstinent, and  reported parental involvement in their lives. To collect data on these  outcome measures and any others, OPA requires all grantees funded in  fiscal year 2004 and beyond to administer, at a minimum, a standardized  questionnaire\u2014developed by OPA\u2014to their program participants, both  when participants begin an abstinence-only education program and after  the program\u2019s completion. The standardized questionnaire includes  questions intended to obtain information on participants\u2019 reported  involvement in extracurricular activities, behaviors linked to health risks,  attitudes and intentions about abstinence, and opinions about the  consequences of premarital sexual activity. Like ACF, OPA requires its  grantees to contract with independent evaluators, such as colleges or  universities, which are responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of  grantees\u2019 individual abstinence-until-marriage education programs. In  addition to evaluating the extent to which grantees are meeting their goals,  OPA officials stated that the independent evaluators may also provide  input to grantees of the AFL Program on other aspects of the program to  improve their service delivery. Unlike ACF, OPA requires that the third- party evaluations incorporate specific methodological characteristics,  such as control groups or comparison groups and sufficient sample  sizes. In addition, OPA requires that the evaluations for grantees funded  in fiscal year 2004 and beyond account for baseline and follow-up data  obtained from the standardized questionnaires.", "OPA\u2019s requirement that grantees use a standardized set of questionnaires,  with data from these questionnaires used in evaluations, differs from  OPA\u2019s previous requirements. Previously, grantees of the AFL Program  were not required to use a standardized method for collecting data that  could be used to assess the effectiveness of their programs; instead,  grantees chose their own data collection instruments. As a result, an OPA  official explained, the collected data varied from one project to another.  OPA officials said that the agency developed the standardized  questionnaire to ensure uniformity in the data collected and allow the  agency to more effectively aggregate the data reported in evaluations of  individual abstinence-until-marriage education programs.", "OPA officials told us that they plan to aggregate information from certain  questions in the standardized set of questionnaires in order to report on  certain performance measures as part of the agency\u2019s annual performance  reports. The measures include the extent of parental involvement in  adolescents\u2019 lives and the extent to which adolescents understand the  benefits of abstinence. An agency official stated that the agency expects to  begin receiving data from grantees that are using these questionnaires in  January 2007. OPA did not previously have long-term measures of the  performance of the AFL Program. Its current measures were developed in  collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in  response to an OMB review in 2004 that found that the AFL Program did  not have any annual performance measures for measuring progress  toward long-term goals.", "In addition to requiring their grantees to report on outcomes used to  assess program effectiveness, both ACF and OPA have provided technical  assistance and training to their grantees in order to support grantees\u2019 own  program evaluation efforts. For example, in November 2005 the two  agencies sponsored an evaluation conference for abstinence-until- marriage grantees that included presentations about evaluations and their  methodology. Similarly, ACF\u2019s Office of Planning, Research, and  Evaluation sponsors annual evaluation conferences, and an ACF official  told us that a recent conference placed \u201ca significant emphasis\u201d on the  evaluation of abstinence-until-marriage education programs. In addition,  HHS officials told us that ACF, along with ASPE, is funding a multiyear  project that is designed to identify gaps in abstinence education evaluation  and technical assistance needs, develop materials on abstinence education  evaluation, deliver technical assistance and capacity-building activities  related to program evaluation, and develop research reports related to  abstinence education. OPA officials also told us that they attempt to help  ensure grantees\u2019 progress and effectiveness by offering various technical  assistance workshops and conferences. For example, in May 2006 OPA  provided a 2-day training conference to its grantees on the importance of  program evaluations and administering evaluation instruments. In  addition, OPA officials stated that the agency contracts with evaluation  consultants, who review grantees\u2019 evaluation tools and activities. OPA  officials explained that these consultants provide in-depth technical  assistance to grantees on how to improve grantees\u2019 evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ACF Uses National Data on Adolescent Behavior as a Measure of the Overall Effectiveness of Its Two Programs", "paragraphs": ["Requiring outcome reporting from state and community-based grantees is  not ACF\u2019s only effort to assess the effectiveness of its two programs. ACF  also analyzes trends in adolescent behavior, as reflected in national data  on birth rates among teens and the proportion of surveyed high school  students reporting that they have had sexual intercourse. ACF uses these  national data as a measure of the overall effectiveness of its State and  Community-Based Programs, comparing the national data to program  targets. In its annual performance reports, the agency summarizes the  progress being made toward lowering the rate of births to unmarried  teenage girls and the proportion of students (grades 9-12) who report  having ever had sexual intercourse.", "ACF\u2019s use of national data to assess the effectiveness of the State and  Community-Based Programs represents a change from how HRSA  assessed the overall effectiveness of these programs. Whereas ACF  compares national data on adolescent behavior to program targets, HRSA  aggregated data from its state and community-based grantees. HRSA\u2019s  state grantees were allowed to select the data sources used to gauge their  progress against certain performance measures. For example, in its annual  performance reports on the State Program, HRSA reported information on  the percentage of its state grantees meeting target rates for reducing the  proportion of adolescents who have engaged in sexual intercourse, the  incidence of youths aged 15 to 19 who have contracted selected STDs, and  the rate of births among youths aged 15 to 17. To determine their progress  in meeting their target rates, some state grantees, for example, reported  national data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, while  other grantees reported state-collected data. After ACF assumed  responsibility for the State and Community-Based Programs from HRSA,  ACF began using national data on adolescent behavior as a measure of the  programs\u2019 effectiveness. According to ACF officials, the agency changed  how it assessed its programs out of concern over the quality of the data  state grantees were using in their performance reporting and because the  agency wanted to use parallel measures of effectiveness for both  programs. For example, according to state performance reports for fiscal  year 2001 that we reviewed, two reports did not include adolescent  pregnancy rates that year because the states did not collect data on  abortions among this population. In addition, ACF officials told us that  they decided not to use national data on STDs as a measure of program  effectiveness because the goal of reducing STD rates is not as central to  the State and Community-Based Programs as reducing sexual activity and  birth rates among teens.

All 6 of the states worked with third-party  evaluators, such as university researchers or private research firms, to  perform the evaluations, which in general measure self-reported changes  in program participants\u2019 behavior and attitudes related to sex and  abstinence as indicators of program effectiveness. To obtain this  information, the third-party evaluators have typically relied on surveys  administered to program participants at the start of a program, its  conclusion, and during a follow-up period anywhere from 3 months to  almost 3 years after the conclusion.

For example, in 2001, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen  Pregnancy\u2014an organization focused on reducing teen pregnancy\u2014 published a report by a panel of scientific experts that assessed the  evidence reported on abstinence-until-marriage education programs in  peer-reviewed journals and other literature. The panel developed criteria  that an evaluation of a program\u2019s effectiveness must meet in order for the  program\u2019s results to be considered scientifically valid. In addition, in 2004,  former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher convened a panel of experts to  discuss, among other things, best practices for evaluating the effectiveness  of sexual health education programs\u2014including abstinence-until-marriage  education programs. This panel published a report in 2006 that describes  similar scientific criteria that assessments of program effectiveness need  to meet in order for their results to be scientifically valid. Further, experts  we interviewed agreed that these criteria are important for ensuring that  the results of a study support valid conclusions. In general, these panels,  as well as the experts we interviewed, agreed that scientifically valid  studies of a program\u2019s effectiveness should include the following  characteristics:    An experimental design that randomly assigns individuals or schools to  either an intervention group or control group, or a quasi-experimental  design that uses nonrandomly assigned but well-matched comparison  groups. According to the panel of scientific experts convened by the  National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, experimental designs or  quasi-experimental designs with well-matched comparison groups have at  least three important strengths that are typically not found in other  studies, such as those that use aggregated data: they evaluate specific  programs with known characteristics, they can clearly distinguish between  participants who did and did not receive an intervention, and they control  for other factors that may affect study outcomes. Therefore, experimental  and quasi-experimental study designs have a greater ability to assess the  causal impact of specific programs than other types of studies. According  to scientific experts, studies that include experimental or quasi- experimental designs should also collect follow-up data for a minimum  number of months after subjects receive an intervention. Experts  reported that follow-up periods are important in order to identify the  effects of a program that are not immediately apparent or to determine  whether these effects diminish over time. In addition, experts have  reported that studies should have a sample size of at least 100 individuals  for study results to be considered scientifically valid.", "Studies should assess or measure changes in biological outcomes or  reported behaviors instead of attitudes or intentions. According to  scientific experts, biological outcomes\u2014such as pregnancy rates, birth  rates, and STD rates\u2014and reported behaviors\u2014such as reported initiation  and frequency of sexual activity\u2014are better measures of the effectiveness  of abstinence-until-marriage programs, because adolescent attitudes and  intentions may or may not be indicative of actual behavior. For example,  adolescents may report that they intend to abstain from sexual intercourse  but may not actually do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Efforts to Assess the Effectiveness of Abstinence- until-Marriage Education Programs Have Not Used an Experimental or Quasi- Experimental Design", "paragraphs": ["Many of the efforts by HHS, states, and other researchers that we  identified in our review lack at least one of the characteristics of a  scientifically valid study of program effectiveness. That is, most of the  efforts to assess the effectiveness of these programs have not used  experimental or quasi-experimental designs with sufficient follow-up  periods and sample sizes to make their conclusions scientifically valid. For  example, ACF\u2014and before it, HRSA\u2014used, according to ACF officials,  grantee reporting on outcomes in order to monitor grantees\u2019 performance,  target training and technical assistance, and help grantees improve service  delivery. However, because the outcomes reported by grantees have not  been produced through experimentally or quasi-experimentally designed  studies, such information cannot be causally attributed to any particular  abstinence-until-marriage education program. While ACF requires its fiscal  year 2006 grantees of the Community-Based Program to contract with  third-party evaluators to select and monitor outcomes for their programs,  ACF is not specifically requiring these grantees to use experimental or  quasi-experimental designs. Therefore, it is not clear whether these  evaluations will include such designs. Similarly, ACF\u2019s use of national data  on adolescent behavior and birth rates to assess its State and Community- Based Programs is of limited value because these data do not distinguish  between those who participated in abstinence-until-marriage education  programs and those who did not. Consequently, these national data sets,  which represent state-reported vital statistics and a nationwide survey of  high school students, cannot be used to causally link declines in birth rates  and adolescent sexual activity to the effects of specific abstinence-until- marriage education programs.", "Similarly, the efforts we identified by states and researchers to assess the  effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs often did  not include experimental or quasi-experimental designs. None of the state  evaluations we reviewed that have been completed included randomly  assigned control groups. For instance, one state evaluation that we  reviewed only included students who volunteered to participate in the  study. This evaluation report stated that the absence of a randomly  assigned control group in the evaluation did not allow the evaluators to  determine whether observed changes in participants\u2019 reported sexual  behavior\u2014as indicated through surveys administered at the beginning and  end of a program\u2014could be attributed to the abstinence-until-marriage  education program. Similarly, some of the journal articles that we  reviewed described studies to assess the effectiveness of abstinence-until- marriage programs that did not include experimental or quasi- experimental designs needed to support scientifically valid conclusions  about the programs\u2019 effectiveness. In these studies, researchers  administered questionnaires to study participants before and after they  completed an abstinence-until-marriage education program and assessed  the extent to which the responses of participants changed. These studies  did not compare the responses of study participants with a group that did  not participate in an abstinence-until-marriage education program. In  addition, some of the studies used insufficient follow-up periods, thereby  limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness of the  abstinence-until-marriage education programs being studied. For example,  two journal articles that we reviewed described studies that measured the  effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage programs in delaying the  initiation of sexual activity from 1 to 2 months after completion of the  program. Scientific experts consider this follow-up period too short to  assess whether the programs had a valid effect.", "According to scientific experts, HHS, states, and other researchers face a  number of challenges in designing experimental or quasi-experimental  studies of program effectiveness. According to these experts, experimental  or quasi-experimental studies can be expensive and time-consuming to  carry out, and many grantees of abstinence-until-marriage education  programs have insufficient time and funding to support these types of  studies. Moreover, it can be difficult for researchers assessing abstinence- until-marriage education programs to convince school districts to  participate in randomized intervention and control groups, in part because  of sensitivities to surveying attitudes, intentions, and behaviors related to  abstinence and sex. For example, in a third-party evaluation of its  program, one grantee of the State Program originally planned to  administer follow-up surveys 1 year after participants finished their  abstinence education program, but the evaluators decided not to conduct  this follow-up because of confidentiality concerns and the difficulty of  locating students. In addition, the contractors hired to design ASPE\u2019s  study of the effectiveness of the Community-Based Program have reported  difficulties finding school districts that are willing to participate in  randomly assigned intervention and control groups receiving either  abstinence-until-marriage education or comprehensive sex education. An  ASPE official told us that although a \u201crandomized approach\u201d is the best  design for assessing the effectiveness of a program, the approach is also  the most difficult to conduct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Efforts to Assess the Effectiveness of Abstinence- until-Marriage Education Programs Have Not Measured Behavioral or Biological Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Another factor that limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the  effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs is the fact  that most efforts in our review to study the effectiveness of these  programs did not measure changes in behavioral or biological outcomes  among participants.

For example, neither ACF\u2019s  community-based grantees nor OPA\u2019s AFL grantees are required to report  on behavioral or biological outcomes, such as rates of intercourse or  pregnancy. Similarly, the journal articles we reviewed were more likely to  use reported attitudes and intentions\u2014such as study participants\u2019 reported  attitudes about premarital sexual activity or their reported intentions to  remain abstinent until marriage\u2014rather than their reported behaviors or  biological outcomes to assess the effectiveness of abstinence-until- marriage programs. For example, in one journal article we reviewed,  participants were asked to rate the likelihood that they would have sexual  intercourse as unmarried teenagers; another journal article described a  study in which participants rated the likelihood that they would have  sexual intercourse in the next year, before finishing high school, and  before marriage.", "Experts, as well as state and HHS officials, have reported that it can be  difficult to obtain scientifically valid information on biological outcomes  and sexual behaviors. Specifically, experts have reported that when  measuring an abstinence-until-marriage education program\u2019s affect on  biological outcomes\u2014such as reducing pregnancy or birth rates\u2014it is  necessary to have large sample sizes in order to determine whether a small  change in biological outcomes is the result of the abstinence-until- marriage education program. In addition, state and federal officials told us  that they have experienced difficulties obtaining information on sexual  behaviors because of the sensitive nature of the information they were  trying to collect. For example, one state official told us that her state\u2019s  effort to evaluate abstinence-until-marriage education programs was only  able to measure changes in participants\u2019 reported attitudes, instead of  behaviors, because the evaluators needed to obtain consent from the  parents of the program participants in order to ask them about their  sexual behavior. The state official explained that the requirement to obtain  consent from parents raised issues of self-selection, and therefore state  officials decided to ultimately halt the study and only report on the  attitudes that they had measured. In another example, ACF\u2019s fiscal year  2006 budget justification reports that ACF has had some difficulty in  obtaining reliable data from state grantees, in part because questions  about teenage sexual behavior are sensitive. OPA officials also  acknowledged that many communities will not allow grantees to ask  program participants questions about their sexual behavior because the  communities believe such questions are too intrusive.

For example, in one  study of middle school students, participants in an abstinence-until- marriage education program who had sexual intercourse during the  follow-up period were 50 percent less likely to report having two or more  sexual partners when compared with their nonparticipant peers. In  contrast, other studies have reported that abstinence-until-marriage  education programs did not affect the reported frequency of sexual  intercourse or number of sexual partners. For example, one study of  middle school students found that participants of an abstinence-until- marriage program were not less likely than nonparticipants at the 1 year  follow-up to report less frequent sexual intercourse or fewer sexual  partners.

One expert with whom we spoke said that she  expects the final Mathematica report on participants\u2019 behaviors to provide  the groundwork for the field.

However, efforts to evaluate both the accuracy and effectiveness of  abstinence-until-marriage education programs have been, in various ways,  limited. ACF, which administers the two programs that account for the  largest portion of federal spending on abstinence-until-marriage education,  does not review or require its grantees to review program materials for  scientific accuracy. In addition, not all grantees of the State Program have  chosen to review their materials. Because of these limitations, ACF cannot  be assured that the materials used in its State and Community-Based  Programs are accurate. Moreover, OPA, which reviews all grantees\u2019  proposed abstinence-until-marriage educational materials, and states that  review educational materials have found inaccuracies in some educational  materials used by abstinence-until-marriage programs.", "Similarly, most of the efforts described in our review to assess the  effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage programs have not met  minimum scientific criteria needed to draw valid conclusions about their  effectiveness. Specifically, most efforts by agencies, states, and other  researchers have not included experimental or quasi-experimental designs  that can establish whether changes in behaviors or biological outcomes  can be causally linked to specific abstinence-until-marriage education  programs. While these types of studies are time-consuming and expensive,  experts said that they are the only definitive way to draw valid conclusions  about the effectiveness of these programs. In addition, among the  assessment efforts we identified are some studies funded by HHS that  experts anticipate will meet the criteria of a scientifically valid  effectiveness study but are not yet completed. When completed, these  HHS-funded studies may add substantively to the body of research on the  effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage education programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To address concerns about the scientific accuracy of materials used in  abstinence-until-marriage education programs, we recommend that the  Secretary of HHS develop procedures to help assure the accuracy of such  materials used in the State and Community-Based Programs. To help  provide such assurances, the Secretary could consider alternatives such as  (1) extending the approach currently used by OPA to review the scientific  accuracy of the factual statements included in abstinence-until-marriage  education to materials used by grantees of ACF\u2019s Community-Based  Program and requiring grantees of ACF\u2019s State Program to conduct such  reviews or (2) requiring grantees of both programs to sign written  assurances in their grant applications that the materials they propose  using are accurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS provided written comments on a draft of this report.

Regarding accuracy, HHS\u2019s written  comments also noted that all applicants for federal assistance attest on the  application form--Standard Form 424--that all data in their applications are  \u201ctrue and correct,\u201d and that in the view of HHS, this applies to information  presented in curricula funded by federal grants. However, as we stated in  the draft report, grantees of the State Program are not required to submit  curricula as a part of their applications; therefore, the attestation in  Standard Form 424 would not apply to curricula used by those grantees. In  addition, as stated in the draft report, some states have reviewed materials  used in abstinence-until-marriage education programs, but these reviews  occurred after they received funding from ACF. Further, while grantees of  the Community-Based Program were required to submit copies of their  curricula and a Standard Form 424 in fiscal year 2006 as part of their  applications, none of the materials specifically require an assurance of  scientific accuracy. Further, OPA and states have found inaccuracies in  educational materials used by abstinence-until-marriage programs.", "HHS\u2019s written comments also stated that ACF requires that curricula  conform to HHS\u2019s standards grounded in scientific literature. HHS\u2019s  comments refer to the curriculum standards for this program that detail  what types of information must be included in abstinence-until-marriage  curricula, and the comments stated that the curricula must provide  supporting references for this information. Further, HHS\u2019s comments  stated that ACF staff review the curricula to ensure compliance with these  standards. The draft report stated this. However, a requirement that  curricula include certain types of information does not necessarily ensure  the accuracy of the scientific facts included in the abstinence-until- marriage materials. For example, while education materials may include  information on failure rates associated with contraceptives or STD  infections, this information may be outdated or otherwise inaccurate or  incomplete. HHS\u2019s written comments also stated that if it finds inaccurate  statements during the review process or at any time during the grant  period, ACF works with grantees to take corrective action. To ensure  completeness, we have added this statement to the report. Further, HHS  stated that 2 inaccuracies cited in the draft report had been corrected  before our work began. We believe HHS is referring to inaccuracies  identified by OPA during its review of materials for scientific accuracy and  this reinforces the need for review of materials used by ACF\u2019s grantees.", "As HHS noted in its written comments, we did not define the term  scientific accuracy. HHS stated that it disagreed with certain findings of  the report because it was difficult to precisely determine the criteria we  employed in making the recommendation as to scientific accuracy. As we  stated in the scope and methodology section of the draft report, the  objective of our work was to focus on efforts by HHS and states to review  the accuracy of scientific facts included in abstinence-until-marriage  education materials. Performing an independent assessment of the criteria  used by these entities to determine the scientific accuracy of education  materials or the quality of the reviews was beyond the scope of the work.", "Regarding effectiveness, HHS\u2019s written comments also described a  number of actions it is taking to determine program effectiveness and  improve the quality of programs and research. Specifically, HHS\u2019s  comments described (1) studies undertaken or funded by ASPE, CDC, and  NIH; (2) technical assistance provided by OPA and ACF; (3) grantee  evaluation requirements; and (4) ACF and OPA requirements for the  amount of grant funds to be spent on evaluations. All of this information  was included in our draft report. HHS\u2019s comments also described a new  effort funded by ACF and ASPE that is designed to build capacity for  quality research in the field of abstinence education. We added  information on this effort to the report. HHS\u2019s written comments also  describe evaluations that resulted from an Abstinence Education  Evaluation Conference sponsored by ACF and OPA.

The solicitation, which was a  Request for Proposals (RFP), described the contract objectives, which  included (1) the development of national criteria for the review of  abstinence-until-marriage educational materials and the development of a  directory of approved materials; (2) the provision of medical accuracy  training to grantees; and (3) the provision of technical support to grantees,  such as assistance with program evaluation. The RFP stated that HRSA  intended to award a cost-reimbursement contract with fixed fee for a   1-year base period and 2 option years. This was a best value procurement;  that is, HRSA reserved the right in the RFP to select for award the  proposal that HRSA determined offered the best value to the government,  even if it did not offer the lowest cost. Further, the RFP stated that the  technical evaluation of the prospective contractors\u2019 proposals would  receive paramount consideration in the selection of the contractor.  According to the RFP, this evaluation would include an assessment of the  prospective contractor\u2019s technical approach, the organizational experience  and expertise of the prospective contractor, the plans for personnel and  management of the work, and the prospective contractor\u2019s statement and  understanding of the project purpose.
