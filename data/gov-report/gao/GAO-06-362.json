DOD has explicitly given the services the responsibility to set up their own processes for certain aspects of the disability evaluation system and has given them latitude in how they go about this. As a result, each service implements its system somewhat differently. Further, the laws that govern military disability and the policies that DOD and the services have developed to implement these laws have led reservists to have different experiences in the disability system compared to active duty members. For example, because reservists are not on active duty at all times, it takes longer for them to accrue the 20 years of service that may be needed to earn monthly disability retirement benefits. While DOD has issued policies and guidance to promote consistent and timely disability decisions for active duty and reserve disability cases, DOD is not monitoring compliance. To encourage consistent decision making, DOD requires all services to use multiple reviewers to evaluate disability cases. Furthermore, federal law requires that reviewers use a standardized disability rating system to classify the severity of the medical impairment. In addition, DOD periodically convenes the Disability Advisory Council, comprised of DOD and service officials, to review and update disability policy and to discuss current issues. However, neither DOD nor the services systematically determine the consistency of disability decision making. DOD has issued timeliness goals for processing disability cases, but is not collecting information to determine compliance. Finally, the consistency and timeliness of decisions depend, in part, on the training that disability staff receive. However, DOD is not exercising oversight over training for staff in the disability system. While GAO's review of the military disability evaluation system's policies and oversight covered the three services, GAO examined Army data on disability ratings and benefit decisions from calendar year 2001 through 2005. After controlling for many of the differences between reserve and active duty soldiers, GAO found that, among soldiers who received disability ratings, the ratings of reservists were comparable to those of active duty soldiers with similar conditions. GAO's analyses of the military disability benefit decisions for the soldiers who were determined to be unfit for duty were less definitive, but suggest that Army reservists were less likely to receive permanent disability retirement or lump sum disability severance pay than their active duty counterparts. However, data on possible reasons for this difference, such as whether the condition existed prior to service, were not available for our analysis. GAO did not compare processing times for Army reserve and active duty cases because GAO found that Army's data needed to calculate processing times were unreliable. However, Army statistics based on this data indicate that from fiscal 2001 through 2005, reservists' cases took longer to process than active duty cases."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, about 490,000 reserve members of the military have been  In recent years, about 490,000 reserve members of the military have been  called to augment active duty military forces in conflicts and peace- called to augment active duty military forces in conflicts and peace- keeping missions in support of the Global War on Terrorism.

We chose these sites because the services conduct  physical disability evaluations at these locations. In addition, we  interviewed officials from military treatment facilities (MTF), including  Brooke Army Medical Center and Wilford Hall Medical Center.

While  the composition of the PEB varies by service, it is typically composed of  one or more physicians and one or more line officers.

Service members found unfit with noncompensable conditions are  separated without disability benefits.", "Disability rating\u2014When the PEB finds the service members unfit and  their disabilities are compensable, it applies the medical criteria  defined in the Veterans Administration Schedule for Rating Disabilities  (VASRD) to assign a disability rating to each compensable condition.  The PEB then determines (or calculates) the service member\u2019s overall  degree of service connected disability. Disability ratings range from   0 (least severe) to 100 percent (most severe) in increments of 10  percent. Depending on the overall disability rating and number of  years of active duty or equivalent service, the service member found  unfit with compensable conditions is entitled to either monthly  disability retirement benefits or lump sum disability severance pay.", "In disability retirement cases, the PEB considers the stability of the  condition. Unstable conditions are those for which the severity might  change resulting in higher or lower disability ratings. Service members  with unstable conditions are placed on TDRL for periodic PEB  reevaluation at least every 18 months. While on TDRL, members receive  monthly retirement benefits. When members on TDRL are determined to  be fit for duty, they may choose to return to duty or leave the military at  that time.

DOD  regulations recognize this and require that the agency establish necessary  reporting requirements to monitor and assess the performance of the  disability system and compliance with relevant DOD regulations. Yet, DOD  does not collect information from the services on the final disability  determinations and personal characteristics of service members going  through the disability system.", "In addition, DOD has not established quality parameters for the services to  follow to evaluate the consistency of decision making. As a result, the  services generally lack a robust quality assurance process. In our past  work on federal disability programs, we have recommended that quality  assurance have two components: (1) the use of multivariate regression  analysis examining disability decisions along with controlling factors to  determine whether the decisions are consistent and (2) an in depth  independent review of a statistically valid group of case files to determine  what factors may contribute to inconsistencies. However, the services  were unable to provide any evidence that they are conducting statistical  reviews \u2013 such as multivariate regression analysis \u2013 on their data to  determine the consistency of decision making for service members with  similar characteristics. Furthermore, while we found that the Army is  conducting independent reviews of 25 to 30 percent of its PEB cases, the  Navy and Air Force conduct these reviews only when a service member  appeals the PEB\u2019s decision. Additionally, these reviews reflect how a  single case\u2019s medical evidence supports the dispositions made (accuracy)  rather than the degree to which decisions in cases, in general, with similar  impairments and characteristics compare (consistency). Without such an  analysis the services are unable to assure that adjudicators are making  consistent decisions in reservist and active duty cases with similar  characteristics.", "Officials from the services said that it was very difficult to examine  outcomes for consistency because each disability decision is unique and  there are a multitude of factors considered when rendering a disability  decision, some of which could not be captured in a database. For example,  individuals\u2019 pain tolerance varies, along with their motivation to adhere to  treatment programs. Nonetheless, other federal disability programs face  the same challenges, have acknowledged the importance of determining  consistency of decision making, and have taken some initial steps to  develop quality assurance systems.
