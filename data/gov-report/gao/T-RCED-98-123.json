This is the amount of excess budget authority in the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program that could be used in place of new budget authority to renew expiring housing assistance contracts. In addition, because this excess budget authority exists, HUD may not need the $70 million it has requested for Section 8 moderate rehabilitation amendment funding.", "HUD\u2019s budget request for $1.3 billion in Section 8 project-based amendment funding\u2014funds needed to cover shortfalls in long-term Section 8 contracts\u2014substantially exceeds the amounts that HUD\u2019s analyses indicated are needed.

Congressional concern exists over the high proportion of funding for assistance for the homeless that was spent on supportive services instead of on direct housing.

For fiscal year 1999, HUD requested about $25 billion in discretionary budget authority, which, in combination with available budget authority from prior years, will help support about $33.2 billion in outlays.

Recognizing the need to improve its budget process with better oversight and documentation, HUD has developed and begun implementing corrective actions.", "HUD recently placed all departmental budget operations under the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to ensure that budgeting is integrated with financial management oversight. In the past, HUD\u2019s budget operations have been fragmented and disjointed, preventing clear accountability and necessary coordination. This problem was the result of the CFO\u2019s inability to link budgeting with strategic planning and financial management, according to HUD\u2019s Management Reform Plan. As another improvement, HUD is hiring a chief financial officer for all program divisions to mirror the operations of the Department\u2019s Office of the CFO. Previously, the program division\u2019s budget director and comptroller reported to a deputy assistant secretary. Under the new structure, the division\u2019s budget director and comptroller will report to the division\u2019s CFO, who will coordinate with the agency\u2019s CFO and the division\u2019s program staff to ensure adequate oversight.", "In addition to organizational changes, the Office of the CFO plans to develop budget estimating policies and procedures that build in enough time for adequate coordination, oversight, and communication. However, HUD did not implement many of the changes in time to affect the Department\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget estimate. According to HUD\u2019s Director of the Office of Budget, time constraints prevented his office from performing analytical reviews of program office submissions. He said that his Office was limited to reviewing the fiscal year 1999 budget estimates for numerical accuracy and that this Office could not always question the estimates\u2019 reasonableness or underlying basis.

However, HUD\u2019s request for $4.7 billion to renew Section 8 tenant-based contracts could still be reduced by the amount of excess budget authority in HUD\u2019s moderate rehabilitation program, or $439 million. In addition, because excess budget authority exists in the moderate rehabilitation program, HUD may not need the $70 million it has requested for moderate rehabilitation amendments.", "In contrast to the Department\u2019s Section 8 tenant-based contract renewal request for fiscal year 1998, HUD\u2019s request for fiscal year 1999 does not appear to contain any duplicative contingency factors. Instead, HUD\u2019s improved budget estimate for fiscal year 1999 is based on actual expenditure data adjusted for inflation. In addition, HUD used $3.7 billion of excess budget authority recaptured from the Section 8 tenant-based program to offset the cost of contract renewals in fiscal year 1999.", "Although HUD has improved its budget-estimating process, we believe that the Department is still overestimating its need for contract renewal funding because $439 million in excess budget authority in the moderate rehabilitation program could be used to renew expiring contracts in lieu of requesting new budget authority. As shown in table 1, HUD determined in January 1998, that the gross excess budget authority in the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program was about $814 million. Of that amount, the Department estimates that it will need $191 million to meet funding shortfalls in the program and $184 million to cover contingencies, such as decreases in tenants\u2019 incomes or unexpected rent increases. (HUD believes, however, that it needs statutory authority from the Congress to use excess budget authority to cover some of these funding shortfalls.) The remaining $439 million is the budget authority that HUD considers to be in excess of the Section 8 program\u2019s needs.", "According to HUD officials, the Department has not decided yet whether to recapture this budget authority or how much it would recapture. Although HUD did not complete its analysis of excess budget authority in the moderate rehabilitation program in time to include this amount in its initial budget submission for fiscal year 1999, we believe sufficient time remains before conference for HUD to revise its fiscal year 1999 request to reflect the $439 million in excess budget authority available to reduce the cost of renewing contracts.", "HUD\u2019s January 1998 analysis also shows that a request for $70 million to amend Section 8 moderate rehabilitation contracts may not be needed. Generally, amending contracts refers to changing specific housing assistance contracts to add more funding. According to HUD officials, the $70 million was included in the budget as a placeholder until the Department completed its analysis of excess budget authority in the moderate rehabilitation program. As noted above, HUD\u2019s analysis shows that sufficient excess funding exists in the program to make the request for $70 million unnecessary. If the Congress grants HUD the authority it believes it needs to use excess budget authority to cover funding shortfalls in the program, Department officials told us that they would not need this $70 million in amendment funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Project-Based Amendment Request May Be Overstated", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD, the total amount of Section 8 project-based amendment funding needed for fiscal year 1999 is $1.7 billion.

As a result, HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget requests $1.3 billion for Section 8 project-based amendments. We do not believe that HUD\u2019s request for Section 8 project-based amendment needs is adequately supported. Furthermore, HUD\u2019s budget request for Section 8 project-based amendment funding substantially exceeds the amounts that HUD\u2019s analyses indicated are needed.", "The support HUD provided to us for its amendment budget request was an analysis dated April 1997. The analysis was formulated using a methodology that HUD refers to as \u201cleveling,\u201d under which funding shortfalls are spread over the remaining term of the contract rather than beginning in the year the contract is projected to run out of money. For example, for a contract costing $1 million a year with 10 years remaining and $9 million available, the $1 million shortfall would be spread in $100,000 increments over the next 10 years, rather than being identified as a shortfall of $1 million in the 10th year. HUD officials told us the goal of the leveling methodology is to enable the Department to request a consistent annual amount to fund amendments and to avoid requesting large amounts in later years.", "The April 1997 analysis, derived from the Budget Forecast System, which the Department uses to estimate its Section 8 amendment needs for budgeting purposes, indicates a total amendment need of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1999, or about $500 million less than the total amount identified in HUD\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 1999. HUD officials said that this additional $500 million reflects a policy decision by the Office of Management and Budget and HUD to augment the request because of the long-term funding need for amendments.", "In addition, an analysis of Section 8 project-based amendment needs that we obtained from HUD in February 1998 shows that substantially higher amounts of recapture funds are projected to become available in the next several years than those that are reflected in the budget. HUD prepared this analysis at our request to address problems that we identified in HUD\u2019s previous analyses of its Section 8 amendment needs. Among other things, we found the previous analyses did not include Section 8 project-based funding that HUD received in its fiscal year 1997 appropriation and erroneously excluded about 1,800 Section 8 contracts. The February 1998 analysis indicates that $2.6 billion in recaptures are projected to become available in fiscal year 1998, compared with the $463 million recapture amount used to offset the 1999 budget request.

In fiscal year 1996, the latest year for which HUD has detailed information on the allocation of its homeless assistance funds, 51 percent of the competitive funding HUD awarded to grantees was spent on supportive services as opposed to direct housing assistance.

They also speculated that it is difficult for organizations to obtain needed services through other agencies, which is why they may be using HUD resources to fill the gap. HUD officials further commented that funding this need is consistent with the agency\u2019s Continuum of Care approach that seeks to end homelessness by bringing together all parts of the community to provide a coordinated system of care for homeless men, women, and children.

These vouchers will be used to assist families that have achieved a sufficient level of independence to move to permanent housing that is linked to services. The vouchers are intended for homeless individuals and families who would otherwise have the greatest difficulty securing permanent housing resources, as determined through the approved Continuum of Care approach.", "However, unlike the Department\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget request for 50,000 new welfare-to-work vouchers, HUD\u2019s request for new vouchers for the homeless does not describe the criteria that would be used to distribute the vouchers. For example, under HUD\u2019s welfare-to-work voucher proposal, any housing agency requesting permission to distribute vouchers must (1) prepare a plan that includes the criteria to be used to select the recipients and (2) describe the proposed strategy for counseling tenants, providing assistance in seeking housing, and reaching out to landlords. Furthermore, the agency must determine that obtaining tenant-based housing assistance is critical for the applicant to obtain or retain employment and that the applicant is not already receiving tenant-based assistance. If HUD developed similar requirements for the recipients of vouchers for the homeless, the program\u2019s implementation could likely begin shortly after the funding is received, strengthening the program\u2019s efficiency.", "We believe that the lack of planning raises concerns about how quickly and effectively this program can be implemented. HUD, on the other hand, stated that it has a structure in place through its continuum of care grant process as well as public housing authorities that are experienced in administering the Section 8 voucher program.

RCI is intended to help states and localities develop and implement strategic plans that address key regional issues facing the nation\u2019s metropolitan and rural communities. HUD is planning to award grants under the program to states and localities on a competitive basis.

Moreover, the key study (still in draft form) underlying this new initiative does not recommend a significant federal effort to address regional problems because little consensus exists at the local and state levels for such an effort. In addition, the study concluded that in the future, emerging regional efforts could raise questions about the appropriate federal role. According to HUD officials, the RCI funding level was a judgment call and was considered a manageable set-aside under the CDBG program.", "In addition, HUD officials believe that the $100 million requested for RCI will be awarded in fiscal year 1999. However, several tasks need to be accomplished before these funds are committed, including selecting an RCI advisory board of community development experts, writing program regulations, developing a notice of funding availability, allowing applicants time to prepare their proposals, reviewing submitted applications, and deciding which applicants will receive RCI funds. To accomplish these tasks, HUD expects to use expertise from outside the Department to help design and review the RCI grant program in time to allow funds to be awarded in fiscal year 1999.

HUD estimates that one-third of the households receiving rental assistance from HUD depend on cash welfare assistance for some or all of their income. Under welfare reform, cash assistance programs became time-limited, work-dependent, and generally less available. Because residents pay a portion of their income for rent, any reduction in cash assistance without a commensurate increase in wage income would result in reduced rental payments from tenants. Managers at most of the 18 housing agencies we visited while conducting our ongoing work expressed concern about barriers their residents face in finding employment within their states\u2019 time limits. Under existing program regulations, reductions in tenant rental payments would increase the size of the payments that HUD makes to housing agencies and private landlords on behalf of low-income tenants to make up the difference between the tenants\u2019 rental payments and the housing units\u2019 operating cost or rent.", "While welfare reform may have a significant impact on HUD\u2019s future year budgets, measuring the potential impact may not be possible. One reason is that the impact of welfare reform will vary from state to state and from year to year because states have differing welfare reform provisions, making the development of national estimates of the impact of welfare reform on HUD nearly impossible. In Massachusetts, for example, recipients will begin to hit the state\u2019s time limits for cash assistance in December 1998, while in Minnesota, recipients will not reach the time limits until July 2002. A second reason is that conclusions drawn about welfare reform\u2019s impact on recipients generally may not apply to those who also receive housing assistance because evidence suggests that welfare recipients receiving housing assistance may have greater difficulty finding and retaining employment than other welfare recipients. Furthermore, HUD does not collect the detailed data on recipients\u2019 education, work, and welfare histories needed to assess likely outcomes for its tenants.
