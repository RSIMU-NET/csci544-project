According to State officials, these efforts have allowed State to meet the goals of Executive Order (E.O.) 13597 of increasing its NIV processing capacity by 40 percent in Brazil and China within 1 year and ensuring that 80 percent of worldwide NIV applicants are able to schedule an interview within 3 weeks of State receiving their application. Specifically, State increased the number of consular officers in Brazil and China by 122 and 46 percent, respectively, within a year of the issuance of E.O. 13597. Additionally, according to State data, since July 2012, at least 80 percent of worldwide applicants seeking a tourist visa have been able to schedule an interview within 3 weeks.", "Two key challenges\u2014rising NIV demand and problems with NIV information technology (IT) systems\u2014could affect State's ability to sustain the lower NIV interview wait times. First, State projects the number of NIV applicants to rise worldwide from 12.4 million in fiscal year 2014 to 18.0 million in fiscal year 2019, an increase of 45 percent (see figure).", "Given this projected NIV demand and budgetary limits on State's ability to hire more consular officers at posts, State must find ways to achieve additional NIV processing efficiencies or risk being unable to meet the goals of E.O. 13597 in the future. Though State's evaluation policy stresses that it is important for bureaus to evaluate management processes to improve their effectiveness and inform planning, State has not evaluated the relative effectiveness of its various efforts to improve NIV processing. Without conducting a systematic evaluation, State cannot determine which of its efforts have had the greatest impact on NIV processing efficiency. Second, consular officers in focus groups expressed concern about their ability to efficiently conduct adjudications given State's current IT systems. While State is currently enhancing its IT systems, it does not systematically collect information on end user (i.e., consular officer) satisfaction to help plan and guide its improvements, as leading practices would recommend. Without this information, it is unclear if these enhancements will address consular officers' concerns, such as having to enter the same data multiple times, and enable them to achieve increased NIV processing efficiency in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve State's ability to process NIVs, while maintaining a high level of security to protect our borders, GAO is recommending that State (1) evaluate the relative impact of efforts undertaken to improve NIV processing and (2) document a plan for obtaining input from end users (consular officers) to help improve their satisfaction and prioritize enhancements to IT systems.

This effort, according to  State officials, allows consular officers more time to focus on visa  adjudication and therefore improves their productivity. The contract  provides support services for visa operations at U.S. embassies and  consulates, including NIV interview appointment scheduling and fee  collection services. Contractors have opened 29 off-site locations in  six countries to collect biometric data of NIV applicants, which are  then forwarded to the post for processing and security screening prior  to an applicant\u2019s scheduled interview. Before the implementation of  the contract in fiscal year 2011, biometric information could be  collected at the post only when the applicant appeared for his or her  interview.

Additionally, at all four posts we  visited, State officials told us that they have, to varying degrees,  redesigned the responsibilities and location of their consular staff to  improve the efficiency of their operations. For example, in China,  India, and Mexico, officials reported that they have individualized the  tasks that are performed at each interview window to reduce the time  an applicant spends at post and streamline NIV processing.  Additionally, at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, each interview window  within the consular section is assigned to conduct a discrete task in  the NIV adjudication process. These tasks include checking-in and  confirming an applicant\u2019s identity, collecting biometric data, and  adjudicating NIVs at separate windows (see fig. 3 for a photograph of  the NIV applicant area at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China).", "Transfer of NIV adjudications: State has redistributed IWP  adjudications within the same country to posts experiencing low NIV  demand and has created an IWP adjudication section in the United  States to better leverage NIV processing resources.

Officers in our focus groups explained that some  aspects of the system hinder their ability to quickly and efficiently  process NIVs. These aspects include a lack of integration among the  databases needed for NIV adjudications, the need for manual  scanning of documentation provided by an applicant, and an absence  of standard keyboard shortcuts across all IT applications that would  allow users to quickly copy information when processing NIV  applications for related applicants, to avoid having to enter data  multiple times. Some consular officers in our focus groups stated that  they could adjudicate more NIVs in a day if the IT systems were less  cumbersome and more user friendly.", "Consular officers in Beijing and Mexico City and consular management at  one post indicated that the NIV system appeared to be designed without  consideration for the needs of a high volume post, which include  efficiently processing a large number of applications per adjudicator each  day. According to consular officers, the system is poor at handling today\u2019s  high levels of demand because it was originally designed in the mid- 1990s. Consular officers in S\u00e3o Paulo stated that under current IT  systems and programs, the post may not be able to process larger  volumes that State projects it will have in the future.", "State, recognizing the limits of its current consular IT systems, initiated  the development of a new IT platform. State is developing a new system  referred to as \u201cConsularOne,\u201d to modernize 92 applications that include  systems such as CCD and the NIV system. According to State,  ConsularOne will be implemented in six phases, starting with passport  renewal systems and, in phase five, capabilities associated with  adjudicating and issuing visas (referred to as non-citizen services).  However, CST officials have yet to formally commit to when the  capabilities associated with non-citizen services are to be implemented.  According to a preliminary CST schedule, the enhanced capabilities  associated with processing NIVs are not scheduled for completion until  October 2019. Given this timeline, according to State officials,  enhancements to existing IT systems are necessary and are being  planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Does Not Systematically Obtain End User Input to Prioritize Improvement Efforts for Current IT Systems", "paragraphs": ["Although consular officers and managers we spoke with identified CCD  and the NIV system as one of the most significant challenges to the  efficient processing of NIVs, State does not systematically measure end  user (i.e., consular officers) satisfaction. We have previously reported that  in order for IT organizations to be successful, they should measure the  satisfaction of their users and take steps to improve it. The Software  Engineering Institute\u2019s IDEALSM model is a recognized approach for  managing efforts to make system improvements. According to this  model, user satisfaction should be collected and used to help guide  improvement efforts through a written plan. With such an approach, IT  improvement resources can be invested in a manner that provides  optimal results.", "Although State is in the process of upgrading and enhancing CCD and  the NIV system, State officials told us that they do not systematically  measure user satisfaction with their IT systems and do not have a written  plan for improving satisfaction. According to CST officials, consular  officers may voluntarily submit requests to CST for proposed IT system  enhancements. Additionally, State officials noted that an IT stakeholder  group comprising officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs regularly  meets to identify and prioritize IT resources and can convey end user  concerns for the system. However, State has not collected  comprehensive data regarding end user satisfaction and developed a  plan to help guide its current improvement efforts. Furthermore, consular  officers continued to express concerns with the functionality of the IT  systems, and some officers noted that enhancements to date have not  been sufficient to address the largest problems they encounter with the  systems.", "Given consular officers\u2019 reliance on IT services provided by CST, as well  as the feedback we received from focus groups, it is critical that State  identify and implement feedback from end users in a disciplined and  structured fashion for current and any future IT upgrades.

According to Commerce, international travelers  contributed $220.6 billion to the economy and supported 1.1 million jobs  in 2014. Processing visas for such travelers as efficiently and effectively  as possible without compromising our national security is critical to  maintaining a competitive and secure travel and tourism industry in the  United States. Although State has historically struggled with the task of  maintaining reasonable wait times for NIV interviews, it has undertaken a  number of efforts in recent years that have yielded substantial progress in  reducing such waits. Significant projected increases in NIV demand  coupled with consular hiring constraints and other challenges could  hinder State\u2019s ability to sustain this progress in the future\u2014especially in  countries where the demand for visas is expected to rise the highest.  These challenges heighten the importance of systematically evaluating  the cost and impact of the multiple measures State has taken to reduce  interview wait times in recent years and leveraging that knowledge in  future decision making. Without this, State\u2019s ability to direct resources to  those activities that offer the greatest likelihood of success is limited.  Moreover, State\u2019s future capacity to cope with rising NIV demand will be  challenged by inefficiencies in its visa processing technology; consular  officers and management officials at the posts we visited pointed to  cumbersome user procedures and frequent system failures as enormous  obstacles to efficient NIV processing. State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs  recognizes these problems and plans a number of system  enhancements; however, the bureau does not systematically collect input  from consular officers to help guide and prioritize these planned  upgrades. Without a systematic effort to gain the input of those who  employ these systems on a daily basis, State cannot be assured that it is  investing its resources in a way that will optimize the performance of  these systems for current and future users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To further improve State\u2019s processing of nonimmigrant visas, we  recommend that the Secretary of State take the following two actions:  1.

Specifically, this report examines (1) the  efforts State has undertaken to expand capacity and reduce NIV  applicants\u2019 interview wait times and the reported results to date, and (2)  the challenges that impact State\u2019s ability to efficiently process NIVs. To  accomplish our objectives, we reviewed relevant State and Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) documents, and interviewed State, DHS, and  Department of Commerce (Commerce) officials. In addition, we observed  consular operations and interviewed U.S. government officials at four  posts\u2014the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China; the U.S. Embassy in New  Delhi, India; the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico; and the U.S.  Consulate in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. For our site visits, we selected posts that  (1) were in countries specifically mentioned in E.O. 13597, (2)  experienced NIV interview wait time problems previously, or (3) were in  countries that have the highest levels of U.S. NIV demand in the world.  During these visits, we observed visa operations; interviewed consular  staff and embassy management about NIV adjudication policies,  procedures, and resources; conducted focus groups with consular  officers; and reviewed documents and data. Our selection of posts was  not intended to provide a generalizable sample but allowed us to observe  consular operations at some of the highest NIV demand posts worldwide.", "To determine the efforts State has undertaken to expand capacity and  reduce NIV applicants\u2019 interview wait times, we reviewed relevant  documents and interviewed officials from State and DHS. To determine  the reported results of those efforts, we collected and analyzed data on  NIV processing capacity and NIV interview wait times worldwide from  January 2011 until July 2015 and compared them to the goals outlined in  E.O. 13597 and reviewed documentation provided by State on their  efficiency efforts. For NIV interview wait time data, we focused our  analysis on B visas and not on other NIV categories because this is how  State measures visa wait times against the goals specified in E.O. 13597,  and because B visas represent most NIVs. For example, B visas  represent 79 percent of all NIVs processed in fiscal year 2014. To  determine the reliability of State\u2019s data on NIV wait times for applicant  interviews, we reviewed the department\u2019s procedures for capturing these  data, interviewed the officials in Washington, D.C., who monitor and  report these data, and examined data that were provided to us  electronically. In addition, we interviewed the corresponding officials from  our visits to select posts overseas and in Washington, D.C., who input  and use the NIV interview wait time data. While some posts occasionally  did not update their NIV wait time data on a weekly basis, we found the  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining the  percentage of posts that were below the 3-week NIV interview wait time  threshold established by E.O. 13597.", "To determine the challenges that impact State\u2019s ability to efficiently  process NIVs, we reviewed relevant documents, including State planning  and NIV demand projections, interviewed State, DHS, and Commerce  officials in Washington, D.C., including officials from State\u2019s Office of  Inspector General, and conducted focus groups with consular officers.  We also reviewed State\u2019s documentation on its information technology  systems, including the Consular Consolidated Database, the NIV system,  and the development plans for the ConsularOne system. To determine  the reliability of State\u2019s NIV applicant projections, we reviewed the  department\u2019s projections and interviewed the officials that develop the  projections. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of providing a baseline for possible NIV demand through 2019.", "To balance the views of State management and obtain perspectives of  consular officers on State\u2019s NIV processing, we conducted 11 focus group  meetings with randomly selected entry-level consular officers that conduct  NIV interviews and adjudications at the four posts we visited. These  meetings involved structured small-group discussions designed to gain  more in-depth information about specific issues that cannot easily be  obtained from single or serial interviews. Consistent with typical focus  group methodologies, our design included multiple groups with varying  characteristics but some similarity in experience and responsibility. Most  groups involved 6 to 10 participants. Discussions were structured, guided  by a moderator who used a standardized list of questions to encourage  participants to share their thoughts and experiences. Our overall objective  in using a focus group approach was to obtain the views, insights, and  feelings of entry-level consular officers on issues related to their  workload, the NIV process, and challenges they face as consular officers  conducting NIV applicant interviews and adjudications. We assured  participants of the anonymity of their responses, promising that their  names would not be directly linked to their responses. We also conducted  one pretest focus group and made some revisions to the focus group  guide accordingly.", "Methodologically, focus groups are not designed to (1) demonstrate the  extent of a problem or to generalize results to a larger population, (2)  develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon plan or make decisions  about what actions to take, or (3) provide statistically representative  samples or reliable quantitative estimates. Instead, they are intended to  generate in-depth information about the reasons for the focus group  participants\u2019 attitudes on specific topics and to offer insights into their  concerns about and support for an issue.", "The projectability of the information produced by our focus groups is  limited for several reasons. First, the information includes only the  responses of entry-level consular officers from the 11 selected groups.  Second, participants were asked questions about their specific  experiences with the NIV process and challenges they face as consular  officers conducting NIV applicant interviews and adjudications. Other  entry-level consular officers who did not participate in our focus groups or  were located at different posts may have had different experiences.  Because of these limitations, we did not rely entirely on focus groups but  rather used several different methodologies to corroborate and support  our conclusions.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to  September 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
