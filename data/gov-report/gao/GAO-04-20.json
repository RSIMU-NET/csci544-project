When owners pay off mortgages--the mortgages \"mature\"--the subsidized financing ends, raising the possibility of rent increases. GAO was asked to determine the number of HUD mortgages that are scheduled to mature in the next 10 years, the potential impact on tenants, and what HUD and others can do to keep these properties affordable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, the HUD mortgages on 2,328 properties--21 percent of the 11,267 subsidized properties with HUD mortgages--are scheduled to mature in the next 10 years, but among states this percentage varies significantly: from 7 percent in Alabama, to 53 percent in South Dakota. About three-quarters of these mortgages are scheduled to mature in the last 3 years of the 10-year period. A CD-ROM (GAO-04-210SP) that accompanies this report provides property-level data for subsidized properties with mortgages scheduled to mature. Impacts on tenants depend on tenant protections available under program statutes and regulations, as well as on property owners' decisions about their properties. While about 134,000, or 57 percent, of the rental units in the 2,328 properties are protected by rental assistance contracts, tenants in over 101,000 units without rental assistance are at risk of paying higher rents after mortgage maturity because no requirement exists to protect tenants when HUD mortgages mature. Absent specific requirements, property owners' decisions on whether to continue serving low-income tenants after their HUD mortgages mature depend on many factors, including neighborhood incomes, property conditions, and owners' missions. Of the 32 properties with HUD mortgages that matured during the past 10 years, 16 have rental assistance contracts that continue to subsidize at least some units, and 10 of the remaining 16 that GAO was able to contact offer rents that are affordable to tenants with incomes below 50 percent of area median income. HUD does not offer incentives to owners to keep properties affordable upon mortgage maturity. While many state and local agencies GAO surveyed offer incentives to preserve affordable housing, they have not directed them specifically at properties where HUD mortgages mature. Most of the agencies do not track HUD mortgage maturity dates for subsidized properties. In addition, although HUD's Web site contains detailed property-level data, some state and local agencies perceive that the information is not readily available. Refer to GAO-04-211SP for survey details."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1950s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) has subsidized about 1.7 million rental units in over 23,000 privately  owned properties that are generally affordable to low-income tenants\u2014 those with incomes 80 percent or less of area median income. HUD  supported the development of affordable housing by offering property  owners favorable mortgage financing, long-term rental assistance  contracts, or both in exchange for owners\u2019 commitment to house low- income tenants for at least 20 years and, in some cases, up to 40 years.  However, many of these commitment periods will be completed in the next  10 years. Properties subsidized under these HUD programs represent a  significant source of housing that is currently affordable to low-income  households.", "HUD programs that provide mortgage financing in subsidized properties to  private developers are known by the section of the act that authorized  them. We consider a property subsidized if HUD provided favorable  financing (below-market interest rate mortgages), rental assistance, or  both. They include the following programs:   Section 202 Elderly and Disabled Housing Direct Loan, which  provided below-market interest rates on up to 40-year mortgages to  developers of rental housing for low-income elderly and persons with  disabilities from 1959 to 1991. Congress changed Section 202 to a grant  program in 1990;  Section 221(d)(3) Below-Market Interest Rate (BMIR), which provided  subsidized financing on private 40-year mortgages to developers of  rental housing from 1961 to 1968;  Section 236, which provided monthly subsidies to effectively reduce  interest rates on private 40-year mortgages for rental housing from 1968  to 1973;  Sections 221(d)(3) and 221(d)(4), which insured private mortgages to  developers of rental housing from 1961; and  Section 231, which insured private mortgages to developers of rental  housing for the elderly from 1959.", "Frequently, properties that benefited from HUD mortgages were coupled  with long-term rental assistance provided under various programs, such as  project-based Section 8, Rent Supplement, and Rental Assistance Payment  (RAP) programs. (The project-based Section 8 program also provides  rental assistance to owners of properties that were not financed with HUD  mortgages.) Rental subsidy was also provided through the Section 8  Moderate Rehabilitation program, which is administered by local housing  authorities and tied to rehabilitated units. Rental assistance programs  basically pay property owners a portion of the monthly rents for units  occupied by assisted low-income tenants. Subsidized financing, rental  assistance, or a combination of both allows property owners the  opportunity to earn financial returns while limiting the rents paid by low- income tenants to a fixed percentage of their household incomes.", "Both mortgages and rental assistance contracts are for set periods of time,  and subject to specific program provisions, properties become eligible to  leave HUD programs when mortgages mature or when HUD or owners  elect not to renew expiring rental assistance contracts. HUD mortgages  subsidized under Section 202, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, and Section 236  restrict how much rent an owner can charge. These restrictions are  generally effective until the mortgage is paid off. Mortgages financed under  Section 221(d)(3), Section 221(d)(4), and Section 231 do not have similar  requirements. In addition, certain properties are eligible to leave HUD  programs by paying off the mortgage prior to the maturity date.", "As agreed with your offices, this report provides information on (1) the  numbers and selected characteristics of HUD-subsidized rental properties  scheduled to reach mortgage maturity over the next 10 years; (2) the  potential impact on tenants when mortgages reach maturity; and (3) the  tools and incentives that HUD, the states, and localities offer owners to  keep HUD properties affordable when mortgages mature.

We also interviewed HUD and housing industry  officials and reviewed literature on the preservation of low-income  housing. Because nationwide data on tools and incentives that can be used  to preserve affordable housing do not exist, we used a Web-based  questionnaire to survey 327 state and local housing and community  development agencies to determine what tools and incentives they use to  keep HUD-subsidized properties affordable to low-income tenants and  which of the tools and incentives they believed to be effective. We received  226 usable responses, for a response rate of 69 percent. We reviewed  statutes and regulations, interviewed HUD officials, and obtained relevant  documents to identify tenants\u2019 protections when mortgages mature in  subsidized properties. Additional details on our scope and methodology,  including information on our survey design and participants, are discussed  in appendix I. We performed our work from January through November  2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the early 1970s, the federal government provided affordable  multifamily housing to low- and moderate-income households by  subsidizing the production of either privately owned housing or  government-owned public housing. Under the production programs, the  subsidy is tied to the unit (project-based), and tenants benefit from reduced  rents while living in the subsidized unit. These programs include Section  202, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, and Section 236. A portion of the units in  properties developed under these production programs received rental  assistance under programs such as Rent Supplement, Rental Assistance  Payments (RAP), and project-based Section 8 in order to reach lower- income tenants.", "In the early 1970s, questions were raised about the production programs\u2019  effectiveness: many moderate-income tenants benefited from federal  assistance, while lower-income families did not; federal costs of producing  housing exceeded the private-sector costs to produce the same services;  and allegations of waste surfaced. Interest in a more cost-effective  approach led Congress to explore options for using existing housing to  shelter low-income tenants. The Housing and Community Development Act  of 1974, a major overhaul of housing laws, included both approaches\u2014a  project-based new construction and substantial rehabilitation program and  a tenant-based rent certificate program for use in existing housing  (currently named the Housing Choice Voucher program)\u2014all referred to as  Section 8 housing. Project-based and tenant-based Section 8 assistance is  targeted to tenants with incomes no greater than 80 percent of area median  income, and tenants generally pay rent equal to 30 percent of adjusted  household income.", "Beginning in the late 1980s, owners of some subsidized properties began to  be eligible to leave HUD programs by prepaying their mortgages or opting  out of their project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. Once these  owners removed their properties from HUD programs, they were no longer  obligated to maintain low rents or accept rental assistance payments. In  response, in 1996, among other things, Congress created a special type of  voucher, known as an enhanced voucher, to protect tenants from rent  increases in these properties. Enhanced vouchers differ from regular  tenant-based housing vouchers in two ways. Enhanced vouchers may  provide a greater subsidy (that is, be used to rent more expensive units)  and give tenants a right to remain in their unit after conversion to market  rent, thus creating an obligation for the owner to accept the voucher. So  long as the rent remains reasonable, the tenant\u2019s portion of the rent should  not increase. If the tenant elects to move, the voucher becomes a \u201cregular\u201d  housing voucher and is subject to the program\u2019s standard rent limits.", "Not all property owners repay mortgages as originally scheduled. For  example, an owner may refinance the mortgage to pay for improvements to  the property. Other owners may experience financial difficulties and  default on their mortgages. From January 1993 through December 2002, for  example, HUD data show that the agency terminated the insurance on 231  mortgages. About 14 percent were due to mortgages that matured; other  reasons included owners\u2019 prepayment of the mortgage (37 percent) and  foreclosure (22 percent).", "Funds provided by other federal programs can be used by states and  localities to subsidize housing for low-income tenants. The CDBG program,  authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974,  distributes grants to local and state governments for community  development activities. Rehabilitation and other housing activities now  consistently represent the largest single use of CDBG funds. Other funds  for housing production have been made available through the HOME  program, authorized by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable  Housing Act of 1990, which awards block grants to state and local  governments primarily for the development of affordable housing. Under  the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, authorized by the Tax  Reform Act of 1986, state housing finance agencies provide tax incentives  to private investors to develop housing affordable to low-income tenants.", "In addition to using their HOME and CDBG allocations as well as tax  credits, some states and localities have established housing trust funds and  other financial mechanisms, which have helped organizations acquire  subsidized properties that may leave HUD\u2019s programs. Further, the states  and localities may use other tools and incentives, such as offering property  tax relief, to encourage owners to keep serving low-income tenants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About One-Fifth of HUD\u2019s Mortgages Are Scheduled to Mature through 2013", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, 21 percent (2,328) of the 11,267 subsidized properties with  HUD mortgages are scheduled to mature through 2013.

For a profit-motivated owner, the decision may be influenced by  the condition of the property and the income levels in the surrounding  neighborhood. If the surrounding neighborhood has gentrified and if the  property can be upgraded at a reasonable cost, it may be more profitable to  turn the building into condominiums or rental units for higher income  tenants. If repair costs are substantial or if high-income residents are not  present in the surrounding area, it may be more profitable to leave the  property in the affordable inventory. Tools and incentives offered by state  and local agencies may also influence this decision. In addition, because  most of these owners have had the right to prepay their mortgages and opt  out of their Section 8 contracts for a number of years, the economic factors  that drive a decision to convert to market rate are not unique to mortgage  maturity.", "HUD data show that nonprofit organizations own about 38 percent of the  properties with mortgages scheduled to mature in the next 10 years. For a  nonprofit owner, the decision would likely be motivated by cash flow  considerations since, in theory, these owners are not primarily motivated  by economic returns. Since mortgage maturity results in an improvement in  property cash flow, reaching mortgage maturity by itself would not  necessarily trigger removal from the affordable inventory. For example, at  1 of the 16 properties (nonprofit ownership) whose mortgages matured in  the past 10 years and that do not currently have project-based Section 8  assistance, the property manager told us that no longer having to pay the  mortgage left money for repairs needed to keep the units affordable for  their low-income senior tenants. Additionally, a nonprofit organization  would be more likely to keep the property affordable to low-income  tenants because to do otherwise could conflict with its basic mission of  providing affordable housing.", "Another factor is the loss of the interest rate subsidy that occurs when the  mortgage matures. When interest rate subsidies were first paid to  properties built in the 1960s and 1970s, they represented substantial  assistance to property owners. Over time, inflation has substantially  reduced the value of this subsidy. For example, the average interest rate  subsidy payment for a Section 236 property with a mortgage maturing in  the next 10 years is $66 per unit per month. The level of prices has roughly  quadrupled since 1970, so to have the same purchasing power would  require about $260 in today\u2019s dollars. Section 8 and similar project-based  rental assistance now provide the bulk of the assistance to these subsidized  properties\u201475 percent of the assistance versus about 25 percent that  derives from the Section 236 interest-rate subsidy.

We found that all 10 (none of which have project-based rental assistance  contracts) are offering rents that are affordable to tenants with incomes  below 50 percent of area median income.

We could not obtain actual tenant incomes since  property managers told us that they are not required to maintain such  information for properties without federal use restrictions.

These state and local agencies  identified several incentives that they believe are the most effective in  preserving the affordability of housing for low-income tenants. For  example, over 60 percent of the 62 state agencies that responded identified  the 4 percent tax credit and HOME programs as effective means for  preserving the affordability of HUD-subsidized properties.

While a share of the  properties with HUD mortgages are scheduled to reach maturity over the  next 10 years, it is uncertain how many of these properties will attempt to  convert to market-rate housing and raise rents, making the units in these  properties unaffordable for many tenants. While state and local agencies  might be able to play an important role in maintaining the affordability of  properties eligible to leave HUD programs because of mortgage maturity or  other reasons, these agencies need to know in advance which properties  are eligible to leave HUD\u2019s programs, and when, in order to use tools and  incentives that can help keep the properties affordable.

We used data from HUD\u2019s Real Estate Management System  (REMS), which contains information on active properties in Datamart, as  well as from the Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS),  which contains information on Section 8 contracts. We also incorporated  data from HUD\u2019s Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) and\u2014through the  Office of Multifamily Housing and Restructuring (OMHAR)\u2014data from the  Annual Financial Statements submitted to HUD by property owners. To  ensure the HUD data were reliable, we performed internal checks to  determine (1) the extent to which the data were complete and accurate, (2)  the reasonableness of the values contained in the data fields, and (3)  whether any data limitations existed in the data we relied upon to do our  work. Based on our reliability assessment, we concluded that the data were  reliable for purposes of this report. The data obtained from HUD are as of  April 15, 2003. To have 10 full years of data, our analysis covered the period  from April 15, 2003, through December 31, 2013.", "For the properties with existing HUD mortgages, we identified those that  also have project-based rental assistance contracts. We then separately  identified properties that do not have HUD mortgages, but have project- based rental assistance contracts that are also due to expire through 2013.  To obtain occupancy data relating to the individual properties, we used the  system containing the financial statements that are prepared and submitted  annually to HUD by property owners. For each property, we obtained the  following information:  metropolitan area,  total number of units,  total number of assisted units,  name of HUD financing program,  name of rental assistance program,   rental assistance expiration date,  number of rental assistance contracts,  rental assistance contract status,  type of client (tenant) served,  type of property ownership,  subsidy utilization rate, and  property inspection score (REAC score).", "We also used HUD\u2019s database to identify properties whose mortgages have  matured over the last 10 years. To determine how many properties are still  serving low-income tenants, we first identified those that are covered by  rental assistance contracts. For 14 of the 16 properties without current  rental assistance contracts, we obtained contact information from HUD\u2019s  archived database (the database did not have sufficient complete  information on the other 2). We then contacted these properties via  telephone to determine if the management was still serving low-income  tenants.", "We reviewed HUD regulations to determine the potential impact on tenants  when HUD mortgages mature. In particular, we reviewed the eligibility of  tenants to receive enhanced vouchers and other protections against  increases in rents when properties leave HUD\u2019s programs. We discussed  these regulations with appropriate HUD officials and also requested that  HUD identify protections available to tenants under the various housing  programs.", "To identify the incentives that HUD, the states, and localities could offer  owners under existing laws and regulations, we interviewed HUD, state,  and local officials and reviewed available literature. Because there are no  nationwide data available on the utilization of tools and incentives at the  state and local level and no single agency is responsible for administrating  the various incentives for any state, we surveyed state and local housing  and community development agencies via the Internet. We identified the  survey participants through lists provided by four national housing industry  organizations. Specifically, we surveyed members of the National Council  of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA), which represents state housing  finance agencies; the Council of State Community Development Agencies  (COSCDA), which represents state housing and community development  agencies; the National Community Development Association (NCDA),  which represents local communities that administer federally supported  programs such as CDBG and HOME; and the National Association of Local  Housing Finance Agencies (NALHFA), which represents local housing  finance agencies. The survey covered (1) their experiences in preserving  affordable housing, (2) the incentives used and their effectiveness, and (3)  the extent to which they identify and track properties that could leave  HUD\u2019s programs.", "In developing the survey, we met with officials at the four national  organizations to gain a better understanding of the issues and modified our  questions based on their comments. We then pretested with several state  and local agencies throughout the country, such as the Department of  Community Development in Amarillo, Texas; the Department of  Neighborhood Development in Boston, Massachusetts; and the Ohio  Housing Finance Agency. During these pretests, we observed the officials  as they filled out the survey over the Internet. After completing the pretest  survey, we interviewed the respondents to ensure that (1) the questions  were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms we used were precise, (3) the  survey did not place an undue burden on the agency officials completing it,  and (4) the survey was independent and unbiased. On the basis of the  feedback from the pretests, we modified the questions as appropriate.  Information about accessing the survey was provided to a contact person  at each of 327 state and local housing and community development  agencies in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The survey  was activated on May 12, 2003; it was available until September 5, 2003. To  ensure security and data integrity, we provided each agency with a  password to access and complete the survey.", "We originally included 373 potential respondents in our survey, but  eliminated 46 for various reasons, including those agencies having no  authority over affordable housing and those with no HUD properties in  their jurisdictions. As a result, 327 potential respondents remained\u201446  from NCSHA, 65 from COSCDA, 130 from NCDA, and 86 from NALHFA.

This letter includes a list of the privately owned, publicly assisted  multifamily housing mortgage programs.", "221(d)(3)", "Market rate with rent supplement  Below Market Rate Interest Rates (BMIR) with rent supplement or   Rental Assistance Projects (RAP)  221(d)(4) with all or partial Section 8  202s with rent supplement or Section 8  Section 8 moderate rehabilitation (not funded through HUD, maybe  PHA)", "Noninsured rent supplement projects (12 projects only in NY and  Minnesota)", "Please update the list if there are other programs that should have  been included and include any omitted programs in your answers to  the other questions requested in this report.", "We did not identify any programs to add to the list. The report encompasses  all of these programs with the following exceptions: (1) HUD does not  collect mortgage information on noninsured rent supplement properties  because the properties do not use HUD financing. HUD does have data on  the rent supplement contracts alone, which we included in the CD-ROM;  (2) Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation properties are excluded because  HUD does not track these properties in its multifamily database and  maintains no aggregate data on properties in the program.  2. What is the potential impact on the renewal of those Section 8  contracts in projects where FHA mortgages mature, the principal is  paid off entirely, and the affordability restrictions attendant to the  mortgages expire?", "The impact of a matured HUD mortgage, by itself, on an owner\u2019s decision to  renew a Section 8 contract is uncertain because there are a number of  other factors that can affect the decision. For a profit-motivated owner, the  decision to renew would likely be influenced by the condition of the  property and the income levels in the surrounding neighborhood. If the  surrounding neighborhood has gentrified and if the property can be  upgraded at a reasonable cost, it may be more profitable to turn the  building into condominiums or rental units for higher income tenants. If  repair costs are substantial or if high-income residents are not living in the  surrounding area, it may be more profitable to keep the property in the  affordable inventory by renewing the Section 8 contract. Tools and  incentives offered by HUD, state, and local agencies may also influence  these decisions.", "For a nonprofit owner, the decision would likely be motivated largely by  cash flow considerations since, in theory, these owners are not primarily  motivated by economic returns. HUD data show that nonprofit  organizations own about 36 percent of the properties with mortgages  scheduled to mature in the next 10 years. Since mortgage maturity results  in an improvement in property cash flow, reaching mortgage maturity  would not by itself necessarily trigger removal from the affordable  inventory. Additionally, a nonprofit organization would be more likely to  keep the property affordable to low-income tenants because to do  otherwise would conflict with its basic mission of providing affordable  housing. Thus, nonprofit owners would likely continue to renew Section 8  contracts. 3. We request an inventory, in chart form, of all the units that will reach  maturity in the next 10 years. The inventory should include:  Property name, city, and state  Property MSA (metropolitan statistical area)", "Month and year of mortgage maturity  Type of multifamily program for each development  Number of units for each development  Expiration date of Section 8 contract for each development (if any)", "Contract status of Section 8 contract for each development (if any)", "Number of section 8 units for each development (if any)", "Total number of units covered under each of the programs and their   Total number of units for all developments  Total number of units that are occupied  Total number of section 8 units  Type of families housed, i.e. families, elderly, etc.", "Whether the unit is owned by a profit or nonprofit organization All the data elements cited above are included in the CD-ROM that  accompanies this report. Data on property inspection scores, subsidy  utilization rates, street addresses, and the congressional district in which  the property is located are also included. 4. What will happen to the units and hence the families occupying the  units once the mortgages expire?  What rights, if any, do these  tenants have regarding their rent costs subsequent to the expiration  of the mortgage term and pay off of the entire mortgage principal?", "Provided there is no other subsidy, owners of properties whose HUD- subsidized mortgages have matured are generally no longer required to  charge reduced rents to tenants that meet HUD\u2019s income limits, and the  tenants do not have any rights or protections. Depending on the owner\u2019s  decision, tenants could face higher rents and, if they were unable to afford  them, would have to move. However, if the units are covered by a rental  assistance contract, the tenants would not be affected by the mortgage  maturity. As long as the rental assistance is in force, these tenants would  continue to benefit from subsidized rents.  5. Under existing laws and regulations, are there Federal government  incentives that HUD could offer the owners of the multifamily  housing developments to keep properties affordable upon maturity of  the FHA mortgage and pay off the principal?  Under existing law and  regulations, what types of incentives are available for each state and  the District of Columbia that could be made available to the owners of  the multifamily housing developments?  Have they been successful?", "HUD does not offer property owners any specific incentive to keep  properties affordable to low-income tenants after maturity of their HUD  mortgage. During the 1990s, HUD established incentive programs to deal  with the loss of affordable units because owners were prepaying their  mortgages and opting out of their Section 8 contracts.  These incentives  include the Mark-up-to-Market program, Section 236 Decoupling, and  Section 202 Prepayments. These incentives do not directly address the  termination of the affordability requirements resulting from mortgage  maturity. Rather, they can extend, under certain circumstances, the  affordability period beyond the original term of the mortgage, as in the  Section 236 Decoupling incentive, or allow property owners to be better  positioned financially to continue providing affordable housing, as in the  case of Section 202 Prepayments and Mark-up-to-Market.", "State and local agencies identified tools and incentives to preserve  affordable housing, but not specifically for addressing maturing HUD  mortgages. The 226 state and local agencies that responded to our survey  commented on the effectiveness of 18 tools and incentives as a mean to  preserve HUD\u2019s affordable rental housing. Of the 18, 6 were funded directly  by the federal government, while 12 were administered by state and local  governments and were not directly federally funded. However, there was  no evidence that they have been used to protect properties when HUD  mortgages mature. This may be because relatively few mortgages have  matured to date. 6. What are the possible effects if the Section 8 contract maturity date is  shorter than the FHA mortgage maturity date?", "The effects depend largely on the owner\u2019s decision about the future use of  the property. As noted in our response to question 2, an owner\u2019s decision to  renew a Section 8 contract can be influenced by a number of factors, such  as neighborhood incomes, the condition of the property, and owner\u2019s  mission. Consideration of these factors would likely also apply to  properties where the Section 8 contract expiration date is earlier than the  scheduled maturity date on the HUD mortgage.", "When mortgage maturity is imminent, an owner may also consider what the  impact of losing the interest rate subsidy as well as paying off the HUD  mortgage will be on the property\u2019s cash flow. When interest rate subsidies  were first paid to properties built in the 1960s and 1970s, they represented  substantial assistance to property owners. Over time, inflation has  substantially reduced the value of this subsidy relative to the rental  assistance subsidy, which is adjusted annually to account for increases in  operating costs. Project-based rental assistance now provides the bulk of  the assistance to these subsidized properties. Therefore, it is possible that,  under certain circumstances, such as where a surrounding neighborhood  has gentrified and the property can be upgraded at a reasonable cost, a for- profit owner may decide to forgo the remaining interest rate subsidy  payments and prepay the mortgage at the time the project-based contract  expires. However, because most owners have had the right to prepay  mortgages and opt out of their Section 8 contracts for a number of years,  the economic factors that drive the decision to convert to market rate when  mortgages mature are no different than in the past.", "From the tenant\u2019s perspective, if the owner elects to enter into a new  Section 8 contract, the tenants in assisted units will be protected for the  duration of the contract. If the owner elects not to enter into a new Section  8 contract with or without prepaying the mortgage, the tenants in the units  that previously received rental assistance would receive enhanced  vouchers. Enhanced vouchers give the tenants the right to stay in their  units and generally protect them from rent increases in the properties after  the Section 8 contract expires, regardless of the maturity date of the HUD  mortgage. 7. For those mortgages that have reached mortgage maturity or are soon  to do so, what actions, if any, have been taken by state, local, or other  bodies to ensure that affordability has been maintained after the FHA  mortgages are extinguished or are about to be paid off in their  entirety?  Have the efforts been successful?", "According to officials from the four national housing and community  development organizations we contacted, because relatively few HUD  mortgages have matured to date, their member state and local agencies  have not experienced the need to deal with mortgage maturity. They noted  that their member agencies can offer tools and incentives, such as loans  and grants, to owners to keep properties affordable after mortgage  maturity. However, about three-quarters of the state and local agencies that  responded to our survey reported that they do not track the maturity dates  on HUD mortgages, and none provided examples of tools or incentives  used specifically to keep units affordable after mortgage maturity. 8. Please provide data on how many units/developments have already  reached mortgage maturity, the current status of those  units/developments, and whether those units/developments are still  serving low-income families.", "Our review of HUD\u2019s data showed that HUD-insured mortgages at 32  properties matured between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2002.  Sixteen of the 32 properties are still serving low-income tenants through  project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. For 13 of these 16  properties, the rental assistance covers 100 percent of the units (799  assisted units), and for the remaining 3 properties, it covers 54 percent of  the units (174 assisted units).", "Using HUD\u2019s archived data for inactive properties, we attempted to contact  the property managers of the remaining 16 properties (consisting of 1,997  units) to determine if the properties currently serve low-income tenants.  We were able to obtain rent information for 10 properties.  We found that  all 10 (none of which have project-based rental assistance contracts) are  still primarily serving low-income tenants and that the current rents are  affordable to tenants with incomes below 50 percent of area median  income. According to HUD\u2019s database, only 2 of these properties ever had  Section 8 project-based contracts, and both expired in early 2000. We could  not obtain actual tenant incomes since property managers told us that they  are not required to maintain such information for properties without  federal use restrictions.  9. The provision of enhanced vouchers does not currently apply to  Section 236 or Section 221 (d) (3) mortgages that mature. What is the  impact on the current tenant population upon mortgage maturity?", "There is no statutory requirement for HUD to offer tenants special  protections, such as enhanced vouchers, when a HUD mortgage matures.  However, tenants who receive rental assistance in properties with maturing  Section 236 or Section 221(d)(3) mortgages would be eligible for enhanced  vouchers under rental assistance programs, such as project-based Section  8. Depending on property owners\u2019 decisions, tenants in these properties  who do not receive rental assistance could face higher, possibly  unaffordable, rents. 10. What recommendations does GAO propose to address or alleviate the  potential loss of affordable housing arising from FHA mortgage  maturations?", "Awareness of the potential for a HUD mortgage to mature, while not a  guarantee of action, could help state or local agencies\u2019 ability to use  available tools or incentives for preserving properties\u2019 affordability to low- income tenants. Therefore, to help state and local housing agencies track  HUD-subsidized properties that may leave HUD\u2019s programs upon mortgage  maturity or for other reasons, we are recommending that the Secretary of  HUD solicit the views of state and local agencies to determine (1) the  specific information concerning HUD-subsidized properties that would be  most useful to their affordability preservation efforts and (2) the most  effective format for making this information available, and then use the  results to modify the current means of conveying the data on these  properties to make the data more readily available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Mark Egger, Daniel Garcia-Diaz, Nadine  Garrick, Curtis Groves, Austin Kelly, John McDonough, John McGrail,  Luann Moy, Barbara Roesmann, William Sparling, Thomas Taydus, and  James Vitarello made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
