In addition to the research and development efforts, the official stated that  DOD has ongoing additive manufacturing activities within the operational  communities, such as military depots and arsenals, and it does not  systematically track these communities either.", "Additionally, while DOD components share information on the additive  manufacturing equipment they own, DOD does not systematically track  these machines to ensure that the components are aware of each other\u2019s  additive manufacturing equipment. DOD has additive manufacturing  machines whose costs range from a few thousand dollars to millions of  dollars. In a constrained budget environment, it is also important to  leverage these resources. According to officials within the U.S. Army  RDECOM, through coordination groups, such as that command\u2019s  community of practice, officials share and understand each other\u2019s  equipment and capabilities. In addition, according to these officials, the  Navy and Air Force have provided information to the Army regarding their  respective departments\u2019 equipment. According to Army and Navy officials,  the Army and Navy also have equipment lists posted on a DOD  collaboration website called milSuite. According to an official at the U.S.  Air Force Research Laboratory, the Air Force does not have an official  inventory listing of additive manufacturing equipment. However, the  official added that a team has accomplished a recent tasking and visits to  the Air Logistics complexes to determine the equipment and capabilities  available and in use.", "Furthermore, DOD does not systematically track actual or potential  performance and combat capability improvements, cost savings, or  lessons learned. DOD component officials we interviewed have shared\u2014 within their respective components and to a lesser degree with other  components\u2014information on their individual performance and combat  capability improvements, as well as on some cost savings attributable to  additive manufacturing. For example, according to Army Rapid Equipping  Force officials, they participate in a community of practice to share their  lessons learned so that others can be informed about the needs of end  users when developing their research priorities. The various DOD  components are at different stages of research and implementation.  However, DOD does not have a systematic process to obtain and  disseminate the results and lessons learned across the components.  Without this information, the department may not be able to leverage the  components\u2019 respective experiences.", "U.S. Army RDECOM officials agreed that it is important to improve cross- communication among the services and agencies, to avoid having to re- invent advances while they continue to expand the implementation of  these technologies and capabilities. The officials added that the Materials  and Manufacturing Processes Community of Interest already reports to  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and  Engineering and to the DOD Science and Technology executives on the  science and technology funding associated with materials and  manufacturing. Therefore, the Army believes that DOD already has  oversight and awareness. According to its chairperson, the Materials and  Manufacturing Processes Community of Interest (a group that comprises  eight technical teams) performs some level of activity in additive  manufacturing, but it does not have a team that focuses solely on additive  manufacturing. The chairperson added that this community of interest  does not systematically track all aspects of additive manufacturing, such  as medical, and that the information that is tracked and communicated to  OSD is rolled up to a high level and submitted to the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. An official  within that office agreed that additional coordination of additive  manufacturing efforts across the department would be helpful. The official  stated that the office does not track all aspects of additive manufacturing.", "DOD does not systematically track all department-wide additive  manufacturing efforts because the department has not designated a lead  or focal point at a senior level, such as OSD, to oversee the development  and implementation of an approach to department-wide coordination.  Specifically, the department has not established a lead to develop and  implement an approach for systematically (1) tracking department-wide  activities and resources, including funding and an inventory of additive  manufacturing equipment; and results of these activities, such as additive  manufacturing performance and combat capability improvements and  cost savings, along with lessons learned; and (2) disseminating the  results of these activities, and an inventory of additive manufacturing  equipment. A senior official within the Office of Manufacturing and  Industrial Base Policy was aware of the various coordination groups. The  official also saw value in collecting certain types of additive manufacturing  information. We recognize that while additive manufacturing has been in  existence since the 1980s, it is still in its early stages as compared with  the techniques of conventional manufacturing, especially with respect to  producing critical parts such as those for aircraft. As the technology  evolves, it is important for OSD to systematically track and disseminate  the results of these additive manufacturing efforts department-wide.  Without designating a lead or focal point responsible for developing an  approach for systematically (1) tracking department-wide activities and  resources, and results of these activities; and (2) disseminating,  department-wide, the results of these activities and an inventory of  additive manufacturing equipment, DOD officials may not obtain the  information they need to leverage resources and ongoing experiences of  the various components."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Additive manufacturing has been in existence since the 1980s, and DOD  has begun looking toward utilizing it to make existing product supply  chains more efficient by enabling on-demand production, which could  reduce the need to maintain large product inventories and spare parts;  and enabling the production of parts and products closer to the location of  their consumers, thereby helping DOD to achieve its missions. The  technology is in its relative infancy, and it may be years or decades  before it can achieve levels of confidence comparable to those available  from conventional manufacturing processes. Across the department the  various DOD components are engaged in activities and are expending  resources in their respective efforts to determine how to use additive  manufacturing to produce critical products. However, DOD does not  systematically track and disseminate the results of additive manufacturing  efforts department-wide, nor has it designated a lead to coordinate these  efforts.

The analysts were consistent in their  respective assessments of whether the briefing included the elements  and therefore it was not necessary for a third analyst to resolve any  differences. We assessed the briefing document, with the recognition that  it was not meant to be a stand-alone document, but rather accompanied  an oral briefing. We met with officials from the Office of Manufacturing  and Industrial Base Policy, America Makes, and the military services to  determine the extent to which they were involved in creating the briefing  document and to obtain additional information about additive  manufacturing.
