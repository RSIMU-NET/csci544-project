The act requires that employers pay locally prevailing wage rates, including fringe benefits, to laborers and mechanics employed on the more than $40 billion of federal construction projects a year. Since 1931, the Congress has enacted many statutes that extend Davis-Bacon\u2019s prevailing wage provisions to construction projects for which the federal government provides only partial funding, such as the construction of local schools. The Department of Labor, which administers the act, surveys construction contractors and other interested third parties to obtain information on wages paid to workers in each construction craft and uses the data submitted on these survey forms to determine local prevailing wage rates.", "In previous reports and testimony, we expressed concern that Labor\u2019s procedures for determining prevailing wage rates were vulnerable to the use of inaccurate or fraudulent data. The use of such data could lead to the payment of wages that are either lower than what workers should receive or higher than the actual prevailing wages, which would inflate federal construction costs at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. We also noted that basing wage determinations on old wage data raises questions about whether the wage results still reflect current conditions. In 1996, we recommended that Labor verify wage data it receives by obtaining appropriate documentation from a sample of participating employers or conducting a limited number of on-site reviews of employer wage data.", "The House Appropriations Committee has also expressed concerns about the accuracy and timeliness of Davis-Bacon wage determinations. The Committee\u2019s reports on appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and related agencies for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 directed Labor to ensure that a portion of the funds appropriated for the wage survey program be used to randomly sample all data submissions to verify their accuracy. Moreover, the reports specified that Labor select a sample of all wage data submissions for on-site data verification against actual payroll records. In response to a request in the Committee reports, we reviewed these verification activities to determine what Labor has done in response to the Committee\u2019s directive that it verify a random sample of employers\u2019 wage data submissions and select a sample of submissions for on-site data verification and the likely effect of these efforts on the accuracy and timeliness of Davis-Bacon wage determinations.", "We are sending this report to you because of your committees\u2019 oversight responsibilities for Labor (see list of addressees at the end of this letter). We conducted our review between June and October 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For information on our methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Davis-Bacon Act and related legislation require employers on federally funded construction projects valued in excess of $2,000 or federally assisted projects to pay their workers no less than the prevailing wage rate. According to its regulations, the Department of Labor determines the wages \u201cprevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the . . . city, town, village, or other civil subdivision of the State in which the work is to be performed.\u201d The Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for making these wage determinations.", "In addition to making these determinations, Labor is responsible for ensuring that employers covered by the law pay at least the mandated wage. While some of the same staff work on both responsibilities, Labor estimates that in fiscal year 1997, it used the equivalent of 51 full-time staff and spent about $5.5 million on the process of determining Davis-Bacon prevailing wages at both its Washington, D.C., headquarters and five regional offices.", "To determine the prevailing wage rates, Labor periodically conducts surveys, called \u201carea surveys,\u201d to collect data on wages and fringe benefits paid to workers in similar job classifications on comparable construction projects in a specific geographic area. The agency solicits information from employers and third parties, such as representatives of unions and contractor associations. As shown in figure 1, after receiving and analyzing the data, Labor issues wage determinations for a series of job classifications such as electricians, carpenters, and drywallers in specific geographic areas varying in size from a section of a county to an entire state. For example, the prevailing wage determination for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area in 1996 included individual wage rates for 143 different construction crafts. For a more complete description of the wage determination process, see appendix II.", "Labor relies on the voluntary participation of contractors and other interested parties in conducting the wage survey. While participation is voluntary, failure to supply truthful answers can have serious consequences: it is a crime under federal law (18 U.S.C. 1001) to knowingly submit false data to the government, and it is a crime under federal law (18 U.S.C. 1341) to use the U.S. mail for fraudulent purposes.", "Contractors and interested third parties generally submit data on wage survey forms, called WD-10s, which are supplied by WHD. As shown in the sample forms WD-10 in figure 2, regardless of whether data are submitted by contractors or third parties, a separate WD-10 is submitted for each construction project and for each contractor that employed workers on that project. Wage rate determinations are issued for different job classifications, such as drywallers and electricians. In fiscal year 1997, WHD issued 1,860 individual wage rate determinations, which were based on information obtained from 43 area wage surveys.", "In accordance with its regulations, Labor determines an area\u2019s prevailing wage rate on the basis of the 50-percent rule, which states that the prevailing wage will be the wage paid to the majority of workers employed in a specific job classification. If the same rate is not paid to a majority of those workers in the classification, the prevailing wage will be the average of the wages paid, weighted by the total number of workers employed in the classification. See the prevailing wage formula in figure 2 for an example of this calculation using the two hypothetical forms WD-10.", "We previously reported that Labor\u2019s wage determination process contained internal control weaknesses that contributed to a lack of confidence in the resulting wage determinations. These weaknesses included limitations in Labor\u2019s verification of the voluntarily submitted wage and fringe benefit data. We recognized, however, that accurately reported wage data are not sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the wage determinations. For example, in a previous report, we concluded that reporting bias resulting from the voluntary nature of the wage surveys may also reduce the accuracy of the wage determinations.", "In 1995, a congressional committee heard specific allegations that inaccurate and fraudulent wage data were submitted and used to determine prevailing wage rates in Oklahoma City. Both GAO and Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) then received congressional requests to review Labor\u2019s wage determination process. Labor responded to the allegations by introducing a policy to verify a sample of wage data forms received from third parties, but it did not extend this verification process to forms submitted by contractors. Before that, Labor had contacted both contractors and third parties to obtain clarification about data that were inconsistent or unclear, but it had not attempted to verify data that were not obviously inaccurate.", "In May 1996, we recommended that Labor obtain appropriate documentation or conduct a limited number of on-site inspection reviews to verify a sample of wage data submissions. Our recommendation was intended to improve data reliability and increase confidence in the accuracy of wage data in the short term while Labor continued its longer-term efforts to address larger weaknesses in the wage determination process. We expected that verification would also increase the accuracy of future wage determinations by reducing errors through educating both contractors and third parties about how to complete wage data forms and deterring the submission of fraudulent data.", "In March 1997, Labor\u2019s OIG issued a report on its audit of a judgmental sample of wage data collected for use in calculating prevailing wage rate determinations issued in calendar year 1995. The audit did not find evidence of fraud or deliberate misreporting of wage data. However, OIG determined that inaccurate data submitted by both employers and third parties were frequently used in prevailing wage determinations and that access to payroll records was the most important factor to successfully verifying wage data. OIG echoed our suggestion that verification efforts be viewed as temporary steps until more fundamental reforms in Labor\u2019s survey methodology could be made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Has Implemented a Program to Verify Wage Data", "paragraphs": ["In response to the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s directive and our recommendation, Labor has implemented a program to verify wage survey data submitted by construction contractors and interested third parties, such as contractor associations and trade unions. To verify these data, Labor established procedures to select samples of wage data forms for telephone verification that differ depending on the entity that submitted the form. In addition, Labor has hired a private accounting firm to conduct on-site verification reviews. In both the telephone and on-site verification process, all data\u2014regardless of which party submitted them\u2014are verified only with the contractors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Telephone Verification Procedures Differ Depending on Whether the Data Are Supplied by Contractors or Third Parties", "paragraphs": ["In response to our recommendation, in June 1996 Labor expanded its telephone verification process begun the previous year from one of verifying wage data submitted by third parties to one that also verifies wage data submitted by contractors. However, Labor verifies a different percentage of wage data forms submitted by third parties than that for data forms submitted by contractors. In addition, regardless of who submitted the wage data form, Labor asks for supporting documentation only from contractors, not from third parties.", "Labor verifies a larger percentage of wage data forms submitted by interested third parties than for those submitted by contractors, as shown in figure 3. For wage data submitted by third parties, wage analysts must select every tenth\u201410 percent\u2014WD-10 wage data form submitted (and no fewer than two WD-10 forms) for verification with the contractor. In contrast, for wage data submitted by contractors, Labor requires that regions select every fiftieth\u20142 percent\u2014wage data form (but no fewer than five) for telephone verification. Regional wage officials told us that they always use the sample size required by Labor\u2019s national office for contractors, but they exceed it for third parties. For example, wage analysts in one region told us that they verify 100 percent of wage data forms submitted by third parties by requiring that all such forms be signed by contractors who paid the wages that were reported. A senior wage analyst in another region told us that they conduct telephone verification of almost all third-party wage data forms.", "Labor\u2019s procedures require that wage analysts verify data only with the contractors, not with third parties, even for data submitted by third parties. The procedures require the regional offices to send letters to the contractors selected for verification requesting that supporting payroll documents be mailed to Labor. (See app. III for a sample of the letter Labor sends to contractors.) Wage analysts contact the contractors selected for verification by telephone to verify wage data regardless of whether the contractor has provided the requested documents. Wage analysts told us that they generally do not receive the documents requested from the contractor and, therefore, rely on the contractor\u2019s verbal assurance that the data are correct. When the wages reported by the contractor, either with documentation or with oral confirmation, are different from those originally submitted, Labor replaces the wage data submitted on the WD-10. When the information provided by the contractor does not agree with the data submitted by a third party, regional wage analysts told us that they always take the word of the contractor over the information supplied by the third party. Unlike the process Labor uses with contractors, Labor seldom notifies third parties that the wage data forms they submitted have been selected for verification and does not ask them for documentary evidence to support the data they provided.", "Even though information from contractors who participate in the verification process sometimes leads to changes in the wage data, Labor includes in the prevailing wage calculation data reported by contractors who refuse to participate in the verification process, thereby assuming these data to be accurate. Labor does not keep records that would allow us to assess how often this occurs. One of Labor\u2019s regional offices, however, provided data showing that in the 18-month period from April 1, 1997, to September 30, 1998, wage analysts in that region were unable to verify data by telephone for 41\u201457 percent\u2014of the 72 WD-10 forms submitted by contractors that were selected for verification. Labor\u2019s procedures allow it to assume that these data are correct and to include them in the wage calculation. However, this assumption is questionable because, of the remaining 31 forms that were verified by telephone, analysts found errors in data submitted in 9 of the forms, or 29 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Uses a Private Accounting Firm to Conduct On-Site Verification", "paragraphs": ["In April 1997, Labor began a process of on-site wage data verification under a contract awarded to a private accounting firm. As of September 30, 1998, Labor had paid the firm a total of $1 million for on-site verification for fiscal years 1997 and 1998, and had awarded a new contract to the same firm for $500,000 in fiscal year 1999.", "The contract requires the accounting firm to review a sample of payroll records to verify wage survey data and interview employers to obtain information to assist in Labor\u2019s efforts to reengineer the wage determination process. Labor selects what it describes as a 10-percent sample of the wage data forms submitted by both contractors and interested third parties for a specific area wage survey. It reaches this percentage by selecting every tenth data form for verification. In fact, the percentage of WD-10s selected for on-site verification usually exceeds 10 percent. This is because, after selecting every tenth data form submitted, Labor adds to the set of forms the auditor will review all other usable WD-10s that could be examined at that contractor\u2019s office, such as the forms for other projects for which data were reported. As a result, 10 percent is the minimum sample size; the actual sample size varies from one survey to another. For example, for the 9 surveys for which final audit reports were completed, the actual percentage of WD-10s selected for on-site verification ranged from 10 to 56 percent.", "As with the telephone verification conducted by WHD wage analysts, auditors verify the data on-site only with the contractor who employed the workers, even when the data were submitted by third parties. The WHD regional office mails the contractors selected for verification a letter notifying them that an auditor will contact them to request a visit to their establishments. (See app. III for a sample letter sent to contractors.) The contractor is asked to make payroll records available to the auditor to confirm that the data reported on the WD-10 are complete and correct. While the contractor\u2019s cooperation with the auditor is requested, it is voluntary for contractors whose wage data cover private construction projects, because Labor is not authorized to require contractors to provide records for such projects. In contrast, contractors on federal projects are required by law to grant access to payroll records related to the federal projects. Labor, however, does not specify this in its letters to these contractors. Labor is concerned that doing so might discourage contractors from participating in future Davis-Bacon surveys, which could reduce the number of survey respondents and thus affect the accuracy of wage determinations.", "The auditor compares the data reported on the WD-10 with the payroll records for the reported project. Discrepancies between the original WD-10 submitted and the payroll records or contractor\u2019s testimony are recorded by the auditor. After completing the audit of the area wage survey data, the auditor submits a preliminary report to Labor, which includes a list of all discrepancies and a list of contractors that did not participate in the verification process. Labor reviews the preliminary report and makes follow-up telephone calls with contractors as necessary. After Labor reviews the auditor\u2019s findings, the accounting firm submits a final report reflecting changes on which Labor and the firm have agreed. Regional wage analysts told us that only after Labor receives the final report do the analysts incorporate appropriate changes to wage data, recalculate wage data, and forward recommended wage rate determinations to Labor\u2019s national office for final review and issuance.", "During the 15-month period from the beginning of the on-site verification process in April 1997 to June 30, 1998, Labor sent 85 surveys to the auditors for on-site verification. As of September 30, 1998, the auditors had completed audits for 30 of the 85 area surveys and had issued final reports for 9 of these.", "The auditors reported finding errors in both the wages and the number of workers reported in the majority of wage data forms they reviewed. Specifically, for the nine surveys for which they had completed final reports, the auditors found errors in wage rates reported in about 70 percent of all wage data forms reviewed. Labor has issued new wage determinations based on four of these nine surveys (see fig. 4)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Verification Will Have Limited Impact on Accuracy of Prevailing Wage Determinations and Will Reduce Timeliness", "paragraphs": ["Verification efforts conducted to date will have a limited impact on the accuracy of prevailing wage rate determinations and will increase the time required to issue them. The extent to which the verification process improves the accuracy of Labor\u2019s prevailing wage determinations will be limited by the congressional directive to use a random sample of wage data forms to select wage data for verification and the procedures Labor uses to implement the directive. In addition, on-site verification has added time to the wage determination process, increasing the likelihood that data used will be outdated. The on-site verification process has, however, provided information that Labor is using as it tries to improve the process for future wage determinations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Errors Identified, but Impact on Accuracy of Wage Determinations Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Although Labor has identified and corrected numerous errors in the wage data submitted, it has been able to correct only the limited number of wage data forms verified. Since this represents only a small portion of the total number of data forms submitted, these corrections have only a minimal impact on the accuracy of the data used to calculate wage determinations. As a result, even though we found that errors the auditors identified in all nine area surveys averaged 76 cents per hour, Labor officials estimate that the changes to wage determinations will amount to an average of 10 cents per hour.", "Furthermore, both the Committee directive to use a random sample of wage data forms to select wage data for verification and the procedures Labor uses to implement the directive also limit the extent to which errors found will improve the accuracy of wage determinations. While a random sample is often assumed to be the most effective approach to selecting a sample, it is not the best approach for verification in this situation. It would be impractical to verify a large enough random sample of wage forms to ensure that verification would have an impact on the accuracy of the wage determination. Moreover, the procedure Labor uses to verify wage data (1) does not take into account whether the data it selects for verification are likely to be used in calculating wage determinations, (2) assumes that data from contractors that refuse access to supporting documentation are correct, and (3) does not attempt to verify data with third-party submitters when contractors are unable to provide or refuse access to supporting documentation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Verification Sample Not Large Enough to Ensure Impact on Accuracy of Wage Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Although the House Committee directed Labor to use a random sample to select wage data forms to verify the accuracy of wage data, Labor does not select a large enough number of data forms to ensure that the errors found will improve the accuracy of wage determinations, nor would it be feasible to do so. Although random sampling is sometimes the best approach to selecting data, in some circumstances other sampling strategies are more effective. A random sample would allow Labor to assume that data found to be in error were representative of all data submitted, and Labor could adjust the prevailing wage rate rather than adjusting the data on only the WD-10s selected for verification. However, the sample size needed for this approach would require Labor to verify most of the wage data submitted. Conversely, a carefully chosen judgmental sample would allow Labor to select wage data forms for which correcting errors found would have the greatest effect on the accuracy of the wage determinations.", "To select a representative random sample that would ensure the accuracy of the data used to determine prevailing wage rates, Labor would have to sample workers within each job classification rather than wage data forms, which often combine job classifications, as it does now. Labor currently determines the amount of wage data to be verified by selecting a uniform percentage of WD-10s for each area survey, ranging from 2 percent to 10 percent. However, because Labor determines multiple prevailing wage rates, one for each job classification, it must select a sample of wage data from every job classification within a survey to ensure a representative sample for all prevailing wage rates. Since wage data forms often include data for multiple job classifications, sampling wage data forms alone does not ensure representativeness within specific job classifications.", "Labor would also have to select a sufficient number of workers within each job class to meet the statistical criteria for appropriately projecting from sampled cases to all the wage data. However, data submitted on the number of workers within a job class can be small, often fewer than 10. As a result, Labor would need to select a sample size equal or close to the total number of workers. For example, we calculated that the sample size required for a statistically representative sample would require that Labor verify all data submitted for 40 of 45 job classifications in one fiscal year 1997 area survey in order to be within 50 cents per hour of the correct wage. For all job classifications, Labor would have had to verify the wages of more than 5 times the number of workers it verified, 439 rather than 78 of the 664 workers for whom wages were reported. (See app. IV.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Selects Wage Data for Verification That Will Have Little or No Impact on Accuracy of Wage Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Using a random sample does not allow Labor to judgmentally select for verification wage data that will have the greatest potential impact on accuracy. For example, Labor verifies wage data that it does not expect to, and does not, use to calculate prevailing wage determinations. In addition, Labor does not consider the cost of travel and staff time in selecting wage data forms to verify.", "Of the 30 area surveys for which on-site verification preliminary reports had been completed as of September 30, 1998, 29 included verification of wage data that would not be used in calculating prevailing wage rates. The data verified would not be used for two reasons. First, in some instances, wage determinations would be based on wage rates included in collective bargaining agreements, not on the wage data reported\u2014whether the data were accurate or not. In general, when the same wage is paid to 50 percent or more of the workers employed in a job classification, the wage rate is the same because it is specified in a collective bargaining agreement that covers the specified job classification. When this occurs, Labor does not determine the prevailing wage rates on the basis of data reported on the WD-10s. Instead, it uses the collective bargaining rate as the prevailing wage rate. Second, in some instances, Labor knew it would not use the wage data because it had received insufficient data within the specific job classification to allow it to issue a wage determination. Labor\u2019s procedures require that it receive responses from a minimum of 25 percent of the contractors and third parties it contacts for data and wages covering a minimum of three workers from two contractors to determine the prevailing wage. When Labor receives too few responses, it does not issue a new wage determination.", "For example, for one of the four area surveys for which Labor has issued prevailing wage rate determinations, none of the verified wages were used to determine the prevailing wage rates. For this specific survey, the rate specified in the collective bargaining agreement was used for 34 of the 36 individual job classifications. Data for the remaining two job classifications were not used because Labor did not receive sufficient data for these two job classifications from the survey responses. Thus, although the on-site verification for this one survey cost about $40,000, and it required 5 weeks to complete the preliminary report, none of the results were used.", "Labor also does not balance the benefits against the costs of verifying specific wage data forms when selecting its sample. For example, selecting wage data forms with wages reported for the greatest number of workers within a specific job classification has the potential for greater benefit in improving the accuracy of the wage determination than does selecting and verifying wages for a smaller number of workers. Using the sample WD-10s in figure 2, if Labor\u2019s random sample resulted in verifying submission 2, which includes data for only 2 of a total of 82 workers for whom wages were used in the calculation, correcting even large errors would have little impact on the prevailing wage determination because only these 2 wage rates could be adjusted. On the other hand, even a small error in wage rates reported for the 80 workers would have a direct effect on the wage determination. Using the hypothetical WD-10s in figure 2, if the fringe benefits reported on submission 1 were incorrectly omitted from submission 2, correcting the wages would increase the prevailing wage rate from $18.64 to $18.71, an increase of 7 cents. However, as figure 5 shows, if the workers did not receive the fringe benefits on submission 1, which includes data on 80 workers, correcting the error would reduce the prevailing wage rate from $18.64 to $16.00, a decrease of $2.64.", "Labor also does not consider the cost of accessing payroll records when selecting wage data forms for verification. To do on-site verification, the accounting firm\u2019s auditors must contact individual contractors and visit their administrative offices to review payroll records; these offices may be located far from one another. For example, as shown in figure 6, for the area wage survey covering Lawrence and Greene counties in Pennsylvania, contractors\u2019 offices were located in six states and were as far away as Texas and Massachusetts. Using Labor\u2019s systematic selection process, auditors would attempt to visit the contractor\u2019s administrative office for submission 1 in our example, regardless of the great distance from the other sites and the small number of drywallers whose reported wages were to be verified.", "Labor assumes that data from contractors that are unable to provide or refuse access to supporting documentation are correct by including them in the wage rate calculations. A more reasonable assumption would be that data from contractors who refuse access have a greater chance of being inaccurate than data from contractors who provide access. Labor did not have comprehensive data on the reasons contractors would not provide access to the payroll records necessary to verify reported wage data. Both Labor\u2019s wage analysts and the on-site accounting firm auditors reported that contractors had many reasons for not participating, such as not wanting to devote the necessary resources to access the records or that the records were no longer available. It is also possible, however, that wage data may be fraudulent or carelessly reported, because contractors who knowingly submit fraudulent data may be unlikely to voluntarily submit to an audit of their payroll records out of fear of prosecution for committing a federal crime.", "As shown in figure 7, 27 percent of the contractors selected for verification either refused or were unable to provide on-site auditors access to some or all of the payroll records required for verification. For the 30 on-site audits for which Labor has received preliminary reports, auditors were unable to visit 20 percent, or 59, of the 293 contractors selected for on-site verification either because the contractors would not participate in on-site verification or the accounting firm was unable to schedule an acceptable time for auditors to visit. Another 7 percent of the contractors denied or were unable to provide access to some or all of the necessary payroll records after the auditors arrived at the contractors\u2019 offices. Labor\u2019s OIG found in its verification review that access to payroll records was the most important factor in successfully verifying wage data.", "While Labor does not have legal authority under the Davis-Bacon Act to access payroll records for workers involved in private construction, it does have authority to access such records for federally funded or assisted construction work covered by the act. Labor officials told us that they do not exercise this right because to do so might result in reduced accuracy of future wage determinations if it discouraged contractors from voluntarily providing wage data for future surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Verifying Data Only With Contractors Limits Accuracy of Wage Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Labor\u2019s procedure of verifying wage data only with contractors also limits the accuracy gains achievable from the verification process and could actually result in decreased accuracy. For example, our review of on-site verification reports found wage data, including fringe benefit data, submitted by third parties that auditors were unable to verify through the contractor. The contractor either did not have records on fringe benefits paid or refused the auditors access to any payroll records. In some cases in which the contractor did not verify the accuracy of the fringe benefits, the auditors recorded $0 under the fringe benefits as though the reported data were inaccurate. These workers, however, were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Especially for fringe benefits paid under collective bargaining agreements, unions often have documentation to verify amounts paid. In fact, regional wage analysts told us that, in some cases, unions may be the only source of data on fringe benefits. By not seeking documentation from the third party, the verification process may have erroneously reduced the amount of wages and fringe benefits paid and thus contributed to a less accurate wage determination."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Verification Process Adds Time to Issuance of Wage Determinations", "paragraphs": ["As would be expected, verification efforts have increased the time required to issue wage determinations after the area survey has been completed. Labor does not collect data on the amount of time required to complete telephone verification, but Labor officials who administer the wage determination process estimated that telephone verification added an average of 2 weeks to the process. Telephone verification can be accomplished relatively quickly because Labor can conduct telephone verification as wage data are being submitted. In addition, it does not require travel, which would add time and expense.", "On-site verification, however, adds much more time\u2014months rather than weeks\u2014to the process because (1) it requires travel and (2) in order to identify all wage data forms related to a specific contractor and more efficiently manage travel, it does not begin until after the survey cutoff date for wage forms has passed. In fact, regional wage analysts told us that they do not send the surveys to the accounting firm for on-site verification until the telephone verification and all preliminary analysis have been completed such that wage determinations are ready to be forwarded to the national office for review and publication. Our analysis of the 30 area surveys for which the auditors submitted preliminary reports shows that the time between when Labor sent the area survey data to the accounting firm for verification and when Labor received the firm\u2019s preliminary report ranged from 36 to 408 days, with an average of 211 days. However, Labor officials told us they cannot begin final calculations until they receive the final report from the auditors, which incorporates the results of discussions with Labor. Other Labor activities, such as reviewing the results of on-site verification audits and making any necessary adjustments to wage determinations before issuance, also add time to the wage determination process, but Labor has no data to estimate the amount of time these activities take. Thus, while the impact verification is having on timeliness is greater than the time elapsed between when Labor forwards the surveys to the auditors and receives the preliminary report, the total time required is not available. WHD officials told us that they expect this delay will decrease over time, attributing some of it to the time required for WHD staff and accounting firm auditors to master the verification process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Verification Process Facilitates Long-Term Efforts to Improve Wage Survey Process", "paragraphs": ["While the effect of the verification process on the accuracy of data used in wage determinations has been minimal, these efforts may have a greater impact over the long term by deterring contractors and third parties from submitting inaccurate or fraudulent data, educating contractors about wage data form procedures, and assisting Labor in its reengineering efforts. Labor officials stated that they had focused their verification procedures on identifying and deterring fraud rather than on ensuring the accuracy of the wage determinations. But they also told us that the value of verification as a deterrent to the submission of fraudulent wage data must be balanced with its potential to deter voluntary participation in future Davis-Bacon Act surveys, which could, conversely, reduce the accuracy of the wage determinations.", "Verification efforts may help educate contractors about how to complete wage survey forms properly. But Labor\u2019s procedure of not including third-party submitters in the verification process limits the potential for verification to improve the accuracy of future wage determinations. Third parties do not benefit from the potential educational value that verification has because they are not informed of any errors identified on the WD-10s they submitted, nor do they learn how to properly complete them.", "Through its verification efforts, Labor has also obtained information that it is using in its long-term efforts to reengineer the wage determination process. Labor included in the on-site verification process questions to contractors about the wage survey form and its terms, such as whether the contractors had difficulty understanding and completing the survey form. Of those contractors who reported confusion or difficulty with the form, many identified the \u201cpeak week\u201d and the number of workers employed during the peak week as major sources of confusion. In addition, the accounting firm found in the course of its on-site payroll verification that contractors and third parties that submitted wage data had difficulty completing the form, including accurately identifying the job classification of workers. The auditors found that these difficulties affected the accuracy of the wage data reported. For example, for the nine area surveys for which the auditors completed final reports, they identified errors in wage data for 38 percent of all contractors visited caused by misidentification of the peak week. Labor is also redesigning its wage reporting form, which responds to concerns raised by contractors during on-site verification.", "Labor is also piloting a statewide survey using wage data for \u201ctotal man-hours\u201d in place of wage data for the peak week."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Without accurate and timely data, Labor cannot determine prevailing wage rates that correctly reflect the labor market. While obtaining accurate wage data through Labor\u2019s voluntary surveys will not ensure that wage rate determinations are accurate, inaccurate data guarantee inaccurate wage determinations. We recognize that achieving 100-percent accuracy is not possible. However, inaccurate prevailing wage determinations could lead to the payment of wages that are either lower than what workers should receive or higher than the actual prevailing wages, which would inflate construction costs at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. A system to verify wage data submitted by contractors and third parties is necessary to ensure that inaccurate data do not have a negative effect on the prevailing wage determination.", "As directed by the House Appropriations Committee, Labor has implemented a process to verify wage data submitted by both contractors and third parties. This process allows it to identify and correct errors it finds in wage data reported. It may also have a positive impact on the accuracy of wage data obtained in future wage surveys by educating contractors on the proper completion of wage data forms. In addition, this process has helped Labor obtain information that will assist it in reengineering efforts. For example, errors in wages reported often occur because of confusion by contractors and third parties over how to report workers and wages for the peak week. Labor is exploring the alternative use of \u201cman-hours\u201d rather than peak week, which may be easier for contractors and third parties to report.", "The process Labor is using, however, is unnecessarily costly, in terms of both money and time. On-site verification is a costly approach to verifying wage data, and it delays the issuance of wage rate determinations by months, especially when compared with telephone verification that is combined with supporting payroll records submitted upon request. On-site verification requires a cadre of auditors to travel to worksites around the country to review payroll records. While Labor\u2019s OIG found that access to payroll records was essential to successfully verifying wage data, the process need not require that the contractor be contacted in person rather than by telephone. Obtaining copies of payroll records by mail as part of the telephone verification is significantly less costly and takes less time.", "Relying on a random rather than a judgmental sample limits the accuracy gains achievable through verification. While a random sample is often assumed to be better than a judgmental sample, it is actually less effective in selecting wage data forms to verify that will have an impact on the accuracy of the wage determinations. Labor does not gain the most significant benefits of a random sample\u2014that is, being able to assume that errors found in verified wage data forms are representative of all wage data forms and adjust wage rates accordingly\u2014because it is not feasible to verify a sufficiently large number of wage data forms. In contrast, a carefully designed judgmental sample to select contractors for verification could consider the likelihood that the data will be used, the number of workers within a job classification, and the geographic dispersion of contractors.", "The impact of Labor\u2019s verification procedures on the accuracy of the wage determinations is also limited by the action it takes when documentation cannot readily be obtained from a contractor. In our view, at least two aspects of Labor\u2019s verification procedures contribute to limiting accuracy. First, contractors may refuse access to supporting documentation for many legitimate reasons\u2014such as the time required\u2014but contractors who refuse to provide the supporting documentation are more likely than those who provide access to have submitted fraudulent or carelessly reported data. Labor, however, (1) accepts the data and uses it as if documentation had supported it and (2) allows federal contractors to deny access to the supporting documentation even though Labor has the legal authority to access their records. While discarding all such data might have negative consequences on Labor\u2019s ability to issue wage determinations, accepting all such data may contribute to inaccurate wage determinations. Labor\u2019s approach does not achieve the needed balance in deciding which data to include and exclude.", "Second, Labor sometimes eliminates or revises data inappropriately when it does not seek supporting documentation from third parties that have submitted it. Wage data submitted for a project by a third party are generally verified against the payroll or oral testimony of the contractor associated with that project. The third party that submitted the original WD-10 is not provided the opportunity to validate the information it submitted; final corrections are generally provided only by the contractor. As a result, data supplied by third parties may be eliminated or revised inaccurately, even though, in some cases, only the third party, not the contractor, can provide supporting documentation, for example, for benefits provided by a union. Supporting documentation provided by third parties could improve the completeness and thus the accuracy of the data used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the cost of verification and increase the benefits, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the WHD Administrator to revise verification procedures to maximize the expected value to be gained from verification.

However, the Department took issue with some of our conclusions concerning the accuracy of survey data submissions by contractors and the use of data from contractors who refuse auditors access to supporting payroll records. Labor also provided technical comments and corrections, and we have revised our report as necessary.", "With regard to the accuracy of the survey data, Labor stated that despite the many errors found by both the on-site auditors and Labor\u2019s OIG, the limited revisions to wage determinations that resulted from correcting these errors demonstrated that the wage determinations closely approximated the accurate prevailing wage rate. We disagree, because the small number of data submissions verified is not a valid representative sample of all data submissions used to calculate the revised wage determinations. Furthermore, the OIG\u2019s report does not support Labor\u2019s conclusion. It states that: \u201cThe errors we discovered did not materially change many of the wage decisions because the data we sampled often represented a small portion of the responses for an individual WH survey. . . . If we had conducted more payroll reviews, we believe more exceptions would have been identified and would have revealed more material errors in published wage decisions.\u201d", "With regard to the use of data when contractors refuse access to the supporting payroll records, Labor disagreed with our conclusion that contractors unable or unwilling to provide auditors access to payroll records are more likely to have submitted fraudulent data than those who provide records. Labor based its conclusions that contractors try to provide accurate and complete information on the data verification that has been done to date by both Labor\u2019s OIG and WHD. Basing conclusions about contractors unwilling or unable to provide access to payroll records on verification of data from contractors that do provide access is not logical or convincing. We continue to believe that employers submitting fraudulent or unsubstantiated wage data forms are unlikely to voluntarily provide access to payroll records for review. Because all verification efforts conducted to date, including those of the OIG, have relied on voluntary access to payroll records, the absence of fraud in verified wage data submissions provides no evidence that contractors who denied access did not submit fraudulent data.", "We have, however, clarified our conclusion on the use of data submitted by contractors or third parties that do not cooperate with verification efforts to allow Labor analysts to use judgment in deciding when to exclude such data from its wage determination calculations. For example, we agree that Labor should consider including data from contractors that routinely cooperated with data verification efforts in the past and whose data were determined to be generally accurate. Another factor to consider would be the possible adverse impact of discarding specific data on Labor\u2019s ability to issue a wage determination.", "Finally, in agreeing to select data using a judgmental sample, Labor stated that it intends to continue selecting some data for verification using a systematic sample, albeit fewer than it does now.

We also obtained a draft of WHD\u2019s procedures for telephone and on-site verification and task orders for on-site verification.

We determined the dollar value of errors in wage rates by calculating the absolute value of the difference between the sum of the reported wages and fringe benefits and the sum of the verified wages and fringe benefits. We weighted the amount of error by the lower of the number of employees reported or the number of employees verified. Because the auditors were not consistent in their analysis and reporting, as necessary we made assumptions about individual wage rates, such as when an average wage rate was reported but individual wage rates were verified. We then calculated the average of the absolute value of error for all workers.", "To determine the percentage of contractors providing full and partial access to payroll records, we analyzed data in the 30 preliminary reports summarizing the results of on-site verification audits. Specifically, we counted the number of selected contractors the auditors reported as refusing access and those the auditors failed to access despite persistent efforts over a matter of weeks or months.

Labor has designated the county as the basic geographic unit for data collection, although Labor also conducts some surveys setting prevailing wage rates for groups of counties. Wage rates are issued for a series of job classifications in the four basic types of construction, so each wage determination requires the calculation of prevailing wages for many different trades, such as electrician, plumber, and carpenter. For example, in 1996 the prevailing wage rates for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area included wage rates for 143 different construction trade occupations. Because there are over 3,000 counties, more than 12,000 surveys could be conducted each year if every county in the United States was surveyed. In fiscal year 1997, Labor issued 1,860 individual wage rate determinations based on 43 area wage surveys.

Labor uses a systematic sample, organizing WD-10s by project and by contractor prior to selection and then selecting them based on a fixed interval. Labor does not require that the first WD-10 selected be based on a number chosen purely by chance. For example, to select a sample for telephone verification of data submitted by contractors, Labor procedures direct the wage analyst to select the 50th, then the 100th. However, because the data are organized prior to selection, the first 49 WD-10s are predetermined on the basis of the specific project and contractor involved. Therefore, the WD-10s for those projects and contractors do not have any chance of being selected for verification.", "Labor officials in the national office told us that because of this, they do not know whether they have selected enough data for telephone and on-site verification to ensure the accuracy of the data used, or whether they have selected more data than needed and are wasting resources. As a result, they do not know the extent to which data used to calculate wage rates have been verified, if at all. For example, using the hypothetical wage data forms in figure 2, Labor would know the number of wage forms it had selected but would not know whether it was verifying wages for drywallers, electricians, or painters. If Labor had selected only one of the two wage data forms for verification, it would disregard the fact that one form reported wages for 80 drywallers and the other form reported wages for 2; it would merely report that it had verified 50 percent of the WD-10s. In one of the on-site audit reports we examined, although Labor sampled 42 percent of WD-10s, the on-site auditor reviewed 28 percent of workers\u2019 wages and fringe benefits out of all wage data submitted for workers employed in that geographic area (390 out of 1,369). This resulted in a review of 100 percent of data used in calculating prevailing wage determinations for job classes such as stone masons, and no verification of data used in other job classes, such as painters.", "To select a random sample that would ensure the accuracy of the data used to determine prevailing wage rates, Labor would have to sample workers within each job classification rather than sample wage data forms as it does now, and it would have to select a sufficient number of workers within each classification. We calculated the sample size required for a statistically representative sample in order to be within 50 cents per hour of the correct wage for one area survey (see table IV.1). The table shows that Labor would need to select a sample size equal or close to the total number of workers, because data reported on the number of workers by job classification can be small.", "Number of additional workers for whom data need to be verified (continued)", "Sheetmetal Worker - Metal Bldg."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Davis-Bacon Act: Process Changes Could Address Vulnerability to Use of Inaccurate Data in Setting Prevailing Wage Rates (GAO/T-HEHS-96-166, June 20, 1996).", "Davis-Bacon Job Targeting (GAO/HEHS-96-151R, June 3, 1996).", "Davis-Bacon Act: Process Changes Could Raise Confidence That Wage Rates Are Based on Accurate Data (GAO/HEHS-96-130, May 31, 1996).", "Addressing the Deficit: Budgetary Implications of Selected GAO Work for Fiscal Year 1996 (GAO/OCG-95-2, Mar. 15, 1995).", "Davis-Bacon Act (GAO/HEHS-94-95R, Feb. 7, 1994).", "The Davis-Bacon Act Should Be Repealed (GAO/HRD-79-18, Apr. 17, 1979).", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
