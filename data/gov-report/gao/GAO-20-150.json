These oversight practices vary.", "While nearly all of the state officials who responded to GAO's survey reported that they perform some review of group and individual insurance plans for compliance with MH/SU parity requirements before they are approved to be sold to consumers, states vary in the frequency and type of reviews they conduct after consumers enroll in plans. For example, officials from 12 states reported that they conducted a targeted review of specific MH/SU parity concerns in 2017 and 2018, with the number of reviews ranging from one to 22 reviews per state.", "DOL and HHS conduct targeted reviews of certain employer-sponsored group plans when they receive information\u2014such as consumer complaints\u2014about possible noncompliance with MH/SU parity requirements or other federal heatlh care requirements. Unlike states, these reviews only occur after consumers enroll in these plans. For example, in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, DOL completed 302 reviews that included a review of MH/SU parity compliance in its oversight of 2.2 million plans. Nearly all these reviews originated from complaints or other information about potential noncompliance with federal health care laws unrelated to MH/SU parity.", "According to DOL and HHS officials, the departments have not analyzed whether relying on targeted reviews alone increases the risk of noncompliance with MH/SU parity requirements in employer-sponsored group plans. Without such an evaluation, DOL and HHS do not know if their oversight is effective or whether they need to adopt additional strategies.", "While states, DOL, HHS, and the research GAO reviewed identified some instances of noncompliance with MH/SU parity requirements, the extent of compliance with these requirements is unknown. States, DOL, and HHS have identified some noncompliance with MH/SU parity requirements based on consumer complaints and other information about potential noncompliance. For example, DOL reported citing 113 violations of MH/SU parity requirements through its reviews in 2017 and 2018. The available research studies GAO reviewed also identified noncompliance with some of the requirements by reviewing plan documentation and benefit data, among other methods. However, according to stakeholders GAO interviewed, complaints are not a reliable indicator of the extent of noncompliance because consumers may not know about MH/SU parity requirements or may have privacy concerns related to submitting a complaint."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOL and HHS evaluate whether relying on targeted oversight is effective for ensuring compliance with MH/SU parity requirements or whether alternative approaches are needed.

Further, among individuals aged 12 and over, an  estimated 7.8 percent had a substance use disorder, with approximately  1.4 percent receiving substance use treatment. Congress has taken  steps to ensure that individuals seeking mental health and substance use  disorder (MH/SU) treatment do not face discrepancies in coverage. The  Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction  Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) requires large group health plan sponsors,  including employers, that choose to offer MH/SU benefits to ensure that  coverage of MH/SU treatment is no more restrictive than coverage for  medical/surgical treatment. Generally, this means that the requirements  or limitations imposed on MH/SU benefits\u2014such as copayment amounts,  number of annual visit allowed, or preauthorization of services\u2014must be  in parity with those imposed on medical/surgical benefits. The Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) extended these parity  requirements to most small group and individual health plans.", "At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) share joint responsibilities for overseeing compliance  with MHPAEA and have jointly developed related regulations and  guidance. Throughout this report, we will refer to MHPAEA  requirements\u2014contained in both laws and regulations\u2014as MH/SU parity  requirements. States are generally responsible for enforcing MH/SU  parity requirements through their oversight of health insurance companies  (known and hereafter referred to as issuers) that sell group and individual  health plans in their states.", "In recent years, questions have been raised about disparities in coverage  and access to MH/SU services despite the MH/SU parity requirements  under MHPAEA. For example, a 2017 study from the consulting firm  Milliman found that consumers used an out-of-network provider for a  substantially higher proportion of MH/SU care than they did for  medical/surgical care. This could lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for  individuals using out-of-network MH/SU services. Similar issues have  also been identified by stakeholder coalitions, a presidential taskforce,  and consumer lawsuits.", "The 21st Century Cures Act includes a provision for us to review certain  aspects of state and federal oversight of MH/SU parity requirements and  to describe the extent to which plans comply with these requirements.

We asked states to report  information about how they review health insurance plans for compliance  with MH/SU parity requirements and to identify any related enforcement  activities in 2017 and 2018. We also asked about coordination between  the states and federal agencies. We conducted the survey from April  2019 to August 2019 and received responses from all states. For some  questions, a few states either did not respond or told us they had no basis  on which to respond. We did not independently verify the information  reported by the states in the survey, but reviewed responses and followed  up with state officials when reported information appeared inconsistent or  needed clarification.

Using these criteria, we selected Maryland,  Massachusetts, and Washington. We interviewed officials responsible for  overseeing health insurance plans in each of these states and reviewed  documentation related to MH/SU parity oversight. We also interviewed  consumer advocacy groups in the selected states. We also spoke to  officials in Wyoming to obtain the perspective of one of the four states  where HHS, rather than the state insurance department, is enforcing  federal MH/SU parity requirements. To examine how relevant federal  agencies\u2014HHS, DOL, and Treasury\u2014oversee MH/SU parity compliance,  we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance;  reviewed agency reports on enforcement activities; and interviewed  relevant officials.

We also performed a literature  review of studies that assessed MH/SU parity compliance. See appendix  II for a description of the methodology used and results of the literature  review. We also identified Mercer\u2019s National Survey of Employer- Sponsored Health Plans as a source of information about employer- sponsored group plan health benefits, including information about  compliance with MH/SU parity compliance.

For example, prior to MHPAEA, an  employer\u2019s plan could cover unlimited hospital days and outpatient office  visits and require 20 percent coinsurance for outpatient office visits for  medical/surgical treatment while, for MH/SU, that same plan could cover  only 30 hospital days and 20 outpatient office visits per year and impose  50 percent coinsurance for outpatient office visits.", "Congress passed MHPAEA in 2008 to help address discrepancies in  health care coverage between mental illnesses and physical illnesses.

The most common types of financial  requirements include: (1) deductibles, which are required payments of a  specified amount made by enrollees for services before the issuer begins  to pay; (2) copayments, which are payments made by enrollees and are a  specified flat dollar amount\u2014usually on a per-unit-of-service basis\u2014with  the issuer reimbursing some portion of the remaining charges; (3)  coinsurance, which is a percentage payment made by enrollees after the  deductible is met and until an out-of-pocket maximum is reached; and (4)  out-of-pocket maximums, which are the maximum amounts enrollees  have to pay per year for all covered medical expenses.", "Quantitative treatment limitations (QTL). QTLs are treatment  limitations that can be expressed numerically, such as annual, episode,  and lifetime day and visit limits.

The first test determines if  a particular type of financial requirement or QTL (such as a copay)  applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the relevant  classification of benefits (e.g., inpatient in-network or outpatient out-of- network). Generally, a financial requirement or QTL is considered to apply  to \u201csubstantially all\u201d medical/surgical benefits if it applies to at least two- thirds of the medical/surgical benefits in the classification, according to  the regulations. Once the first test is met, the second test checks for  parity in the level or magnitude of the requirement (e.g., copay of $15 or  $20 or treatment limit of 21 or 30 inpatient days per episode). Specifically,  by regulation, the financial requirement or QTL cannot exceed the  predominant level\u2014that is, the level that applies to more than half of the  medical/surgical benefits subject to the financial requirement or QTL in  the classification. For example, if at least two-thirds of outpatient, in- network, medical/surgical benefits are subject to a copay, and 75 percent  (i.e. more than half) of outpatient, in-network visits involving  medical/surgical benefits are subject to a copay of $30, the copay for  outpatient, in-network visits involving MH/SU benefits cannot exceed $30.", "The MH/SU parity regulations extended parity requirements to NQTLs  and establish a different test for assessing parity of NQTLs between  medical/surgical and MH/SU benefits. Under the regulations, a plan  generally cannot apply an NQTL on an MH/SU benefit unless\u2014both as  written and in operation\u2014it is comparable to and applied no more  stringently than the NQTL applied to medical/surgical benefits.  According to guidance issued by HHS, DOL, and Treasury, the NQTL  analysis in the regulations focuses on the underlying factors (such as  processes, strategies, and evidentiary standards) used to apply the NQTL  and ensuring there are not arbitrary or discriminatory differences in how a  plan or issuer applies those factors to MH/SU benefits as compared to  medical/surgical benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MH/SU Parity Oversight", "paragraphs": ["HHS, DOL, and Treasury share joint oversight responsibilities for certain  federal laws applicable to private health coverage, including MHPAEA.

States falling into these  categories are known as direct enforcement states, and, in these states,  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within HHS  assumes the responsibility for directly enforcing federal MH/SU parity  requirements and other federal health laws covered by PPACA with  respect to issuers. CMS is currently responsible for enforcing MH/SU  parity requirements against issuers in four states: Missouri, Oklahoma,  Texas, and Wyoming.

Twenty states reported in our survey  that they had conducted a targeted review that focused on specific  issuers or particular MH/SU parity compliance concerns, while other  states reported they had never performed such a review. Consumer  complaints were most commonly identified as the reason\u2014at least in  part\u2014that these 20 states conducted targeted reviews to assess  compliance with MH/SU parity requirements. Thirty-eight states  reported in our survey that they track MH/SU parity complaints, which  can be submitted by consumers, providers, or advocates. For  example, after receiving consumer complaints, Massachusetts  examined the accuracy of the information on behavioral health  services\u2014services that address mental health or substance use  issues\u2014contained in issuers\u2019 provider directories and compared this  to the accuracy of medical/surgical provider information in a 2018  report. Officials from another state told us they frequently use targeted  reviews in response to complaints because these focus on a specific  issue, rely on more recent data, and are less time consuming than  more comprehensive market conduct examinations that review an  issuer\u2019s compliance with all state health requirements. States reported  additional reasons for starting targeted reviews related to MH/SU  parity requirements, including reviews initiated after receiving referrals  from other departments, reviews driven by predictive analytics or  market analyses, and reviews in response to media attention. In 2017  and 2018, the frequency of receiving MH/SU parity-related complaints  and conducting targeted reviews varied across states. (See table 2).", "Market conduct examinations. Nearly all states conduct market  conduct examinations and states have not routinely included a review  for MH/SU parity compliance as part of the examinations. Market  conduct examinations are a review of an insurer\u2019s marketplace  practices.

Eighteen states reported in our survey that they  routinely conduct market conduct examinations (ranging from every 3  or 5 years), and, of those, nine states reported that they usually or  always include a review of MH/SU parity compliance. Twenty-nine  states reported that their market conduct examinations are not  routine; they are conducted on an as-needed basis or in response to  risk factors, such as market analysis or complaints. In order to assist  states\u2019 ongoing oversight of MH/SU parity compliance, NAIC  developed guidance on MH/SU parity for its Market Regulation  Handbook, which most states use to guide their market conduct  examinations, an NAIC official told us. The guidance includes a data  collection tool for mental health parity analysis. While the guidance  was finalized in August 2019, an NAIC official told us most states  were already using the guidance to conduct their market conduct  examinations while it was in draft form.", "State-wide comprehensive reviews of issuers. Officials we  interviewed from two of the three selected states told us they have  conducted reviews of all issuers in their state as part of their oversight  of MH/SU parity compliance after consumers enroll in plans. For  example, as requested by its state legislature, Maryland conducted  three annual MH/SU parity surveys with the state\u2019s major issuers.  Maryland officials told us the first two surveys focused on MH/SU  parity compliance in the issuers\u2019 plan documentation, and the last  survey assessed compliance in plan practices and operations.  Maryland officials told us the review of all issuers in the state will give  them a baseline understanding of issuer compliance with MH/SU  parity requirements reviewed.

At least eight states have established  annual requirements for issuers to demonstrate their MH/SU parity  compliance through data reporting or self-certifications, according to  officials from one of the three selected states in our review and a  provider organization. To fulfill the states\u2019 requirements, issuers  submit information such as the percentage of claims paid for in- network and out-of-network MH/SU services compared to those paid  for medical/surgical services and the number of consumers denied  prior authorizations for MH/SU services. For example, in 2012,  Massachusetts began requiring issuers to submit annual reports  certifying that their plans comply with federal and state MH/SU parity  requirements and instructing issuers to compare denials of care for  MH/SU and medical/surgical services, among other things. These  certifications must be signed by the issuer\u2019s chief executive officer  and chief medical officer, which Massachusetts officials told us  ensures that issuer leadership is aware of the MH/SU parity  requirements. Additionally, an official from NAIC told us that NAIC  now includes data reporting requirements related to MH/SU parity,  such as requiring information on prior authorizations and denials of  care, in its annual nationwide collection of issuers\u2019 post-enrollment  information. An NAIC official told us states can use these data to  compare information on MH/SU and medical/surgical services and  examine issuers that operate in multiple states.", "In their survey responses, 47 states identified enforcement actions they  can take if they find, through a review, that an issuer violated MH/SU  parity requirements. States reported that these enforcement actions  include: financial penalties, license termination, orders to pay claims or  interest, and orders to pay restitution.

These  reviews which are performed by DOL\u2019s 10 regional offices can focus on  specific private, employer-sponsored group plans, service providers (such  as third party administrators), or issuers; however, DOL does not have  the authority to take direct enforcement actions against issuers for  violations of MH/SU parity requirements.", "DOL reported that it completed 302 reviews of private, employer- sponsored group plans that included a review for compliance with MH/SU  parity requirements in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. According to DOL  officials, these reviews can take 2 to 3 years to complete and  investigators follow an extensive compliance checklist to conduct these  reviews. The checklist includes specific questions to help determine  compliance with all applicable requirements, including a section with  questions on MH/SU parity. Because investigators complete the  compliance checklist for every plan level health investigation, reviews not  triggered by a parity complaint may still uncover a parity violation. For  example, DOL might review a private employer-sponsored group plan in  response to a consumer complaint about how long the plan covered a  hospital stay for a mother and her newborn. The review would include a  review of compliance with the related law (the Newborns\u2019 and Mothers\u2019  Health Protection Act of 1996), MH/SU parity-related requirements, and  all other applicable federal health care requirements.", "Nearly all DOL reviews that assess compliance with MH/SU parity  requirements originate from sources unrelated to MH/SU parity, including  complaints or other information about potential noncompliance with other  federal health care laws and DOL reviews of the annual financial and  operational information filed by employers, based on data provided by  DOL on the reasons targeted reviews were opened. DOL received few  MH/SU parity complaints and opened few reviews based on a potential  MH/SU parity violation, compared to complaints related to other federal  health requirements, in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 (see table 3).", "When DOL identifies a violation of MH/SU parity requirements through  one of its reviews, investigators first seek to bring the private employer- sponsored group plan or issuer into compliance voluntarily, according to  DOL officials. When that is not possible, DOL can sue the plan for  equitable relief, which can result in the plan being required to reimburse  members whose claims were improperly denied. DOL can also request  that the Treasury levy an excise tax on the non-compliant private  employer-sponsored group plan, but DOL officials noted that the excise  tax goes to the Treasury rather than toward payment of claims for plan  members, and DOL\u2019s focus is on obtaining payment of claims. DOL  officials told us they have never referred a plan to IRS to levy an excise  tax based on an MH/SU parity violation. The 21st Century Cures Act  requires DOL to conduct an audit of a private employer-sponsored group  plan when DOL has identified five or more MH/SU parity violations;  however, DOL officials told us the use of this authority has not been  triggered, as of October 2019.", "DOL identified audit resources challenges faced by the agency given the  universe of plans DOL oversees and reported that the agency is taking  steps to better leverage its resources through targeted exams in its  September 2019 enforcement report to Congress. Specifically, DOL  reported that DOL has less than one investigator for every 12,500  employee benefit plans the agency oversees, including private health,  pension, life, and disability insurance. In light of these challenges, DOL  officials said they are focusing their targeted reviews on issuers and other  service providers to obtain voluntary corrections whenever possible so  they can address noncompliance across multiple private employer- sponsored group plans. To date, they have completed at least two  investigations at the issuer level and brought an issuer into voluntary  compliance after one investigation identified MH/SU parity noncompliance  affecting over 4,000 private, employer-sponsored group plans and 7  million consumers. According to DOL officials, focusing on issuers will  result in their opening fewer targeted reviews than in prior years, but will  have more meaningful results. DOL officials also noted other efforts  underway to assist in MH/SU parity oversight. For example, the DOL\u2019s  Kansas City Regional Office has convened a task force that focuses on  parity in opioid use disorder treatment coverage. DOL officials told us  they require senior advisors in each of the 10 regions to identify trends in  the types of violations DOL identifies and to identify when a violation  could be happening at the issuer level, rather than the individual  employer-sponsored group plan level.", "CMS oversight. CMS oversight of employer-sponsored, non-federal  governmental plans for compliance with MH/SU parity requirements  consists of targeted reviews. Like DOL, these targeted reviews originate  from complaints or information about noncompliance\u2014about MH/SU  parity or issues with other federal health care laws. The reviews are used  to assess compliance with all applicable health requirements, and CMS  officials told us CMS has broad authority to review or request information  as a part of these reviews. However, according to CMS officials, CMS  has limited authority to review or request information from these plans  outside of these targeted reviews. Specifically, CMS officials said CMS  does not have the authority to conduct random audits, reviews, or  examinations of employer-sponsored, non-federal governmental plans, or  to require the plans to provide documentation to demonstrate compliance  with MH/SU parity requirements. CMS officials also said they do not have  the authority to review employer-sponsored, non-federal governmental  plans for compliance with MH/SU parity requirements prior to enrollment.", "While large, self-funded, employer-sponsored, non-federal governmental  plans may opt-out of MH/SU parity requirements and certain other federal  health requirements, CMS may identify MH/SU parity noncompliance if  these plans did not properly opt-out. CMS officials told us that they review documentation for all plans that elect to opt out of MH/SU parity  requirements to ensure it was properly submitted. If CMS finds a plan  may have opted-out incorrectly, CMS officials said they can request  additional information from the plan and can ultimately decide the opt-out  was invalid.", "CMS reported that it closed five reviews related to MH/SU parity in fiscal  years 2017 and 2018. Two targeted reviews originated from MH/SU parity  complaints and three reviews were related to plans opting-out of MH/SU  parity requirements. CMS officials told us that they received four  complaints related to MH/SU parity in employer-sponsored, non-federal  governmental plans in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The officials told us all  four complaints resulted in targeted reviews, two of which were ongoing  as of September 2019.", "When CMS identifies MH/SU parity noncompliance through one of these  targeted reviews, the agency takes one of several actions: working with  the plan to implement a corrective action plan; initiating a full market  conduct examination of the plan; or imposing civil money penalties. Like  DOL, the 21st Century Cures Act requires CMS to audit an employer- sponsored, non-federal governmental plan or issuer when CMS has  identified noncompliance five or more times. According to CMS officials,  as of November 2019, the use of this audit authority has not been  triggered."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOL and CMS Do Not Have Assurance That Their Use of Targeted Reviews to Oversee MH/SU Parity Requirements Is Effective for Ensuring Parity", "paragraphs": ["Under DOL\u2019s and CMS\u2019s oversight through targeted reviews, self-funded  employer-sponsored group plans do not undergo review for compliance  with MH/SU parity requirements unless the agencies receive complaints  or other information about potential noncompliance with an applicable  federal health care law, or the review is opened as a result of a targeting  technique unrelated to MH/SU parity\u2014such as bankruptcy filing review.  Relying on the receipt of such information to trigger a targeted review of  MH/SU parity is a concern given the low number of complaints DOL  receives related to MH/SU parity when compared to other federal health  requirements. For example, as we have noted, DOL received 129  complaints in fiscal year 2018, and most of the noncompliance with  MH/SU parity requirements DOL identified was found through reviews  triggered by complaints and information unrelated to MH/SU parity in  fiscal years 2017 and 2018, based on our review of DOL data. Further, as  discussed later in this report, consumer advocates have noted that there  is a lack of consumer awareness about MH/SU parity requirements,  which may result in fewer complaints than would otherwise be made if  consumers understood the requirements.", "Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving their defined  objectives. DOL has stated that its defined objective is the full  implementation of MH/SU parity requirements through vigorous  compliance assistance and enforcement. HHS has stated that it is  committed to enforcing MH/SU parity requirements through CMS and to  providing the sponsors of employer-sponsored, non-federal governmental  plans the information needed to ensure that the plans are fully compliant  with MH/SU parity requirements.", "DOL and CMS officials told us they have not completed any statistical  analysis or study regarding the effectiveness of their targeted review  approach to MH/SU parity compliance, nor whether this approach  increases the risk of noncompliance. Specifically, they have not  analyzed whether relying on targeted reviews alone increases the risk of  noncompliance with MH/SU parity requirements in employer-sponsored  group plans. The risk of noncompliance may be increased because  incentives for plans to comply are limited when investigations are initiated  only after receiving complaints or information about noncompliance. DOL  and CMS officials also said they have not analyzed whether additional  strategies, such as the attestation or issuer documentation requirements  used by some states, would reduce the risk of noncompliance. For  example, such an evaluation could assess whether a sample of health  plans reviewed for compliance identified similar types of noncompliance  as those identified when plans were reviewed in response to MH/SU  parity complaints. According to officials from a provider organization, one  such strategy to improve compliance would be to require issuers or plans  to affirm that (1) their plans comply with MH/SU parity requirements and  (2) they have documentation showing that they analyzed their plans for  compliance. According to these officials, requiring this documentation  from plans and issuers can increase compliance, even if there is a low  probability that a plan will be audited. DOL and CMS officials told us that  they currently do not have the authority to conduct oversight activities of  this type. Specifically, they told us that for self-funded private or non- federal governmental employer-sponsored group plans they do not  currently have the authority to: (1) review plans for compliance with  MH/SU parity requirements before coverage is offered to consumers, (2)  require plans to develop documentation to demonstrate compliance with  MH/SU parity requirements, and (3) monitor or examine plans for  compliance with MH/SU parity requirements outside of an investigation.", "Without evaluating the effectiveness of their targeted review approach,  DOL and CMS do not know whether their oversight is adequate for  ensuring compliance with MH/SU parity requirements, or whether they  need to adopt additional strategies and seek new authorities, if needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Enforcement Activities and Research Identified Some Health Plans Not Compliant with MH/SU Parity Requirements, but the Extent of Compliance Is Unknown", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States, DOL, CMS, and Available Research Identified Some Noncompliance with MH/SU Parity Requirements", "paragraphs": ["States, DOL, and CMS identified some plan or issuer noncompliance with  specific MH/SU parity requirements in 2017 and 2018 through their  various oversight efforts.

Eleven of the 14 states that provided  information on the types of MH/SU parity noncompliance in our survey  reported that the noncompliance they found was related to NQTLs half  the time or more. Similarly, DOL reported that 55 percent of  noncompliance the agency found in fiscal year 2018 was related to  NQTLs, while 40 percent was related to financial requirements or QTLs.  Through our review of DOL letters informing plans of noncompliance, we  found that the most common types of noncompliance with MH/SU parity  requirements were related to (1) copayments or coinsurance, such as a  higher copayments for MH/SU treatment than those generally applied to  equivalent medical/surgical treatment (a financial requirement); (2) prior  authorizations, such as requiring approval in advance for MH/SU  treatment but not requiring it for equivalent medical/surgical treatment (an  NQTL); and (3) the total number of treatments allowed, such as a limit on  inpatient hospital days for MH/SU treatment that is not applied to  equivalent medical/surgical treatment (a QTL).", "The scope of noncompliance with MH/SU parity requirements identified  by states, DOL, and CMS in 2017 and 2018 varied\u2014both in terms of the  number of consumers affected and the steps needed to come into  compliance. While MH/SU parity requirements apply to plans, regulators  may identify and seek to correct noncompliance in the underlying health  policies that issuers use to design, market, and sell as health plans to  numerous employers. For example, DOL letters show one particularly  widespread violation affected more than 7 million enrollees. Most plans or  issuers resolved the noncompliance identified by regulators voluntarily.  For example, DOL officials told us that plans or issuers resolved all  instances of noncompliance voluntarily. Nine states reported in our survey  taking a total of 20 enforcement actions to bring plans or issuers into  compliance in 2017 and 2018. See table 4 for examples of  noncompliance and steps required to come into compliance.", "Additionally, while the literature we reviewed suggested that the  individual, small group, and large group plans assessed by the studies  were generally compliant with MH/SU parity requirements assessed by  the studies, the studies identified some noncompliance or possible  noncompliance.

The study also found variation in the types of  noncompliance in each of the states. The case study concluded that  on one exchange more than half the products appeared inconsistent  with MH/SU parity requirements, particularly the NQTLs reviewed; on  the other exchange, 11 percent of the products had a financial  requirement that violated MH/SU parity requirements.", "One study found that 18 percent of benchmark plans were not  compliant with MH/SU parity requirements for substance use disorder  benefits specifically.

However, stakeholders from eight consumer advocacy groups told us that  complaints are not a good measure of whether MH/SU parity issues exist  and do not accurately reflect the number of enrollees facing problems  with parity. Further, CMS, DOL, and state officials, as well as  stakeholders and researchers, also noted the complexity of assessing  plans for MH/SU parity compliance for NQTLs in particular, which may  result in inconsistent identification of MH/SU parity violations or the  inability to fully assess compliance.", "Limitations of relying on complaints to trigger enforcement  activities. Stakeholders and state officials reported on the limitations of  relying on complaints to trigger enforcement activities\u2014which contribute  to the challenges in determining the full extent of compliance with parity  requirements. Stakeholders from eight consumer advocacy groups told us  that if regulators rely on complaints to identify possible noncompliance  after consumers enroll in plans, they will not know the full extent of  compliance with MH/SU parity requirements. These stakeholders  identified several reasons complaints do not accurately reflect the number  of consumers facing problems related to plan or issuer compliance with  MH/SU parity requirements:", "Consumers may not be aware of MH/SU parity requirements, such as  how to determine if the treatment challenge they are experiencing is a  potential parity violation, how to file a parity-related complaint, or  which entity they should contact to file a complaint, according to five  consumer advocacy stakeholders we spoke to and one professional  organization. For example, while a consumer would be aware of a  denial for a particular treatment for a mental health condition because  the issuer did not consider it to be medically necessary, the consumer  could not easily determine if this standard was applied more  stringently than to similar medical/surgical benefits and thus signaled  a parity issue. Further, in our survey, officials from 21 states  reported they do not provide any public information to consumers  about MH/SU parity requirements, which may contribute to a general  lack of consumer awareness in these states.", "Consumers may decide not to file a complaint due to the stigma  associated with MH/SU treatment, three consumer advocacy  stakeholders and state officials in one state told us. One stakeholder  also noted that consumers expect substance use disorder services to  be treated differently than medical services and are therefore less  likely to file a complaint if they receive disparate treatment.", "Consumers may be hesitant to file a complaint that includes sensitive  personal details, such as a mental illness diagnosis, two stakeholders  told us. One of these stakeholders told us consumers in need of  substance use disorder services in particular may not want to raise a  complaint that documents their participation in illegal activities, such  as drug misuse. In addition, two stakeholders and state officials in one  state stated that individuals or families experiencing an immediate  crisis associated with MH/SU conditions may not be well-equipped to  navigate the complaint process or wait for a complaint resolution.", "Providers face barriers helping consumers file complaints or appeals  related to MH/SU parity requirements, four consumer advocacy  stakeholder groups and one professional organization told us. The  barriers identified by these stakeholders include: providers being  unable to file complaints on behalf of consumers in some states; the  time consuming nature of the appeals or complaint processes; and  provider fear that an issuer will drop them from their network if they  file a complaint. Two consumer advocacy groups have identified that  providers may be in a better position to understand a denial decision  and justify a consumer\u2019s need for treatment, but noted that barriers  discourage providers from filing an appeal or complaint. One of these  consumer advocacy groups reported that providers might be unaware  of what issuer actions would violate MH/SU parity requirements.", "Officials from the three selected states provided examples of specific  efforts taken that may address stakeholder identified challenges  consumers face in understanding parity requirements and filing related  complaints. For example, Maryland officials told us they developed a  webinar to help consumers with filing complaints related to substance use  disorder treatment. Officials from Massachusetts told us they review for  parity violations any complaint related to coverage of mental health- related services, regardless of whether the consumer indicates that the  complaint might be a parity violation. While this process is still dependent  on a consumer to make a complaint, it does not rely on the consumer  having an in-depth understanding of parity requirements for their  complaint to be reviewed for potential noncompliance. In light of concerns  about consumers not filing complaints, officials from Washington told us  their statewide comprehensive review includes an assessment of how  issuers implemented state and federal MH/SU parity requirements and  aims to help them assist consumers who are not reaching out directly.

Officials from  three states reported in our survey or interviews that it is challenging  to determine how an NQTL described in plan documents is actually  being implemented and experienced by consumers in practice. This  can make it difficult to determine both if noncompliance has occurred  and the extent of any noncompliance. Further, some state regulators  do not conduct the types of detailed analyses necessary to determine  if an NQTL is in compliance with MH/SU parity requirements,  according to one consumer advocacy group. Finally, four studies we  reviewed identified that researchers were unable to observe the plans\u2019  implementation of NQTLs. Thus, they were unable to draw  conclusions about whether or not the way plans implemented the  NQTLs complied with MH/SU parity requirements. To address the  complexities of these analyses for their own reviews, DOL officials  told us that for its targeted reviews of MH/SU parity compliance, DOL  uses seasoned investigators, early litigation support, technical  guidance from DOL\u2019s regulations office, and outreach to other federal  and state agencies.", "Lack of documentation on medical/surgical NQTLs. A lack of  documentation on the factors used to apply NQTLs to  medical/surgical benefits makes it difficult for issuers to demonstrate  compliance with MH/SU parity requirements, according to two industry  officials. They told us that information on NQTLs\u2014such as when to  require prior authorization\u2014has to be created for medical/surgical  benefits so that the information can then be compared to the  application of NQTLs to MH/SU benefits to assess compliance with  MH/SU parity requirements. One industry official noted that this poses  an additional hurdle when MH/SU benefits are carved out or  separately managed from the rest of a health plan. This lack of explicit  information about medical/surgical benefits and difficulty drawing  parallels between medical/surgical and MH/SU care also makes it  difficult for regulators to determine parity compliance, officials from  one of the three selected states told us.", "Lack of resources. Eight states reported in our survey that lack of  staff resources, staff training, or clinical expertise are additional  challenges to assessing compliance with MH/SU parity requirements.  Further, states may hesitate to determine an issuer violated federal  MH/SU parity requirements due to a lack of confidence or clarity in  applying the federal laws and may cite state laws instead, according  to officials from one of our three selected states and a provider  organization. Officials from the provider organization told us this could  result in an undercount of MH/SU parity violations if a state cites a  potential violation of an MH/SU parity requirement as a violation of a  state law unrelated to federal MH/SU parity requirements. One state  official identified consumer protection laws as an alternative to  pursuing possible MH/SU parity requirement violations. Officials from  one state told us some state laws have more clear cut standards than  federal MH/SU parity requirements, due to the lack of clarity regarding  federal MH/SU parity requirements.

Under this final rule, all beneficiaries  enrolled in Medicaid MCOs, ABPs, and CHIP are entitled to mental health  and substance use disorder (MH/SU) benefits that comply with certain  MH/SU parity requirements of MHPAEA, which generally requires that  MH/SU benefits be no more restrictive than medical or surgical benefits  when MH/SU benefits are offered.", "The CMS final rule defines the role of the states in evaluating overall  compliance of state Medicaid and CHIP programs with MH/SU parity  requirements. The final rule establishes the processes by which states  must assess and document that their Medicaid and CHIP programs  comply with MH/SU parity requirements. CMS guidance provides detailed  information to help states assess their compliance with MH/SU parity  requirements. These processes vary by program type, as described  below.", "Medicaid MCOs. The final rule requires either the state or the Medicaid  MCO to complete a parity analysis, depending on how Medicaid benefits  are provided. In general, CMS guidance requires states or MCOs to  assess if a plan\u2019s MH/SU benefits are no more restrictive than medical or  surgical benefits for the following items: aggregate lifetime/annual dollar  limits, financial requirements, quantitative treatment limitations (QTL), and  non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTL). The MCO must complete  this analysis when it provides all Medicaid benefits\u2014both medical and  MH/SU benefits. The state must complete the parity analysis if the  benefits are provided through multiple delivery systems, such as through  multiple MCOs or the state\u2019s fee-for-service Medicaid program, and  provide the parity analysis to CMS for review. States are also required to  make the documentation of compliance with the final rule available to the  general public.", "The final rule also requires states to include contract provisions requiring  compliance with MH/SU parity requirements in all MCO and other  applicable contracts. CMS guidance encourages states to consider  including provisions in their contracts with MCOs to ensure adequate  oversight of the MCO\u2019s parity-related monitoring and compliance  activities, such as ensuring the state can see the MCO\u2019s parity analysis.", "ABPs and CHIP. The final rule requires states to document that their  ABP and CHIP plans comply with MH/SU parity requirements in the  comprehensive state plans that describe the state\u2019s Medicaid and CHIP  programs. CMS guidance requires that states conduct a parity analysis  demonstrating this compliance as part of the documentation the states  submit to CMS to request a change to the state plan, known as a state  plan amendment.", "In certain CHIP programs and ABPs, the state does not have to complete  the full parity analysis, known as deemed compliance. A plan may be  deemed to be in compliance with MH/SU parity requirements for plan  members aged 20 and under if Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic,  and Treatment (EPSDT) benefits are provided to those individuals,  because EPSDT benefits include MH/SU services. CMS guidance  requires that states demonstrate that EPSDT benefits are covered by  their CHIP plans through documents such as member handbooks. (The  state or MCO would still be required to conduct a parity analysis to ensure  that plan benefits for those not eligible for EPSDT benefits satisfy parity  requirements.)", "To ensure state Medicaid and CHIP benefits comply with MH/SU parity  requirements, CMS must review states\u2019 documentation of compliance.  For Medicaid managed care, CMS must review state contracts with  managed care plans to ensure they are compliant with CMS  requirements. CMS reviews the parity provisions in MCO contracts and  the state\u2019s parity analysis as part of the normal contract review process.  Additionally, for states in which some but not all benefits are provided by  an MCO, CMS reviews documentation of the state\u2019s parity analysis to  ensure the full scope of services being provided complies with MH/SU  parity requirements.
