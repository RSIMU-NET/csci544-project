Originally, IRS intended to focus the program on two categories of income--interest and dividends--wherein matching was straightforward, and therefore the number of notices sent to compliant taxpayers could be minimized. However IRS changed the matching program to cover additional categories of flow-through income without clearly informing taxpayers and tax preparers. Matching these additional categories of income was less straightforward. As a result, IRS sent notices about suspected noncompliance to more compliant taxpayers than it intended. In fact, about two-thirds of the notices were sent to taxpayers later determined to be compliant. After taxpayers complained, and after sending out about 70 percent of the planned notices, IRS responded by stopping the notices. IRS has assessed about $41.4 million in additional tax from the notices that were sent and approximately $26.9 million was directly attributable to Schedule K-1 underreporting. IRS did not timely implement two parts of the plans for managing the Schedule K-1 matching program. First, IRS did not test the feasibility of focusing the program on interest and dividend income until after recommending such a focus and communicating the recommendation to taxpayers, preparers, and other stakeholders. Second, after changing the plan, IRS did not clearly communicate the changes. IRS is taking steps to improve communications and reduce the burden on compliant taxpayers.

IRS based its decision on a risk matrix  that summarized the risk of sending a notice to a compliant taxpayer for  the various categories of flow-through income. Interest and dividend  income were identified as low risk because they are easily identified on  individuals\u2019 tax returns. Short and long-term capital gains and royalties  were considered a moderate risk because the K-1 information was less  likely to be accurate or the income could be harder to locate on  individuals\u2019 returns. Income from trade or business activities, rental real  estate, other rental activities, and guaranteed payments was considered  high risk because it could be much harder to isolate on individuals\u2019  returns. For example, some taxpayers would reduce or net their flow- through income in these four categories by subtracting carryover losses or  expenses. Although IRS\u2019s tax form instructions caution against such  netting, some taxpayers still do so, which can make flow-through income  appear to be underreported.", "Starting in 2001, IRS began briefing representatives from stakeholder  groups on its plan for the Schedule K-1 matching program. IRS met with  two of its advisory committees, composed primarily of tax practitioners,  the Internal Revenue Service Advisory Committee (IRSAC) and the  Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee (IRPAC), and other  practitioner groups.

Because of a desire to direct the  69 FTEs allocated for screening K-1 underreporter cases to K-1 cases, IRS  decided to expand the focus of the K-1 matching program. IRS officials  told us they had wanted to direct the resources to K-1 cases exclusively in  order to be able to determine the results achieved with those resources.  The revised program included flow-through income from trade or business  activities, rental real estate, other rental activities, and guaranteed  payments.

In particular, IRS will issue notices to taxpayers if K-1 income  information is completely missing from a return. Also, if a taxpayer  received a notice in 2002 for tax year 2000 K-1 items and agreed with the  changes proposed by that notice, the taxpayer will receive a notice for any  underreported K-1 income identified this year in the tax year 2001 return.

In a report issued March  2003, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA)  stated the lack of detailed information reported by taxpayers and/or  practitioners may have been a significant reason for the number of K-1- related notices that were sent. TIGTA then recommended that IRS revise  Form 1040 Schedule E to classify and report flow-through income in a  manner that would allow an easier comparison with Schedule K-1. In  response, an IRS official has stated that, for the 2003 filing season, the  agency would issue a revised Form 1040 Schedule E that would alert  practitioners to pay special attention to the written instructions on the  reporting of certain losses and expenses. The desired effect of this change  is to make taxpayers less likely to improperly net income and expenses  being reported on Schedule E.", "Finally, an IRS task force is studying the possibility of simplifying the  Schedule K-1 and its instructions for different tax situations.
