In addition to MID, during our review, we interviewed officials from the Office of Field Operations (OFO), which oversees CMCs and ports of entry, and the Office of Investigations (OI), which oversees SAICs, RAICs, and RAs, because these are geographically dispersed components with the responsibility for completing a large number of self-inspection worksheets. Also, we judgmentally selected seven ports of entry and one SAIC office from these components for field visits and accompanied MID on inspections of four of the entities. We also visited the CMCs affiliated with the two San Diego ports of entry and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). At the ports of entry and SAIC office, we interviewed supervisors and managers responsible for implementing SIP at the local level.

MID\u2019s results from inspections of 127 entities and over 2,000 self-inspection worksheets were used in our analysis. Because the MID reports did not follow a consistent format and it was often difficult to extract the appropriate information, we used the reports only to validate overall assessments given by MID. Because the entities inspected were judgmentally selected by MID, the findings from these reports and our analysis of these reports may not be representative of the entire Customs Service.", "To identify improvements and refinements that could enhance the value of the program, we worked closely with directors, managers, and supervisors at selected Customs sites.

Corrective actions included developing evidence and sign-in logs for property rooms and vaults and improving processes for transferring seized property to secure vaults in a timely manner. In addition, at one port of entry we visited, Customs officials discovered problems in the imprest fund as a result of a self-inspection. According to the port director, the self-inspection raised questions about a cashier\u2019s handling of the fund, which led to a determination that the cashier had embezzled $1,000 from the fund.", "According to an OFO report, CMCs and ports of entry identified approximately 3,000 items needing improvement with corresponding corrective actions nationwide during the second SIP cycle. The OFO SIP Program Coordinator tracks the status of the corrective actions for issues that occur at many ports. Financial management, trade programs, passenger processing (including personal searches), and fines, penalties, and forfeitures (including seized property) were the areas identified most frequently as needing improvement.", "In addition, all the entities we visited had identified numerous areas needing improvement and had implemented a number of corrective actions. For example, one port of entry identified 37 areas needing improvement out of 54 they inspected during the second SIP cycle. Of the 37 areas, corrective actions for 31 had been completed at the time of our visit; the rest were in process.

For example, at one port of entry, MID inspectors found late filing of travel vouchers, security checks not being conducted, and personal search facilities having privacy and safety shortcomings. In response, MID made numerous recommendations to port management for corrective actions. MID officials explained that the recommendations were based on problems identified during their inspection that the port should have found during its self-inspection or MID found in areas it reviews but are not addressed by the self-inspection worksheets. MID officials further explained that while on-site at a port of entry or other entity, they conduct more in-depth reviews that go beyond the scope of the worksheet questions. These in-depth reviews have been targeted toward higher-risk areas, such as airport security programs, and may lead to worksheet revisions where warranted.", "MID also conducts follow-up activities to ensure that its recommendations have been completed. MID generally sends a follow-up memorandum to the applicable entity about 6 months after the inspection to determine the status of the corrective actions taken in response to the recommendations. The entity then provides MID with a letter stating the status of the corrective action(s) and provides supporting documentation. After receiving this letter, MID may close out the recommendation, require more documentation, or visit the entity to obtain more documentation. For example, during the second and third SIP cycles, MID made a total of 65 recommendations to improve imprest fund management. At the time of our review, 17 of the 65 recommendations had been implemented and were closed out. Forty-one recommendations were pending; MID sent out follow-up memorandums to determine the status of the pending recommendations but had not received responses at the time of our review.

Under one component of the prior program, teams of officers from areas such as passenger processing would inspect different areas such as fines, penalties, and forfeitures. Because these teams did not work in the areas being inspected, they generally had limited knowledge and expertise of the activities they were inspecting. With this limited knowledge, they were often unable to verify the information they were given or investigate any problems in the activities further.", "In contrast, under SIP, supervisors inspect their own activities and their immediate superiors review the results. According to this port director, SIP helps supervisors maintain accountability for their area of responsibility because it requires them to \u201cback-up\u201d the results of their self-inspection with supporting documentation. The next level of local management is to certify that the results are correct and, should MID inspect their area of responsibility, managers and supervisors will be asked to explain how they determined worksheet answers. Many supervisors told us that these different levels of review helped give the process integrity.", "Managers and supervisors also said that self-inspections assisted them in uncovering and correcting problems that they would have otherwise not known about, and that SIP helps to keep them informed and current on Customs\u2019 policies and directives.

According to the results of inspections conducted since January 2000, MID reported finding insufficient supporting documentation on 23 percent of the worksheets reviewed and questions answered incorrectly on 16 percent of the worksheets. Results from our review of MID inspection reports were consistent with MID\u2019s assessment.", "Insufficient documentation and inaccurate worksheet results indicated to MID inspectors that approving officials may not have sufficiently reviewed completed worksheets in order to certify their accuracy. MID inspectors explained that by signing worksheet certifications, approving officials, such as port directors, are indicating that they reviewed the self-inspection and that they agree that the results are accurate. However, MID inspectors believed that if support for answers was not indicated on the worksheets, it was not clear how the officials could have determined that the results were accurate. In effect, MID inspectors believed that some approving officials might be \u201crubber-stamping\u201d self-inspection results.", "According to MID inspection reports, problems at some entities with insufficient supporting documentation and inaccurate worksheet answers resulted, in part, from a lack of detailed guidance and instructions on how to complete and review worksheets and determine appropriate sample sizes. Many managers and supervisors that we interviewed agreed with MID\u2019s assessment and believed that more guidance and more specific instructions were necessary to answer some worksheet questions. Specifically, they mentioned having difficulty determining the proper supporting documentation for answers to some questions, the appropriate universe from which to draw a sample, and the appropriate sample size.", "We also found worksheets lacking supporting documentation and with incorrect answers, to some extent, at all the entities that we visited. At three of the eight Customs entities that we visited, the majority of the worksheets we analyzed either lacked supporting documentation or had incorrectly answered questions. We found instances of managers and supervisors having difficulty determining (1) proper support for worksheet answers, (2) appropriate sampling universe and timeframes, and (3) appropriate sample sizes.", "For example, at one entity we visited with MID inspectors, a purchase cardholder answered \u201cyes\u201d to a worksheet question asking whether the monthly purchase card statements were reconciled within 10 days after their receipt. While it is a requirement to provide supporting documentation for worksheet answers, the purchase cardholder did not indicate that any records, reports, or other documents were reviewed to support the answer. During their inspection, MID accessed a report that showed some purchase card statements had not been reconciled within the prescribed timeframe. According to the MID inspector, the report should have been reviewed when answering the question and a copy included with the self-inspection worksheet as supporting documentation. The purchase cardholder explained that he was unaware of this report and, lacking documentation, had answered the question based on what he remembered. As a result, MID inspectors concluded that incorrect results had been funneled up the chain of command. Purchase cardholders at two of the other three entities we visited with MID also said that they were unaware of this reconciliation report.", "We also found supervisors having difficulty determining the appropriate sampling universe and timeframes. For example, at one entity we visited, a MID inspector found that a supervisor completing the collections and deposits worksheet had sampled supporting documents from only 1 month in the 6-month reporting period. The MID inspector explained that this was not representative of the activity in the review period. The supervisor explained that he had received no training or guidance on how to conduct the self-inspection and only had instructions on the worksheet for guidance. We reviewed the self-inspection worksheet and found that the instructions read \u201cReview at least 10 documents randomly selected from the day\u2019s deposit and collection documents.\u201d The instructions do not explain that the sample of documents should be from every month or describe how the documents should be representative of the entire reporting period. At another port of entry, we found that supervisors had sampled collection and deposit activity from only 1 day in the 6-month reporting period, which appeared to be consistent with the limited instructions referenced above.", "In addition, we found examples of difficulties in determining appropriate sample sizes. For example, questions on one worksheet ask about controls over narcotic training aids for canines. The worksheet did not contain specific instructions or guidance about how to support answers to these questions. At one entity we visited, the supervisor who completed the worksheet used control documents from one canine enforcement officer\u2019s (CEO) file as supporting documentation for the worksheet answers. We interviewed the supervisor and found that there were 16 CEOs at the port of entry in possession of narcotic training aids, although only one file had been reviewed for the self-inspection. The supervisor said that no guidance or instructions had been provided on how many files needed to be reviewed to support the worksheet answers, so the supervisor randomly picked one file to answer the worksheet questions.", "At another port of entry, the supervisor who completed the canine narcotics training aid worksheet indicated that without guidance on how to determine the sample size, the local CMC instructed that a 5-percent sample should be taken. The supervisor drew a 5-percent sample of CEOs in possession of narcotic training aids, which resulted in only 2 out of 53 files being included in the self-inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Managers and Supervisors Believed SIP to Be Burdensome and Time-Consuming", "paragraphs": ["At six of the eight entities we visited, more than half of the 54 managers and supervisors we interviewed said that SIP can be paperwork-intensive, burdensome, and time-consuming. In particular, some self-inspection worksheets have more questions than others, from only 1 to 15 questions, and some worksheets require extensive research to determine and support worksheet answers. For example, a supervisory import specialist we interviewed explained that to answer one worksheet question, a data query of over 120,000 records had to be retrieved before a sample could be taken. According to the supervisor, other questions on this worksheet required similar efforts, taking several days to gather the information. Although other worksheets may not require such extensive research, neither MID nor any of the entities we visited tracked the amount of time required to complete various self-inspections. Consequently, we were unable to determine the actual time burden of the program or to what extent completing self-inspection worksheets may impact primary job duties.", "About three-quarters of the managers and supervisors who told us that SIP was time-consuming and burdensome said that too much time was being spent on low-risk activities, such as internal and external relations, and reporting requirements for low-risk activities were too frequent. At several of the entities we visited, managers and supervisors said that Customs needed to prioritize the activities covered by the worksheets and focus on high-risk activities such as collections and deposits and seized narcotics. One port director said that based on the port\u2019s activities, the areas of collections and deposits of cash/checks and seized currency should be the two highest priorities under the port\u2019s self-inspection. These are risky areas that could be vulnerable to abuse, making them good candidates for continuous scrutiny under SIP. The port director also believed that other areas are not as important and should receive less scrutiny during the SIP cycles. As discussed later in this report, MID is taking action to address these concerns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SIP Improvements and Refinements Are Underway", "paragraphs": ["Based on feedback MID received from our review, its own inspections, and comments from managers and supervisors, several improvements and refinements to SIP are being implemented. These include (1) adding key internal control questions to worksheets, (2) reducing the time spent self- inspecting low-risk activities, (3) standardizing MID\u2019s verification and validation inspection reporting format, and (4) developing and implementing a computerized self-inspection reporting system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Internal Control Questions Being Incorporated Into Worksheets", "paragraphs": ["During our review, we found that some key internal control concepts were not being addressed by self-inspection questions. According to the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Nov. 1999), a key factor in helping federal managers improve accountability and minimize operational problems to better achieve agencies\u2019 missions and program results is to implement appropriate internal control. Internal control is a series of actions and activities that occur throughout an entity\u2019s operations and on an ongoing basis as part of its infrastructure to help managers run the entity and achieve their aims. An organization\u2019s internal control provides reasonable assurance that its operations are effective and efficient, its financial reporting is reliable, and it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Management sets the objectives, puts the control mechanisms and activities in place, and monitors and evaluates the control.", "Not all self-inspection worksheet questions, however, fully address the concepts in the internal control standards. On the imprest fund worksheet, for example, we found a question that read: \u201cIf there is no separation of duties for a cashier who performs other procurement/change making functions, does management perform any extra reviews?\u201d This question, however, was not specific enough to address the segregation of duties internal control activity. \u201cKey duties and responsibilities need to be divided or segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error or fraud. This should include separating the responsibilities for authorizing transactions, processing and recording them, reviewing the transactions, and handling any related assets. No one individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or event.\u201d", "We believed that the question on the imprest fund worksheet should be revised to address the fundamental concept by specifically asking whether key duties and responsibilities were segregated among different people in the imprest fund area. We also noted that the worksheet for the purchase card program did not have a question about segregation of duties. \u201cAn agency must establish physical control to secure and safeguard vulnerable assets.", "Examples include security for and limited access to assets such as cash, securities, inventories, and equipment which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorized use.", "Such assets should be periodically counted and compared to control records.\u201d", "We discussed our internal control concerns with the MID Director at Customs headquarters, who added the question on unannounced cash counts back into the imprest fund worksheet for the fourth SIP cycle, and began a reassessment of all SIP worksheets to ensure that questions cover basic internal controls.", "Key duties and responsibilities are divided to reduce the risk of error or mismanagement.", "No one individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or event. Examples of programs requiring key functions to be separated include procurement (approving, purchasing, and receiving), imprest fund (cashier and approver), and collections and deposits (preparer, verifier and receiver); and Individuals who account for assets are not the same as those that have custody of the assets. Preventing this assures that individuals who record assets can not misappropriate the asset and conceal its whereabouts in the inventory records.", "MID left the implementation of the revision to the discretion of each assistant commissioner and said that for the revised worksheets to be available for the January 2002 SIP cycle; the worksheets should be completed by October 2001. We were concerned about the lengthy implementation timeframe, but after discussing the issue with program manager representatives of the OFO and OI Assistant Commissioners, we were assured that work on the revisions was well underway. In fact, both the OFO and OI program managers told us that their goal is to complete the revised worksheets in May 2001 so that they can be used for the next SIP cycle beginning in July 2001.", "In these instances of key internal control questions missing from worksheets whose programs could be subject to financial vulnerability and corruption, we worked closely with MID officials to correct the deficiencies.

Many worksheets covering activities considered to be low-risk are to be completed on an annual, instead of semiannual basis. Worksheets covering activities that are vulnerable to fraud and abuse, however, are being retained for semiannual completion. For example, OFO began prioritizing its activities and associated worksheets after the first SIP cycle because they found that it was too burdensome to complete all the worksheets during one cycle. According to the OFO Acting SIP Program Coordinator, worksheets covering high-risk areas such as money, narcotics, or seized property, were retained on a semiannual cycle.

This is not the case, however, if worksheet guidance is insufficient and instructions are unclear. Because of inadequate guidance, inaccurate and incomplete self-inspection results can and do occur, reducing the credibility of the program. More can be done to ensure that all worksheets contain complete and clear guidance and instructions for making determinations such as sampling sizes and timeframes. Clarifying and refining all worksheet guidance and instructions will not only assist managers and supervisors in conducting self-inspections, but will also provide approving officials and MID inspectors with a clear set of criteria for determining whether self-inspections were done correctly and completely.
