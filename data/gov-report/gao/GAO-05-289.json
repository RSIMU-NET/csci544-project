According to EPA, environmental justice involves fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes. EPA developed guidance for considering environmental justice during the development of rules under the Clean Air Act and other activities. GAO was asked to examine how EPA considered environmental justice during two phases of developing clean air rules: (1) drafting the rule, including activities of the workgroup that considered regulatory options, the economic review of the rule's costs, and making the proposed rule available for public comment, and (2) finalizing the rule, including addressing public comments and revising the economic review. GAO reviewed the three clean air rules described in the next column."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["When drafting the three clean air rules, EPA generally devoted little attention to environmental justice. While EPA guidance on rulemaking states that workgroups should consider environmental justice early in this process, GAO found that a lack of guidance and training for workgroup members on identifying environmental justice issues may have limited their ability to identify such issues. In addition, while EPA officials stated that economic reviews of proposed rules consider potential environmental justice impacts, the gasoline and diesel rules did not provide decision makers with environmental justice analyses, and EPA has not identified all the types of data necessary to analyze such impacts. Finally, in all three rules, EPA mentioned environmental justice when they were published in proposed form, but the discussion in the ozone implementation rule was contradictory. In finalizing the three clean air rules, EPA considered environmental justice to varying degrees. Public commenters stated that all three rules, as proposed, raised environmental justice issues. In responding to such comments on the gasoline rule, EPA published its belief that the rule would not create such issues, but did not publish the data and assumptions supporting its belief. Specifically, EPA did not publish (1) its estimate that potentially harmful air emissions would increase in 26 of the 86 counties with refineries affected by the rule or (2) its assumption that this estimate overstated the eventual increases in refinery emissions. For the diesel rule, in response to refiners' concerns that their permits could be delayed if environmental justice issues were raised by citizens, EPA stated that the permits would not be delayed by such issues. Moreover, after reviewing the comments, EPA did not change its final economic reviews to discuss the gasoline and diesel rules' potential environmental justice impacts. Finally, the portions of the ozone implementation rule that prompted the comments about environmental justice were not included in the final rule. Overall, EPA officials said that these rules, as published in final form, did not create an environmental justice issue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Low-income and minority populations are disproportionately exposed to  air pollution and other environmental risks, according to Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) studies. For example, a 1991 study cited by EPA  found that African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be  exposed to ground-level ozone and several other air pollutants known to  cause health problems. In 1992, EPA established an office to address  environmental pollution affecting racial minorities and low-income  communities. Efforts to identify and address disproportionately high and  adverse impacts on specific populations and communities are commonly  referred to under the term \u201cenvironmental justice.\u201d", "In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which stated that  EPA and other federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and  permitted by law, shall make achieving environmental justice part of their  missions by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, the  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects  of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low- income populations in the United States. To implement the executive order,  EPA developed guidance for incorporating environmental justice into  specific program areas. One such program area is EPA\u2019s implementation  and enforcement of the Clean Air Act, a comprehensive law intended, in  part, to control emissions that have been found to harm human health. To  implement the act, EPA\u2014among other things\u2014develops, implements, and  enforces rules on the amount of various pollutants that may be emitted by  mobile sources (such as cars, trucks, and other vehicles) and stationary  sources (such as power plants and refineries).", "According to EPA guidance, environmental justice and other specific  factors are to be considered at various points during the development of a  rule. For example, to draft a proposed rule, EPA establishes a workgroup,  comprised of officials from relevant offices within the agency, to consider  various options and typically recommend one option to managers. EPA  guidance, issued in 1994 and 2004, reinforced Executive Order 12898 by  suggesting that environmental justice be considered early in the  rulemaking process. Also, the Clean Air Act, other statutes, and executive  orders require EPA to prepare an economic review of the proposed rule\u2019s  costs and other impacts. EPA guidance specifies that this review will  consider the rule\u2019s potential total costs to society (which could include  adverse health effects due to exposure to pollutants), including the  distribution of those costs among various social and economic groups.  Finally, after the approval of all relevant offices within EPA, the proposed  rule is published in the Federal Register, and a public comment period is  opened to solicit formal public comment on the proposed rule. Further, the  Clean Air Act requires EPA to allow the submission of public comments,  and the final rule must be accompanied by a response to each of the  significant comments. Significant public comments that raise  environmental justice issues would be addressed along with any other  significant public comments on the proposed rule. After considering formal  public comments and sometimes changing the economic review and the  rule as a result, EPA publishes the final rule in the Federal Register and on  the Internet. After a specified time period, the rule goes into effect.", "In this context, you asked us to determine how EPA considered  environmental justice in both drafting and finalizing significant clean air  rules between fiscal years 2000 and 2004. Drafting the rule included initial  reports flagging potential issues for senior management, activities of the  workgroups that considered regulatory options, the economic review of  the proposed rule\u2019s costs, and making the proposed rule available for  public comment. Finalizing the rule included addressing public comments,  revising the economic review, and publication of the final review in the  Federal Register.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed EPA documents and held  discussions with EPA officials in Washington, D.C.; Anne Arbor, Michigan;  and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, relating to three final clean air  rules that were considered significant by EPA and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and were finalized between October 1,  1999, and September 30, 2004. In order to identify the rules we would  review in detail, we initially analyzed a database of clean air rules finalized  between fiscal years 2000 and 2004. We then selected rules for review (1)  that involved the EPA Administrator\u2019s office or extensive cross-agency  involvement and (2) that were sent to OMB for review. Rules are sent to  OMB for review if their expected annual costs or benefits exceed $100  million, if they raise novel legal or policy issues, or if they may interfere  with actions undertaken by another federal agency or a state, local, or  tribal government. We examined two mobile source rules: one rule  addressed, among other things, the sulfur content of gasoline used in cars  and similar vehicles (the gasoline rule, promulgated in 2000), and a second  rule addressed, among other things, the sulfur content of diesel fuel used in  trucks and similar vehicles (the diesel rule, promulgated in 2001). We also  examined the rule for implementing the 8-hour ozone national ambient air  quality standard (the ozone implementation rule, promulgated in 2004). A  more detailed description of these rules can be found in appendix I. We  also selected these rules because, of the 19 clean air rules finalized during  this period that met our criteria, they are the only 3 that included the terms  \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d or \u201cExecutive Order 12898\u201d in the final rule. We  believed that compared with the other 16 rules, these 3 were more likely to  include an in-depth consideration of environmental justice by EPA.  Therefore, these 3 rules are not likely to be representative of all 19 rules.", "In addition, we are including information in this report on how EPA  considered environmental justice in drafting three proposed rules of  substantial congressional interest, detailed in appendix II. We did not  review how EPA considered environmental justice when finalizing these  rules because they had not been finalized when we completed our initial  fieldwork. Additional details about our scope and methodology are  provided in appendix III. We conducted our work between July 2004 and  May 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Even before Executive Order 12898 was issued in 1994, EPA took steps to  address environmental justice. For example, in 1992, it established the  Office of Environmental Equity, which is now known as the Office of  Environmental Justice, to focus on environmental pollution affecting racial  minorities and low-income communities, but this office has no specific role  in rulemaking. In 1993, EPA created the National Environmental Justice  Advisory Committee to provide independent advice and recommendations  to the Administrator on environmental justice matters.", "The 1994 executive order stated that EPA and other federal agencies, to the  extent practicable and permitted by law, shall make achieving  environmental justice part of their missions by identifying and addressing,  as appropriate, the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority  populations and low-income populations in the United States. The  executive order does not create a right to sue the government or seek any  judicial remedy for an agency\u2019s failure to comply with the order.", "After the issuance of the executive order, EPA took additional steps to  identify and address environmental justice. Among other things, in 1994,  the Administrator issued guidance for the rulemaking process suggesting  that environmental justice be considered early in the rulemaking process.  In 1995, EPA issued an Environmental Justice Strategy that included,  among other things, (1) ensuring that environmental justice is incorporated  into the agency\u2019s regulatory process, (2) continuing to develop human  exposure data through model development, and (3) enhancing public  participation in agency decision making. In 2001, the Administrator issued  a memorandum defining environmental justice more broadly to mean \u201cthe  fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes, with respect to  the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws  and policies, and their meaningful involvement in the decision making  processes of the government.\u201d In 2004, EPA developed new guidance for  rulemaking that, like its earlier 1994 guidance, suggested that  environmental justice be considered early in the rulemaking process.", "Under the Clean Air Act, EPA, along with state and local government units  and other entities, regulates air emissions of various substances that harm  human health. According to EPA data, from 1995 though 2004, emissions of  certain air pollutants have declined from 15 percent to as much 31 percent,  as shown in table 1.", "In addition, EPA sets primary national ambient air quality standards for six  principal pollutants that harm human health and the environment. These  standards are to be set at a level that protects human health with an  adequate margin of safety, which, according to EPA, includes protecting  sensitive populations, such as the elderly and people with respiratory or  circulatory problems. These six pollutants include the five types of  emissions listed in table 1, along with ozone, which is not emitted directly  but is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react  in the presence of sunlight. According to EPA, in 2003, about 161 million  people (about 56 percent of the population) lived in areas where the  concentration of ozone met the standard; about 120 million people (41  percent) lived in areas where the concentration of particulate matter met  EPA\u2019s standard; and about 168 million people (58 percent) lived in areas  where the concentrations of the other four pollutants met the standards.", "EPA has a multistage process for developing clean air and other rules that it  considers high priority (the top two of three priority levels) because of the  expected involvement of the Administrator, among other factors. Initially, a  workgroup chair is chosen from the lead program office, such as the Office  of Air and Radiation (Air Office) in the case of clean air rulemaking. The  workgroup chair assigns the rule one of the three priority levels, and EPA\u2019s  top management makes a final determination of the rule\u2019s priority. The  priority level assigned depends on such factors as the level of the  Administrator\u2019s involvement and whether more than one office in the  agency is involved. The gasoline, diesel, and ozone implementation rules  were classified as high-priority rules on the basis of these factors. In  addition, these rules were considered significant because they had an  effect of $100 million or more a year on the economy, or they raised novel  legal or policy issues and, therefore, were required under Executive Order  12866 to be sent to OMB. Among other things, an OMB review is  conducted to ensure that the rule is consistent with federal laws and the  President\u2019s priorities, including executive orders.", "EPA guidance identifies environmental justice as one of many factors to be  considered early in the rulemaking process. In 1994, the EPA Administrator  established guidance for rulemaking and identified 11 characteristics for  \u201cquality actions\u201d in rulemaking. Among these characteristics were (1)  consistency with legal requirements and national policies, which would  include Executive Order 12898, and (2) adherence to the Administrator\u2019s  seven priorities, which included environmental justice. According to the  guidance, managers must consider all 11 areas early on and be explicit  about any trade-offs made among them.", "For high-priority rules, the workgroup chair is responsible for, among other  things, ensuring that work gets done and the process is documented. Other  workgroup members are assigned from the lead program office and, in the  case of the two highest priority rules, from other offices. The workgroup  may conduct such activities as (1) collaborating to prepare a plan for  developing the rule, (2) seeking early input from senior management, (3)  consulting with stakeholders, (4) collecting data and analyzing issues, (5)  considering various options, and (6) recommending usually one option to  managers. In addition, an economist (who typically participates in the  workgroup) prepares an economic review of the proposed rule\u2019s costs to  society. According to EPA, the \u201cultimate purpose\u201d of an economic review is  to inform decision makers of the social welfare consequences of the rule.  Finally, after the approval of all relevant offices within EPA, the proposed  rule is published in the Federal Register, the public is invited to comment  on it, and EPA considers the comments. Comments may address any aspect  of the proposed rule, including whether environmental justice issues are  raised and appropriately addressed in the proposed rule. Sometimes, prior  to the publication of the proposed rule, EPA publishes an Advanced Notice  of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register. The notice provides an  opportunity for interested stakeholders to provide input to EPA early in the  process, and the agency takes such comments into account to an  appropriate extent, according to EPA.", "In finalizing a rule, EPA is required to provide a response to all significant  public comments, including those on environmental justice, and to prepare  a final economic review. After these tasks are completed, the rule, if it is  significant, is sent to OMB for approval. Once OMB approves the final rule  and the Administrator signs it, it is published in the Federal Register. After  a specified time period, the rule goes into effect.", "Within EPA, the Air Office is primarily responsible for implementing the  Clean Air Act, as amended. Within that office, the Office of Air Quality  Planning and Standards is primarily responsible for developing the majority  of new rules for stationary sources resulting from the act. Also within the  Air Office, the Office of Transportation and Air Quality has primary  responsibility for developing rules and other programs to control mobile  source emissions.

Specifically, the assessment stated that EPA determined the rule would not  create environmental justice issues, based on its analysis of the 1997 rule  that established the 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard.  However, the earlier rule referred to its economic review, which stated it  was not possible to rigorously consider the potential environmental justice  effects of the rule because the states were responsible for its  implementation. The inability of EPA to rigorously consider environmental  justice in the 1997 rule does not seem to support EPA\u2019s statement that there  were no environmental justice issues raised by the ozone implementation  rule. Also, the economic impact assessment did not address the potential  environmental justice effects of a certain provision, which EPA stated 2  months later, in the proposed rule, might raise environmental justice  issues.

In the proposed gasoline rule, EPA stated that environmental  justice is an important economic dimension to consider, but it did not  describe whether it was considered or whether the proposed rule raised  any environmental justice issues. In the proposed diesel rule, in a section  on environmental justice, EPA stated that the rule would improve air  quality across the country and could be expected to mitigate environmental  justice concerns about concentrations of diesel emissions. More  particularly, EPA stated that health benefits could be expected for  populations near bus terminals and commercial distribution centers, where  diesel truck traffic would be concentrated, because pollutants in diesel  emissions would be reduced. The treatment of environmental justice in the  proposed ozone implementation rule was unclear because two sections of  the rule appeared to contradict each other.

Also, a representative of a petroleum company stated  that EPA needed to address environmental justice issues. EPA responded  by taking two actions. It (1) analyzed the rule\u2019s potential impact on  communities around refineries and (2) sought stakeholders\u2019 views on  environmental justice and other issues relating to refinery emissions.", "First, EPA estimated how two types of refinery and vehicle emissions  would change, as a result of the rule, in 86 U.S. counties that contained a  refinery. The two types of emissions\u2014nitrogen oxides and volatile organic  compounds\u2014contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, which is  regulated under the Clean Air Act because it is harmful to human health.  EPA estimated that the increase in refinery emissions could be greater than  the decrease in vehicle emissions, resulting in a net increase in emissions  of one or both substances, in 26 counties (about 30 percent of the total), as  shown in table 3. Specifically, it estimated that emissions of both  substances could increase in 10 counties, with a population of about 13  million people, and that emissions of only one substance would increase in  another 16 counties. On the other hand, EPA estimated that emissions of  both substances could decrease in 60 counties. For example, EPA  estimated that in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, net emissions of nitrogen  oxides could increase 298 tons as a result of the rule, reflecting an increase  in refinery emissions of 356 tons and a decrease in vehicle emissions of 58  tons. Conversely, it estimated that in Calcasieu Parish, emissions of volatile  organic compounds could decrease by 61 tons, reflecting an increase in  refinery emissions of 84 tons and a decrease in vehicle emissions of 145  tons.", "The results of EPA\u2019s analysis appear to support those commenters who  asserted that the rule might create environmental justice issues in some  localities.

However we do not believe the Tier  2/gasoline sulfur control rule will cause such an exchange.\u201d EPA also stated  that, for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of areas near refineries, the benefits of reduced  emissions from vehicles would \u201cfar outweigh\u201d any increase in refinery  emissions.", "When asked whether this analysis appeared to confirm concerns about the  rule\u2019s potential environmental justice impacts, EPA officials told us that the  analysis was limited and overstated the net increase in refinery emissions  in two ways. First, according to EPA officials, the analysis did not consider  the actions that refiners would likely take to offset increases in emissions  because of the new rule; EPA assumed that they would seek to reduce  emissions in other ways to avoid additional regulation at the state level.  EPA said it believed these actions would limit the expected increases in  refining emissions. Second, EPA analyzed the effect of the rule only for  2007. EPA officials said they believed that the benefits of the rule would  increase after that year, as new (and cleaner) vehicles increasingly  replaced older (and less clean) vehicles.", "We note two other ways in which the analysis was limited in estimating the  potential effects on communities near refineries. First, EPA did not ask  refiners about the rule\u2019s impact on their output of these two emissions, nor  did EPA perform an analysis to determine how the rule would impact  individual refiners\u2019 emissions of these two substances. Instead, EPA  assumed that emissions would increase by the same proportion at each  refinery\u2014nitrogen oxides, by 4.5 percent, and volatile organic compounds,  by 3.32 percent\u2014although individual refineries increases could be lesser or  greater than these percentages. Secondly, EPA did not estimate the rules\u2019  impact on other pollutants, such as particulate matter and sulfur dioxide,  which might also increase as a result of the increase in refining activity  needed to comply with the rule.", "EPA did not make the results of its analysis available to the public, either in  the economic review of the final rule or elsewhere in the docket, because  EPA officials told us they considered the results of the analysis too  uncertain to release to the public. However, EPA officials told us that the  analysis\u2014along with their assumption that refineries were likely to emit  less emissions than the analysis indicated\u2014supported their belief that the  rule would be unlikely to cause environmental justice impacts. In addition,  these officials said they believed that, if the rule did create environmental  justice issues, they could be best addressed by the state or local  governments. This is because any refiners needing to increase their  emissions to comply with the gasoline rule would have to submit specific  plans to such governments during the permitting process.", "Second, EPA believed that environmental justice issues would be best  addressed during the permitting process, and EPA hired a contractor to  solicit stakeholders\u2019 potential concerns about this issue. In September  1999, the contractor interviewed individuals from EPA, environmental  organizations, the oil refining industry, and state agencies responsible for  regulating refinery emissions to ascertain their views. In December 1999,  the contractor again sought stakeholders\u2019 views, focusing largely on local  environmental groups, because few of them were interviewed in  September. In December, local environmental groups stated that they did  not trust the state environmental agencies, and that they perceived that  EPA had \u201ctalked exclusively with industry representatives prior to  developing the proposed rule, but not to the local environmental  organizations.\u201d In addition, these groups said that they did not want \u201cany  added emissions to their air, even if there will be a net benefit to the  nation\u2019s environment.\u201d", "In response to the stakeholders\u2019 concerns, the contractor recommended  that EPA develop permitting teams, provide information about the rule, and  enhance community involvement. The contractor said that these  recommendations would improve the permitting process for all  stakeholders by addressing issues specific to each permit, potentially  including environmental justice. EPA said that it would implement the  contractor\u2019s recommendations for improving the permitting process to deal  with environmental justice issues.", "EPA stated that it believed that environmental justice issues could be dealt  with during the permitting process at the state or local level, and officials  told us that EPA has limited direct authority over permitting because most  permitting occurs at the state level. Several groups commented that the  states, not EPA, \u201cact as the permitting authorities\u201d over refineries. EPA said  it agreed that states generally have primary authority over permitting.

During the drafting of the three rules, even when the workgroups discussed  environmental justice, their capability to identify potential concerns may  have been limited by a lack of guidance, training, and involvement of EPA\u2019s  environmental justice coordinators. It is important that EPA thoroughly  consider environmental justice because the states and other entities, which  generally have the primary permitting authority, are not subject to  Executive Order 12898.", "EPA\u2019s capability to identify environmental justice concerns through  economic reviews also appears to be limited. More than 10 years have  elapsed since the executive order directed federal agencies, to the extent  practicable and permitted by law, to identify and address the  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects  of their programs, policies, and activities. However, EPA apparently does  not have sufficient data and modeling techniques to be able to distinguish  localized adverse impacts for a specific community. For example, EPA has  not agreed upon the complete list of data that would be needed to perform  an environmental justice analysis. This suggests that, although EPA has  developed general guidance for considering environmental justice, it has  not established specific modeling techniques for assessing the potential  environmental justice implications of any clean air rules. In addition, by not  including a discussion of environmental justice in all of the economic  reviews, EPA decision makers may not have been fully informed about the  environmental justice impacts of all the rules.", "Finally, even though members of the public commented about two rules\u2019  potential to increase refinery emissions\u2014potential environmental justice  issues, (1) in one case, EPA did not provide a response and (2) in the other  case, it did not explain the basis for its response, such as the rationale for  its beliefs and the data on which it based its beliefs.

In  addition, he provided technical comments that we incorporated where  appropriate.", "First, EPA expressed the view that its rules have resulted in better air  quality nationally. EPA said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that we did not  accurately reflect its progress in achieving environmental justice with  respect to air pollution. It noted that the three rules are part of a larger  program that is making significant progress in providing cleaner air  nationwide. Second, EPA stated that in examining the agency\u2019s process for  considering environmental justice, we asked the wrong question, and that  we should have focused on the outcome of the rulemaking process\u2014the  rules themselves. Finally, it stated that our evidence of how it considered  environmental justice during the development of the three final rules did  not support our conclusions and recommendations, and it provided  detailed information about the efforts it took relating to environmental  justice for the three final rules.", "We question the relevance of the information provided on air quality  nationally and disagree with EPA\u2019s other two points. First, in addition to the  data we had already presented on the decrease in emissions of certain air  pollutants, EPA provided data on overall improvements in air quality,  specifically the decrease in the number of areas throughout the nation that  did not meet certain ambient air quality standards. However, because these  data provide no detail on the conditions facing specific groups\u2014for  example, residents of areas near refineries, who might be negatively  affected by the two mobile source rules\u2014these data are not necessarily  germane to environmental justice. Although Executive Order 12898 calls on  agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse  effects of its programs, policies, and activities on specific groups, EPA  provided no information about such groups. Also, we believe that EPA\u2019s  statement about the effect of clean air rules on national air quality at some  level misses the point. Second, EPA suggested that it would have been  more appropriate for us to look at the outcomes of its efforts than at the  process that produced the outcomes. We agree with EPA that outcomes are  important, but it is not yet clear whether the rules we examined will  address environmental justice issues effectively because the rules are being  implemented over the next several years. It is also important to examine  the process that led to the rules\u2014as we did. The various process steps are  intended to help ensure that EPA\u2019s activities during the many phases of  drafting and finalizing all rules are efficiently and effectively focused on  achieving the desired outcomes.", "Third, although EPA stated that our evidence did not support our  conclusions and recommendations, it did not challenge the accuracy of the  information we provided on how it considered environmental justice  during the many phases of developing the three final rules discussed in the  body of our report and the three proposed rules discussed in appendix II.", "While it provided detailed information on certain activities and the  rationale for undertaking them, our report already discussed nearly all of  these activities. For example, EPA noted at length its efforts, after drafting  the gasoline rule, to hold discussions with environmental justice and other  groups on issues relating to permits that refiners would need if they  increased their emissions to comply with the rule. We already  acknowledged these efforts in our report. However, EPA\u2019s efforts at this  stage do not mitigate the fact that it devoted little attention to  environmental justice up to that point, nor the fact that discussions with  affected groups, while beneficial, do not offset the effects of possible  increases in refinery emissions on these groups. EPA is essentially relying  on state and local governments to deal with environmental justice concerns  as they implement the gasoline and diesel rules at the refinery level, even  though the executive order does not apply to state or local governments,  and, absent specific state or local law, they have no obligation to consider  environmental justice when issuing permits. In addition, the three final  rules were selected in part because they mentioned environmental justice  and should have showcased EPA\u2019s efforts to consider environmental  justice. Thus, we continue to believe that the evidence we provided  supports our conclusions and recommendations.", "Finally, aside from its general statement that the evidence we presented  does not support our conclusions and recommendations, EPA generally did  not respond to our four recommendations. We continue to believe that all  of them are still warranted. With respect to our recommendation that  workgroups devote attention to environmental justice while developing  clean air rules, EPA stated that it \u201cdevoted appropriate attention to  environmental justice issues\u201d in the three final rules. EPA\u2019s guidance  suggests that environmental justice be considered both at the beginning of  process (when the rules are drafted) and at the end of the process (when  they are finalized). However, nearly all of the attention EPA described came  at the end of the process\u2014after receiving public comments.", "EPA responded in part to our recommendation on the need to provide  guidance and training to workgroup members and the need to involve  environmental justice coordinators. EPA did not provide any information  that would refute the finding on the lack of guidance and training, for  example, by bringing to our attention any guidance or training that it  provides to workgroup members. However, EPA noted that an  environmental justice coordinator \u201cwas heavily involved\u201d in one of the  three final rules and became an \u201cad hoc member\u201d of the workgroup for the  gasoline rule \u201caround the time the rule was proposed.\u201d From EPA\u2019s  comment, it is clear that the coordinator became involved only at the end  of the process of drafting this rule (i.e., \u201caround the time the rule was  proposed\u201d). Further, EPA did not mention whether a coordinator was  involved at all in the other two final rules, nor in the three proposed rules.", "EPA did not comment specifically on our recommendation on the need to  improve assessments of potential environmental justice impacts in  economic reviews or provide any information that would refute the finding  that led to it. EPA responded in part to our recommendation on the need to  respond fully, when feasible, to public comments on environmental justice.  Specifically, it noted that it did not respond to comments on the Advanced  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the diesel rule, and that it is has no legal  or policy obligation to respond to comments on an Advanced Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking.

Rules are considered significant and sent to the Office of Management and  Budget for review if their expected annual costs or benefits exceed $100  million; they raise novel legal or policy issues; or they may interfere with  actions undertaken by another federal agency or state, local, or tribal  governments.

We disagree with EPA\u2019s assertion that the Air Office paid appropriate  attention to environmental justice issues. We found that EPA devoted  little attention to environmental justice in four phases of drafting the  rules and considered environmental justice to varying degrees in the  three phases of finalizing them. EPA provided virtually no new  information on its activities during these phases.  2. EPA was referring to our report entitled Clean Air Act: EPA Has  Completed Most of the Actions Required by the 1990 Amendments, but  Many Were Completed Late, GAO-05-613 (Washington, D.C.: May 27,  2005). 3. As we stated, several public commenters said that the ozone  implementation rule, as proposed in June 2003, could have potential  environmental justice impacts. As we also stated, in April 2004, EPA  finalized a portion of the ozone implementation rule, which it then  called Phase I; but it did not include the provision that drew the public  comments on environmental justice. EPA officials are still considering  this provision for a second phase of the rule implementing a new  ground-level ozone standard, called Phase II. It is true, as EPA stated,  that we did not identify any environmental justice issues in the Phase I  rule. However, our objective was not to identify such issues with the  rules, but to review how EPA considered environmental justice in  developing the rules. 4. On the basis of EPA\u2019s letter, we added clarification about the \u201cseemingly  contradictory statements\u201d in our discussion of the ozone  implementation rule. 5. As we stated, public commenters did raise such issues about all three  rules as they were proposed. As we also stated, EPA did not finalize the  portion of the ozone implementation rule that it, and others, said could  raise environmental justice issues. 6. While EPA stated that our report is misleading and needs further  explanation of context, it is not clear from EPA\u2019s comments how the  agency would want us to frame this issue differently. First, EPA  comments that EPA staff believed that, as a factual matter, as the rule  was implemented, it was unlikely to pose environmental justice issues.  Similarly, we state in the report that EPA officials believed that the final  rules did not create environmental justice issues. Second, EPA stated  that we should note the steps that the agency took to address potential  environmental justice concerns. We did so, noting EPA\u2019s discussion of  these steps in the final rule. Moreover, in its letter, EPA stated that it  agreed with us that the gasoline rule (finalized in February 2000) would  create \u201cpotential environmental justice issues.\u201d It was public  commenters, not we, who raised concerns about potential  environmental justice issues.  7. We clarified in the Highlights page and other portions of the report to  note that EPA officials told us, after the rules were finalized, that none  of the rules created an environmental justice issue. 8. We clarified the source of EPA\u2019s statements. The preamble of the final  rule is discussed in our report. 9. According to EPA, we stated that the Air Office\u2019s environmental justice  coordinators were not involved in the gasoline rulemaking. In fact, we  stated only that the coordinators were not involved in developing the  rule, as opposed to public outreach efforts, where they were involved.  EPA\u2019s description of how and when a coordinator was involved  buttressed our point. According to EPA\u2019s letter, the environmental  justice coordinator was involved only in resolving \u201cpermitting process  issues\u201d and became involved only \u201caround the time the rule was  proposed.\u201d Similarly, according to EPA\u2019s letter, the Office of  Environmental Justice representative was involved only in discussions  of \u201cpermitting issues\u201d and only \u201cafter the proposed  rule was  published.\u201d Thus, it appears that in neither case were they substantively  involved in drafting this rule. We added language in the report clarifying  the discussion of the process. 10. As EPA noted, it devoted resources to seeking public involvement while  finalizing the gasoline rule. Accordingly, we changed our  characterization of EPA\u2019s efforts in finalizing the three rules.  11. EPA\u2019s public involvement policy provides that it will, to the fullest  extent possible, respond to public comments. We did not see a  distinction in the policy between comments on Advanced Notices of  Proposed Rulemaking and comments on proposed rulemakings.
