PCORI is a federally funded, nonprofit corporation established to carry out and improve comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER), which evaluates and compares the health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness, risks, and benefits of two or more medical treatments, services, or items. PCORI provides funding through award commitments from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (Trust Fund) and may pay these awards over multiple years. Of the $2 billion PCORI committed as of the end of fiscal year 2017, about $1.6 billion (or 79 percent of its commitments) is for research awards, and $325 million (or 16 percent) is for building the capacity to use existing health data for research. Through fiscal year 2017, commitments for dissemination and implementation awards\u2014intended to share CER findings with potential users of this research\u2014were limited because most PCORI-funded research was still underway. PCORI projects to commit an additional $721 million for awards in fiscal years 2018 through 2021. In addition to awards, PCORI spent $310 million on program and administrative support services in fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and projects to spend an additional $206 million for these services through fiscal year 2024.", "From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) obligated about $448 million from the Trust Fund. Of this amount, HHS obligated about $260 million (or 58 percent of all obligations) to the dissemination and implementation of CER findings. As most PCORI-funded CER had not yet been completed due to the time needed to conduct this research, HHS efforts focused instead on the dissemination and implementation of CER funded by other federal entities.

For example, a recent CER study found that the life  expectancy of women over age 50 with breast cancer in one breast, but  who do not carry the breast cancer gene mutation, is similar whether they  have one or both breasts removed. Another recent study compared the  effectiveness and safety of treatments for childhood anxiety disorders and  found that a combination of medications and therapy is likely more  effective than either treatment alone.

(See app. IV for an  overview of these activities.)", "In response to a recommendation in our 2015 report on HHS\u2019s CER  activities, ASPE implemented a monitoring system to track progress  toward its milestones and deliverables for these projects. ASPE also  contracted to evaluate its projects to build data capacity for CER. The  evaluation, completed in December 2017, found that ASPE made  progress managing these projects towards the core functionalities  outlined in its strategic framework. However, among other things, the  evaluation found that additional efforts are needed to explore how to  enhance data privacy and security, ensure data quality, and  operationalize related standards.
