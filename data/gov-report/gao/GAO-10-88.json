Because of the significance of the federal debt held by the public to the governmentwide financial statements, GAO audits the Bureau of the Public Debt's (BPD) Schedules of Federal Debt annually. The audit of these schedules is done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) the schedules are reliable and (2) BPD management maintained effective internal control over financial reporting relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Further, GAO tests compliance with a significant provision of law related to the Schedule of Federal Debt (statutory debt limit). Federal debt managed by BPD consists of Treasury securities held by the public and by certain federal government accounts, referred to as intragovernmental debt holdings. The level of debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the nation's wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues. Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds such as Social Security, that typically have an obligation to invest their excess annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In GAO's opinion, BPD's Schedules of Federal Debt for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were fairly presented in all material respects, and BPD maintained effective internal control over financial reporting relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt as of September 30, 2009. GAO found no instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2009 with the statutory debt limit. As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, federal debt managed by BPD totaled about $11,898 billion and $10,011 billion, respectively. During the last 4 fiscal years, managing the federal debt has continued to be a challenge as evidenced by the growth of total federal debt by $3,980 billion, or 50 percent, from $7,918 billion as of September 30, 2005, to $11,898 billion as of September 30, 2009. The increase to the federal debt has become particularly acute since the onset of the recession in December 2007. Federal government actions in response to both the financial market crisis and the economic downturn have added significantly to Treasury's borrowing needs. The fiscal year 2008 increase in total federal debt of $1,018 billion was the largest annual dollar increase in history; only to be surpassed by the fiscal year 2009 increase of $1,887 billion. During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, legislation was enacted to raise the statutory debt limit on three different occasions. During this period, the statutory debt limit went from $9,815 billion to its current level of $12,104 billion, an increase of 23 percent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The accompanying auditor\u2019s report presents the results of our audits of the  Schedules of Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt for  the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009 and 2008.  The Schedules of  Federal Debt present the beginning balances, increases and decreases, and  ending balances for (1) Federal Debt Held by the Public and  Intragovernmental Debt Holdings, (2) the related Accrued Interest  Payables, and (3) the related Net Unamortized Premiums and Discounts  managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD).", "The auditor\u2019s report contains our (1) opinion on the Schedules of Federal  Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, (2) opinion on  the effectiveness of relevant internal control over financial reporting as of  September 30, 2009, (3) conclusion on BPD\u2019s compliance in fiscal year 2009  with a selected provision of a law we tested, and (4) conclusion on the  consistency between information in the Schedules of Federal Debt and the  accompanying Overview on Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the  Public Debt.", "As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, federal debt managed by the bureau  totaled about $11,898 billion and $10,011 billion, respectively, primarily for  moneys borrowed to fund the federal government\u2019s operations.  As shown  on the Schedules of Federal Debt, these balances consisted of  approximately (1) $7,552 billion as of September 30, 2009, and $5,809  billion as of September 30, 2008, of debt held by the public and about (2)  $4,346 billion as of September 30, 2009, and $4,202 billion as of September  30, 2008, of intragovernmental debt holdings.", "The level of debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the  nation\u2019s wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance  prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues.  It represents the  cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today\u2019s economy and the  federal budget.  To finance a cash deficit, the federal government borrows  from the public. When a cash surplus occurs, the annual excess funds can  then be used to reduce debt held by the public. In other words, annual cash  deficits or surpluses generally approximate the annual net change in the  amount of federal government borrowing from the public.", "Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities  held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds (e.g.,  Social Security), that typically have an obligation to invest their excess  annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities.  Most federal trust  funds invest in special U.S. Treasury securities that are guaranteed for  principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.   The federal government uses the trust funds\u2019 invested cash surpluses to  assist in funding other federal government operations. The Treasury  securities held by the federal government accounts are not shown as  balances on the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements  because, under current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, they  represent loans from one part of the federal government to another.  When  the federal government\u2019s financial statements are consolidated, those  offsetting balances are eliminated.  These securities are nonmarketable;  however, they represent a priority call on future federal budgetary  resources.", "While both are important, debt held by the public and intragovernmental  debt holdings are very different.  Debt held by the public approximates the  federal government\u2019s competition with other sectors in the credit markets.   Federal borrowing absorbs resources available for private investment and  may put upward pressure on interest rates.  In addition, interest on debt  held by the public is paid in cash and represents a burden on current  taxpayers.  It reflects the amount the federal government pays to its outside  creditors.  In contrast, intragovernmental debt holdings typically do not  require cash payments from the current budget or represent a burden on  the current economy.  In addition, from the perspective of the budget as a  whole, interest payments to federal government accounts by Treasury are  entirely offset by the income received by such accounts. This  intragovernmental debt and related interest represent a claim on future  resources and hence a burden on future taxpayers and the future economy.  Specifically, when trust funds redeem Treasury securities to obtain cash to  fund expenditures, Treasury usually borrows from the public to finance  these redemptions. Such borrowings result in competition for funds with  the private sector and thus an effect on the economy.", "We have audited the Schedule of Federal Debt since fiscal year 1997. Over  this period, total federal debt has more than doubled, increasing by 120  percent. During the last 4 fiscal years, managing the federal debt has  continued to be a challenge as evidenced by the growth of total federal debt  by $3,980 billion, or 50 percent, from $7,918 billion as of September 30,  2005, to $11,898 billion as of September 30, 2009. The increase to the  federal debt has become particularly acute since the onset of the recession  in December 2007. Federal government actions in response to both the  financial market crisis and the economic downturn have added  significantly to Treasury\u2019s borrowing needs.  The fiscal year 2008 increase  in total federal debt of $1,018 billion was the largest annual dollar increase  in history; only to be surpassed by the fiscal year 2009 increase of $1,887  billion. Of the fiscal year 2009 increase, about $1,743 billion was from the  increase in debt held by the public and about $144 billion was from the  increase in intragovernmental debt holdings. Two primary factors  contributed to the increase in debt held by the public. First, there was the  largest reported deficit in history of $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009,  compared to $455 billion in fiscal year 2008. Second, a significant amount  of assets were purchased primarily relating to the Government Sponsored  Enterprise Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchase Program and the  Troubled Asset Relief Program in which debt was borrowed to fund the  purchases.  Treasury met its borrowing needs in part by reintroducing the  3-year and 7-year notes, both issued monthly, and increasing the amounts  offered at public debt auctions.  Further, Treasury added offerings of both  the 30-year bond and the 10-year note resulting in 12 additional auctions a  year.  During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, legislation was enacted to raise the  statutory debt limit on three different occasions. During this period, the  statutory debt limit went from $9,815 billion to its current level of $12,104  billion, an increase of 23 percent.  Legislation to increase the statutory debt  limit to $13,029 billion was passed by the House of Representatives and  referred to the Senate.  In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury has  requested an increase in the statutory debt limit.  As of November 2, 2009,  an increase had not been enacted.", "Weaknesses in the economy and financial markets\u2014and the federal  government\u2019s response to them\u2014are expected to impact both the annual  federal deficit and related debt in the near term. Official estimates for fiscal  year 2010 show the annual federal deficit will exceed $1 trillion.  Correspondingly, debt held by the public is expected to grow from an  estimated 53.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of fiscal  year 2009 to over 60 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2010.   However, while addressing these near-term pressures is important, the real  challenge is not this year\u2019s deficit or even next year\u2019s; it is how best to  address the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal path over the coming decades.", "While a lot of attention has been understandably given to the recent fiscal  deterioration, the federal government faces even larger fiscal challenges  that will persist long after the return to financial stability and economic  growth.  The budget and economic implications of the baby boom  generation\u2019s retirement have already become a factor in near-term budget  projections and will only intensify as the baby boomers age. The Medicare  Hospital Insurance program currently pays more in benefits than it receives  in cash from payroll taxes.  The Social Security program, which has  historically run large cash surpluses that helped reduce the need to borrow  to finance other federal government activities, is expected to pay more in  benefits than it receives in tax income for a sustained period beginning in  2016.  GAO and the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s long-range fiscal policy  simulations continue to show that, absent significant changes in policy, the  federal government\u2019s fiscal condition over the coming decades is on an  unsustainable path.  The sooner action is taken to address the long-term  fiscal challenge, the less disruptive and destabilizing the changes will be.   As a result, once current economic and financial issues are addressed, the  nation\u2019s leaders will need to turn their attention to the long-term challenges  that lie ahead.", "A continuing trend that we also have noted is the increase in reported  foreign ownership of Treasury securities. Treasury securities held by  foreign and international investors have increased significantly since 2001.   According to amounts reported in the September 2009 Treasury Bulletin,  Treasury estimates that the amount of Treasury securities held by foreign  and international investors has increased by $2,383 billion\u2014from $1,001  billion as of June 30, 2001, to $3,384 billion as of June 30, 2009.  As of June  30, 2009, this represents an estimated 45 percent of debt held by the public,  down from an estimated 50 percent as of June 30, 2008, but up from about  31 percent as of June 30, 2001.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Commissioner of the Bureau of the Public Debt, the  Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury, the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget, and other agency officials.

As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, outstanding gross federal debt managed by the bureau totaled $11,898 and $10,011 billion,  respectively.  The increase in gross federal debt of $1,887 billion during fiscal year 2009 was due to an increase in gross  intragovernmental debt holdings of $144 billion and an increase in gross debt held by the public of $1,743 billion.  As Figure 1 illustrates, both intragovernmental debt holdings and debt held by the public have increased since fiscal year 2005.  The primary  reason for the increases in intragovernmental debt holdings is the Department of the Treasury's use of the surpluses in the Federal  Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Supplementary Medical  Insurance Trust Fund, Military Retirement Fund, and DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund.  The increases in debt held by the public are due primarily to total federal spending exceeding total federal revenues.  As of September 30, 2009, gross debt held  by the public totaled $7,552 billion and gross intragovernmental debt holdings totaled $4,346 billion.", "Interest expense incurred during fiscal year 2009 consists of (1) interest accrued and paid on debt held by the public or credited to  accounts holding intragovernmental debt during the fiscal year, (2) interest accrued during the fiscal year, but not yet paid on debt  held by the public or credited to accounts holding intragovernmental debt, and (3) net amortization of premiums and discounts.  The  primary components of interest expense are interest paid on the debt held by the public and interest credited to federal government  trust funds and other federal government accounts that hold Treasury securities.  The interest paid on the debt held by the public  affects the current spending of the federal government and represents the burden in servicing its debt (i.e., payments to outside  creditors).  Interest credited to federal government trust funds and other federal government accounts, on the other hand, does not  result in an immediate outlay of the Federal Government because one part of the government pays the interest and another part  receives it.  However, this interest represents a claim on future budgetary resources and hence an obligation on future taxpayers.  This  interest, when reinvested by the trust funds and other federal government accounts, is included in the programs\u2019 excess funds not currently needed in operations, which are invested in federal securities.  During fiscal year 2009, interest expense incurred totaled  $381 billion, interest expense on debt held by the public was $189 billion, and $192 billion was interest incurred for  intragovernmental debt holdings.  As Figure 2 illustrates, total interest expense has increased from fiscal years 2005 through 2008,  but decreased from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009.  Due to the current economic conditions, there has been a significant increase  in the demand for government backed securities, which resulted in lower average interest rates and interest expense.  For example, the  average interest rates on Treasury bills outstanding as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, were 0.3 percent and 1.6 percent,  respectively.  Average interest rates on principal balances outstanding as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, are disclosed in the Notes  to the Schedules of Federal Debt.", "Debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the nation\u2019s wealth has been absorbed by the Federal Government  to finance prior federal spending in excess of total federal revenues.  During the fiscal year, changes in economic  conditions resulted in the need for an increase in borrowings from the public to finance federal spending.  Treasury  responded to the increase in marketable borrowing requirements by raising issuance sizes of regular weekly and monthly  bills, increasing the frequency and issuance sizes of cash management bills, increasing the issuance sizes of nominal  coupon security offerings, and adjusting the securities offering calendar to include the reintroduction of certain Treasury  notes.  As a result of this change in debt management strategy, Treasury bill and Treasury note issuances increased by  $2,288 billion and $1,008 billion, respectively, in fiscal year 2009.  Due to the increase in short-term debt issuances,   repayments increased by $2,317 billion during the fiscal year.

Specifically, total SOMA holdings were $769 billion as of September 30, 2009 compared  to $477 billion as of September 30, 2008.  This increase is due to the Treasury portion of the large scale asset purchase program  announced by the Federal Open Market Committee on March 18, 2009.

Large budget deficits emerged during the  1980\u2019s due to tax policy decisions and increased outlays for defense and domestic programs.

From fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009, federal debt held by the public increased an additional 49.6 percent rising by $2,503 billion.  This increase is primarily a result of the  federal government's response to the financial market crisis and the economic downturn.
