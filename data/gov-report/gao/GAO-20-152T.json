Medical center staff must determine whether to hire and retain health care providers by reviewing and verifying information about their qualifications and practice history. The NPDB is a key source of information about a provider's clinical practice history.", "Medical center staff must also investigate any concerns that arise about the clinical care their providers deliver. Depending on the findings from these reviews, medical centers may take an adverse privileging action against a provider. VA medical centers are required to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards under certain circumstances. Failing to adhere to these requirements can negatively affect patient safety.", "This testimony is primarily based on GAO's 2019 and 2017 reports on VHA processes for reviewing and reporting quality and safety concerns about VA providers. It addresses VA medical centers' implementation and VHA's oversight of (1) reviews of adverse information about providers in the NPDB; (2) reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns are raised; and (3) reporting of providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards. For the 2019 report, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 57 VA providers who had an NPDB report. For the 2017 report, GAO reviewed providers whose clinical care was reviewed after a concern was raised about that care at a nongeneralizable selection of five VA medical centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) needs to take action to ensure its health care providers have the appropriate qualifications and clinical abilities to deliver high quality, safe care to veterans, as GAO recommended in its February 2019 and November 2017 reports. Specifically, GAO found the following:", "VA medical centers took action against some providers who did not meet VA licensure requirements, but overlooked others . In its 2019 report, GAO found that some VA medical centers took administrative or disciplinary actions against these providers, such as removing them from employment, after becoming aware of disqualifying information in the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The NPDB is an electronic repository that contains information on providers who have been disciplined by a state licensing board, among other information. However, in some cases VA medical centers overlooked or were unaware of disqualifying information in the NPDB. For example, officials told GAO they inadvertently overlooked a disqualifying adverse action and hired a provider whose license had been revoked for patient neglect. GAO found three reasons for this inconsistency: lack of mandatory training for key staff, gaps in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policies, and inadequate oversight.", "Selected VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care were not always documented . The five selected VA medical centers that GAO included in its 2017 report were required to review 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care from October 2013 through March 2017. However, officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews had been conducted. GAO found two reasons for inadequate documentation of these reviews: gaps in VHA policies and inadequate oversight of the reviews.", "Selected VA medical centers did not report providers to the NPDB or to state licensing boards as required . The five selected VA medical centers that GAO included in its 2017 report had reported one of nine providers to the NPDB that they were required to report from October 2013 through March 2017. None of these providers were reported to state licensing boards, as required by VHA policy. These nine providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them\u2014actions that limit the care providers can deliver at a facility or prevent the providers from delivering care altogether\u2014or resigned or retired while under investigation before such an action could be taken. GAO found two reasons providers were not reported: lack of awareness or understanding of VHA policies and inadequate oversight of this reporting.", "GAO made 11 recommendations in its 2019 and 2017 reports to address the deficiencies identified. VA implemented two of these 11 recommendations, and provided action plans to address the other nine recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent body of work on  provider qualifications and competence at the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA). VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates one of  the largest health care systems in the nation, and has approximately  165,000 licensed health care providers, such as physicians and nurses,  across its 172 VA medical centers and over 1,000 outpatient facilities.  Like other health care facilities, VA medical centers are responsible for  ensuring that their providers deliver safe care to patients. As part of this  responsibility, VA medical centers are required to determine whether  each provider has the appropriate professional qualifications and clinical  abilities to care for patients. During this process, known as credentialing,  VA medical center officials review and verify information about the  provider\u2019s qualifications and practice history. Such information can  include the provider\u2019s application for employment at VA, education, and  state licenses. VA providers are required to hold at least one active and  unrestricted medical license. If a provider has ever had a license revoked  for cause, or has voluntarily surrendered a license after being notified in  writing by the state of potential revocation of the license for cause, the  provider is not eligible for VA employment, unless the license is restored  to a full and unrestricted status.", "As part of credentialing, VHA policy also requires VA medical centers to  review the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) for any adverse  information about a provider. The NPDB is an electronic repository  administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that  collects and releases information on providers who either have been  disciplined by a state licensing board, professional society, or health care  entity, such as a hospital, or have been named in a medical malpractice  settlement or judgment. Consistent with industry standards, VHA policy  requires VA medical centers to query the NPDB and verify with the  appropriate state licensing boards that a provider\u2019s medical licenses are  current and in good standing\u2014unrestricted\u2014before appointing a provider  to its medical staff. VHA policy also requires VA medical centers to query  the NPDB when licensed independent providers such as physicians\u2014 those who can independently provide medical care\u2014renew their clinical  privileges. Additionally, VHA enrolls these licensed independent  providers in the NPDB continuous query, which alerts VHA if any entity  reports information on a provider to the NPDB. (See appendix I for  additional details on VHA\u2019s credentialing, privileging, and monitoring  processes.)", "The presence of information in the NPDB does not automatically  disqualify a provider from working at VA medical centers. Each VA  medical center has broad discretion in hiring providers, within parameters.  For example, a provider listed in the NPDB for a revoked license can be  employed by VA if the license has been restored. If the NPDB indicates  that a provider has had other state licensing board action, such as a  reprimand, VA medical center officials must review the information on a  case-by-case basis and document their review.", "After a provider is hired, VA medical centers are also required to  investigate and, if warranted, address any concerns that may arise about  the provider\u2019s clinical care. Concerns about a provider\u2019s clinical care can  be raised for many reasons, ranging from a provider not adequately  documenting information about a patient\u2019s visit to practicing in a manner  that is unsafe or inconsistent with industry standards of care. VA medical  centers may also become aware of a potential concern if the NPDB  includes new adverse information about an existing provider. If VA  medical centers fail to properly review and address concerns that have  been raised about a provider, veterans may be exposed to unsafe care  and potential harm.", "Depending on the nature of the concern and the findings from their  review, VA medical center officials may take adverse privileging actions  against a provider that either limits the care the provider is allowed to  deliver at the facility or prevent the provider from delivering care  altogether. VA medical center officials are required to report independent  providers against whom they take adverse privileging actions to the  NPDB so that this information is available to other VA medical centers,  non-VA hospitals, and other health care facilities. VA medical center  officials are also required to report providers\u2014both independent and  dependent\u2014to state licensing boards when there are serious concerns  about providers\u2019 clinical care. State licensing boards can then investigate  and determine if a provider\u2019s conduct or ability to deliver care warrants  action against the provider\u2019s medical license.", "Over the past few months, the VA Office of Inspector General and the  media have reported on multiple cases of quality and safety concerns  regarding specific VA providers. The issues reported range from  providers lacking appropriate qualifications to poor performance and  provider misconduct. For example, the VA Office of Inspector General  reported in September 2019 that a VA medical center did not comply with  several VHA credentialing and privileging activities in hiring and reviewing  a surgeon. The Inspector General substantiated that the VA medical  center staff did not appropriately verify the provider\u2019s credentials.  Additionally, despite ongoing concerns about the provider\u2019s productivity,  competency, and technical skills, medical center leadership reappointed  the provider to the medical staff, which the VA Inspector General said  allowed the provider to continue performing surgical procedures without  the required training or competency to do so.", "My testimony today summarizes key findings from our February 2019 and  November 2017 reports on the implementation and oversight of VHA  processes for reviewing and reporting quality and safety concerns about  VA providers. Accordingly, this testimony addresses  1.  VA medical centers\u2019 reviews of adverse information about providers in  the NPDB and VHA\u2019s oversight of these reviews;  2.  selected VA medical centers\u2019 reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after  concerns are raised and VHA\u2019s oversight of these reviews; and  3.  selected VA medical centers\u2019 reporting of providers to the NPDB and  state licensing boards and VHA\u2019s oversight of these processes.", "In addition, I will highlight key actions that we recommended VA take,  including VA\u2019s responses and the current status of those  recommendations.", "For our 2019 report, we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 57 VA  providers, including physicians, nurses, dentists, physical therapists, and  social workers across all 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISN). These 57 providers were listed in the NPDB for an adverse  action, such as a revoked or surrendered license, and were working at  VHA as of September 30, 2016. For each of the individuals in our  sample, we reviewed the VHA personnel and credentialing files, as well  as state licensing board documents. Further details on our scope and  methodology are included in our February 2019 report on credentialing  VA providers. For our 2017 report, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed medical center staff at a nongeneralizable selection of five VA  medical centers (across five different VISNs) to identify any independent  providers whose clinical care was reviewed after a concern was raised  about that care. For each identified provider, we reviewed  documentation and interviewed staff to determine whether the VA medical  center took an adverse privileging action against any of these identified  providers from October 2013 through the time we completed our site  visits in March 2017. Further details on our scope and methodology are  included in our November 2017 report. Finally, we obtained information  from VA officials in October 2019 on the status of their efforts to  implement the recommendations that we made in our 2019 and 2017  reports.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Medical Centers Took Action against Some Selected Providers with Disqualifying Information in the NPDB but Overlooked Others", "paragraphs": ["In our review of 57 providers selected for our February 2019 report, we  found that the responsible VA medical centers took action against some  providers with disqualifying information in the NPDB but overlooked  others. We found that VA medical centers took administrative or  disciplinary actions against some providers, such as removing them from  patient care, after becoming aware of adverse information in the NPDB.  However, many of these actions were taken following our review and a  VHA-wide licensure review, both of which occurred in 2018, rather than at  the time of the NPDB report. Specifically, the responsible VA medical  centers removed five providers who they determined did not meet VA  licensure requirements following our inquiries. For example, one of these  five providers had surrendered a license in 2014, while employed at VA,  but was not removed by the VA medical center until after our inquiries in  2018. Additionally, another provider was reported to the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) by a VA medical center after we  inquired about the provider prescribing controlled substances without  appropriate registration.", "We also found that VA medical centers hired or retained some of the 57  providers who they acknowledged had disqualifying adverse information  in the NPDB, which is inconsistent with VHA policy. Specifically, these  providers had licenses that were revoked or surrendered for cause, but  VA medical center officials overlooked or were unaware of this  information. However, none of these providers still worked at VHA at the  time we completed our review. For example, one VA medical center hired  a provider who had a state license revoked for patient neglect and  substandard care. VA medical center officials stated that they received  the NPDB report about the revoked license at the time the provider was  hired in 2014 but it was inadvertently overlooked by multiple staff. This  provider voluntarily resigned in 2017.", "In our February 2019 report, we found that three factors were largely  responsible for inconsistent adherence to VHA policies that disqualify  providers from employment.", "First, some medical center officials are not aware of key VHA policies,  such as the requirement that a provider who has had a license  revoked or surrendered for cause is ineligible for employment unless  the license is reinstated. For example, in the case of the provider who  surrendered a license in 2014, documentation shows that the medical  center staff became aware of the surrendered license in 2015, but  VHA staff stated that the removal was stalled due to confusion about  policies. This lack of awareness of key policies may be linked to a lack  of mandatory training for credentialing staff.", "Second, gaps in VHA policy allow for inconsistent interpretation. For  example, VHA has not issued policies pertaining to employing  providers who have had their DEA registration for prescribing  controlled substances revoked or surrendered for cause. While the  DEA requires registrants, like VHA, to obtain a waiver before  employing such providers, VHA policy is silent on the requirement to  obtain a waiver; we found that VA medical center officials were  unclear on the DEA requirement and had hired providers without  obtaining the required DEA employment waiver. Further, we found  that two providers inappropriately prescribed controlled substances  without a DEA waiver.", "Third, VHA\u2019s oversight of VA medical centers\u2019 reviews of adverse  information is inadequate. Under VHA policy, VISN officials are  responsible for reviewing providers with certain adverse licensure  actions. However, we found that this review was not always  conducted or documented. Further, although VHA-wide reviews of  provider licenses have been completed and have identified providers  with licensure issues, VHA officials indicated that these types of  reviews are not routinely conducted because they are labor intensive.", "In our February 2019 report, we also found that some VA medical centers  had taken steps to improve the credentialing process and identify  providers who do not meet the licensure requirements. For example, one  medical center completed a periodic review of all licensed providers to  identify providers who may have had an expired licensure issue. Another  VA medical center updated its policies to require providers with adverse  actions to be reviewed by management. However, we found that VHA  does not routinely assemble and disseminate information about initiatives that medical centers have undertaken to improve the oversight of  providers.", "In our February 2019 report, we concluded that without consistent  adherence to VHA employment policies and adequate oversight, VHA  lacks assurance that all VA providers have the appropriate professional  qualifications and clinical abilities to care for patients. To address these  shortcomings, in our February 2019 report we made seven  recommendations to VA. VA concurred with these recommendations.

However, for almost half of these reviews, officials  at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that  the reviews had been conducted. We found that all five VA medical  centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us  they conducted, and in some cases, we found that the required reviews  were not conducted at all. For example, we found that the medical  centers lacked documentation showing they conducted a prospective  review of 26 providers. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed  that they failed to conduct this required review for an additional 21  providers.", "We also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always  conduct reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care in a timely manner. Specifically,  of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16  providers for 3 or more months, and in some cases, for multiple years,  after concerns had been raised about the providers\u2019 care. For three of  these 16 providers, additional concerns about the providers\u2019 clinical care  were raised before the reviews began.", "In our November 2017 report, we found that two factors were largely  responsible for the inadequate documentation and untimely provider  reviews.", "First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all  types of reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care, including retrospective  reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for  initiating reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care.", "Second, VHA\u2019s oversight of the reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care is  inadequate. Under VHA policy, VISN officials are responsible for  overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their  respective VA medical centers. While reviews of providers\u2019 clinical  care after concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and  privileging, we found that none of the VISN officials we spoke with  described any routine oversight of such reviews. This may be in part  because the standardized tool that VHA requires the VISNs to use  during their routine audits does not direct VISN officials to ensure that  all reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care have been conducted and  documented. Further, some of the VISN officials we interviewed told  us they were not using the standardized audit tool as required.", "In our November 2017 report, we concluded that without adequate  documentation and timely completion of reviews of providers\u2019 clinical  care, VA medical center officials lack the information they need to make  decisions about providers\u2019 privileges, including whether or not to take  adverse privileging actions against providers. Furthermore, because of its  inadequate oversight, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that VA medical  center officials are reviewing all providers about whom clinical care  concerns have been raised and are taking adverse privileging actions  against the providers when appropriate. To address these shortcomings  and improve VA medical center reviews of provider quality and safety  concerns, we made three recommendations to VA in our November 2017  report. VA concurred with these recommendations.

Furthermore, none of these nine providers were  reported to state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. These  nine providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them  or resigned or retired while under investigation before an adverse  privileging action could be taken.", "The VA medical centers documented that these nine providers had  significant clinical deficiencies that sometimes resulted in adverse  outcomes for veterans. For example, the documentation shows that one  provider\u2019s surgical incompetence resulted in numerous repeat surgeries  for veterans. Similarly, the documentation shows that another provider\u2019s  opportunity to improve had to be halted and the provider was removed  from providing care after only a week due to concerns that continuing the  review would potentially harm patients.", "In addition to these nine providers, one VA medical center terminated the  services of four contract providers based on deficiencies in the providers\u2019  clinical performance, but the facility did not follow any of the required  steps for reporting providers to the NPDB or relevant state licensing  boards. This is concerning, given that the VA medical center documented  that one of these providers was terminated for cause related to patient  abuse after only 2 weeks of work at the facility.", "At the time of our review, two of the five VA medical centers we reviewed  each reported one provider to the state licensing boards for failing to meet  generally accepted standards of clinical practice to the point that it raised  concerns for the safety of veterans. However, we found that the medical  centers\u2019 reporting to the state licensing boards took over 500 days to  complete in both cases, which was significantly longer than the 100 days  suggested in VHA policy.", "Across the five VA medical centers, we found that providers were not  reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required for two  reasons.", "First, VA medical center officials were generally not familiar with or  misinterpreted VHA policies related to NPDB and state licensing  board reporting. For example, at one VA medical center, we found  that officials failed to report six providers to the NPDB because they  were unaware that they were responsible for NPDB reporting. Officials  at two other VA medical centers incorrectly told us that VHA cannot  report contract providers to the NPDB.", "Second, VHA policy does not require the VISNs to oversee whether  VA medical centers are reporting providers to the NPDB or state  licensing boards when warranted. We found, for example, that VISN  officials were unaware of situations in which VA medical center  officials failed to report providers to the NPDB.", "As a result of VHA staff misinterpretation of VHA policy and insufficient  oversight, we concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all  providers who should be reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards  are reported. Consequently, the NPDB and state licensing boards in other  states where the providers we identified held licenses were not alerted to  concerns about the providers\u2019 clinical practice. We reported that this could  allow a provider who delivered substandard care at one VA medical  center to obtain privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals  outside of VA\u2019s health care system. In our November 2017 report, we  noted several cases of this occurring among the providers who were not  reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards by the five VA medical  centers we reviewed. For example,", "We found that two of the four contract providers whose contracts were  terminated for clinical deficiencies remained eligible to provide care to  veterans outside of that VA medical center. At the time of our review,  one of these providers held privileges at another VA medical center,  and another participated in the network of providers that can provide  care for veterans in the community.", "We also found that a provider who was not reported as required to the  NPDB during the period we reviewed had their privileges revoked 2  years later by a non-VA hospital in the same city for the same reason  the provider was under investigation at the VA medical center.", "Officials at this VA medical center did not report this provider following  a settlement agreement under which the provider agreed to resign. A  committee within the VA medical center had recommended that the  provider\u2019s privileges be revoked prior to the agreement. There was no  documentation of the reasons why this provider was not reported to  the NPDB.", "To improve VA medical centers\u2019 reporting of providers to the NPDB and  state licensing boards and VHA oversight of these processes, we made  one recommendation in our November 2017 report.
