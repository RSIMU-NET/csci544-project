All four states require a patient to have a physician's recommendation to be eligible for medical marijuana use. Alaska, Hawaii, and Oregon have established state-run registries for patients and caregivers to document their eligibility to engage in medical marijuana use; these states require physician documentation of a person's debilitating condition to register.

Relatively few people had registered to use marijuana for medical purposes in Oregon, Hawaii, and Alaska. As of Spring 2002, 2,450 people, or about 0.05 percent of the total population of the three states combined, had registered as medical marijuana users. Statewide figures for California are unknown.

Marijuana can be consumed in food or drinks, but most commonly dried portions of the leaves and flowers are smoked. Marijuana is widely used and the only major drug of abuse grown within the United States borders, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.", "Marijuana is a controlled substance under federal law and is classified in the most restrictive of categories of drugs by the federal government. The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) places all federally controlled substances into one of five \u201cschedules,\u201d depending on the drug\u2019s likelihood for abuse or dependence, and whether the drug has an accepted medical use. Marijuana is classified under Schedule I, the classification reserved for drugs that have been found by the federal government to have a high abuse potential, a lack of accepted safety under medical supervision, and no currently accepted medical use. In contrast, the other schedules are for drugs of varying addictive properties, but found by the federal government to have a currently accepted medical use. The CSA does not allow Schedule I drugs to be dispensed upon a prescription, unlike drugs in the other schedules. In particular, the CSA provides federal sanctions for possession, manufacture, distribution or dispensing of Schedule I substances, including marijuana, except in the context of a government-approved research project.", "The potential medical value of marijuana has been a continuing debate. For example, beginning in 1978, the federal government allowed the first patient to use marijuana as medicine under the \u201cSingle Patient Investigational New Drug\u201d procedure, which allows treatment for individual patients using drugs that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An additional 12 patients were approved under the procedure between 1978 and 1992. When the volume of applicants tripled, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decided not to supply marijuana to any more patients. According to Kuromiya v. United States, HHS concluded that the use of the single patient Investigational New Drug procedure would not yield useful data to resolve the remaining safety and effectiveness issues.", "In 1999, an Institute of Medicine study commissioned by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy recognized both a potential therapeutic value and potential harmful effects, particularly the harmful effects from smoked marijuana. The study called for more research on the physiological and psychological effects of marijuana and on better delivery systems. A 2001 report by the American Medical Association\u2019s Council on Scientific Affairs also summarized the medical and scientific research in this area, similarly calling for more research.", "In May 1999, HHS released procedures allowing researchers not funded by the National Institute of Health to obtain research-grade marijuana for approved clinical studies.

It may be difficult to identify the relevant measures because crime is a sociological phenomena influenced by a variety of factors.Local law enforcement officials we spoke with about trends in marijuana law enforcement noted several factors, other than medical marijuana laws, important in assessing trends. These factors included changes in general perceptions about marijuana, shifts in funding for various law enforcement activities, shifts in local law enforcement priorities from one drug to another, or changes in emphasis from drugs to other areas, such as terrorism. Demographics might also be a factor.", "The limited availability of data on marijuana-related law enforcement activity illustrates some of the difficulties in doing a statistically valid trend analysis. To fully assess the relationship between the passage of state\u2019s medical marijuana laws and law enforcement, one would need data on marijuana related arrests or prosecutions over some period of time, and preferably an extended period of time. Although state-by-state data on marijuana-related arrests is available from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), at the time of our review, only data up to the year 2000 was available. Yearly data would be insufficient for analytic purposes since the passage of the medical marijuana initiatives or law in three of the states\u2014 Oregon (November 1998), Alaska (November 1998), and Hawaii (June 2000)\u2014is too recent to permit a rigorous appraisal of trends in arrests and changes in them. Furthermore, although California\u2019s law took effect during 1996 providing a longer period of data, it is also important to note that the FBI cautions about UCR data comparisons between time periods because of variations in year-to-year reporting by agencies.", "Similar data limitations would occur using marijuana prosecutions as a measure of trends in law enforcement activity. Data on marijuana prosecutions are not collected or aggregated at the federal level by state. At the state level, for the four states we reviewed, the format for collecting the data, or time period covered also had limitations. For example in California, the state maintains \u201cdisposition\u201d data that includes prosecutions, but reflects only the most serious offenses, so that marijuana possession that was classified as a misdemeanor would not be captured if the defendant was also charged with possession of other drugs, or was involved with theft or other non-misdemeanor crimes. Further, the data is grouped by the year of final disposition, not when the offense occurred. Hawaii does not have statewide prosecution data.

Officials representing 21 of the organizations we contacted indicated that medical marijuana laws had had little impact on their law enforcement activities for a variety of reasons, including very few or no encounters involving medical marijuana registry cards or claims of a medical marijuana defense. For example:   The police department on one Hawaiian island had never been presented a medical marijuana registry card, and only 15 registrants lived on the island. In Alaska, a top official for the State Troopers Drug Unit had never encountered a medical marijuana registry card in support of claimed medical use. In Oregon, one district attorney reported having less than 10 cases since the law was passed where the defendant presented a medical marijuana defense.In Los Angeles County, an official in the District Attorney\u2019s office stated that only three medical marijuana cases have been filed in the last two years in the Central Branch office, two of the cases involving the same person.", "Some of the federal law enforcement officials we interviewed indicated that the introduction of medical marijuana laws has had little impact on their operations. Senior Department of Justice officials said that the Department\u2019s overall policy is to enforce all laws regarding controlled substances, however they do have limited resources. Further, the federal process of using a case-by-case review of potential marijuana prosecutions has not changed as a consequence of the states\u2019 medical marijuana laws. These officials said that U.S. Attorneys have their own criteria or guidelines for which cases to prosecute that are based on the Department\u2019s overall strategies and objectives.", "Law enforcement officials in the selected states also told us that, given the range of drug issues, other illicit drug concerns, such as rampant methamphetamine abuse or large-scale marijuana production are higher priorities than concerns about abuse of medical marijuana. In at least one instance, this emphasis was said to reflect community concerns\u2014in Hawaii, one prosecuting attorney estimated that one-third to one-half of the murders and most hostage situations in the county involved methamphetamines. He said businesses ask why law enforcement is bothering with marijuana when they have methamphetamines to deal with.", "Although many of the officials with other organizations we contacted did not clearly indicate whether medical marijuana laws had, or had not, had major impact on their activities, officials with two organizations said that medical marijuana laws had become a problem from their perspective. Specifically, an official with the Oregon State Police Drug Enforcement Section said that during 2000 and 2001, there were 14 cases in which the suspects had substantial quantities of processed or growing marijuana and were arrested for distribution of marijuana for profit, yet were able to obtain medical marijuana registry cards after their arrests. Because the same two defense attorneys represented all the suspects, the police official expressed his view that the suspects might have been referred to the same doctor, causing the official to speculate about the validity of the recommendations. In Northern California\u2014an area where substantial amounts of marijuana are grown\u2014officials with the Humboldt County Drug Task Force told us that they have encountered growers claiming to be caregivers for multiple medical marijuana patients. With a limit of 10 plants per person established by the Humboldt County District Attorney, growers can have hundreds of plants officials said, and no documentation to support their medical use claims is required.", "Over one-third of officials from the 37 law enforcement organizations told us that they believe that the introduction of medical marijuana laws have, or could make it, more difficult to pursue or prosecute some marijuana cases. In California, some local law enforcement officials said that their state\u2019s medical marijuana law makes them question whether it is worth pursuing some criminal marijuana cases because of concerns about whether they can effectively prosecute (e.g., with no statutory limit on the number of marijuana plants allowed for medical use, the amount consistent with a patient\u2019s personal medical purposes is open to interpretation). In Oregon, Hawaii, and Alaska where specific plant limits have been established, some law enforcement officials and district attorneys said that they were less likely to pursue marijuana cases that could be argued as falling under medical use provisions. For example, one Oregon District Attorney stated that because they have limited resources the District Attorneys might not prosecute a case where someone is sick, has an amount of marijuana within the medical use limit, and would probably be approved for a card if they did apply. Officers in Hawaii reported reluctance of a judge to issue a search warrant until detectives were certain that cultivated marijuana was not being grown for medical use, or that the growth was over the 25-plant limit qualifying for felony charges.", "Less concrete, but of concern to law enforcement officials were the more subtle consequences attributed to the passage of state medical marijuana laws. Officials in over one-fourth of the 37 law enforcement organizations we interviewed indicated they believe there has been a general softening in public attitude toward marijuana, or public perception that marijuana is no longer illegal. For example, state troopers in Alaska said that they believe that the law has desensitized the public to the issue of marijuana, reflected in fewer calls to report illegal marijuana activities than they once received. Hawaiian officers stated that it is their view that Hawaii\u2019s law may send the wrong message because people may believe that the drug is safe or legal.", "Several law enforcement officials in California and Oregon cited the inconsistency between federal and state law as a significant problem, particularly regarding how seized marijuana is handled. According to a California Attorney General official, state and local law enforcement officials are frequently faced with this issue if the court or prosecutor concludes that marijuana seized during an arrest was legally possessed under California law, and law enforcement is ordered to return the marijuana. To return it puts officials in violation of federal law for dispensing a Schedule I narcotic, according to the California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, and in direct violation of the court order if they don\u2019t return it. The same issue has arisen in Portland, Oregon, officials said, when the Portland police seized 2.5 grams of marijuana from an individual. After the state dismissed charges, the court ordered the return of the marijuana to the individual, who was a registered medical marijuana user. The city of Portland appealed the court order on grounds that its police officers could not return the seized marijuana without violating federal law, but the Oregon court of appeals rejected this argument in Oregon v. Kama.Oregon officials said that DEA then obtained a federal court order to seize the marijuana from the Portland police department. The Department of Justice stated in comments on a draft of this report that they believe conflicts between federal and non-federal law enforcement over the handling of seized marijuana has been and will continue to be a problem.", "Law enforcement officials in all four states identified areas of their medical marijuana laws that can hamper their marijuana enforcement activities because the law could be clearer or provide better control. In California, key issues were lack of a definable amount of marijuana for medical use, and no systematic way to identify who qualifies for the exemption. In Oregon, officers were concerned about individuals registering as medical marijuana users after they have been arrested, and timely law enforcement access to the registry information.

However, DOJ stated that the report failed to adequately address some of the serious difficulties associated with such programs. Specifically, according to DOJ, the report does not adequately address, through any considered analysis, issues related to the (1) inherent conflict between state laws permitting the use of marijuana and federal laws that do not; (2) potential for facilitating illegal trafficking; (3) impact of such laws on cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement; and (4) lack of data on the medicinal value of marijuana.

As discussed in our report, the legal framework for our work was the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative, 532 U.S. 483 (2001) which held that the federal government can enforce marijuana prohibitions without regard to a medical necessity defense, even in states with medical marijuana laws. During our review, we saw no reason to expand our analysis beyond that set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. This is especially true since the scope of our work was to examine how the selected states were implementing their medical marijuana laws\u2014not the issues raised in DOJ comments.", "Regarding the second issue concerning the potential for illegal trafficking, DOJ commented that our report did not mention that state medical marijuana laws are routinely being abused to facilitate traditional illegal trafficking.

Our report discusses the views of law enforcement officials representing 37 organizations in the four states\u2014including federal officials\u2014regarding the impact of state medical marijuana laws on their law enforcement efforts. Our report presented the views they conveyed to us.
