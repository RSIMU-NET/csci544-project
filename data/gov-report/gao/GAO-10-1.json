As directed by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, GAO analyzed DOD, State, and USAID data for Iraq and Afghanistan for FY 2008 and the first half of FY 2009 on the (1) status of agency efforts to track information on contracts and contractor personnel; (2) number of contractor personnel; (3) number of killed and wounded contractors; and (4) number and value of contracts and extent to which they were awarded competitively. GAO reviewed selected contracts and compared personnel data to other available sources to assess the reliability of agency-reported data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In response to a statutory requirement to increase contractor oversight, DOD, State, and USAID agreed to use the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) system to track information on contracts and contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. With the exception of USAID in Afghanistan, the agencies are in the process of implementing the system and require contractor personnel in both countries to be entered into SPOT. However, the agencies use differing criteria to decide which personnel are entered, resulting in some personnel not being entered into the system as required. Some agency officials also questioned the need to track detailed information on all contractor personnel, particularly local nationals. Further, SPOT currently lacks the capability to track all required data elements, such as contract dollar value and the number of personnel killed and wounded. As a result, the agencies rely on other sources for contract and contractor personnel information, such as periodic surveys of contractors. DOD, State, and USAID reported nearly 226,500 contractor personnel, including about 28,000 performing security functions, in Iraq and Afghanistan, as of the second quarter of FY 2009. However due to their limitations, the reported data should not be used to identify trends or draw conclusions about contractor personnel numbers. Specifically, we found that the data reported by the three agencies were incomplete. For example, in one quarterly contractor survey DOD did not include 26,000 personnel in Afghanistan, and USAID did not provide personnel data for a $91 million contract. The agencies depend on contractors to report personnel numbers and acknowledge that they cannot validate the reported information. USAID and State reported that 64 of their contractors had been killed and 159 wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan during our review period. DOD officials told us they continue to lack a system to reliably track killed or wounded contractor personnel and referred us to the Department of Labor's Defense Base Act (DBA) case data for this information. However, because DBA is a worker's compensation program, Labor's data include cases such as those resulting from occupational injuries and do not provide an appropriate basis for determining how many contractor personnel were killed or wounded while working on DOD, State, or USAID contracts in Iraq or Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the data provide insights into contractor casualties. According to Labor, 11,804 DBA cases were filed for contractors killed or injured in Iraq and Afghanistan during our review period, including 218 deaths. Based on our review of 150 randomly selected cases, we estimate that 11 percent of all FY 2008 DBA cases for the two countries resulted from hostile actions. DOD, State, and USAID reported obligating $38.6 billion on nearly 85,000 contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan during our review period. DOD accounted for more than 90 percent of the contracts and obligations. The agencies reported that 97 percent of the contracts awarded during our review period, accounting for nearly 71 percent of obligations, were competed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Departments of Defense (DOD) and State and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) have relied extensively on contractors  to support troops and civilian personnel and to oversee and carry out  reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We and others have reported that the  agencies have faced challenges in obtaining information on contracts and  contractor personnel to plan and manage efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Absent complete and accurate information on contractors supporting  contingency operations, the agencies are limited in their ability to develop  a complete picture of their reliance on contractors, the tasks being  performed, and their associated costs. The importance of such information  is heightened by the evolving U.S. efforts in the two countries as the  agencies reduce their presence in Iraq while expanding their presence in  Afghanistan. Reliable and meaningful data on contractors and the services  they provide are a starting point for agency decisions on when and how to  effectively use contractors; support contractors in terms of housing,  transportation, security, and other services; and ensure that contractors  are properly managed and overseen.", "Congress has taken a number of actions to increase oversight of contracts  with performance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among these, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA for FY2008)  directed DOD, State, and USAID to sign a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) regarding matters relating to contracting in the two countries,  including maintaining common databases of information on contracts and  contractor personnel. In their July 2008 MOU, the agencies designated the  Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) database as  their system of record for information on contracts and contractor  personnel working in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Congress directed us to annually review DOD, State, and USAID contracts  in Iraq and Afghanistan and report on these reviews through 2010. This is  our second report issued pursuant to that mandate. We are providing the  results of our analyses of agency-reported data for fiscal year 2008 and the  first half of fiscal year 2009 regarding (1) the agencies\u2019 implementation of  SPOT, (2) the number of contractor personnel, including those performing  security functions, working on DOD, State, and USAID contracts with  performance in Iraq and Afghanistan, (3) the number of contractor  personnel killed or wounded, and (4) the number and value of contracts  that were active and awarded during our 18-month review period and the  extent of competition for new contract awards.", "We used the following methodologies to develop our findings:    To assess SPOT\u2019s implementation, we reviewed DOD, State, and USAID\u2019s  MOU and interviewed officials responsible for implementing SPOT to  determine the agencies\u2019 criteria and practices for entering information into  SPOT and the system\u2019s current and planned capabilities. We reviewed  agency guidance and policy documents regarding the use of SPOT and  took training courses designed for personnel who expect to use the  system. We then compared the uses and capabilities of SPOT to the MOU  requirements to determine the extent to which SPOT fulfills the terms of  the MOU.", "For the number of contractor personnel, we obtained DOD, State, and  USAID data on the number of U.S., third country, and local nationals  working on contracts in Iraq or Afghanistan, including those performing  security functions, during our review period. The agencies provided data  from surveys of their contractors as well as the SPOT database. We  assessed the reported data by comparing them to other available sources.  Based on comparisons of each source, we concluded that the agency- reported data should not be used to draw conclusions about the actual  number of contractor personnel in Iraq or Afghanistan or trends over time.  However, we are presenting the reported data along with their limitations  as they establish a minimum number of contractor personnel during our  period of review.", "For contractor personnel killed or wounded during our review period, we  analyzed State and USAID data; DOD did not collect and could not provide  these data. We could not independently verify the completeness of the  data reported by USAID and State. However, we report State\u2019s and  USAID\u2019s data as they provide insight into the number of contractor  personnel who were killed or wounded during our review period. In  addition, we analyzed Department of Labor data on Defense Base Act  (DBA) cases for incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan during fiscal year 2008  and the first half of fiscal year 2009. We determined the DBA data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report based on our prior  reliability assessments. We also reviewed a random sample of 150 DBA  case files, from a population of 2,500 cases, for incidents that occurred  during fiscal year 2008 to determine, for example, whether the case was  the result of a hostile incident and the severity of the contractor\u2019s injury.    For the contracts, we obtained data from DOD, State, and USAID on the  number of active and awarded contracts with performance in Iraq and  Afghanistan during our review period, the amount of funds obligated on  those contracts, and the extent of competition for new contract awards.  Data were provided from the Federal Procurement Data System \u2013 Next  Generation (FPDS-NG), agency-specific databases, and manually compiled  lists of contract actions. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to determine the minimum number of active and awarded  contracts and obligation amounts, as well as the number of competed  contracts, based on our prior reliability assessments, interviews with  agency officials, and verification of some reported data.", "A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is included in  appendix I.

The NDAA for  FY2008 requires the databases to track at a minimum:  for each contract,     a brief description of the contract,   its total value, and     whether it was awarded competitively; and  for contractor personnel working under contracts in Iraq or Afghanistan,  total number employed,  total number performing security functions, and  total number who have been killed or wounded.", "DOD, State, and USAID signed the MOU in July 2008. The agencies agreed  that SPOT, a Web-based system initially designed and used by DOD, would  be the system of record for the statutorily-required contract and  contractor personnel information.

Information entered into SPOT is more detailed than the number of  contractor personnel as it is designed to track individuals by name and  record information such as the contracts they are working under,  deployment dates, and next of kin.

In  January 2007, DOD designated SPOT as its primary system for collecting  data on contractor personnel deployed with U.S. forces and directed  contractor firms to enter personnel data for contracts performed in Iraq  and Afghanistan. State started systematically entering information for both  Iraq and Afghanistan into SPOT in November 2008. In January 2009,  USAID began requiring contractors in Iraq to enter personnel data into  SPOT. However, USAID has not yet imposed a similar requirement on its  contractors in Afghanistan and has no time frame for doing so.", "In implementing SPOT, DOD\u2019s, State\u2019s, and USAID\u2019s criteria for  determining which contractor personnel are entered into SPOT varied and  were not consistent with those contained in the MOU, as the following  illustrate.", "Regarding contractor personnel in Iraq, DOD, State, and USAID officials  stated that the primary factor for deciding to enter contractor personnel  into SPOT was whether a contractor needed a SPOT-generated letter of  authorization (LOA). Contractor personnel need SPOT-generated LOAs to,  among other things, enter Iraq, receive military identification cards, travel  on U.S. military aircraft, or, for security contractors, receive approval to  carry weapons. However, not all contractor personnel, particularly local  nationals, in Iraq need LOAs and agency officials informed us that such  personnel were not being entered into SPOT. In contrast, DOD officials  informed us that individuals needing LOAs were entered into SPOT even if  their contracts did not meet the MOU\u2019s 14-day or $100,000 thresholds.", "For Afghanistan, DOD offices varied in their treatment of which contractor  personnel should be entered into SPOT. Officials with one contracting  office stated that the need for an LOA determined whether someone was  entered into SPOT. As in Iraq, since local nationals generally do not need  LOAs, they are not being entered into SPOT. In contrast, DOD officials  with another contracting office stated that they follow DOD\u2019s 2007  guidance on the use of SPOT. According to the guidance, contractor  personnel working on contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan with more than  30 days of performance and valued over $25,000 are to be entered into  SPOT\u2014as opposed to the MOU threshold of 14 days of performance or  valued over $100,000.", "Agency officials have raised questions about the need to enter detailed  information into SPOT on all contractor personnel. Some DOD officials we  spoke with questioned the need to individually track all contractor  personnel as opposed to their total numbers given the cost of collecting  these detailed data compared to the benefit of having this information.  Similarly, USAID officials questioned the need to enter detailed  information as agreed to because personnel working on its contracts in  Afghanistan generally do not live or work in close proximity to  U.S. government personnel and typically do not receive support services  from the U.S. government. USAID officials also cited security concerns as  one factor affecting their decision on who should be entered into SPOT.  USAID officials explained that they have held off entering Iraqi or Afghan  nationals into SPOT because identifying local nationals who work with the  U.S. government by name could put those individuals in danger should the  system be compromised. To help address this concern, DOD officials said  that they have begun developing a classified version of SPOT. However,  USAID officials told us the agency would most likely not be able to use a  classified system due to limited access to classified computers.", "Because of the varying criteria on who should be entered into the system,  the information in SPOT does not present an accurate picture of the total  number of contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. For example,  officials from all three agencies expressed confidence that the SPOT data  were relatively complete for contractor personnel who need an LOA in  Iraq. Conversely, agency officials acknowledged that SPOT does not fully  reflect the number of local nationals working on their contracts. Agency  officials further explained that ensuring that information on local nationals  is in SPOT is challenging because their numbers tend to fluctuate due to  the use of day laborers and because local firms do not always keep track  of the individuals working on their projects. DOD officials also explained  that they have had to develop workarounds to deal with the fact that SPOT  requires a first and last name to be entered for each individual along with a  birth date and unique identification number. The officials noted that many  Afghan laborers have only one name, do not know their birth dates, and  lack identification numbers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SPOT Not Capable of Tracking All Required Information", "paragraphs": ["SPOT currently lacks the capability to track all of the contract data  elements as agreed to in the MOU. While the MOU specifies that contract  values, competition information, and descriptions of the services being  provided would be pulled into SPOT from FPDS-NG, this capability is not  expected to be available until 2010. In the interim, the DOD officials  overseeing SPOT\u2019s development told us that SPOT users can manually  enter competition information and descriptions, but there is no  requirement for them to do so. Since SPOT is not designed to let users  enter contract dollar values, the DOD officials stated that SPOT and FPDS- NG are being periodically merged to identify contract values.", "Even when the direct link is established, pulling FPDS-NG data into SPOT  may present challenges because of how data are entered into SPOT. First,  information from the two systems can only be merged if the contract has  been entered into SPOT. If no contractor personnel working on a  particular contract have been entered, then the contract will not appear in  SPOT and its information cannot be linked with the information in FPDS- NG. Second, while contract numbers are the unique identifiers that will be  used to match records in SPOT to those in FPDS-NG, SPOT users are not  required to enter contract numbers in a standardized manner. In our  review of SPOT data, we determined that at least 12 percent of the  contracts had invalid contract numbers and, therefore, could not be  matched to records in FPDS-NG. Additionally, contract numbers may not  be sufficient to identify unique contracts. Specific orders placed on task  order contracts are identified through a combination of the contract  number and task order number. However, SPOT users are not required to  enter task order numbers. For example, one SPOT entry only contained  the contract number without an order number. In reviewing FPDS-NG  data, we determined that DOD had placed 12 different orders\u2014ranging  from a few thousand dollars to over $129 million\u2014against that contract.  Based on the information in SPOT, DOD would not be able to determine  which order\u2019s value and competition information should be imported from  FPDS-NG.", "SPOT, as currently designed, also lacks the capability to readily generate  reports on the number of killed or wounded contractor personnel. SPOT  was upgraded in January 2009 to fulfill the NDAA for FY2008 requirement  to track such information. Contractors can now update the status of their  personnel in the system, including whether they have been killed or  wounded, while agencies can run queries to identify the number of  personnel with a current status of killed or wounded. However, the  standard queries can only generate a list of personnel currently identified  as killed or wounded and cannot be used to identify individuals who  previously had the status of killed or wounded and whose records have  become inactive or whose injured status changed when they returned to  work. For example, if an individual has an injured status today and a query  were run, that individual would be included in the report. If that individual  then returned to work, the status would change and that individual would  not appear on any subsequent injury reports, with the agencies having no  means of determining whether the individual was ever injured."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD, State, and USAID Lack Reliable Data on Contractor Personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["DOD, State, and USAID reported to us that there were 226,475 contractor  personnel, including 27,603 performing security functions, in Iraq and  Afghanistan as of the second quarter in fiscal year 2009.

CENTCOM  initiated its quarterly census of contractor personnel in June 2007 as an  interim measure until SPOT is fully implemented. The census relies on  contractor firms to report their personnel data to DOD components, which  then aggregate the data and report them to CENTCOM at the end of each  quarter. As shown in table 1, DOD\u2019s reported number of contractor  personnel for our review period ranged from 200,111 to 231,698, with  approximately 7 percent performing security functions over the entire  period, on average.", "DOD officials acknowledge that the census numbers represent only a  rough approximation of the actual number of contractor personnel that  worked in either country. Specifically, these officials told us that because  of how the data were collected and reported by the various DOD  components, it was difficult to compile and obtain an accurate count of  contractor personnel. We determined that over the course of our review  period the following data issues existed.", "Contractor personnel information was sometimes incomplete. Most  notably, an Army-wide review of fiscal year 2008 third quarter census data  determined that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not include  approximately 26,000 Afghan nationals working on contracts. However,  information on these contractors was included in subsequent censuses. As  a result, comparing third quarter and fourth quarter data would incorrectly  suggest that there was an increase in the number of contractors in  Afghanistan, when in fact the increase is attributable to more accurate  counting of personnel.", "Contractor personnel were being double counted. For example, the system  used to record contractor personnel numbers for the Joint Contracting  Command-Iraq/Afghanistan was found to have duplicates. As a result,  DOD reported a 10 percent decrease in personnel in Iraq in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2009 and a 5 percent decrease in contractor  personnel in Afghanistan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 when  duplicates were removed.", "The process used to collect data changed. For example, a 3 percent  decrease in personnel numbers reported in the first quarter of fiscal year  2009 compared to the previous quarter was attributed to the Joint  Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan\u2019s decision to begin using a  monthly data call to contractors to collect personnel numbers.", "Data submitted by the DOD components were often of poor quality or  inaccurate, which created challenges for CENTCOM to compile quarterly  totals. During our review of quarterly census data submissions, we  identified a DOD component in Afghanistan that provided invalid contract  numbers for about 30 percent of its contracts in the second quarter for  fiscal year 2009. Also, it was not possible to determine for some  submissions how many contractors were working in a specific country.

In addition, during our file reviews, we noted that many  cases, particularly those submitted for injuries, were for medical  conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, and appendicitis, determined not to  be related to the individual\u2019s employment in Iraq or Afghanistan, and  compensation claims for many of these cases were denied because the  conditions were not work-related. While employers must notify Labor of  all work-related contractor deaths and injuries resulting in time lost from  work, one Labor official told us that some employers report all medical- related conditions, regardless of their severity and the nature of the  incidents that caused them. In addition, some contractor deaths and  injuries may not be reported to Labor as required. In particular, Labor  officials have indicated that deaths and injuries to local and third-country  contractors may be underreported.", "Additionally, because Labor does not track cases by agency or contract,  DBA data cannot be analyzed to determine how many cases involved  contractor personnel working specifically on DOD, State, or USAID  contracts. As a result, the data may include cases for contractor personnel  working for agencies other than DOD, State, and USAID. During our  review of 150 DBA case files, we noted that the files did not always  contain contract information and did not consistently identify the  contracting agency. While we identified 103 case files for personnel  working on DOD or State contracts, we did not identify any files for  USAID contractor personnel. In addition, 1 case file specified an agency  other than DOD, State, or USAID, while 46 files did not specify which  agency the contractor worked for.", "Despite their limitations for determining the number of contractor  personnel killed or wounded, Labor\u2019s DBA case data provide insight into  contractor personnel deaths and injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan.  According to Labor, there were 11,804 DBA cases, including 218 cases  reporting contractor deaths, which resulted from incidents that occurred  in Iraq and Afghanistan during fiscal year 2008 and the first half of fiscal  year 2009. As shown in table 6, overall both the total number of DBA cases  and the number of death cases decreased from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal  year 2008, though the number of death cases in Afghanistan increased.", "Based on our review of 150 randomly selected DBA case files, we  estimated that about 11 percent of the deaths and injuries reported to  Labor for incidents that occurred in fiscal year 2008 resulted from hostile  actions. Only 16 of the 150 files we reviewed were for cases related to  hostile actions. Further, about one-third of the 11,586 DBA injury cases  that occurred during our review period resulted in the affected contractor  losing time from work. For example, we reviewed a case in which a  contractor lost time from work after receiving multiple injuries when an  ammunition pallet fell and wedged him against the side of a container,  while another contractor suffered fractures and spinal injuries caused by  an improvised explosive device and small arms fire."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD, State, and USAID Obligated Tens of Billions of Dollars on Contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["DOD, State, and USAID reported obligating nearly $39 billion on 84,719  contracts with performance in Iraq and Afghanistan during fiscal year 2008  and the first half of fiscal year 2009 (see fig. 1 for obligation data).

Task orders were the most common  contract vehicle that the agencies used during our review period and  accounted for most of the obligations. A relatively small number of task  orders accounted for a large portion of each agency\u2019s obligations.

The agencies reported that approximately 3 percent of contracts  awarded during our period of review, accounting for 29 percent of the  obligations, were not competed (see fig. 3).", "Most of the 1,143 contracts reported to us as not competed had relatively  small obligations during our review period. Approximately 90 percent of  them had obligations of less than $100,000 and 80 percent had obligations  less than $25,000. In contrast, only 27 of the 1,143 contracts reported as  not competed had over $1 million in obligations. These 27 contracts  accounted for 99 percent of obligations for contracts that were not  competed.", "The law authorizes agencies to use limited competition in certain  situations. There may be circumstances under which full and open  competition would be impracticable, such as when contracts need to be  awarded quickly to respond to urgent and compelling needs or when there  is only one source for the required product or service. In such cases,  agencies may award contracts without providing for full and open  competition (e.g., using limited competition or on a sole-source basis) if  the proposed approach is appropriately justified, approved, and  documented. Similarly, simplified acquisition procedures allow for limited  competition when awarding certain contracts, and the use of these  procedures is determined based on dollar thresholds contained in the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). These dollar thresholds vary  depending on where and for what purpose the contract was awarded and  performed, its dollar value, and the contracting method used. Additionally,  contracts valued below the micropurchase threshold, which is $25,000 for  contracts awarded and performed outside the United States in support of  contingency operations, may be awarded without soliciting competitive  quotations if the authorized purchase official considers the price to be  reasonable.", "To determine the circumstances in which the agencies awarded contracts  using other than full and open competition, we reviewed 79 DOD and State  contracts awarded in fiscal year 2008 that had more than $100,000 in  obligations during our review period and were reported as not competed  or for which no competition information was provided. During our  review, we discovered that 8 of these had actually been awarded after a  full and open competition and 14 had been awarded after a limited  competition (i.e., they were not sole-source awards). Of the 71 files we  reviewed that were not awarded under full and open competition, the  most common justification for limiting competition or awarding a sole- source contract was that only one source could provide the good or  service being acquired. In some of these cases, the incumbent contractor  was awarded the new contract. For example, State awarded a sole-source  contract for communication equipment in Iraq because only one company  offered radios that were compatible with State\u2019s existing communication  network. The second most common reason for limiting competition was  DOD\u2019s enhanced authority to acquire products and services from Iraq and  Afghanistan. Congress granted DOD this authority, which allows DOD to  limit competition or provide preferences for products and services from  Iraq or Afghanistan, to provide a stable source of jobs and employment in  the two countries. According to DOD contracting officials in Iraq and  Afghanistan, they are increasing their use of this authority. However,  officials in Afghanistan explained that in doing so they generally have  some level of competition among local firms as opposed to doing a sole- source award. They explained that limited competitions are being  conducted to not only ensure better prices and products but also to help  instill Western business practices and develop local business capacity.", "Competition requirements generally do not apply to the process of issuing  task and delivery orders. However, where there were multiple awardees  under the underlying contract, the FAR requires the contracting officer in  most instances to provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be  considered for each order exceeding $3,000.

As  discussed in the report, however, this upgrade does not provide  agencies with the capability to readily generate reports on the total  number of contractor personnel killed or wounded within a given  timeframe; instead, the current capability is limited to generating a  report of personnel identified as killed or wounded on the day the  report is generated. DOD does not specify in its comments as to  whether or how the planned November 2009 upgrade would address  this reporting limitation. Also, it is not clear from DOD\u2019s comments as  to whether this planned upgrade will apply to both the unclassified and  classified versions of SPOT. State\u2019s comments suggest that based on  information it received from DOD, the improved reporting features will  be limited to the classified version."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["Department of State Comments on GAO Draft Report  CONTINGENCY CONTRACTING:  DOD, State, and USAID Continue to  Face Challenges in Tracking Contractor Personnel and Contracts in Iraq and   (GAO-10-01, GAO Code 120790)", "The Department of State appreciates the opportunity to review the  Government Accountability Office (GAO) draft report titled, \u201cContingency  Contracting:  DOD, State and USAID Continue to Face Challenges in Tracking  Contractor Personnel and Contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d", "Recommendation:  To ensure that the agencies and Congress have reliable  information on contracts and contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, we  recommend that the Secretaries of Defense and State and the Administrator of  USAID jointly develop and execute a plan with associated timeframes for their  continued implementation of the NDAA for FY2008 requirements, specifically   Ensuring that the agencies\u2019 criteria for entering contracts and contractor  personnel into the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT)  are consistent with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2008  and with the agencies\u2019 respective information needs for overseeing contracts and  contractor personnel;    Establishing uniform requirements on how contract numbers are to be  entered into SPOT so that contract information can accurately be pulled from  FPDS-NG as agreed to in the MOU; and    Revising SPOT\u2019s reporting capabilities to ensure that they fulfill statutory  requirements and agency information needs, such as those related to contractor  personnel killed or wounded.   In developing and executing this plan, the agencies may need to revisit their MOU  to ensure consistency between the plan and what has previously been agreed to in  the MOU.", "Response:  The Bureau of Administration (A) has the lead on agency  implementation of SPOT and the NDAA.  We acknowledge the importance of  reliable information on contracts and contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan  reported jointly with the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and the Administrator of  USAID to implement NDAA FY2008 requirements.  We agree that the agencies  need to continue to meet to review progress and intent of the MOU to comply with  NDAA FY2008, but do not agree with the recommendation that a new plan needs  to be developed.  We do agree that the current MOU needs to be revisited as well  as some issues to ensure consistency meeting the criteria it already contains as  specified in NDAA 2008, section 861. \u201cregarding contractor personnel in Iraq, DOD, State, and USAID officials stated that the  primary factor for deciding to enter contractor personnel into SPOT was whether a  contractor needed a SPOT-generated letter of authorization (LOA). Contractor personnel  need SPOT-generated LOAs to, among other things, enter Iraq, receive military  identification cards, travel on U.S. military aircraft, or, for security contractors, receive  approval to carry weapons. However, not all contractor personnel, particularly local  nationals, in Iraq need LOAs and agency officials informed us that such personnel were  not being entered into SPOT.  In contrast, DOD officials informed us that individuals  needing LOAs were entered into SPOT even if their contracts did not meet the MOU\u2019s 14  day or $100,000 thresholds.\u201d", "State personnel advised the GAO during an interview that company  administrators were told verbally and in writing to enter all United States citizens,  Third Country Nationals, and Locals Nationals into SPOT.  Due to security  concerns about entering data on Local Nationals, company administrators were  given a blind identity scheme to aid with accountability of entering the  information.  We continue to urge that actual information be entered on all Local  Nationals because SPOT would be used for NDAA 1248, repatriation requests.", "Also, the MOU signed by the three agencies stipulate that contracts under  the simplified acquisitions threshold of $100,000 and 14 working days would not  be entered into SPOT (Section VII B).  The GAO was advised by State personnel  during the interview that it lacked resources to enter every acquisition into SPOT  and support the higher threshold.  However, there may be confusion because an  earlier Section II A of the MOU only states \u201clonger than 14 days\u201d.  We agree that  the three agencies need to discuss this issue to determine one standard. \u201cwhile contract numbers are the unique identifiers that will be used to match records in  SPOT to those in FPDS-NG, SPOT users are not required to enter contract numbers in a  standardized manner. In our review of SPOT data, we identified that at least 12 percent of  the contracts had invalid contract numbers and, therefore, could not be matched to  records in FPDS-NG.\u201d", "When implementing SPOT, State used the configuration guidance which  complies with FPDS-NG given by DOD to enter all contract numbers.  The user  guide posted on the Department\u2019s intranet was shared with GAO; the business  rules in it state the configuration to be used when entering a contract number into  SPOT.  We contacted DOD on September 9, 2009, and they informed us they are  already working on a standardized configuration.", "Recently, DOD conducted user acceptance testing for implementation of  enhanced reporting in SPOT, but we were told it would only be on its secure  network.   However, all the information input to date into SPOT is in an  unclassified network.  The agencies need to discuss future reporting capability for  non-classified SPOT.", "The following are GAO\u2019s supplemental comments on the Department of  State\u2019s letter dated September 24, 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  Notwithstanding State\u2019s guidance to contractors, we found that not all  contractor personnel are being entered into SPOT as required. In  practice, we found that the need for an LOA is the primary determinate  for whether or not contractor personnel are entered into SPOT. For  example, a State contracting officer informed us that Iraqis working on  his contracts are not in SPOT because they do not need LOAs, which is  not consistent with State\u2019s guidance, the MOU criteria, or the NDAA  for FY2008.  2.  As reflected in our recommendation, we agree that the agencies need  to determine a single standard on which contracts should be entered  into SPOT. This is not only due to State\u2019s observation regarding  inconsistencies in the MOU, but also due to the inconsistencies we  found between the MOU and NDAA for FY 2008 and the varying  criteria being used by the agencies. Until there is a single agreed upon  standard\u2014both in guidance and practice, the agencies will continue  track data differently and, as a result, the data for all three agencies  will be incomplete.   3.  Our finding pertained to how data are actually being entered into  SPOT, which as we report allows users to enter invalid contract  numbers and does not require the entry of task order numbers. For  example, we found that none of State\u2019s task orders in SPOT provided  both the contract and task order numbers. If such data entry issues are  not resolved in the near future, then the planned connection with  FPDS-NG may present challenges and prevent contract data from  being accurately imported into SPOT."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s supplemental comments on USAID\u2019s letter dated  September 22, 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  While building off the lessons learned in Iraq has merit, we note that  USAID does not provide a time frame for when it will begin requiring  contractors in Afghanistan to use SPOT to fulfill the requirements of  the NDAA for FY2008 and what it agreed to in the MOU.  2.  Our report explains that the need for the LOA\u2014as opposed to what  was agreed to in the MOU or contained in the NDAA for FY2008\u2014has  become the primary factor for determining which contractor personnel  are entered into SPOT. USAID\u2019s comment that it will explore SPOT\u2019s  functionality to track personnel who do not need LOAs is consistent  with our recommendation that the agencies work together to ensure  that the requirements of the NDAA for FY2008 and their respective  information needs are fulfilled. 3.  While USAID has a standard contract numbering system, the issue we  identified pertains to how SPOT allows contract and task order  numbers to be entered inconsistently. The agencies need to work  together to ensure that contract and task orders numbers are entered  into SPOT so that data can be accurately pulled from FPDS-NG.  4.  While DOD is responsible for maintaining and upgrading SPOT, the  three agencies have a shared responsibility to ensure that the database  they agreed to use in their MOU fulfills the requirements of the NDAA  for FY2008.
