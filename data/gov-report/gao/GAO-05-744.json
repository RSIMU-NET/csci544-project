The growth in global trade and the dramatic increase in foreign direct investment in developing countries raise questions regarding CSR-related issues such as labor, environment, and human rights. U.S. firms with operations in many countries employ millions of foreign workers and conduct a range of CSR activities to address these issues. However, there is controversy as to the proper government role. GAO describes (1) federal agency policies and programs relating to global CSR and (2) different perspectives regarding the appropriate U.S. government role and views on the impact of current federal activities on corporate global CSR efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although there is no broad federal CSR mandate, we identified 12 U.S. agencies with over 50 federal programs, policies, and activities that generally fall into four roles of endorsing, facilitating, partnering, or mandating CSR activities. Many of these programs have small budgets and staff and aim to accomplish broader agency mission goals, rather than being specifically designed to facilitate or promote companies' global CSR activities. The U.S. government endorses CSR by providing awards to companies, such as the Department of State's Award for Corporate Excellence. Federal programs facilitate CSR by such activities as providing information or providing funding to engage in CSR. For example, a Department of Commerce program facilitates CSR by providing training on corporate stewardship. Some agencies partner with corporations on specific projects related to their core mission. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) partnered with one U.S. corporation operating in post-war Angola to build up the country's business sector and workforce. Other agencies, such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, mandate CSR by requiring companies to meet CSR-related criteria to obtain their services. While perspectives on the government's role are tied to perspectives on CSR and its connection to profit, many we spoke with who are actively involved in global CSR desired a government role supporting business's voluntary CSR efforts. Those with a free-market economic perspective believe corporations should be primarily concerned with earning a profit and government should not promote CSR as it reduces profits. Those with a \"business case\" perspective often welcome government assistance with their voluntary efforts because they view their CSR efforts as increasing profits and business value. Finally, those with a social issues perspective believe that business should contribute to broader social goals but split on whether business action should be voluntary or mandatory. Most groups we spoke with at U.S. companies and others actively engaged in CSR were generally supportive of U.S. federal agency efforts to endorse and facilitate CSR and partner with companies voluntarily pursuing CSR actions. For example, several groups supported a government role in providing CSR-related information and convening stakeholders to address CSR-related issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The trend toward globalization\u2014as evidenced by the growth in global trade  and the dramatic increase in foreign direct investment in developing  countries, from $22 billion in 1990 to $154 billion in 2002\u2014has intensified  the debate about the role of business and the U.S. government in  addressing \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d (CSR) related issues.  Presently, for example, some opponents of the U.S.-Central American Free  Trade Agreement (CAFTA) have complained that the agreement does not  do enough to ensure that workers in these countries have adequate labor  protections. The term CSR is often used to refer to business efforts to  address the impact of business operations on such concerns as labor,  environment, and human rights. U.S. multinational corporations, which  conduct operations in many countries and employ millions of foreign  workers, have sometimes responded to the varying pressures they face by  adopting CSR efforts to address social and environmental concerns.

First, we provided a general description of global CSR  to agency officials and asked them to identify relevant programs, policies,  and efforts within their agency. We then sent a questionnaire to officials  responsible for each identified program and interviewed officials to obtain  further information. To identify different perspectives regarding the role of the U.S. government related to corporate global CSR efforts, we  reviewed CSR-related trade and business literature and interviewed, on a  nonattribution basis, representatives from 14 selected U.S. multinational  corporations; 4 business interest groups; 4 investor groups; 6  nongovernmental organizations; and 4 academic institutions that are  leaders in the CSR field.

At the same  time, others view globalization as resulting in negative social impacts and  raise concerns about the expanding activities of multinational  corporations, particularly in developing countries. U.S. multinational  corporations are now faced with difficult issues, such as the treatment and  conditions of foreign workers in corporate supply chains, environmental  and health issues associated with production in diverse local communities,  and human rights issues associated with authoritarian governments in  countries where multinationals operate. In addition, some negative  incidents involving U.S.-based companies have been widely publicized,  hurting their own and the United States\u2019 image, such as the use of  sweatshops in the manufacture of clothing and other products.

However, the legal, regulatory and  ethical environments in which U.S. businesses and their suppliers operate  vary across countries. For example, some have asserted that developing  countries have inadequate or poorly enforced environmental and labor  laws. Given the limited capacity of some developing countries, CSR  advocates argue that corporations themselves must establish and maintain  codes of conduct regarding operating standards in these environments.  Companies face increasing pressure from nongovernmental organizations  (NGO), the media, \u201csocially responsible\u201d investor groups, and other  stakeholders to adhere to high standards globally in their own operations  and throughout their supply chains.

In this view, engaging in CSR actions that  are not based on profitability can affect not only business performance but  also potentially reduce the general welfare of society. David Henderson, an  economist who has written extensively questioning the value of CSR,  recently wrote \u201cThe general adoption of CSR, in response to social  pressures, would undermine the market economy and make businesses  less effective in performance of their primary role.\u201d While this free-market  economic perspective recognizes that government has a role in structuring  the legal framework of a market economy, those with this view do not  support government involvement in the general adoption of the concept of  CSR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Business-Case Perspective", "paragraphs": ["Many CSR proponents cite a \u201cbusiness-case\u201d perspective, in which  business CSR efforts are supported based on their contribution to business  profit and value.

Supporters  of this perspective have developed many different lists of potential benefits  to a business in adopting CSR. For example, one discussion of the business  case identified the following six potential business benefits: Operational cost savings\u2014Investment in environmental efficiency  measures such as waste reduction and energy efficiency can save  money as well.", "Enhanced reputation\u2014Good company performance in relation to  sustainability issues can build reputation, while poor performance,  when exposed, can damage brand value.", "Increased ability to recruit, develop, and retain staff\u2014These can  be direct results of introducing \u2018family friendly\u2019 policies.

In addition, some  developing countries may not have adequate laws to address concerns  about workers rights or the local environment, and even where they do,  these countries may not have the resources, technical expertise, or the  willingness to adequately enforce their laws and regulations.

We collected major definitions and descriptions of CSR and global  CSR and related terms and obtained information on different perspectives  that have led to different definitions for CSR and CSR-related terms.", "To determine what policies and programs U.S. federal agencies have  adopted that relate to global CSR, we surveyed federal legislation, reviewed  literature, and spoke with agency officials and experts in CSR. To select the  federal agencies to involve in our review, we first considered which  agencies\u2019 missions suggest possible involvement with promoting,  facilitating, or monitoring global corporate social responsibility efforts,  which yielded seven agencies. We then added two additional agencies to  include all of the agencies that participate in the interagency working group  developing a Web portal to publicize the U.S. government programs and  resources that promote good corporate practices or CSR. We added the  remaining three agencies, following referrals by agency officials or CSR  experts, and had discussions with some agency officials to determine if  their agencies had relevant programs for this review. The agencies we  identified with CSR-related programs were:   Department of Energy (DOE),  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (Ex-Im Bank),  Inter-American Foundation (IAF),  Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC),  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),  Department of the Treasury,  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).", "We identified specific agency programs and policies related to CSR using a  two-step process. First, we provided a standard Data Collection Instrument  (DCI) with a general description of global CSR to agency officials and  asked them to identify current programs, policies, and efforts within their  agencies that directly or indirectly promote, facilitate, or monitor global  CSR efforts. The description discussed the general elements that a global  CSR program can involve, including labor, human rights, environmental  and corporate governance efforts. In addition, we also asked agencies  about programs that we identified through interviews or literature review.  We then sent a more detailed DCI to officials responsible for each identified  program to obtain further information, such as the program\u2019s objective,  start year, legal basis, targeted groups, and activities. Most of the programs  have other goals and objectives, and some only relate to CSR in particular  aspects of their activities. We collected budget information and staffing  levels, where available, to estimate the level of effort dedicated to the CSR  activities by the agency.", "After we received the responses from the agencies, we followed up with  many of the identified federal programs to obtain additional information,  which helped us determine whether we should include the program in our  review. We also obtained additional documentation from a subset of the  programs to verify the information and conducted a thorough review of all  of the responses identifying the legal basis for the program/activity. We  narrowed down the programs to those that met the following criteria: (1)  were ongoing in fiscal year 2003 or afterwards; (2) may affect U.S.  corporations\u2019 CSR efforts overseas, including their supply chains (e.g.,  government to government efforts); and (3) touch on key components of  CSR, such as labor, environment, human rights, community development  and corporate governance. We also obtained agency concurrence that the  program is related to CSR.", "We excluded programs or activities that are primarily aimed at U.S.  corporations\u2019 CSR efforts within the United States, although they may  influence a company\u2019s CSR efforts overseas, and efforts that are primarily  targeted at the federal government, such as government procurement  policies. Due to the lack of federal legislation on, and a generally accepted  definition of, corporate social responsibility, there are likely additional  programs, policies, and efforts related to global CSR within the federal  government that we did not identify.", "To obtain different perspectives regarding the role of the U.S. government  in corporate global CSR efforts, we reviewed CSR literature. In addition,  we conducted and synthesized information from a structured interview  with 32 individuals representing a diverse variety of groups actively  engaged in CSR. We initially identified 25 U.S. companies that were (1)  leaders in CSR, based on companies that appeared on the Business Ethics  Magazines\u2019s Top 100 to Corporate Citizens list each year from 1999 to 2004  and (2) had international operations. Fourteen of these companies agreed  to participate in interviews with us. However, their views may not  represent those of all 25 leaders we identified, or those of all U.S.  companies. We identified representatives from other groups actively  engaged in CSR through a review of CSR literature and referrals from  experts and agency officials. We selected these groups and organizations to  help us obtain a broad range of knowledgeable and informed views on  global CSR and the federal government's role in global CSR; our selection  was not intended to be representative in any statistical sense. Groups that  are not active in global CSR may have different views and opinions,  especially in terms of the federal government's role. Specifically, we  interviewed:  Fourteen U.S. multinational corporations that appeared on the Business  Ethics Magazine\u2019s Top 100 Corporate Citizens list for each year from  1999 to 2004\u2014Brady Corporation; Coors Brewing Company; Cummins,  Inc.; Deere & Company; Herman Miller, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard  Development Company, L.P.; International Business Machines  Corporation; Intel Corporation; Merck & Co., Inc.; Modine  Manufacturing Company; Motorola, Inc.; Procter & Gamble; The  Timberland Company; and Whirlpool Corporation;   Four business interest groups that have been active in CSR\u2014Business  for Social Responsibility; the Conference Board; the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce Center for Corporate Citizenship; and the U.S. Council for  International Business;  Four investor groups\u2014Calvert Group, Ltd.; Domini Social Investments,  LLC ; Dow Jones Sustainability Index; and the Interfaith Center on  Corporate Responsibility;   Six nongovernmental organizations\u2014Coalition for Environmentally  Responsible Economies; Fair Labor Association; Human Rights Watch;  Social Accountability International; World Resources Institute; and  Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production; and  Four academic institutions\u2014Center for Corporate Citizenship, Boston  College; Center for Responsible Business, the Haas School of Business,  University of California at Berkeley; the Corporate Social Responsibility  Initiative, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University;  the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, University of  North Carolina\u2019s Kenan-Flagler Business School.", "The structured interview instrument included questions designed to obtain  information from these organizations on their definition of CSR and similar  terms; efforts related to evaluating the effectiveness of CSR activities; the  impact of current U.S. government programs, policies and practices; and  opinions regarding the appropriate U.S. government actions or role  regarding U.S. companies\u2019 global CSR activities. However, in this report, we  do not evaluate the concept of CSR nor the justification or efficacy of any  government role with regard to CSR activities.", "We conducted our work from May 2004 through May 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agency CSR-Related Programs and Activities", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides a listing and brief description of the 54 programs  and activities we identified at 12 U.S. agencies that relate to global CSR.
