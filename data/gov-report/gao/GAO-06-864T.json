To do so, TSA has been developing Secure Flight.

TSA's rebaselining effort is currently under way, and final decisions regarding the future direction of the program have not been made. In our most recent report and testimony, we noted that TSA had made some progress in developing and testing the Secure Flight program, but had not followed a disciplined life cycle approach to manage systems development or fully defined system requirements. We also reported that TSA was proceeding to develop Secure Flight without a program management plan containing program schedule and cost estimates. Oversight reviews of the program had also raised questions about program management. Secure Flight officials stated that as they move forward with the rebaselined program, they will be following a more rigorous and disciplined life cycle process for Secure Flight. We support TSA's rebaselining effort, and believe that the agency should not move forward with the program until it has demonstrated that a disciplined life cycle process is being followed. We also reported that TSA had taken steps to collaborate with Secure Flight stakeholders whose participation is essential to ensuring that passenger and terrorist watch list data are collected and transmitted to support Secure Flight. However, key program stakeholders--including the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Terrorist Screening Center, and air carriers--stated that they needed more definitive information about system requirements from TSA to plan for their support of the program. In addition, we reported that several activities that will affect Secure Flight's effectiveness were under way or had not yet been decided. For example, TSA conducted name-matching tests that compared passenger and terrorist screening database information to determine what type of passenger data would be needed for Secure Flight's purposes. However, TSA had not yet made key policy decisions that could significantly impact program operations, including what passenger data it would require air carriers to provide and the name-matching technologies it would use. Further, Secure Flight's system development documentation did not fully identify how passenger privacy protections were to be met, and TSA had not issued the privacy notices that described how it would protect passenger data once Secure Flight became operational. As a result, it was not possible to assess how TSA is addressing privacy concerns. Secure Flight officials stated that they plan to address privacy issues and finalize its redress polices in conjunction with rebaselining the program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) intelligence efforts and the  integration of its programs that will affect the traveling public, such as  Secure Flight. The purpose of Secure Flight is to enable our government to  protect the public and strengthen aviation security by identifying and  scrutinizing individuals suspected of having ties to terrorism, or who may  otherwise pose a threat to aviation, in order to prevent them from  boarding commercial aircraft in the United States, if warranted, or by  subjecting them to additional security scrutiny prior to boarding an  aircraft. The program also aims to reduce the number of individuals  unnecessarily selected for secondary screening while protecting  passengers\u2019 privacy and civil liberties.", "My testimony today summarizes the progress TSA has made to develop  and implement Secure Flight and the challenges it continues to face as it  moves forward with (1) developing, managing, and overseeing the Secure  Flight program; (2) coordinating with federal and private sector  stakeholders who will play critical roles in Secure Flight operations;   (3) addressing key factors that will impact system effectiveness; and   (4) minimizing program impacts on passenger privacy and protecting  passenger rights. Since I last testified on these issues in February 2006,  TSA announced that it was rebaselining the Secure Flight program.

(See app. II for a description of the 10 issues  and app. III for additional information on the scope and methodology for  this review.) In March 2005, we reported that TSA had made progress in  developing and testing Secure Flight, but had not completed key system  testing, had not finalized system requirements or determined how certain  aspects of the program would operate (such as the basis on which  passengers would be selected for preflight scrutiny), and had not clearly  defined the privacy impacts of the program. At the time, we recommended  that TSA take several actions to manage the risks associated with  developing and implementing Secure Flight, including finalizing system  requirements and test plans, privacy and redress requirements, and  program cost estimates. In February 2006, we testified that TSA had  committed to take action based on our recommendations that the agency  manage the risks associated with developing and implementing Secure  Flight. Although we noted that TSA had made some progress in these  areas, we reported that it had not completed any of the actions that were  scheduled to be accomplished and long-standing issues related to systems  development and testing, program management, and privacy and redress  protections remained.

The process of prescreening  passengers\u2014that is, determining whether airline passengers might pose a  security risk before they reach the passenger-screening checkpoint\u2014is  used to focus security efforts on those passengers that represent the  greatest potential threat. Currently, U.S. air carriers conduct passenger  prescreening by comparing passenger names against government-supplied  terrorist watch lists and applying the Computer-Assisted Passenger  Prescreening System rules, known as CAPPS rules."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Development of Legacy Passenger Prescreening Systems", "paragraphs": ["Following the events of September 11, and in accordance with the  requirement set forth in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that  a computer-assisted passenger prescreening system be used to evaluate all  passengers before they board an aircraft, TSA established the Office of  National Risk Assessment to develop and maintain a capability to  prescreen passengers in an effort to protect U.S. transportation systems  and the public against potential terrorists. In March 2003, this office began  developing the second-generation computer-assisted passenger  prescreening system, known as CAPPS II, to provide improvements over  the current prescreening process, and to screen all passengers flying into,  out of, and within the United States.", "Based in part on concerns about privacy and other issues expressed by us  and others, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) canceled the  development of CAPPS II in August 2004.  Shortly thereafter, it announced  that it planned to develop a new passenger prescreening program called  Secure Flight. In contrast to CAPPS II, Secure Flight, among other  changes, will only prescreen passengers flying domestically within the  United States, rather than passengers flying into and out of the United  States. Also, the CAPPS rules will not be implemented as part of Secure  Flight, but rather the rules will continue to be applied by commercial air  carriers. As of February 2006, TSA planned to operate Secure Flight on the  Transportation Vetting Platform (TVP)\u2014the underlying infrastructure  (hardware and software) developed to support the Secure Flight  application, including security, communications, and data management  and, the Secure Flight application was to perform the functions associated  with receiving, vetting, and returning requests related to the determination  of whether passengers are on government watch lists. This application  was also to be configurable\u2014meaning that it could be quickly adjusted to  reflect changes to workflow parameters. In May 2006, TSA officials stated  that the agency was considering other approaches for integrating the  Secure Flight TVP and application functions in a different configuration as  part of rebaselining the program. In its rebaselining effort, this and other  aspects of Secure Flight are currently being reviewed, and policy decisions  regarding the operations of the program have not been finalized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of TSA\u2019s Plans to Operate Secure Flight as of February 2006", "paragraphs": ["As envisioned under Secure Flight, when a passenger made flight  arrangements, the organization accepting the reservation, such as the air  carrier\u2019s reservation office or a travel agent, would enter passenger name  record (PNR) information obtained from the passenger, which would then  be stored in the air carrier\u2019s reservation system. While the government  would be asking for only portions of the PNR, the PNR data could include  the passenger\u2019s name, phone number, number of bags, seat number, and  form of payment, among other information. Approximately 72 hours prior  to the flight, portions of the passenger data contained in the PNR would be  sent to Secure Flight through a secure network connection provided by  DHS\u2019s CBP. Reservations or changes to reservations that were made less  than 72 hours prior to flight time would be sent immediately to TSA  through CBP.", "Upon receipt of passenger data, TSA planned to process the passenger  data through the Secure Flight application running on the TVP. During this  process, Secure Flight would determine if the passenger data matched the  data extracted daily from TSC\u2019s Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB)\u2014 the information consolidated by TSC from terrorist watch lists to provide  government screeners with a unified set of terrorist-related information. In  addition, TSA would screen against its own watch list composed of  individuals who do not have a nexus to terrorism but who may pose a  threat to aviation security.", "In order to match passenger data to information contained in the TSDB,  TSC planned to provide TSA with an extract of the TSDB for use in Secure  Flight and provide updates as they occur. This TSDB subset would include  all individuals classified as either selectees (individuals who are selected  for additional security measures prior to boarding an aircraft) or no-flys  (individuals who would be denied boarding unless they are cleared by law  enforcement personnel). To perform the match, Secure Flight was to  compare the passenger data, TSDB, and other watch list data using  automated name-matching technologies. When a possible match was  generated, TSA and potentially TSC analysts would conduct a manual  review comparing additional law enforcement and other government  information with passenger data to determine if the person could be ruled  out as a possible match. TSA was to return the matching results to the air  carriers through CBP. Figure 1 illustrates how Secure Flight was intended  to operate as of February 2006.", "As shown in figure 1, when the passenger checked in for the flight at the  airport, the passenger was to receive a level of screening based on his or  her designated category. A cleared passenger was to be provided a  boarding pass and allowed to proceed to the screening checkpoint in the  normal manner. A selectee passenger was to receive additional security  scrutiny at the screening checkpoint. A no-fly passenger would not be  issued a boarding pass. Instead, appropriate law enforcement agencies  would be notified. Law enforcement officials would determine whether  the individual would be allowed to proceed through the screening  checkpoint or if other actions are warranted, such as additional  questioning of the passenger or taking the passenger into custody. Based  on its rebaselining effort, TSA may modify this concept of operations for  Secure Flight."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Had Not Followed a Disciplined Life Cycle Approach or Fully Defined System Requirements, Schedule, and Costs", "paragraphs": ["As we testified in February 2006, TSA had not conducted critical activities  in accordance with best practices for large-scale information technology  programs. Further, TSA had not followed a disciplined life cycle approach  in developing Secure Flight, in which all phases of the project are defined  by a series of orderly phases and the development of related  documentation. Program officials stated that they had instead used a rapid  development method that was intended to enable them to develop the  program more quickly. However, as a result of this approach, the  development process had been ad hoc, with project activities conducted  out of sequence. For example, program officials declared the design phase  complete before requirements for designing Secure Flight had been  detailed.", "Our evaluations of major federal information technology programs, and  research by others, have shown that following a disciplined life cycle  management process decreases the risks associated with acquiring  systems. As part of the life cycle process, TSA must define and document  Secure Flight\u2019s requirements\u2014including how Secure Flight is to function  and perform, the data needed for the system to function, how various  systems interconnect, and how system security is achieved. We found that  Secure Flight\u2019s requirements documentation contained contradictory and  missing information. TSA officials acknowledged that they had not  followed a disciplined life cycle approach in developing Secure Flight, but  stated that in moving forward, they would follow TSA\u2019s standard  development process. We also found that while TSA had taken steps to  implement an information security management program for protecting  Secure Flight information and assets, its efforts were incomplete, based on  federal standards and industry best practices. We reported that without a  completed system security program, Secure Flight may not be adequately  protected against unauthorized access and use or disruption, once the  program becomes operational.", "Further, TSA had proceeded with Secure Flight development without an  effective program management plan that contained up-to-date program  schedules and cost estimates. TSA officials stated they had not maintained  an updated schedule in part because the agency had not promulgated a  necessary regulation requiring commercial air carriers to submit certain  passenger data needed to operate Secure Flight, and air carrier responses  to this regulation would impact when Secure Flight would be operational  and at what cost. While we recognized that program unknowns introduce  uncertainty into the program-planning process, uncertainty is a practical  reality in planning all programs and is not a reason for not developing  plans, including cost and schedule estimates that reflect known and  unknown aspects of the program.", "Prior to TSA\u2019s rebaselining effort of Secure Flight, several oversight  reviews of the program had been conducted that raised questions about  program management, including the lack of fully defined requirements.  DHS and TSA had executive and advisory oversight mechanisms in place  to oversee Secure Flight, including the DHS Investment Review Board\u2014 designed to review certain programs at key phases of development to help  ensure they met mission needs at expected levels of costs and risks.  However, the DHS Investment Review Board and other oversight groups  had identified problems with Secure Flight\u2019s development. Specifically, in  January 2005, the Investment Review Board withheld approval of the TVP,  which supported Secure Flight operations, to proceed from development  and testing into production and deployment until a formal acquisition plan,  a plan for integrating and coordinating Secure Flight with other DHS  people-screening programs, and a revised acquisition program baseline  had been completed. In addition, an independent working group within the  Aviation Security Advisory Committee, composed of government, privacy,  and security experts, reported in September 2005 that TSA had not  produced a comprehensive policy document for Secure Flight that could  define oversight or governance responsibilities, nor had it provided an  accountability structure for the program.", "TSA has taken actions that recognize the need to instill more rigor and  discipline into the development and management of Secure Flight, and  suspended its development efforts while it rebaselines the program. This  rebaselining effort includes reassessing program goals and capabilities and  developing a new schedule and cost estimates. Although TSA officials  stated that they will use a disciplined life cycle approach when moving  forward with the rebaselined program, officials have not identified when  their rebaselining effort will be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Had Made Progress in Coordinating with Critical Stakeholders, but More Work Remains", "paragraphs": ["As we testified in February 2006, TSA had taken steps to collaborate with  Secure Flight stakeholders\u2014CBP, TSC, and domestic air carriers\u2014whose  participation is essential to ensuring that passenger and terrorist watch list  data are collected and transmitted for Secure Flight operations, but  additional information and testing are needed to enable stakeholders to  provide the necessary support for the program. TSA had, for example,  drafted policy and technical guidance to help inform air carriers of their  Secure Flight responsibilities, and had begun receiving feedback from the  air carriers on this information. TSA was also in the early stages of  coordinating with CBP and TSC on broader issues of integration and  interoperability related to other people-screening programs used by the  government to combat terrorism.", "Prior to its rebaselining effort, TSA had conducted preliminary network  connectivity testing between TSA and federal stakeholders to determine,  for example, how information would be transmitted from CBP to TSA and  back. However, these tests used only dummy data and were conducted in  a controlled environment, rather than in a real-world operational  environment. According to CBP, without real data, it was not possible to  conduct stress testing to determine if the system could handle the volume  of data traffic that would be required by Secure Flight. TSA acknowledged  it had not determined what the real data volume requirements would be,  and could not do so until the regulation for air carriers was issued and  their data management role had been finalized.", "All key program stakeholders we interviewed stated that additional  information was needed before they could finalize their plans to support  Secure Flight operations. Although CBP, TSC, and air carrier officials we  interviewed through January 2006 acknowledged TSA\u2019s outreach efforts,  they cited several areas where additional information was needed from  TSA before they could fully support Secure Flight. Several CBP officials  stated, for example, that they could not proceed with establishing  connectivity with all air carriers until DHS published the rule\u2014the  regulation that would specify what type of information was to be provided  for Secure Flight\u2014and the air carriers submitted their plans for providing  this information. In addition, a TSC official stated that until TSA provided  estimates of the volume of potential name matches that TSC would be  required to screen, TSC could not make decisions about required  resources.", "TSA\u2019s ongoing coordination of prescreening and name-matching initiatives  with CBP and TSC could impact how Secure Flight is implemented and  require stakeholders to alter their plans made to support the program. In  January 2006, TSA officials stated that they are coordinating more closely  with CBP\u2019s international prescreening initiatives for passengers on flights  bound for the United States. The Air Transport Association and the  Association of European Airlines\u2014organizations representing air  carriers\u2014had requested, among other things, that both domestic and  international passenger prescreening function through coordinated  information connections and avoid unnecessary duplication of  communications, programming, and information requirements. In  addition, TSC has an initiative under way to, among other things, better  safeguard watch list data. At present, TSC exports watch list data to other  federal agencies for use in their screening efforts or processes for  examining documents and records related to terrorism. However, TSC is  currently developing a new system, Query, whereby watch list data would  not be exported, but rather would be maintained by TSC. Query would  serve as a common shared service that would allow agencies to directly  search the TSDB using TSC\u2019s name-matching technology for their own  purposes. If TSC chooses to implement Query, TSA may be required to  modify the system architecture for Secure Flight in order to accommodate  the new system.", "Due to delays in Secure Flight\u2019s development and uncertainty about its  future, officials from two air carriers told us after our February 2006  testimony that they were enhancing their respective name-matching  systems because they were unsure when and whether TSA would be  taking over the name-matching function through Secure Flight. While  these efforts may improve the accuracy in each air carrier\u2019s individual  name-matching system, the improvements will only apply to their  respective systems and could further exacerbate differences that currently  exist among the various air carriers\u2019 systems. These differences may result  in varying levels of effectiveness in the matching of passenger names  against terrorist watch lists, which was a primary factor that led to the  government\u2019s effort to take over the name-matching function through  Secure Flight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Factors That Could Influence the Effectiveness of Secure Flight Remain to Be Finalized or Resolved", "paragraphs": ["As of February 2006, several activities were under way, or were about to  be decided, that would affect Secure Flight\u2019s effectiveness. For example,  TSA had tested name-matching technologies to determine what type of  passenger data would be needed to match against terrorist watch list data.  These tests had been conducted using historical data in a controlled,  rather than real-world environment, but additional testing was needed to  learn more about how these technologies would perform in an operational  environment. TSA also had not yet conducted stress testing to determine  how the system would handle peak data volumes. Further, due to program  delays and the program rebaselining, TSA had not conducted a  comprehensive end-to-end testing to verify that the entire system would  function as intended, although it had planned to do so by the middle of  2005.", "Prior to its rebaselining effort, we further reported that TSA had not made  key policy decisions for determining the passenger information that air  carriers would be required to collect, the name-matching technologies that  would be used to vet passenger names against terrorist watch list data,  and thresholds that would be set to determine the relative volume of  passengers who are to be identified as potential matches against the  database. For example, TSA will need to decide which data attributes air  carriers will be required to provide in passenger data to be used to match  against data contained in the TSDB, such as full first, middle, and last  name plus other discrete identifiers, such as date of birth. Using too many  data attributes can increase the difficulty of conducting matching, while  using too few attributes can create an unnecessarily high number of  incorrect matches due to, among other things, the difficulty in  differentiating among similar common names without further information.  In addition, TSA must determine what type or combination of name-  matching technologies to acquire and implement for Secure Flight, as  different technologies have different capabilities. For example, earlier TSA  PNR testing showed that some name-matching technologies are more  capable than others at detecting significant name modifications allowing  for the matching of two names that contain some variation. Detecting  variation is important because passengers may intentionally make  alternations to their names in an attempt to conceal their identities. In  addition, unintentional variations can result from different translations of  non-native names or data entry errors. TSA had planned to finalize  decisions on these factors as system development progressed. However,  until TSA completes its program rebaselining, data requirements for the  program will remain unknown.", "As we reported in February 2006, two additional factors will play an  important role in the effectiveness of Secure Flight. These factors include  (1) the accuracy and completeness of data contained in TSC\u2019s TSDB and in  passenger data submitted by air carriers, and (2) the ability of TSA and  TSC to identify false positives and resolve possible mistakes during the  data-matching process to minimize inconveniencing passengers. Regarding  data quality and accuracy, in a review of the TSC\u2019s role in Secure Flight,  the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General found that TSC  could not ensure that the information contained in its TSDB was complete  or accurate. To address accuracy, TSA and TSC had planned to work  together to identify false positives\u2014passengers inappropriately matched  against data contained in the terrorist-screening database\u2014by using  intelligence analysts to monitor the accuracy of data matches. Related to  the accuracy of PNR data, we reported that TSA had planned to describe  the required data attributes that must be contained in passenger data  provided to TSA in a forthcoming rule. However, the accuracy and  completeness of the information contained in the passenger data record  will still be dependent on the air carriers\u2019 reservations systems, the  passengers themselves, and the air carriers\u2019 modifications of their systems  for transmitting the data in the proper format. Prior TSA testing found that  many passenger data records submitted by air carriers were found to be  inaccurate or incomplete, creating problems during the automated name- matching process.", "Prior to its rebaselining effort, TSA had also reported that it planned to  work with TSC to identify false positives as passenger data are matched  against data in the TSDB, and to resolve mistakes to the extent possible  before inconveniencing passengers. The agencies were to use intelligence  analysts during the actual matching of passenger data to data contained in  the TSDB to increase the accuracy of data matches. When TSA\u2019s name- matching technologies indicated a possible match, TSA analysts were to  manually review all of the passenger data and other information to  determine if the passenger could be ruled out as a match to the TSDB. If a  TSA analyst could not rule out a possible match, the record would be  forwarded to a TSC analyst to conduct a further review using additional  information. Until TSA completes its rebaselining effort, it is uncertain  whether this or another process will be used to help mitigate the  misidentification of passengers. An additional factor that could impact the  effectiveness of Secure Flight in identifying known or suspected terrorists  is the system\u2019s inability to identify passengers who assume the identity of  another individual by committing identity theft, or who use false  identifying information. Secure Flight was neither intended nor designed  to address these vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Secure Flight Privacy Notices and Passenger Redress Process Cannot Be Finalized Until Program Requirements Are More Fully Defined", "paragraphs": ["TSA is aware of, and plans to address, the potential for Secure Flight to  adversely affect travelers\u2019 privacy and their rights. However, as we  testified in February 2006, TSA, as part of its requirements development  process, had not clearly identified the privacy impacts of the envisioned  system or the full actions it planned to take to mitigate them. Because  Secure Flight\u2019s system development documentation did not fully address  how passenger privacy protections were to be met, it was not possible to  assess potential system impacts on individual privacy protections, as of  February 2006. Further, such an assessment will not be possible until TSA  determines what passenger data will be required and how privacy  protections will be addressed in the rebaselined program.", "The Privacy Act and the Fair Information Practices\u2014a set of  internationally recognized privacy principles that underlie the Privacy  Act\u2014limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by  federal agencies. TSA officials have stated that they are committed to  meeting the requirements of the Privacy Act and the Fair Information  Practices. However, it is not evident how this will be accomplished  because TSA has not decided what passenger data elements it plans to  collect, how such data will be provided by stakeholders, or how a  restructuring that may result from its program rebaselining will impact its  requirements for passenger data. Prior to the rebaselining effort, TSA was  in the process of developing but had not issued the systems-of-records  notice required by the Privacy Act, or the privacy impact assessment  required by the E-Government Act, that would describe how TSA will  protect passenger data once Secure Flight becomes operational.  Moreover, privacy requirements had not been incorporated into the Secure  Flight system development process to explain whether personal  information would be collected and maintained in the system in a manner  that complies with privacy and security requirements. In our review of  Secure Flight\u2019s system requirements prior to TSA announcing its  rebaselining, we found that privacy concerns were broadly defined in  functional requirements documentation, which states that the Privacy Act  must be considered in developing the system. However, these broad  functional requirements had not been translated into specific system  requirements. Until TSA determines the relevancy of these requirements  and notices, privacy protections and impacts cannot be assessed.", "Further, Congress mandated that Secure Flight include a process whereby  aviation passengers determined to pose a threat to aviation security may  appeal that determination and correct erroneous information contained  within the prescreening system. While TSA has not yet determined how it  will meet this congressional mandate, it currently has a process in place  that allows passengers who experience delays under the current  prescreening conducted by air carriers to submit a passenger identity  verification form to TSA and request that the agency place their names on  a cleared list. If, upon review, TSA determines that the passenger\u2019s identity  is distinct from the person on a watch list, TSA will add the passenger\u2019s  name to its cleared list, and will forward the updated list to the air carriers.  TSA will also notify the passenger of his or her cleared status and explain   that in the future the passenger may still experience delays. Recently,  TSA has automated the cleared list process, enabling the agency to further  mitigate inconvenience to travelers on the cleared list. GAO has an  ongoing review examining TSA\u2019s redress process for assisting passengers  misidentified under the screening program.", "According to TSA officials, no final decisions have been made regarding  how TSA will address redress requirements, but information on the  process will be contained within the privacy notices released in  conjunction with the forthcoming regulation.

We believe this  rebaselining effort is a positive step in addressing the issues facing the  program. To make and demonstrate progress on any large-scale  information technology program, such as Secure Flight, an agency must  first adequately define program capabilities that are to be provided, such  as requirements related to performance, security, privacy, and data  content and accuracy.  These requirements can then in turn be used to  produce reliable estimates of what these capabilities will cost, when they  will be delivered, and what mission value or benefits will accrue as a  result. For Secure Flight, well-defined requirements would provide a guide  for developing the system and a baseline to test the developed system to  ensure that it delivers necessary capabilities, and would help to ensure  that key program areas\u2014such as security, system connectivity, and  privacy and redress protections\u2014are appropriately managed.", "When we reported on Secure Flight in March 2005, TSA had committed to  take action on our recommendations to manage the risks associated with  developing and implementing Secure Flight, including finalizing the  concept of operations, system requirements, and test plans; completing  formal agreements with CBP and air carriers to obtain passenger data;  developing life cycle cost estimates and a comprehensive set of critical  performance measures; issuing new privacy notices; and putting a redress  process in place. When we testified in February 2006, TSA had made some  progress in all of these areas, including conducting further testing of  factors that could influence system effectiveness and corroborating with  key stakeholders.

Throughout our  ongoing reviews of Secure Flight, we have reviewed TSA\u2019s System  Development Life Cycle Guidance for developing information technology  systems and other federal reports describing best practices in developing  and acquiring these systems. We also reviewed draft TSA documents  containing information on the development and testing of Secure Flight,  including concept of operations, requirements, test plans, and test results.  We also reviewed reports from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the  Inspector General that reviewed the Secure Flight program and reports  from two oversight groups that provided advisory recommendations for  Secure Flight: DHS\u2019s Privacy and Data Integrity Advisory Committee and  TSA\u2019s Aviation Security Advisory Committee Secure Flight Working  Group. We interviewed senior-level TSA officials, including  representatives from the Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and  Credentialing, which is responsible for Secure Flight, and the Office of  Transportation Security Redress, to obtain information on Secure Flight\u2019s  planning, development, testing, and policy decisions. We also interviewed  representatives from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and  Terrorist Screening Center to obtain information about stakeholder  coordination. We also interviewed officials from several air carriers and  representatives from aviation trade organizations regarding issues related  to Secure Flight\u2019s development and implementation.
