In response to this increase, DOD restructured the development program and reduced production aircraft by 27. If additional delays occur, further changes may be required. The program also continues to address technical problems that have limited the performance of test aircraft, including violent movement or \"buffeting\" of the vertical fins, overheating in portions of the aircraft, weakening of materials in the horizontal tail, and instability of avionics software. Air Force officials cannot predict when they will resolve these problems. These technical problems, along with the late delivery of aircraft to the flight test center, have delayed the development program. Based on F/A-22 flight test accomplishment data and current flight test plans, we believe that operational testing will likely be delayed several months beyond the planned August 2003 start date. The F/A-22 program is in its final stages of development, and low-rate initial production has begun. Since fiscal year 1997, funds have been appropriated to acquire production aircraft, and the F/A-22 acquisition plan calls for steadily increasing annual production rates. However, GAO considers the Air Force's acquisition strategy at high risk for increases in production costs. In past reports, GAO has reported that acquiring aircraft while significant technical challenges remain does not allow for adequate testing of the aircraft. The uncertainties regarding performance capabilities of the F/A-22 aircraft and its development schedule will persist until technical problems have been addressed, including testing of modifications or fixes necessary to potentially alleviate these problems. In light of those uncertainties, steadily increasing annual production rates could result in the Air Force having to modify a larger quantity of aircraft after they are built."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force is developing the F/A-22 aircraft to replace its fleet of F-15  air superiority aircraft.

The shutdowns occur when the pilot attempts to use  the radar, communication, navigation, identification, and electronic  warfare systems concurrently. Although the plane can still be flown after  the avionics have failed, the pilot is unable to successfully demonstrate the  performance of the avionics. Therefore, the Air Force has had to extend  the test program schedule.", "The Air Force recognized that the avionics problems pose a high technical  risk to the F/A-22 program, and in June 2002 the Air Force convened a  special team to address the problem. According to the team, the  unpredictable nature of the shutdowns was not surprising considering the  complexity of the avionics system. The team recommended that the  software be stabilized in the laboratory before releasing it to flight testing.  The team further recommended conducting a stress test on the software  system architecture to reduce problems and ensure that it is operating  properly. The Air Force implemented these recommendations. Further, the  Air Force extended the avionics schedule to accommodate avionics  stability testing and now plans to complete avionics testing in the first  quarter of 2005.

Unless the violent  movement is resolved or the fins strengthened, the vertical fins will break  over time because the pressures experienced exceed the strength limits of  the fins. In addition, the buffeting problem has restricted the testing of  aerial maneuvers of the aircraft.", "Lockheed Martin has developed several modifications to strengthen the  vertical fins and has performed an analysis to test the structural strength  of the aircraft. It concluded that no flight restrictions above 10,000 feet are  necessary as a result of buffeting.

As the F/A-22 flies, heat builds up  inside several areas in of the rear of the aircraft. Continued exposure to  high temperatures would weaken these parts of the aircraft. For example,  a portion of the airframe that sits between the engines\u2019 exhausts  experiences the highest temperatures. This intense heat could weaken or  damage the airframe. To prevent this heat buildup during flight testing, the  aircraft is restricted to flying just over 500 miles per hour, about the same  speed as a modern jet liner, and significantly below the supercruise  requirement. Currently, the F/A-22 flies with temperature sensors in  those areas of the aircraft, and it slows down whenever the temperature  approaches a certain level.

However, aircraft are requiring five times the  maintenance actions expected at this point in development. As of  November 2002, the development test aircraft have been completing  only .29 flying hours between maintenance actions. Therefore, the  development test aircraft are spending more time than planned on the  ground undergoing maintenance.", "In addition, the F/A-22 program has not completed the testing required to  prove the aircraft can be maintained worldwide without unique support  equipment. For example, the Air Force planned to fly the F/A-22 a  minimum of 650 hours prior to the start of operational testing to establish  that special support equipment is not necessary to maintain the materials  on the exterior of the aircraft. These materials are critical to the aircraft\u2019s  low observable, or stealthy, nature. However, as of December 2002, the  program has only accomplished 191.6 hours.

Further, the Air Force now plans to conduct  more developmental flight testing concurrently with operational testing.", "Continuing technical problems were the primary reasons for the delays  in flight testing. In addition, late delivery of development aircraft to the  flight test center was a contributing problem; three developmental aircraft  were delivered from 9 to 12 months late. Late deliveries were due not  only to technical problems, but also to continuing problems associated  with the manufacture and assembly of development aircraft by the  prime contractor.", "With the new schedule, the Air Force delayed the beginning of operational  testing for 4 months, until the portion of developmental testing required to  begin operational testing could be completed. Operational testing is now  planned to begin in August 2003.

Indeed, we believe  that it is unlikely that the Air Force will be able to complete all necessary  avionics flight testing prior to the planned start of operational testing.  Based on F/A-22 flight test accomplishment data and current flight test  plans, we project that the start of operational testing might be delayed  until January 2004.

Currently, the  Air Force has almost $3.0 billion in funding for modernization projects,  which it plans to spend through fiscal year 2009. Most of the recent  increase in modernization funding is necessary to provide increased  ground attack capability. Other modernization projects include upgrading  avionics software, adding an improved short-range missile capability,  upgrading instrumentation for testing, and incorporating a  classified project.", "In December 2002, in response to the increase in development costs, the  Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, approved the restructuring of  the F/A-22 program. According to the Comptroller, the cost increase will  not require increased funds from Congress. Rather, the estimated  $876 million increase for development will be met by a $763 million  decrease in production funding and a transfer of $113 million from  modernization funds. This restructure eliminates 27 aircraft from the  current production program, reducing the total number of aircraft to be  acquired from 303 to 276."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risks in the F/A-22 Acquisition Plan", "paragraphs": ["Despite continuing development problems and challenges, the Air Force  plans to continue acquiring production aircraft at increasing annual rates.  This is a very risky strategy, because, as we have previously reported,  the Air Force may encounter higher production costs as a result of  acquiring significant quantities of aircraft before adequate testing. Late  testing could identify problems that require costly modifications in order  to achieve satisfactory performance.", "For example, as shown in figure 3, the Air Force plans to acquire  20 aircraft during 2003, rather than the maximum of 16 Congress allowed  without DOD\u2019s submittal of a risk assessment and certification. DOD  justified this strategy in the December 2002 risk assessment and  certification it submitted to Congress. In this document, DOD certified  that acquiring more than 16 aircraft involved lower risk and lower total  program cost than acquiring only 16. DOD identified the costs associated  with acquiring more than 16 aircraft per year as between $7 million and  $221 million, depending on the number of aircraft in excess of 16. DOD  concluded that this additional cost would be less than the potential cost of  modifying production aircraft once operational testing has been  completed. Figure 3 shows the Air Force\u2019s acquisition plan.", "However, DOD\u2019s risk assessment may be overly optimistic because it  is grounded in the conclusion that there is a low risk that remaining  development and operational testing will identify needs for expensive  modifications. The performance capabilities of the F/A-22 and its schedule  will remain uncertain until technical problems have been addressed,  including testing of modifications or fixes necessary to potentially  alleviate these problems. Furthermore, we believe that the amount of  development and operational testing and the remaining uncertainties  increase the possibility that modifications considered unlikely in DOD\u2019s  analysis will, indeed, need to be made. For example, the Air Force has still  not completely defined the fin-buffet problem described earlier in this  report. The remaining 15 percent of flight testing to help characterize the  problem is not scheduled to begin until June 2003. Consequently, there is  still the possibility that additional modifications and costs may be  necessary to correct this problem on production aircraft. DOD\u2019s risk  assessment acknowledges that additional fin buffet testing is needed, but  concludes that modifications are not expected.", "The optimism of DOD\u2019s risk assessment is reflected in the Air Force\u2019s  general acquisition strategy. As also shown by figure 3, the Air Force  is currently committed to acquiring 73 production aircraft (26 percent)  before operational and development testing is complete. We believe that\u2014 like the fiscal year 2003 decision to acquire more than 16 aircraft\u2014this is  an overly optimistic strategy given the remaining F/A-22 technical  problems and the current status of testing. As we have noted, acquiring  aircraft before completing adequate testing to resolve significant technical  problems increases the risk of costly modifications later. If F/A-22 testing  schedules slip further\u2014as we believe is likely\u2014even more aircraft will be  acquired before development and operational testing is complete, and the  risk of costly modifications will increase still more."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Continuing the acquisition of aircraft in increasing quantities when  significant development testing and technical problems remain is an  acquisition strategy that relies on overly optimistic assumptions regarding  the outcome and timing of the remaining testing events. By employing  such a strategy, major problems are more likely to be discovered after  production has begun when it is either too late or very costly to correct  them. At the very least, key decisions are being made without adequate  information about the weapon system\u2019s demonstrated operational test  results. In its certification, DOD quantified the estimated costs associated  with a higher production rate. However, the potential advantage was  predicated on the assumption that the risks of modifications are low.  As we stated last year, by limiting F/A-22 production quantities and  completing development testing, the Air Force could gain information that  would reduce uncertainties and the risks of increased costs and delays  before committing to additional production aircraft. As we discussed  earlier in this report, DOD recently decided to reduce production  quantities as part of a program restructure to address F/A-22 development  problems and associated cost increases. Based on uncertainties about the  resolution of problems found in the past year, we continue to maintain the  position that production quantities should be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In light of continued uncertainties regarding the resolution of problems  found in the past year and notwithstanding the December 2, 2002  certification provided by DOD, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense  reconsider the Department\u2019s decision to increase the annual  production rate beyond 16 aircraft until greater knowledge on any  need for modifications is established through completion of  operational testing, and    update the 2002 risk assessment and certification with sufficient detail to  allow for verification of the conclusions following the completion of  operational testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated that it agreed,  for the most part, with our description of the current state of the F/A-22  program\u2019s content, schedule, and cost. However, DOD did not concur with  our recommendation that it not increase its production rate beyond the  maximum of 16 aircraft Congress allowed without DOD submitting a risk  assessment and certification. DOD said that our recommendation does not  sufficiently account for the costs of termination associated with the  approval given to funding long-lead items, the manufacturing inefficiencies  associated with a reduction in aircraft quantities, or the effects of inflation  on the cost of acquiring aircraft at a lower rate. DOD also noted that we  had not provided a quantitative assessment to justify limiting production,  and it reiterated its reliance on the risk assessment and certification it  submitted to Congress in December 2002. DOD also asserted, incorrectly,  that our report concludes that minimal cost risk would be realized by  slowing production.", "Following review of DOD\u2019s comments, we clarified the recommendation  in our draft report by establishing two recommendations. These  recommendations are based on the current state of the program\u2014 including the challenges and risks it faces\u2014and on our examination of  DOD\u2019s risk assessment and certification. DOD acknowledges the  challenges faced by the program but believes the risk of modification is  low. As we discussed in this report, until testing has been completed and  technical problems have been addressed, the performance capabilities  of the F/A-22 and its schedule will remain uncertain; thus, it is not possible  to predict that expensive modifications will not be required. For example,  as we stated earlier in this report, DOD\u2019s risk assessment concludes that  significant costs associated with a more extensive modification to resolve  the fin buffet problem may be required, but the probability is low. DOD  arrives at this conclusion even though the last phase of testing to help  characterize the fin buffet problem has not yet begun. Furthermore, we  continue to believe there is still significant risk that the F/A-22 program  will not be able to begin operational testing as scheduled in August 2003.  Subsequent to our providing the draft of this report to DOD for comment,  OSD\u2019s operational test and evaluation office issued a report stating that  F/A-22 technical and schedule risk are still high, as is the risk that  operational testing will be further delayed.", "While DOD\u2019s December 2002 risk assessment and certification did provide  an indication that manufacturing inefficiencies and inflation as a result of  lower production rates would increase costs, sufficient detail was not  provided in its risk assessment for us to verify DOD\u2019s conclusion. We  requested additional detailed information to help us evaluate and verify  the conclusions. However, the information provided to us was not  adequate to verify the conclusions contained in the risk assessment.  Regardless, even with such verification, still needing to be resolved are the  uncertainties to date regarding when development problems can be fixed  and the possibility of finding additional problems prior to the completion  of operational testing. As a result, we have little confidence that existing  problems can be quickly resolved and will not result in further delays. Our  work has shown that continuing the acquisition of aircraft in increasing  quantities when significant development testing and technical problems  remain is risky. By employing such a strategy, major problems are more  likely to be discovered after the program has begun production when it is  either too late or very costly to correct them.", "DOD also provided various technical comments, which we have  incorporated as appropriate. One of these comments related to the total  number of production aircraft to be acquired. The projected number of  production aircraft the Air Force plans to or can actually acquire has  historically been fluid and elusive. For example, the President\u2019s budget  for fiscal year 2003 reflected plans to acquire 333 production aircraft,  even though the approved program at the time called for acquiring  295 production aircraft. In its technical comments, DOD stated that the  approved program plan is to acquire 295 aircraft. As a result of the recent  F/A-22 restructuring to cover development cost increases, the Air Force  says that it now plans to acquire 276 aircraft. However, DOD estimates  that the cost of production to acquire these 276 aircraft will be  $42.2 billion, which exceeds the current production cost limit by  $5.4 billion. Consequently, unless the production cost limit is raised or  substantial cost reduction plans are achieved, it appears that the number  of aircraft that can actually be purchased will have to be lowered from  the 276 planned. This is particularly true if production or development  costs\u2014or both\u2014continue to rise and no additional funds are provided by  the Congress.", "Last month, we recommended in another report that DOD provide  Congress with documentation reflecting the quantity of aircraft that DOD  believes can be procured within the existing production cost limit. DOD\u2019s  explanation in its technical comments to a draft of this report identifies  the likelihood that F/A-22 aircraft quantities will continue to fluctuate.
