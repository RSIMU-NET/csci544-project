Legislation passed in November 2009 supports the 80 percent goal for individual income tax returns by requiring tax return preparers who file more than 10 individual returns per year to file them electronically, or e-file. GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of this e-file mandate. Specifically, GAO (1) described e-file rates and preparers' experiences implementing the mandate, (2) assessed IRS's plans to enforce the mandate, (3) assessed IRS's analysis of options for digitizing more data from paper returns, and (4) determined whether there are any tax forms IRS cannot accept electronically and assessed IRS's plans for adding them to the e-file system. To conduct these analyses, GAO reviewed IRS processing data and e-file planning documents, and interviewed IRS officials and 26 members of national preparer organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, 79 percent of all individual tax returns were e-filed, a noticeable increase over prior years. Both preparer and self-prepared e-file rates increased, which IRS officials attributed to different factors. They said the e-file mandate was one key factor in the growth of preparer e-filing. Preparers GAO interviewed who were new to e-filing said they experienced increased costs and administrative burdens due to the mandate. Several preparers who had been e-filing prior to the mandate said they experienced some of these same problems when they first e-filed, but they now find that e-filing helps their business--for example, by reducing the time needed to file returns. IRS's plans to identify preparers who are not complying with the mandate are not fully developed because IRS does not know the extent of noncompliance and it may be low. Nonetheless, officials stated some noncompliance likely exists and may increase in 2012 when the mandate applies to more preparers. Regardless of the extent, IRS does not have authority under the IRC to assess penalties on preparers who fail to comply. IRS may be able to impose sanctions under Department of Treasury regulations that govern practice before IRS. However, the process is costly and the penalties, which could include suspension of practice, may be harsher than needed. IRS is considering pursuing two options to digitize more data--bar coding and additional transcription. IRS does not transcribe all lines from paper returns. IRS's policy is to post the same information from electronic and paper returns to its databases, so that similar paper and electronic returns have equal chances of being audited. IRS has not analyzed the costs and benefits of these options, which could support informed funding decisions. Some forms cannot be e-filed, including two relatively high-volume forms for amended returns and nonresident aliens. IRS has not developed a complete list of forms that cannot currently be e-filed nor does it have a time line for adding them to the e-file system. Without adding forms such as these to the system, IRS will limit e-filing's growth potential. Congress should consider amending the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to provide IRS with penalty authority for preparer noncompliance with the mandate. GAO also recommends, among other things, that IRS conduct analyses on the costs and benefits of implementing bar coding and additional transcription and create a time line and list of forms to be added to the e-file system.

During filing season 2011, only certain forms were accepted  through the MeF system, so not all tax returns could be processed with  the new system. IRS plans to add all of the forms currently accepted in  EMS to MeF and discontinue use of EMS in October 2012. IRS officials  said that MeF provides several benefits; for example, MeF accepts or  rejects individual tax returns faster than the EMS and provides better  explanations for rejections. MeF will also allow taxpayers to attach  Portable Document Format (PDF) files to their tax returns, which will be  useful in instances where taxpayers are required to submit additional  documentation, such as settlement statements when claiming the First  Time Homebuyer Credit. Another benefit is that MeF accepts prior year  returns starting with tax year 2009. As we previously reported, IRS tested  MeF during the 2010 filing season, but use was low. Industry  stakeholders, who are major users of the e-filing systems, said MeF was  unstable (i.e., the system often had down time, time-outs, slow servers,  and delayed acknowledgments).

Electronic Tax Administration officials said  eventually they would like to enable e-filing of the 1040-X, but they  have not done so because the technology would need to be  developed to check the amended data against what was originally  filed.  \uf0b7  Form 1040-NR, \u201cU.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return.\u201d About  621,000 taxpayers submitted a Form 1040-NR in 2010.

Regarding our recommendation on the  relative costs and benefits of transcribing different individual lines of tax  return data, IRS stated that it has determined the relative costs of  transcribing individual lines. To fully address this recommendation,  however, IRS should also quantify the benefits of transcribing individual  lines and compare them to the individual costs. This analysis could inform  budget decisions by allowing IRS to compare the option of additional  transcription against any work foregone. Regarding our recommendation  to develop and prioritize a list of forms that still need to be added to MeF,  IRS outlined the next three releases scheduled for MeF (through filing  season 2014). While IRS has a list of forms it plans to transfer from EMS  to MeF, there are still some forms that cannot be e-filed on either system.

For example, if 10,000 taxpayers submit paper returns  that include a given form, the paper volume of that form is 10,000.  Paper volume is related to the total volume of the form and the e-file  rate of the form:  Paper volume = # taxpayers who submit the form \u00d7 (1 \u2013 e-file rate of form)  \uf0b7  E-file rates vary significantly for different forms, as shown in figure 6;  for example, 78 percent of Form 8863s were e-filed for tax year 2009,  compared to 55 percent of Schedule C\u2019s.  \uf0b7  Number of taxpayers who submit the form varies significantly for  different forms, from under 10,000 to over 50 million.  \uf0b7  Occurrence rate of the line is the rate at which the line is filled in.", "Some lines are left blank most of the time, while others are filled in  more often or always.
