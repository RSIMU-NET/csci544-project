For 3 other programs, while the programs themselves would likely not change under statehood, eligibility determinations for these programs could be affected indirectly by changes that could occur to benefits in other programs. Statehood would not likely affect the 15 remaining programs. See figure below.", "The extent to which federal spending would change for some of the programs affected by Puerto Rico statehood depends on various assumptions: these assumptions include the program eligibility options Puerto Rico might select or the rates at which eligible residents might participate in the programs. For example, for the four largest programs for which federal spending likely would change under statehood\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\u2014GAO used various assumptions to estimate the range of potential effects on federal program spending. The estimated ranges for the four programs, as described below, are based on Puerto Rico being treated the same as the states in either 2010 or 2011, based on the year for which GAO had the most recent data.", "Medicare: In fiscal year 2010, actual federal Medicare spending in Puerto Rico was $4.5 billion; if Puerto Rico had been a state in calendar year 2010, estimated federal spending would have ranged from $4.5 billion to $6.0 billion. The Medicare estimates take into account certain changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act occurring after 2010 that would reduce spending. Also, the Medicare estimates depend on the estimates for Medicaid, as some individuals are eligible for both programs.", "Medicaid: In fiscal year 2011, actual federal Medicaid spending in Puerto Rico was $685 million; if Puerto Rico had been a state in calendar year 2011, estimated federal spending would have ranged from $1.1 billion to $2.1 billion. The Medicaid estimates do not take into account the cost of nursing home and home health services in Puerto Rico due to the lack of available cost data, and because Puerto Rico lacks an infrastructure of nursing home facilities, according to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services officials. If these services became available, Medicaid spending would likely increase.", "SNAP: In fiscal year 2011, actual federal spending for a similar program in Puerto Rico was $1.9 billion; if Puerto Rico had been a state in calendar year 2011, residents would have been eligible for SNAP, and estimated federal spending would have ranged from $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion. One reason why the low end of the estimate range is less than actual spending is because participants' benefits would be reduced because of benefits received from SSI, for which Puerto Rico residents would newly qualify.", "SSI: In fiscal year 2011, actual federal spending for a similar program in Puerto Rico was $24 million; if Puerto Rico had been a state in calendar year 2011, residents would have been eligible for SSI, and estimated federal spending would have ranged from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.", "All the federal revenue sources GAO reviewed\u2014individual and corporate income taxes, employment tax, excise tax, estate and gift taxes, and customs duties\u2014could be affected if Puerto Rico became a state. For example, under statehood, Puerto Rico residents would be subject to federal tax on all their income: currently, they are subject to federal tax only on income from sources outside of Puerto Rico. Also, some sources of income, such as pension income, are taxed differently in Puerto Rico than in the states. As a result, for 2010, Puerto Rico filers' adjusted gross income for federal tax purposes would have been higher than that for Puerto Rico tax purposes. For some revenue sources, the extent to which federal revenue would change depends on various assumptions. For example, for the two largest revenue sources that would be affected substantially by statehood\u2014individual and corporate income taxes\u2014GAO used various assumptions to estimate a range of federal revenue. The estimate ranges, as described below, are based on Puerto Rico being treated the same as the states in either 2009 or 2010, based on the year for which GAO had the most recent data.", "Individual income tax: In 2010, Puerto Rico taxpayers reported paying $20 million to the United States, its possessions, or foreign countries. According to officials from Puerto Rico's Department of Internal Revenue, most of these payments would have been to the United States. If Puerto Rico had been a state in 2010, estimated individual income tax revenue from Puerto Rico taxpayers would have ranged from $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion (after accounting for estimated payments in excess of tax liability from refundable tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit).", "Corporate income tax: In 2009, U.S. corporations paid about an estimated $4.3 billion in tax on income from their affiliates in Puerto Rico. Most of this amount was from an unusually large amount of dividends repatriated from Puerto Rico (compared to amounts repatriated in earlier years or in 2010). Absent that spike in dividends, the federal taxes these corporations would have paid for 2009 would have been about $1.4 billion. If Puerto Rico had been a state in 2009, estimated corporate income tax revenue from businesses that filed a Puerto Rico tax return for that year (or their parent corporations in the United States) would have ranged from $5.0 to $9.3 billion. The low end of this range assumes that U.S. corporations would have used prior-year losses of affiliated Puerto Rico corporations to offset their federal taxable income to the maximum extent (leaving only smaller or newly generated losses available to offset income in subsequent years), among other assumptions. However, this range does not take into account any behavioral changes of businesses with activities in Puerto Rico. For example, according to tax policy experts at the Department of the Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation, changes in federal income tax requirements under statehood would likely motivate some corporations with substantial amounts of income derived from intangible (and therefore mobile) assets to relocate from Puerto Rico to lower tax foreign locations. The extent to which such corporations might relocate from Puerto Rico is unknown. Consequently, GAO produced an alternative set of revenue estimates to account for some businesses with activities in Puerto Rico potentially relocating under statehood: this range was -$0.1 billion to $3.4 billion. The low end of this range is negative because U.S. corporations would have used their Puerto Rico affiliates' prior-year losses to reduce their taxes to such an extent that they would have more than offset the positive tax amounts that other corporations continuing to operate in Puerto Rico under statehood would have paid.", "Puerto Rico faces various economic and fiscal challenges that could potentially impact changes in federal spending and revenue under statehood. For example, its economy largely has been in recession since 2006, and its levels of employment and labor force participation are relatively low, compared to those of the states. Persistent deficits have resulted in an increase in Puerto Rico's public debt, which represents a much larger share of personal income than in any state (and in February 2014, Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative\u2014noninvestment\u2014grade by three ratings agencies). Puerto Rico has taken recent steps to improve its fiscal position, such as reducing its government workforce and reforming its largest public employee retirement system. Changes in federal program spending and to federal tax law under statehood could lead to economic and fiscal changes of their own in Puerto Rico. That may have a cascading effect on federal spending and revenue levels. However, the precise nature of such changes is uncertain. Because statehood would cause numerous adjustments important to Puerto Rico's future, it would require careful consideration by Congress and the residents of Puerto Rico. Consequently, statehood's aggregate fiscal impact would be influenced greatly by the terms of admission, strategies to promote economic development, and decisions regarding Puerto Rico's government revenue structure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations.

Our individual income tax revenue estimates take these  differences into account, as they are based on the federal filing thresholds  and federal tax rates. That is to say, we were able to determine which  Puerto Rico residents who filed a Puerto Rico tax return for 2010 would  have met federal filing thresholds and what tax rates would have applied  to their taxable income, if at all. The Governor also noted that Puerto Rico  does not tax Social Security benefits, which may be taxable at the federal  level. In the individual income tax section of appendix III to this report, we  note that because Social Security benefits are not included on Puerto  Rico tax returns, our estimates do not take taxable Social Security  benefits into account, and as a result our estimates could understate  individual income tax revenue.", "In response to our estimate for corporate income tax revenue, the  Governor noted that to counter the effect of increased taxes on Puerto  Rico businesses upon the imposition of federal taxes, our draft report  suggested that Puerto Rico would reduce its corporate tax rate to 3.8  percent to be on par with the average corporate tax rate in the states  (state taxes are deductable against corporate income for federal tax  purposes). He noted that this assumption is unrealistic given Puerto  Rico\u2019s current level of corporate tax rates and Puerto Rico\u2019s current fiscal  situation.

However, one possibility is that it would reduce its  income tax rates to be more in line with those from other states. Puerto  Rico\u2019s equivalent of a state income tax rate is relevant to estimates of  aggregate tax liability and refundable credit payments because some  filers would be able to deduct state and local taxes paid on their federal  returns. Accordingly, we developed an alternate scenario for estimating  aggregate tax liability and refundable credit payments based on Puerto  Rico reducing its income tax rates. Under this alternative scenario, we  imputed amounts for the deduction for state and local taxes paid (using  reported data from IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income program for 2010) based on  the national average deduction as a percentage of adjusted gross income  (3.3 percent).", "To determine the amount of federal income tax that Puerto Rico residents  actually paid for 2010, we used data reported on Puerto Rico tax returns.  We used these data because, although IRS publishes data on taxes  collected by state (and for Puerto Rico) the amounts for individual and  employment taxes are combined. According to IRS officials, the agency  cannot separate the amounts for these two types of taxes at the state  level. Instead, we used information reported on the Puerto Rico tax  returns as a proxy for the amount of federal income tax paid. Puerto Rico  allows a credit for taxes paid to the United States, its possessions, and  foreign countries. According to officials from Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of  Internal Revenue, most of these taxes would have been paid to the  United States.

Likewise, officials from Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Internal Revenue told  us that the data would not provide sufficient or reliable information on the  country of incorporation for any of the filing businesses or for their parent  corporations. Consequently, we made a range of assumptions regarding  the percentage of the filing entities\u2019 income attributable to either (1)  branches or subsidiaries that would have been included in the  consolidated federal corporate income tax return of a U.S. corporation, or  (2) corporations that would have been taxed as separate entities under  statehood.

As a result, we needed to estimate these amounts, because they  represent an important deduction under the federal corporate income tax.  As with the individual income tax, Puerto Rico\u2019s corporate income tax  rates are relatively high compared to those in the states. For example,  Puerto Rico\u2019s highest marginal tax rate in 2010 for regular corporations  was 19 percent; the highest corporate tax rate in the states in 2010 was  12 percent (Iowa).

Consequently, we assumed that under  statehood, the effective rate of Puerto Rico\u2019s income tax would be similar  to the average effective rate for income taxes levied in the states (the rate  for profitable corporations was 3.8 percent of net income; for corporations  with losses it was -1.0 percent).estimate this average rate for the states.", "We used data compiled by IRS to  We also needed to make assumptions regarding which federal tax rates  would have applied to these entities\u2019 net income under statehood.

For  these corporations, the applicable rate of tax depended not only on the  Puerto Rico entities\u2019 net income, but also on the income and losses of  other group members, and on the credits earned by the group as a whole.  For these entities, we applied the marginal federal tax rate for the  consolidated group to the net income (or losses) that the Puerto Rico  entity would have added to the group\u2019s tax return. For entities in the  financial services and social services industries, we applied the full 35  percent corporate marginal tax rate based on the assumption that these  entities would not have qualified for the domestic production activities  deduction. For all other corporations, we reduced the marginal rate to  31.85 percent to reflect the effect of this deduction.", "We estimated tax liabilities both before and after applying prior-year  losses to offset income from 2009. We did so because the initial effect  that these prior-year losses would have had on tax revenue may not have  been representative of their effects over a longer time period. In the first  year of statehood, when Puerto Rico subsidiaries of U.S. corporations  first become subject to federal tax and are consolidated into their parent  corporations\u2019 tax returns, large portions of their losses could be used to  offset the taxable income reported on those returns, leaving only smaller  amounts (or newly generated losses) available to offset income in  subsequent years.", "We also made assumptions to account for the potential relocation, under  statehood, of businesses with activities in Puerto Rico. Tax experts at the  U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation  suggested that the changes in tax treatment that would occur under  statehood likely would motivate some businesses to move their  operations from Puerto Rico to lower-tax foreign locations\u2014particularly  those with substantial amounts of income derived from intangible (and  therefore mobile) assets. For 2009, exempt corporations in the  pharmaceutical and the medical equipment and supplies industries  accounted for over 70 percent of the net income (and about 20 percent of  accumulated losses) of the full population of exempt corporations. In  addition, other industries with potential income from intangible assets  accounted for significant shares of total net income.", "Using the other assumptions described above, we produced an  alternative set of estimates to account for the potential relocation, under  statehood, of businesses with activities in Puerto Rico.
