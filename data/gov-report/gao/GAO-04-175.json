Multilateral export control regimes have expanded their lists of controlled technologies, but key countries of concern are not members. U.S. export control authorities find it increasingly difficult to limit or track unlisted dual-use items that can be acquired without an export license. Moreover, a gap in U.S. export control authority enables American companies to export certain dual-use items to recipients that are not associated with missile projects or countries listed in the regulations, even if the exporter knows the items might be used to develop cruise missiles or UAVs. American companies have in fact legally exported dualuse items with no U.S. government review to a New Zealand resident who bought the items to build a cruise missile. The U.S. government seldom uses its end-use monitoring programs to verify compliance with conditions placed on the use of cruise missile, UAV, or related technology exports. For example, State officials do not monitor exports to verify compliance with license conditions on missiles or other items, despite legal and regulatory requirements to do so. Defense has not used its end-use monitoring program initiated in 2002 to check the compliance of users of more than 500 cruise missiles exported between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. Commerce conducted visits to assess the end use of items for about 1 percent of the 2,490 missile-related licenses we reviewed.

A cruise missile is an unmanned aerial vehicle with  the airframe designed for one-time use, which travels through the air like  an airplane before delivering its payload. The U.S. government faces trade- offs when making decisions about transfers of cruise missiles, UAVs, or  related technology. U.S. policy aims to prevent the proliferation of these  weapons systems to countries of concern and terrorists. At the same time,  the U.S. government has an interest in encouraging transfers of cruise  missiles and UAVs to U.S. allies to support regional security and bilateral  relations. The U.S. government also wants to use these sales to help  maintain the health of the U.S. defense industrial base. To accomplish  these goals, the U.S. government regulates the export of cruise missiles,  UAVs, or related technology through three agencies: the Departments of  State, Commerce, and Defense.", "You asked us to assess U.S. and international efforts to limit the  proliferation of cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and related  technology.

The technology for the engine, the autopilot, and the airframe  could be similar for both cruise missiles and UAVs, according to a 2000  U.S. government study of cruise missiles. Figure 1 shows the major  components of a cruise missile.", "Cruise missiles provide a number of military capabilities. For example,  they present significant challenges for air and missile defenses. Cruise  missiles can fly at low altitudes to stay below radar and, in some cases,  hide behind terrain features. Newer missiles are incorporating stealth  features to make them less visible to radars and infrared detectors.  Modern cruise missiles can also be programmed to approach and attack a  target in the most efficient manner. For example, multiple missiles can  attack instantaneously from different directions. Furthermore, land attack  cruise missiles may fly circuitous routes to get to their targets, thereby  avoiding radar and air defense installations.", "UAVs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, propeller-driven or jet  propelled, and can be straight-wing aircraft or have tilt-rotors like  helicopters.

Regime members agree to restrict such  trade through their national laws and regulations, which set up systems to  license the exports of sensitive items. The four principal regimes are the  MTCR; the Wassenaar Arrangement, which focuses on trade in  conventional weapons and related items with both civilian and military  (dual-use) applications; the Australia Group, which focuses on chemical  and biological technologies; and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which  focuses on nuclear technologies. The United States is a member of all four  regimes. Regime members conduct a number of activities in support of the  regimes, including (1) sharing information about each others\u2019 export  licensing decisions, including certain export denials and, in some cases,  approvals and (2) adopting common export control practices and control  lists of sensitive equipment and technology into national laws or  regulations.", "Exports of commercially supplied American-made cruise missiles, military  UAVs, and related technology are transferred pursuant to the Arms Export  Control Act, as amended, and the International Trafficking in Arms  Regulations, implemented by State.

According to an unclassified  summary of a national intelligence estimate from December 2001, several  countries are technically capable of developing a missile launch  mechanism to station on forward-based ships or other platforms so that  they can launch land-attack cruise missiles against the United States.  Technically, cruise missiles can be launched from fighter, bomber, or even  commercial transport aircraft outside U.S. airspace. According to the  National Air Intelligence Center, defending against land attack cruise  missiles will strain air defense systems.

Thus, less capable and expensive systems  could be more easily improved to attack targets not currently accessible,  especially on land. Although not all cruise missiles can be modified into  land-attack cruise missiles because of technical barriers, specific cruise  missiles can and have been.

MTCR control lists  were revised between 1997 and 2002 to adopt six of eight U.S. proposals to  include additional items related to cruise and UAV technologies.

The growing capability of nonmember supplier countries to develop  technologies used for WMD and trade them with other countries of  proliferation concern undermines the regimes\u2019 ability to impede  proliferation. For example, China has sold anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran  and Iraq (see fig. 3). Israel also reportedly sold the Harpy UAV to India,  according to a Director of Central Intelligence report in 2003.", "In addition to the limitations posed by non-member suppliers, some  nonproliferation experts and foreign government officials noted that  MTCR\u2019s effectiveness has been limited because there has been less  consensus among MTCR and Wassenaar members to restrict cruise  missiles and UAVs than to restrict ballistic missiles. MTCR members have  not always agreed with each others\u2019 interpretation of the MTCR guidelines  and control lists concerning cruise missiles. Specifically, members have  had different views on how to measure the range and payload of cruise  missiles and UAVs, making it difficult to determine when a system has the  technical characteristics that require more stringent export controls to  apply under MTCR guidelines. For example, cruise missiles can take  advantage of more fuel-efficient flight at higher altitudes to gain  substantially longer ranges than manufacturers and exporting countries  advertise. Even with the new definition of range that the MTCR adopted in  2002, different interpretations remain among members over whether  particular cruise missiles could be modified to achieve greater range. In  one case, the United States and France disagreed about France\u2019s proposed  sale of its Black Shaheen cruise missile to the United Arab Emirates,  according to French and U.S. government officials and nonproliferation  experts (see fig. 4). In a second case, members have raised questions  about Russia\u2019s assistance to India, a nonmember, to develop the Brahmos  cruise missile project and called for further discussion of the system\u2019s  technical capabilities.", "In October 2002, we reported on other limitations that impede the ability  of the multilateral export control regimes, including MTCR and the  Wassenaar Arrangement, to achieve their nonproliferation goals. For  example, we found that MTCR members may not share complete and  timely information, such as members\u2019 denied export licenses, in part  because the regime lacks an electronic data system to send and retrieve  such information. The Wassenaar Arrangement members share export  license approval information but collect and aggregate it to a degree that it  cannot be used constructively. Both MTCR and the Wassenaar  Arrangement use a consensus process that makes decision-making  difficult and lack a means to enforce compliance with members\u2019 political  commitments to regime principles. We recommended that the Secretary of  State establish a strategy to work with other regime members to enhance  the effectiveness of the regimes by implementing a number of steps,  including (1) adopting an automated information-sharing system in MTCR  to facilitate more timely information exchanges, (2) sharing greater and  more detailed information on approved exports of sensitive transfers to  nonmember countries, (3) assessing alternative processes for reaching  decisions, and (4) evaluating means for encouraging greater adherence to  regime commitments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Authorities Have Had Difficulty Restricting Dual- use Missile Technology Exports", "paragraphs": ["U.S. ICE and Commerce authorities have had difficulty identifying and  tracking dual-use exports in transit that could be useful for cruise missiles  and UAV development because such exports have legitimate civilian uses.

Since this technology is already widely available throughout  the world, the United States works in concert with other countries through  multilateral export control regimes to better control the sale of cruise  missiles, UAVs, and related technologies. Even though the effectiveness of  these regimes is limited in what they can accomplish, the United States  could achieve additional success in this area by adopting our previous  recommendations to improve the regimes\u2019 effectiveness.", "U.S. export controls may not be sufficient to prevent cruise missile and  UAV proliferation and ensure compliance with license conditions. Because  some key dual-use components can be acquired without an export license,  it is difficult for the export control system to limit or even track their use.  Moreover, current U.S. export controls may not prevent proliferation by  nonstate actors, such as certain terrorists, who operate in countries that  are not currently restricted under missile proliferation regulations.  Furthermore, the U.S. government seldom uses its end-use monitoring  programs to verify compliance with the conditions placed on items that  could be used to develop cruise missiles or UAVs. Thus, the U.S.  government does not have sufficient information to know whether  recipients of these exports are effectively safeguarding equipment and  technology in ways that protect U.S. national security and nonproliferation  interests.

It stated that  our report is ambiguous as to whether the gap relates to items listed on the  control list or to items that are not listed, as they are not considered as  sensitive for missile proliferation reasons. Commerce also stated that we  should explain the basis for suggesting that noncontrolled items are  sensitive and should be placed on the MTCR control list, if that is our  position.

We also  agree that they augment controls and checks used during the licensing  process to determine the legitimacy of the parties involved and the  appropriate end use of the export prior to license approval. However, such  checks cannot confirm the appropriate end user or end use of an item  after it has been shipped and received by the recipient. Regarding other  tools in the export licensing process to verify conditions, we asked State  for additional information that would indicate what other actions, besides  PSV checks, State took.

DOD suggested that a random sample of cases could  achieve results equivalent to that of a comprehensive assessment. It  agreed to conduct a greater number of PSVs in order to (1) provide the  U.S. government with a high level of confidence over time that exporters  and end users are complying with export license conditions and (2) allow  the U.S. government to determine whether adequate resources are devoted  to license compliance issues. We clarified our recommendation so that a  comprehensive assessment could include a sampling methodology so long  as it provided each agency with a high level of confidence that the sample  selected accurately demonstrated the nature and extent of compliance  with conditions.

We believe that our explanation was clear as to how we applied  Commerce\u2019s guidance to select licenses that met Commerce\u2019s listed  criteria for receiving a PSV. As clearly noted in our report, we first  started with the 2,490 dual-use licenses with commodity categories  that Commerce had identified as relevant to cruise missile and UAV  items. Second, we selected those licenses having only commodity  categories identified in Commerce guidance as chokepoint  technologies. Third, we matched these licenses to a recipient country  identified as a country of missile proliferation concern or as a conduit  country. This analysis resulted in 20 licenses. When we found that two  of the 20 licenses we identified had been selected for a PSV, we asked  Commerce officials to explain which of the other variables  (information about the parties to the transaction, proposed end use,  previous licensing history, etc.) mitigated the need for a PSV. As we  reported, Commerce officials could not explain which factors lessened  the need for a PSV for the remaining 18 licenses.  5.  Commerce stated that there is ambiguity in our report as to whether  the gap relates to items listed on the Commerce Control List or to  items that are not listed because they are not considered as sensitive  for missile proliferation reasons. Our references to the gap in the  regulations refer to dual-use items that are not listed on the Commerce  Control List. We have made changes to the draft to clarify this point.  6.  Commerce stated that if it is GAO\u2019s position that noncontrolled items  are sensitive and should be placed on the MTCR control list, then we  should explain the basis for this position. We are not suggesting that  unlisted items should be added to the MTCR control list to deal with  the issue we identified in the New Zealand example. As indicated in  our recommendation, the vehicle to address this gap would be an  expansion of Commerce\u2019s catch-all provision whereby license reviews  would be required when the exporter knows or has reason to know  that items not on the Commerce Control List might be used by  nonstate actors for missile proliferation purposes.  7.  Commerce states that the United States and MTCR members  effectively control the items of greatest significance for cruise missiles  and UAVs that pose concerns for U.S. national security. We agree that  MTCR covers items of greatest significance for cruise missiles and  UAVs that pose concerns posed by national missile programs.  However, Commerce needs to recognize the potential for nonstate  actors, particularly terrorists, to legally acquire unlisted items for use  in missile proliferation.  8.  Commerce acknowledges that its enforcement authority is limited  concerning items not listed on the Commerce Control List and entities  not named on the terrorist lists. Nonetheless, it asserts that it could  take specific actions if it learned that U.S. items had been shipped to  proliferators or terrorists that were developing weapons with these  components. However, it is not clear how this information would come  to Commerce\u2019s attention because current regulations do not require, or  inform, an exporter to seek a license review in this type of situation.  9.  Commerce agrees to consider whether the catch-all provision  sufficiently protects U.S. national security interests. We agree that  such a review in consultation with the Technical Advisory Committees  and interagency community would be an important first step in  identifying the sufficiency of the provision to cover nonstate actors  and ways to modify it to address the gap. Consequently, we have  modified our recommendation accordingly.  10.  The gap that we identified in our report is in the catch-all provisions.", "We are not suggesting that additional items be added to the control  lists. Currently, the catch-all regulations require an exporter to submit  a license application when he knows or has reason to know that an  unlisted item would be used for missile proliferation purposes.  However, this provision applies only to specific missile proliferation  projects or countries identified on a narrow list in the regulations. The  New Zealand citizen was not covered under the catch-all provisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State letter  dated November 19, 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  State said that it has conducted over 1,200 Blue Lantern checks on  exports of all types and developed derogatory information in almost  200 cases over the past 3 years. However, these checks and cases  involved both pre-license checks and PSVs and included more than  cruise missile or UAV items, according to State\u2019s most recent end-use  monitoring report. For example, 428 checks initiated by State in fiscal  year 2002\u2014of which 50 checks resulted in unfavorable  determinations\u2014included firearms and ammunition, electronics and  communications equipment, aircraft spare parts, bombs, spare parts  for tanks and military vehicles, and night vision equipment.  2.  State also said that the Blue Lantern program (1) effectively verifies  the end use and end users of export applications when questions arise,  (2) has deterred diversions, (3) helped disrupt illicit supply networks,  (4) helped State make informed licensing decisions, and (5) ensured  exporter compliance with law and regulations. State added that the  historical context of assessing the parties to the export weighs into  every licensing decision and its importance cannot be discounted. We  agree that the Blue Lantern program can have a positive impact when  State has the information needed to allow it to act. This statement  affirms our point that it is important to obtain such information  through improved monitoring, particularly PSVs. However, given the  limited number of either pre- or post-shipment Blue Lantern checks  focused to date on cruise missile and UAV-related transfers, we  question whether sufficient information has been obtained in this area.  3.  State said that it was unclear why our report\u2019s analysis excluded pre- license checks as part of State\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with  arms export regulations. As noted above, we did ask for such  information and learned that State conducted few pre-license checks  for its cruise missile and UAV transfers. While we agree with State that  pre-license checks are critical to providing assurances that licenses are  issued to legitimate, reliable entities and for specified programs or end  uses, they obviously cannot verify that exports are received by the  legitimate end user or used in accordance with the terms of the license  after shipment. We agree that seeking and receiving assurances prior  to licensing and shipment is a critical function that might mitigate the  need for a PSV check in many cases. However, State implies that pre- license and other actions of the licensing process mitigated the need to  conduct PSV checks for all but 4 of its 786 licenses for cruise missile,  UAV, or related technology. These included 129 licenses to non-MTCR  countries, such as Egypt, Israel, and India.  4.  State said that our report did not articulate the criteria we used to  determine what exports are UAV-related. State provided the criteria  we used to determine what State-licensed exports were cruise missile  or UAV-related. State officials queried their licensing database to  search for specific category codes and 12 keywords. The resulting  report that State provided to us contained 400 pages with 1,300 entries.  We have added this information to our Scope and Methodology section  to clarify that State provided us with these criteria, the data generated  from applying the criteria, and information on Blue Lantern pre-license  and PSV checks for these licenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Jeffrey D.
