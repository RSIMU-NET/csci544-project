Driving the Bureau's decision was its experience during the 1990 Census when it released separate counts of people found at shelters, on the street, and similar locations that proved to be incomplete. The Bureau also tried to ensure that the Service-Based Enumeration figures could not be used as a \"homeless\" count, because it was not designed to provide a specific count of the homeless. Instead, the operation was part of a larger effort to count people without conventional housing. In January 2001, the Bureau changed its earlier decision because a statistical procedure used to refine the emergency and transitional shelter data proved to be unreliable, which lowered the quality of the data. In response, the Bureau combined the shelter data with a category called \"other non-institutional group quarters,\" a category that also includes data on people enumerated in several other group locations such as facilities for victims of natural disasters. In the fall of 2001, the Bureau produced a heavily qualified special report on the shelter data. A key cause of the Bureau's shifting position on reporting these data appears to be its lack of well documented, transparent, clearly defined, and consistently applied guidelines on the minimum quality necessary for releasing data. Had these guidelines been in place at the time of the census, the Bureau could have been better positioned to make an objective decision on releasing these figures. Additionally, the Bureau could have used the guidance to explain to data users the reasons for the decision, eliminating any appearance of censorship and arbitrariness.

Service-Based Enumeration also counted people in targeted  nonsheltered outdoor locations such as encampments beneath bridges.   The operation occurred from March 27 through March 29, 2000.", "According to Bureau officials, Service-Based Enumeration was not  designed, and was never intended, to provide a specific count of homeless  persons.

Service-Based  Enumeration counted people in specific categories of noninstitutional  group quarters.", "To help ensure a complete count of people without conventional housing,  the Bureau partnered with local governments and community advocacy  groups to obtain lists of service locations and to assist with the  enumeration.  In some cases, the Bureau hired clients of the advocacy  groups and other people trusted by the homeless to conduct Service-Based  Enumeration.  For example in Atlanta, an advocacy group for homeless  veterans helped the Bureau employ homeless veterans to improve the  count of this population.  Local governments helped the Bureau as well,  often investing considerable resources.

The Service-Based  Enumeration operation took place a year later, in March 2000.  The April  1999 plan was in large part a reaction to the challenges the Bureau faced  counting the emergency shelter and street population during the 1990  Census.  Although the Bureau disseminated separate counts of people  found at emergency shelters, preidentified street locations, and similar  sites, the counts proved to be incomplete.  Moreover, the Bureau stated in  its October 2001 report that despite its warnings to the contrary, the data  were sometimes misinterpreted as a \u201chomeless\u201d count.", "The October report does not offer an example of this, but the  misinterpretation clearly played a role in a lawsuit against the Bureau.

The Bureau\u2019s decision was contained  in an internal Bureau memorandum from the Chief of the Population  Division to the Chief of the Decennial Systems and Contracts Management  Office.  Bureau officials told us that the decision to exclude a separate  emergency and transitional shelter count in SF-1 was made between  December 2000 and January 2001, by the Director of the Decennial Census  with input from the Associate Director Decennial Census, the Population  Division, the Associate Director for Demographic Programs, the Decennial  Management Division, and the Decennial Statistical Studies Division.", "According to Bureau officials, their concerns focused on the accuracy of a  new statistical procedure called \u201cmultiplicity estimation\u201d that adjusted the  number counted to better reflect the number of actual shelter users.   Because Service-Based Enumeration only counted people who were at  these facilities on the day of enumeration, the Bureau intended to use  multiplicity estimation to calculate the number of people who used these  facilities but were not present during Service-Based Enumeration.  The  multiplicity estimation procedure was based on information from those  who were counted and on the number of times they used the service  facilities in the prior week.  An estimate of people not counted on the day  of enumeration was added to the count of people who were.  According to  the Bureau, the multiplicity estimates tested well during the 1998 dress  rehearsal for the 2000 Census possibly because the three rehearsal sites did  not offer large enough sample sizes of the appropriate populations to  adequately test this procedure.  However, during the 2000 Census the  Bureau found that a census question pertaining to facility usage upon  which the multiplicity estimates were based had a low response rate.   Moreover, the Bureau found that respondents, particularly in shelters, did  not answer the question accurately.  Due to data quality concerns, the  Bureau decided not to use multiplicity estimation to adjust the data and  consequently decided not to report the data separately.", "Bureau officials said they did not announce the change in plans because  they were still evaluating the problems with the data.  It was not until June  2000 that the Bureau began recalculating the data and making a final  decision on which categories to aggregate.  Ultimately, the Bureau did not  report any of the Service-Based Enumeration data separately in SF-1.

In a  briefing for staff of the House Committee on Governmental Affairs, the  Associate Director of the Decennial Census announced that the Bureau  planned to produce a separate report on the emergency and transitional  shelter data.  In October 2001, the Bureau issued a special report, entitled  Emergency and Transitional Shelter Population: 2000.  This report  separately identified emergency and transitional shelter data for various  levels of geography down to the census tract level with 100 or more people  in emergency and transitional shelters.  The report did not include data for  the populations in targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations, soup kitchens,  regularly scheduled mobile food vans, and shelters for domestic violence.   The 17-page report contains an extensive discussion on the limitations of  the data.  For example, the Bureau noted that the data in the report should  not be construed as a count of people without conventional housing.   Moreover, the emergency and transitional shelter data at the census tract  level are not in the hard copy, but rather in the Internet version of the  report.  The Bureau stated that all Census 2000 data at the tract level are  available on the Internet and are not available in printed reports.", "The October report contains most of the same data that were to be released  under the April 1999 dissemination plan for SF-1.

The October 2001 report contained an  extended discussion of these limitations.", "The October 2001 report also identified reasons the Bureau did not (and  never planned to) separately release data on people counted at targeted  nonsheltered outdoor locations, soup kitchens, regularly scheduled mobile  food vans, and shelters for victims of domestic violence, including the  following.", "People without conventional housing who were at outside locations  other than the targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations identified for the  census were not included in the TNSOL operation.", "For the purposes of the TNSOL operation, the definition of \u201coutdoor\u201d  excluded both mobile and transient locations used by people  experiencing homelessness as well as abandoned buildings.", "The option was given to the individuals found at soup kitchens and  regularly scheduled mobile food vans to select \u201cusual home elsewhere.\u201d   For example, if an individual enumerated at a soup kitchen listed a usual  home elsewhere, then that person was tabulated at their usual residence  and not at the service location.  Therefore, the data on this population  would not reflect a true count of the individuals using these services.", "Prior to publicly releasing the October report, the Bureau asked two  representatives from the National Coalition for the Homeless to review a  draft of the portion of the report that described the limitations of the data.   The National Coalition for the Homeless commented extensively on the  section containing the caveats and limitations in order to strengthen the  report.  A member of the Board of Directors for the National Coalition for  the Homeless told us that he provided this feedback both as an  academician and a stakeholder.

For example, several organizations we contacted favored the separate  release of the Service-Based Enumeration data categories.  Indeed, local  government officials we talked to in New York City believed that the data  would help with grant applications, projections about future service needs,  and determining their success in getting people off the streets and into  shelters.  The Executive Director of the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the  Homeless stated that the city of Cleveland does not do its own count of this  population and, therefore, the Bureau numbers are the only ones available  on this segment of the population.  Los Angeles city officials wanted the  Service-Based Enumeration data so they could better target their services  and, like Cleveland, Los Angeles did not have its own data.  Several of these  entities stated that the potential misuse of data was not a valid reason for  not separately releasing data.", "In addition, the majority of the organizations we contacted partnered with  the Bureau anticipating that they would be able to use the Service-Based  Enumeration data to evaluate whether improvements were made in  enumerating local populations without conventional housing in 2000  compared to 1990.  The Assistant City Attorney of Los Angeles estimated  that Los Angeles spent about $300,000 on the effort to improve the count of  Los Angeles\u2019s people without conventional housing.  For example, as part  of an extensive effort to help the Bureau develop a list of targeted  nonsheltered outdoor locations, the city provided senior Bureau staff with  a helicopter tour over some outdoor locations where people without  conventional housing lived.   The Assistant City Attorney of Los Angeles  stated that she believed the city would get the targeted nonsheltered  outdoor locations data that they helped collect and wanted to review.  In  addition, because of the Bureau\u2019s focus on counting people at shelters, the  city kept shelters open on the night of the enumeration at its own expense  even though shelters in Los Angeles typically do not have many people  during warm weather.  Los Angeles expected to have detailed data to use to  evaluate the effectiveness of its resource allocation.", "However, the National Coalition for the Homeless and other advocates of  the homeless opposed the separate release of any of the Service-Based  Enumeration data.  They were concerned that these data could be misused  as a count of the homeless population and lead to flawed decision-making  by policymakers.", "Ultimately, the Bureau left a number of data users unsatisfied.  Those who  wanted the Service-Based Enumeration categories released separately did  not feel the Bureau met their expectations with the data released in SF-1 or  with the release of the October report.  Users who opposed the separate  release of the data and were pleased that SF-1 combined the Service-Based  Enumeration components with other data were displeased that the October  2001 report was released.", "The difficulties the Bureau experienced trying to reconcile the competing  needs and interests of data users illustrates the importance of effective  communication between the Bureau and its key data users and partners to  ensure no expectation gaps develop.  More than just a good business  practice, federal internal control standards require agencies to have  effective external communications with groups that can have a serious  impact on programs, projects, operations, and other activities.", "However, our conversations with several Bureau partners and our review  of Bureau documents suggest that communications were sometimes vague  and insufficient.  For example, although the April 1999 memorandum that  outlined the Bureau\u2019s initial data dissemination plans was written a year  before the 2000 Census, this information may not have been effectively  communicated to the Bureau\u2019s partners.  Indeed, at a Capitol Hill briefing  on this topic in June 2001, Bureau officials themselves acknowledged that  they did not do a good job of communicating on this issue.  Some of the  partners we spoke to indicated that had they known earlier about the  Bureau\u2019s plans to limit the release of Service-Based Enumeration data they  might have focused their resources on different census operations.   Further, our review of Bureau documents indicated that the information on  the \u201cofficial plan\u201d for the release of the different Service-Based  Enumeration categories of data was limited and inconsistent.  Some  partners stated that they did not know that the Bureau never intended to  report the targeted nonsheltered outdoor location data.", "Although the Bureau made numerous presentations on Service-Based  Enumeration that emphasized there would be no count of the homeless,  the Bureau provided little detail on how components of Service-Based  Enumeration would actually be presented.  In the absence of clear  communication from the Bureau, partners developed their own  expectations of what would be released.  Several of the local officials and  advocates that we spoke to expected that the data would be released in the  same detail as it was in 1990, because they were not told otherwise.  For  example, a Los Angeles government official said that the Bureau stated it  would not provide a homeless count in 1990, but it still released the street  count data separately.
