(2) How much did the judiciary spend on all conferences over $100,000 for its employees in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, and to what extent did selected conferences conform to judiciary policy on conferences? GAO analyzed judges' NCR travel data from fiscal years 2003 through 2014, reviewed procedures for collection of NCR travel information, and interviewed judiciary officials.

These NCR travel costs averaged $8.8 million per year. However, while the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) tracks the costs of all official travel in its accounting systems of record, the NCR system does not collect specific information on the direct costs to the federal judiciary for judges' NCR travel. GAO found that AOUSC's data collection system for judges' NCR travel information lacked controls to standardize responses to accurately record whether NCR travel was paid for by a court or judicial agency versus other federal agencies or private entities. As a result of these limitations in the NCR travel data, GAO was not able to determine the extent to which those reported costs were paid using judiciary funds rather than other federal or private sources. According to AOUSC officials, as of November 2015, AOUSC has not decided to change the way the Judges' Non-Case-Related Travel Reporting System collects judges' NCR travel information, but is considering making improvements to the system to better collect judges' NCR travel information, including collecting the judiciary's costs of judges' NCR travel. According to the 2015 Strategic Plan for the Federal Judiciary, the judiciary must provide Congress timely and accurate information about issues affecting the administration of justice. By improving the system, AOUSC officials would be able to better collect required NCR travel information from judges and identify and report the judiciary's costs for judges' NCR travel in response to future congressional member requests.", "The judiciary spent $11.5 million on 61 conferences costing over $100,000 in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. AOUSC began collecting information on judiciary conference spending across all courts and judicial agencies in fiscal year 2013 for conferences costing over $100,000. This information was used to develop publically available reports and indicated the judiciary spent $4.6 million in fiscal year 2013 and $6.9 million in fiscal year 2014 for conferences costing over $100,000.", "The judiciary followed its policies for conference planning and administration. GAO sampled 8 conferences from the 61 conferences held in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 costing over $100,000 and determined the extent to which those conferences conformed to judiciary policy on conference planning and administration. GAO's results cannot be generalized to all conferences costing over $100,000 conducted by the judiciary, but do provide insight into the judiciary's compliance with its conference policies.

Further, as we reported in  November 2015, the judiciary has been affected by mandatory  sequestration cuts to its budget in fiscal year 2013 by $346 million, or by  about 5 percent.

To  determine the reliability of judges\u2019 NCR travel data, we conducted data  testing, interviewed judiciary officials responsible for collecting and  maintaining the data, and reviewed related documentation such as user  guides.

To  determine the reliability of data included in these reports, we interviewed  judiciary officials responsible for developing the reports and reviewed  documentation such as instructions for tracking conference costs and  user manuals for financial systems. We found these data were sufficiently  reliable for our reporting purposes. To determine the extent to which  conferences conformed to judiciary policy, we reviewed judiciary policies  and relevant laws and statutes, and interviewed judiciary officials. We  also selected a sample of eight conferences costing over $100,000  conducted in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, including a random sample of  four circuit judicial conferences, and four other kinds of conferences  based on a non-generalizable sample considering factors such as cost  per person. For each sample conference, we interviewed judiciary  officials and reviewed supporting information, which included cost  comparisons, budget information, documentation of the rationale for the  conference site selection, lists of cost-saving actions, and documentation  for internal controls required in judiciary guidance for conference  oversight and approval by senior judiciary officials. To determine the  extent to which conference organizers considered various judiciary cost  and management practices, we analyzed written responses from  organizers of each conference about how they considered 40 different  cost and management factors suggested in the guidance, and whether  they had the documentation required by judiciary policy.
