Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that LPTA procedures are typically for requirements that are well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services with a minimal risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The figure shows the military departments' limited use of LPTA procedures for contracts for selected services.", "For the 7 contracts that GAO reviewed, contracting officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. Contracting officials also stated that LPTA was used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For example, the Navy used LPTA procedures to award a contract for commercially available monthly telephone maintenance services. In addition, the Air Force used LPTA procedures to award a contract for mail sorting and delivery. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to amend its regulations to require contracting officers to consider specific criteria when deciding to use LPTA procedures. DOD has not yet revised its regulations to implement Section 813. Nevertheless, for the 7 contracts GAO reviewed, contracting officials' considerations when choosing to use LPTA procedures were often consistent with most of these new criteria.

When awarding a  contract competitively, DOD has several source selection procedures it  can use to evaluate firms\u2019 proposals. For example, DOD may use a best  value, lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) process. In the LPTA  process, DOD awards the contract to the firm presenting the lowest  priced proposal that is technically acceptable, and no tradeoffs are  permitted. Alternatively, it can use a best value tradeoff process, in which  it can vary the relative importance of cost or price to other factors such as  technical capability or past performance in its solicitations to firms. In  these cases, DOD may award a contract to a firm presenting other than  the lowest-priced proposal if it determines that a higher-priced firm  provides a greater benefit to the department, and this greater benefit is  worth paying an additional cost.", "Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2017 calls for DOD to avoid using LPTA procedures when doing so  would deny DOD the benefits of making cost and technical tradeoffs in  the source selection process. To implement this policy, Section 813  requires that DOD revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement (DFARS) to allow the use of LPTA procedures only when  certain criteria are met. For example, one criterion is that contracting  officials must determine that no, or little, value would be gained from a  proposal exceeding the solicitation\u2019s minimum technical requirements.  The specific criteria are discussed in the background section of this  report.", "Section 813 also requires that LPTA procedures must be avoided to the  \u201cmaximum extent practicable\u201d in procurements of:  Information technology (IT) services, cybersecurity services, systems  engineering and technical assistance services, advanced electronic  testing, audit or audit readiness services, or other knowledge-based  professional services;", "Personal protective equipment, such as body armor; and", "Knowledge-based training or logistics services in contingency or other  operations outside the United States.", "Further, Section 813 included a provision that we report on the number of  instances where DOD used LPTA procedures for contracts exceeding  $10 million, as well as an explanation of how acquisition officials  considered the new criteria identified in Section 813. The objectives of  this report were to assess the (1) extent to which DOD used LPTA  procedures for contracts awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017 for  certain services and products identified in Section 813 valued at  $10 million and above, and (2) factors that contracting officials considered  when deciding to use LPTA procedures for these contracts. We selected  the first half of fiscal year 2017 because that was the most recent time  period for which data were available.", "To determine the extent to which DOD used LPTA source selection  procedures in the first half of fiscal year 2017, we used data from the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to  identify a population of contracts valued at $10 million or above that were  awarded between October 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 by the  Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. These military  departments represented almost 80 percent of DOD procurement  spending in fiscal year 2016, and collectively accounted for 781, or over  64 percent, of DOD\u2019s 1,212 new contracts reported in FPDS-NG with total  estimated values of $10 million or above awarded during the 6-month  period we reviewed. We determined that FPDS-NG was sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of identifying these contracts by tracing relevant  FPDS-NG data to the contracts we reviewed and related documents. We  identified a population of 781 new contract awards that were within the  scope of our review. Our scope includes stand-alone contracts and the  initial award of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, but  excludes subsequent orders issued under these contracts because  solicitation data is not readily available for orders. Our scope also  excluded blanket purchase agreements and basic ordering agreements.", "We focused our review on contracts for categories of products and  services that could include those listed in Section 813 of the fiscal year  2017 NDAA for which DOD should, to the maximum extent practicable,  avoid using LPTA source selection procedures. Through analysis of  FPDS-NG product and service code information, we identified the  following four categories which could contain such products or services:  Information technology and telecommunications;", "Support services, which include", "Ammunition and explosives, which include tactical sets that may  include personal protective equipment; and", "Clothing and individual equipment, which includes protective clothing  and personal armor (or in other words, personal protective  equipment).", "From the 781 contracts that were within the scope of our review, we  identified 147 contracts in one of these four categories. Fourteen of these  were in the ammunition category. We did not identify any contracts in the  clothing category. We reviewed descriptions of what was purchased  under these 14 awards and also requested that DOD identify any  contracts that included the purchase of personal protective equipment.  The Army, Navy, and Air Force confirmed that none of the 14 contracts in  the ammunition category included personal protective equipment. The  remaining 133 contracts identified were for services coded as IT or  support services, which include knowledge-based professional services.", "Because FPDS-NG does not identify the source selection procedure used  to award contracts, we provided contract numbers for these 133 contracts  to the Army, Navy, and Air Force and requested that these departments  identify contracts for which LPTA procedures were used, and provide  supporting documentation for that determination.", "Of the 133 contracts valued at $10 million and over, DOD officials  responded to us that 9 were awarded through LPTA source selection  procedures and 124 were not. To assess the accuracy of LPTA status  information provided by DOD, we reviewed 36 of the 75 unique  solicitations for the 124 contracts that DOD identified as non-LPTA. We  could not find information for 39 solicitations, likely because these  solicitations were no longer available through online portals, and so for  these solicitations, we could not verify the source selection method. For  the 36 solicitations we examined, we found that all had been properly  classified by DOD as non-LPTA. We excluded 2 of the 9 contracts  awarded through LPTA procedures from further study because those  awards were protested, resulting in 7 contracts awarded through LPTA  procedures that were included in our review for more detailed  assessment. Each of these 7 contracts was for IT or support services.", "To identify the factors contracting officials considered when deciding to  use LPTA procedures on these 7 contracts, we obtained and analyzed  relevant contract documents including the acquisition plan, solicitation,  and source selection decision memorandum. In addition, we interviewed  contracting officials for each of these 7 contracts. We also reviewed  applicable sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the  DFARS, and DOD\u2019s March 2016 Source Selection guide. Finally, we  assessed contract documents and interviewed contracting officials to  determine whether they were aware of the new policy of Section 813.  Because the criteria in Section 813 have not yet been incorporated into  the DFARS, we also determined the extent to which criteria similar to  those in Section 813 had been considered in the decision to use LPTA  procedures in the 7 procurements we examined.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 through  November 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

In such cases, DOD has determined that cost or price should  play a dominant role in the source selection. When using LPTA  procedures, DOD specifies its minimum requirements in the solicitation.  Firms submit their proposals and DOD determines which of the proposals  meet or exceed those requirements, no tradeoffs between cost or price  and non-cost factors (for example, technical capabilities or past  performance) are permitted, and the award is made based on the lowest  price technically acceptable proposal submitted to the government. Non- cost factors are rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis.", "By contrast, DOD may elect to use tradeoff procedures in acquisitions  where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is  required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these  instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source  selection process. Tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors allow  DOD to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The FAR requires  DOD to state in the solicitation whether all evaluation factors other than  cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than,  approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price.", "DOD\u2019s March 2016 Source Selection guide offers additional guidance  regarding the use of LPTA source selection procedures. The guidance is  mandatory for acquisitions conducted as part of a major system  acquisition program and all competitive FAR part 15 procurements with  an estimated value over $10 million. The guidance states that LPTA  procedures may be used in situations where there would not be any value  on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance  requirements. The guidance also states that such situations may include  acquisitions for well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or  services and where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal,  and when it has been determined there would be no need or value to pay  more for higher performance.", "Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 NDAA required that DOD revise the  DFARS to require that LPTA procedures only be used in situations when  the following six criteria are met.  1.  DOD can clearly describe the minimum requirements in terms of  performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to  determine acceptability of offers;  2.  DOD would realize no, or little, value from a proposal exceeding the  solicitation\u2019s minimum technical requirements;  3.  The proposed technical approaches can be evaluated with little or no  subjectivity as to the desirability of one versus the other;  4.  There is a high degree of certainty that a review of technical proposals  other than that of the lowest-price offeror would not identity factors  that could provide other benefits to the government;  5.  The contracting officer has included a justification for the use of LPTA  procedures in the contract file; and  6.  The lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs, including for operations  and support.", "Section 813 also established that implementing revisions to the DFARS  were to be completed within 120 days of enactment of the NDAA, but the  revisions had not been put in place as of October 2017.

In 2010, we found that, for 60 of the 88  contracts reviewed, DOD used a tradeoff process and weighted non-cost  factors as more important than price. In these cases, DOD was willing to  pay more when a firm demonstrated it understood complex technical  issues more thoroughly, could provide a needed good or service to meet  deadlines, or had a proven track record in successfully delivering  products or services of a similar nature. In addition, we determined that  when making tradeoff decisions, DOD selected a lower priced proposal  nearly as often as it selected a higher technically rated, but more costly,  proposal. In so doing, DOD chose not to pay more than $800 million in  proposed costs by selecting a lower priced offer over a higher technically  rated offer in 18 contracts. The majority of solicitations where non-cost  factors were equal to or less important than cost were for less complex  requirements. DOD faced several challenges when using best value  tradeoff procedures, including:  the difficulties in developing meaningful evaluation factors,  the additional time investment needed to conduct best value  procurements, and  the greater level of business judgment required of acquisition staff  when compared to other acquisition approaches.", "To help DOD effectively employ the best value tradeoff process, we  recommended that DOD develop training elements such as case studies  that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions.

For contracts with obligations over $25 million, DOD used LPTA source  selection procedures primarily to acquire commercial products such as  fuel, and we identified relatively few uses of LPTA to acquire higher dollar  services. For contracts with obligations over $1 million and under  $25 million, DOD used LPTA procedures an estimated 45 percent of the  time for a mix of products and services, including fuel, aircraft parts,  computer equipment, construction-related services, engineering support  services, and ship maintenance and repairs.

The acquisition plan  states that Afghan nationals can more freely move about the country  compared to U.S. personnel. Further, a contracting official stated that  it was determined that no additional value would be gained by paying  a premium for these services and that the lowest price was the best  choice. In addition, to mitigate risk of poor performance, one  requirement of the contract is to maintain a qualified workforce.  Officials stated that approximately 90 percent of personnel performing  on the previous contract are working on the current contract.", "The Air Force awarded three contracts for base operation support  services\u2014vehicle maintenance, airfield maintenance, fuel  management, and traffic management\u2014at an Air Force Reserve Base  and two Air Reserve Stations.

Additionally,  contracting officials stated that there is at least a decade of past  experience with these requirements, and, as a result, the  requirements are well known.", "The Air Force awarded a contract for centralized mail sorting services  in Germany. The contract consists of a 2-month phase-in period, a 2- month base period, four 1-year options, and one 8-month option, with  a total estimated value of approximately $21.5 million. The acquisition  plan for this requirement stated that a LPTA source selection  procedure was chosen because the requirement was well-defined and  not technically complex. For example, the acquisition plan noted that  there was more than a decade of historical data that helped define  and estimate the volume of mail that would need to be sorted.  Contracting officials reiterated that LPTA was used since the service  was well-defined, the risk of poor performance was low, and that it  was determined that additional trade-offs would not provide an  additional benefit to the taxpayer.", "The Army awarded an IDIQ contract to look for vulnerabilities in  software code. The contract, which was set aside for small  businesses, had a 5-year ordering period and an estimated ceiling  value of $17.1 million.

Army requirements officials stated that they  determined there was no additional value to be gained from additional  innovations in doing either task. Our review found some indication that  the requirement, however, might not have been clearly understood by  offerors. For example, the Army received 12 offers which ranged from  $800,177 to $46,680,003. The contracting officer attributed the range  of offers to the inexperience of some offerors with preparing proposals  or misunderstanding this type of requirement, and the two lowest  offers were determined to be technically unacceptable.", "The Navy awarded a contract to perform commercially available  monthly telephone maintenance, which includes preventive and  remedial maintenance on a specific brand of phone systems that  Navy locations in California use.

Most officials said they felt that it was possible to evaluate the  proposals they received with little subjectivity, although they had not  always explicitly made and documented this assessment. Officials for  two contracts stated, for example, that the threshold question of  technical acceptability for their contracts was whether the offering  firms possessed certain licenses or accreditation to perform services  on specific equipment or in specific locations. No subjectivity was  involved in this assessment; therefore, they viewed the question of  technical acceptability as essentially objective. However, because  they were not required to document this assessment, contract  documents did not provide evidence of an assessment of subjectivity.  4.  Officials for most of the contracts we reviewed stated they had  determined that a review of technical proposals other than that of the  lowest-price offeror would not identity factors that could provide other  benefits. In one case officials ultimately reviewed additional proposals,  which is allowed under current DOD source selection guidance.", "DOD\u2019s March 2016 source selection guidance does not require  contracting officers to consider the fifth and sixth criteria listed in Section  813.

Specifically, we found that:  5.  Although the files for all 7 contracts contained some record of the  choice of LPTA source selection procedures, files for 3 of the 7  contracts simply stated that LPTA procedures would be used and did  not include an explanation or justification for the choice. Only the  documents for the four Air Force contracts included some explanation  of the reasons for choosing LPTA source selection procedures. While  not required by DOD source selection guidance when our selected  contracts were approaching source selection, providing a justification  for using LPTA is one of the criteria that Section 813 requires DOD to  include among the revisions to the DFARS.  6.  None of the officials for our selected contracts had confirmed that the  lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs, which is one of the  criteria that Section 813 requires DOD to include among the revisions  to the DFARS.
