GAO's analysis of DHS's MD-715 reports showed that DHS generally relied on workforce data to identify 13 of 15 triggers, such as promotion and separation rates. According to EEOC, in addition to workforce data, agencies are to regularly consult a variety of sources, such as exit interviews, employee groups, and employee surveys, to identify triggers. Involving employees helps to incorporate insights about operations from a frontline perspective in determining where potential barriers exist. DHS does not consider employee input from such sources as employee groups, exit interviews, and employee surveys in conducting its MD-715 analysis. Data from the governmentwide employee survey and DHS's internal employee survey are available, but DHS does not use these data to identify triggers. By not considering employee input on DHS personnel policies and practices, DHS is missing opportunities to identify potential barriers. Once a trigger is revealed, agencies are to investigate and pinpoint actual barriers and their causes. In 2007, through its departmentwide barrier analysis, DHS identified four barriers: (1) overreliance on the Internet to recruit applicants, (2) overreliance on noncompetitive hiring authorities, (3) lack of recruitment initiatives that were directed at Hispanics in several components, and (4) nondiverse interview panels. GAO's analysis of DHS's 2007 and 2008 MD-715 reports showed that DHS has articulated planned activities to address identified barriers, has modified nearly all of its original target completion dates by a range of 12 to 21 months, and has not completed any planned activities; although officials reported completing other activities in fiscal year 2007 and 2008 associated with its EEO program. Nearly half of the planned activities involve collaboration between the civil rights and human capital offices. DHS said that it modified the dates because of staffing shortages. In order to ensure that agency programs are effectively and efficiently implemented, it is important for agencies to implement internal control activities, such as establishing and tracking implementation goals with timelines. This allows agencies to pinpoint performance shortfalls and gaps and suggest midcourse corrections. DHS has not developed project plans with milestones beyond what is included in its MD-715 report and its Human Capital Strategic Plan. These documents include only the anticipated outcomes and target completion dates, not the essential activities needed to achieve the outcome. Identifying the critical phases of each planned activity necessary to achieve the intended outcome with interim milestones could help DHS ensure that its efforts are moving forward and manage any needed midcourse corrections, while minimizing modification of target dates. DHS uses a variety of means to oversee and support components, including providing written feedback on draft reports to components that are required to prepare their own MD-715 reports, conducting program audits, and convening a council of EEO directors from each of the components."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since March 2003, when it was created from a disparate group of 22  agencies with multiple missions, values, and cultures, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) has faced enormous challenges related to  protecting the nation from terrorism while organizing its predecessor  agencies\u2014several with existing program and management challenges\u2014 into a coherent and integrated department. Because these challenges  could have serious consequences for the security of our country, we  designated DHS\u2019s implementation and transformation as a high-risk area in  2003. While progress has been made, DHS\u2019s implementation and  transformation remains on the high-risk list today.", "One key challenge DHS has faced is effectively and strategically managing  its large workforce (about 216,000 employees) to respond to current and  emerging 21st century issues. Strategic human capital management must  be the centerpiece of any serious change management strategy. The  federal government is faced with a workforce that is becoming  increasingly eligible for retirement. We have reported that it is important  for federal agencies, including DHS, to use available flexibilities to acquire,  develop, motivate, and retain talented individuals who reflect all segments  of society and our nation\u2019s diversity. While DHS overall has a low  proportion\u201420 percent\u2014of workers eligible to retire by 2012, attention to  strategic human capital management is still important as 50 percent or  more of its customs and border agents, who serve in a mission-critical  occupation, are eligible to retire by 2012. According to the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to attract, develop, and  retain a top-quality workforce, agencies must ensure that their workforces  are free of barriers to equal employment opportunity (EEO). Through  Management Directive (MD) 715, EEOC provides that as part of a model  EEO program, to prevent unlawful discrimination, federal agencies are to  identify barriers to EEO in the workplace, execute plans to eliminate  barriers, and report annually to EEOC.", "As agreed, we present our findings on (1) the extent to which DHS has  taken steps, according to its MD-715 reports, to identify barriers to EEO in  the workplace; (2) the extent to which DHS has taken steps to address  identified barriers and what progress has been reported; and (3) how DHS  oversees and supports component agencies in identifying and addressing  barriers. We reviewed DHS's MD-715 reports for fiscal years 2004 through  2008, and analyzed DHS\u2019s identified barriers and plans to address those  barriers obtained from its fiscal year 2007 and 2008 reports. Because it was  beyond the scope of this engagement, we did not evaluate the accuracy of  the data contained in the workforce data tables, the extent to which DHS  identified all potential barriers, or the extent to which plans to eliminate  barriers or activities would address identified barriers. In addition, we  reviewed DHS policies, guidance, directives, and diversity plans related to  identifying and addressing barriers; the 2008 Federal Human Capital  Survey (FHCS) results for DHS; and DHS\u2019s 2007 internal employee survey  results. We interviewed DHS officials from its Office of Civil Rights and  Civil Liberties (CRCL) and the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer  (OCHCO). We also reviewed MD-715 and EEOC instructions and guidance  on MD-715, and interviewed EEOC officials from its Office of Federal  Operations.

Figure 2 shows the barrier identification steps under MD-715.", "Our review of DHS\u2019s MD-715 reports for each of the fiscal years 2004  through 2007 showed that in 2004 DHS identified 14 triggers, which were  present in each subsequent year. According to DHS\u2019s MD-715 reports, DHS  identified 13 of the 14 triggers based on its analysis of participation rates  contained in the workforce data tables. The remaining trigger\u2014 incomplete accessibility studies on all facilities\u2014was identified based on  responses to the self-assessment checklist contained in the MD-715 form  and comments made at disability awareness training for managers. In  addition, in 2008, DHS identified one new trigger based on a joint  statement from EEOC, the Department of Justice, and the Department of  Labor related to heightened incidents of harassment, discrimination, and  violence in the workplace against individuals who are or are perceived to  be Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, or Sikh. Table 1 shows a  summary of DHS-identified triggers and the sources of information from  which they were identified.", "To identify triggers, agencies are to prepare and analyze workforce data  tables comparing participation rates to designated benchmarks (such as  representation in the civilian labor force (CLF) or the agency\u2019s total  workforce) by gender, race, ethnicity, or disability status in various  subsets of their workforces (such as by grade level or major occupations  and among new hires, separations, promotions, and career development  programs). According to EEOC\u2019s MD-715 instructions, participation rates  below a designated benchmark for a particular group are triggers. Along  with the workforce data tables, according to EEOC\u2019s MD-715 instructions,  agencies are to regularly consult additional sources of information to  identify areas where barriers may operate to exclude certain groups. Other  sources of information include, but are not limited to    EEO complaints and EEO-related grievances filed;    findings of discrimination on EEO complaints;     surveys of employees on workplace environment issues;     exit interview results;     surveys of human resource program staff, managers, EEO program staff,  counselors, investigators, and selective placement coordinators;   input from agency employee and advocacy groups and union officials;     available government reports (i.e., those of EEOC, GAO, OPM, the Merit  Systems Protection Board, and the Department of Labor); and   local and national news reports.", "EEOC officials said that these sources may reveal triggers that may not be  present in the workforce data tables. Several of the above-listed sources  provide direct employee input on employee perceptions of the effect of  agency policies and procedures. For example, according to EEOC  instructions, employee surveys may reveal information on experiences  with, perceptions of, or difficulties with a practice or policy within the  agency. Further, EEOC\u2019s instructions state that reliance solely on  workforce profiles and statistics will not meet the mandate of MD-715.  When workforce data and other sources of information indicate that a  barrier may exist, agencies are to conduct further inquiry to identify and  examine the factors that caused the situation revealed by workforce data  or other sources of information.", "To identify triggers, CRCL stated that it regularly reviews complaint data it  must submit annually to EEOC and data collected from reports CRCL is  required to submit under various statutes, executive orders, and initiatives,  including the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and  Retaliation Act, Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Recruitment  Program, Executive Order 13171 on Hispanic employment in the federal  government, Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program, White House  Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and White House  Initiative on Tribal Colleges and Universities. According to CRCL officials,  in the past, CRCL has also relied upon the DHS online departmental  newsletter, periodicals, and news media to identify triggers.", "We have previously reported that successful organizations empower and  involve their employees to gain insights about operations from a frontline  perspective, increase their understanding and acceptance of organizational  goals and objectives, and improve motivation and morale. Obtaining the  input of employees in identifying triggers would provide a frontline  perspective on where potential barriers exist. Employee input can come  from a number of sources including employee groups, exit interviews, and  employee surveys. CRCL said that it does not consider input from  employee groups in conducting its MD-715 analysis, but the Diversity  Council\u2019s Diversity Policy and Planning Subcouncil has recently begun to  reach out to form partnerships with employee associations such as the  National Association of African-Americans in the Department of Homeland  Security. In addition, according to DHS\u2019s 2008 MD-715 report, DHS does  not currently have a departmentwide exit survey, but according to a senior  OCHCO official, OCHCO plans to develop a prototype exit survey with the  eventual goal of proposing its use throughout DHS.", "Although DHS does not have the structures in place to obtain employee  input departmentwide from employee groups and exit surveys, DHS could  use the FHCS and DHS\u2019s internal employee survey to obtain employee  input in identifying potential barriers. OPM administers the FHCS  biennially in even-numbered years, and DHS administers its own internal  survey in off years. Both surveys collect data on employees\u2019 perceptions  of workforce management, organizational accomplishments, agency goals,  leadership, and communication. We have previously reported that  disaggregating employee survey data in meaningful ways can help track  organizational priorities.According to information from officials in OPM\u2019s  Division for Strategic Human Resources Policy, which administers and  analyzes the FHCS, results by gender, national origin, and race are  available at the agency level (i.e., DHS) on each agency\u2019s secure site.  DHS\u2019s internal survey also collects demographic data on race, gender, and  national origin of respondents. DHS could analyze responses from the  FHCS and its internal employee survey by race, gender, and national origin  to determine whether employees of these groups perceive a personnel  policy or practice as a possible barrier. For example, one question on the  2008 FHCS asked whether supervisors or team leaders in the employee\u2019s  work unit support employee development. Fifty-eight percent of DHS  respondents agreed and 21 percent disagreed with the statement. The 2007  DHS internal survey asked whether employees receive timely information  about employee development programs. Thirty-nine percent of  respondents provided a positive response; 35 percent provided a negative  response. Although a CRCL staff member reviews the FHCS and DHS\u2019s  internal survey data as part of an OCHCO employee engagement working  group, the staff member does not review DHS responses based on race,  gender, and national origin. Responses based on demographic group could  indicate whether a particular group perceives a lack of opportunity for  employee development and suggest a need to further examine these areas  to determine if barriers exist. Without employee input on DHS personnel  policies and practices, DHS is missing opportunities to identify potential  barriers.

The Deputy Officer for EEO  Programs told us that CRCL intends to conduct program reviews of the  EEO programs at all operational components by 2010, although no  schedule for completing these audits has been established."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Input from employee groups reflects the perspective of the individuals  directly affected by employment policies and procedures and could  provide valuable insight into whether those policies and procedures may  be barriers to EEO. Because CRCL does not regularly include employee  input from available sources, such as the FHCS and DHS\u2019s internal  employee survey, it is missing opportunities to identify potential barriers  to EEO. For barriers DHS has already identified, it is important for DHS to  ensure the completion of planned activities through effective internal  control activities, including the identification of critical schedules and  milestones that need to be completed by a given date. Effective internal  controls could help DHS ensure that its efforts are moving forward,  manage any needed midcourse corrections, and minimize modifications of  target completion dates. Additional staff, which DHS plans to add in 2009,  could help DHS implement effective internal control activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security take the  following two actions:    Direct the Officer for CRCL to develop a strategy to regularly include  employee input from such sources as the FHCS and DHS\u2019s internal survey  in identifying potential barriers to EEO.", "Direct the Officer for CRCL and the CHCO to identify essential activities  and establish interim milestones necessary for the completion of all  planned activities to address identified barriers to EEO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security  for review and comment. In written comments, which are reprinted in  appendix I, the Director of DHS\u2019s Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office  agreed with our recommendations. Regarding the first recommendation,  the Director agreed that DHS should develop a departmentwide strategy to  regularly include employee input from the FHCS and DHS internal  employee survey to identify barriers, but noted that DHS component EEO  programs already use employee survey data to develop annual action  plans to address identified management issues. Regarding the second  recommendation, the Director wrote that CRCL has already begun revising  its plans to identify specific steps and interim milestones to accomplish  the essential activities. DHS also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
