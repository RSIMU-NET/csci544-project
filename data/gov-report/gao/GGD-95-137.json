Some shift in workload has occurred. Taxpayer service and service center staffs originated about 82 percent of all agreements in fiscal year 1994, up from 43 percent in fiscal year 1991. Most of the increase was due to these two staffs granting streamlined agreements. ACS call sites granted fewer agreements in fiscal year 1994 (about 381,000 or 15 percent of agreements) than in fiscal year 1991 (about 579,000 or 53 percent of agreements).", "In shifting the installment agreement workload to service center and taxpayer service staff, IRS hoped to increase ACS collections by freeing up ACS staff to work on higher dollar cases. However, the expectation of increased collections had not materialized since ACS collections per staff year dropped between fiscal years 1992 and 1994 from $1.71 million to $1.44 million in current year dollars. Overall, the amount collected at ACS sites decreased from $4.88 billion to $3.30 billion during the same period.", "IRS collection officials said that the lower ACS collections are due, in part, to their decision during this same period to increase the deferral level\u2014the amount under which delinquent accounts are not pursued beyond the notice stage, except to offset refunds. According to IRS officials, this increase reduced ACS workloads more than expected and contributed to reduced ACS collections. IRS subsequently lowered its deferral level in April 1994, a move IRS officials expect will increase ACS workloads and the resulting collections.", "Another indication of the greater impact the installment agreement program is having on collections was the increased number of balance due accounts that are being resolved earlier in the collection process. IRS data show that more balance due accounts are being favorably resolved by taxpayers paying or arranging to pay the amounts owed without IRS resorting to collection notices and subsequent collection actions. Between fiscal years 1991 and 1994, accounts favorably resolved before a collection notice rose from 41 percent to 52 percent, with installment agreements accounting for a growing share of the favorable early resolutions.

In September 1994, IRS\u2019 internal auditors raised concerns about whether (1) the new procedures for granting installment agreements were encouraging taxpayers to choose installments when they could be paying their taxes in full and (2) the program was leading some taxpayers to accumulate debt they may not be able to pay."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Installment Payers May Be Able to Pay in Full", "paragraphs": ["The installment agreement program was established to provide taxpayers who cannot pay their taxes in full, when they are due, an opportunity to pay in installments. Before the program was revised in April 1992, taxpayers whose agreements were for tax debts above $5,000 were required to provide financial data to substantiate their inability to pay in full and on time. Under its streamlined procedures, IRS relies on taxpayers to determine for themselves whether they can pay in full or want to pay in installments, as long as the amount owed does not exceed $10,000 and the payment period meets IRS requirements. IRS recognizes that this may result in some taxpayers opting for installment agreements even though they could have paid in full and on time. IRS collection officials told us they did not know the extent to which this occurs, but they believed the benefits from streamlining outweigh any unintended negative effects of making installment agreements available to taxpayers who can pay in full.", "This issue was raised by IRS\u2019 internal auditors in their September 1994 report on using and processing installment agreement requests received with tax returns. The auditors reviewed a sample of 2,824 pre-assessed installment agreements\u2014those agreements requested by taxpayers when they filed their tax returns\u2014granted in 1993 and found that 22 percent of the taxpayers had paid in full with their return the previous year, while another 10 percent had fully paid later during the collection notice process. The auditors reasoned that on the basis of the taxpayer\u2019s payment history, some of these taxpayers could have paid their taxes in full in the year they entered into an agreement. In addition, to obtain more conclusive information on whether some taxpayers who entered into installment agreements could have paid their taxes on time, the auditors contacted 87 taxpayers who received pre-assessed agreements. The auditors were told by 41 percent of these taxpayers that they could have fully paid their accounts by withdrawing savings, liquidating assets, or borrowing.", "In response to IRS\u2019 internal audit findings, IRS has begun taking steps to discourage taxpayers who can pay in full from using installment agreements. For example, IRS revised Form 9465 to advise taxpayers to consider other alternatives, such as bank loans, before requesting an installment agreement when filing a tax return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Taxpayers May Be Accumulating Debt", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 streamlined procedures allow for new tax debt to be added to an existing installment agreement without a review of a taxpayer\u2019s financial condition or of possible remedies to incurring future debt, provided the new aggregate balance does not exceed $10,000 and the payment period meets IRS requirements. IRS data show that about 16 percent of the agreements granted in fiscal year 1994 were added to existing installment debt. In their September 1994 report, IRS internal auditors expressed concern that IRS procedures allowed taxpayers to incur tax debts beyond what they could reasonably be expected to pay. The auditors stated that allowing taxpayers to add tax debt beyond what could be paid within a reasonable time would increase IRS\u2019 accounts receivable balance and its costs to collect taxes.", "According to an IRS official, one explanation for why the practice of accumulating debt was allowed is that IRS accommodated taxpayers who had balance due accounts because of 1992 changes in the withholding tables. During that period, IRS assumed that many taxpayers would owe taxes unexpectedly and allowed taxpayers to pay those taxes by adding debt to existing agreements under streamlined procedures.", "That policy continued through 1994 when, as a result of concerns from IRS\u2019 internal auditors, IRS took several steps to address the issue for the 1995 tax filing season. For example, the monthly installment agreement reminder notices for December 1994 included a special reminder to taxpayers. The reminder stated that under the terms of their existing agreements the taxpayers were not eligible for another installment agreement while their existing agreements were in effect and that all federal tax liabilities must be paid in full or they would be in default. Also, Form 9465 was revised to inform taxpayers that they are not to use the form if they were currently making installment payments and that the agreement would be in default if all liabilities were not paid in full. In addition, in January 1995, IRS issued procedures to field personnel working installment agreements to prevent taxpayers from adding new tax debt to existing liabilities. IRS plans to revisit this issue before the 1996 tax filing season.", "IRS internal auditors also reviewed whether taxpayers with installment agreements acted on their own to avoid the need for future agreements. In doing so, IRS contacted 87 taxpayers who were granted pre-assessed installment agreements and found that 39 percent had not adjusted their withholding or estimated payments to avoid owing money on successive tax returns. Although acceptance letters to taxpayers contain instructions for making such adjustments, no such instructions appear on Form 9465, which is the initial form completed by taxpayers who request pre-assessed agreements.", "The auditors recommended that IRS include a section on Form 9465 for taxpayers to identify the cause of their tax debts and the steps taken to ensure that the condition does not recur the following year.

However, IRS does not tell taxpayers the total estimated cost of the agreement, including interest and penalty accruals, nor does IRS tell taxpayers how long it will take to pay off their debt. The lack of information provided by IRS contrasts with prevailing private sector practices, which are governed by truth-in-lending laws.", "Penalty and interest accruals add considerably to the cost and payoff period of an agreement. For example, assume a taxpayer agrees to make $100 monthly payments on a $2,800 tax debt (the median amounts from our sample). To pay off interest and penalty accruals, the taxpayer would need to make 6 additional monthly payments (34 payments versus 28 payments) and pay an additional $544 (assuming the 0.5 percent per month penalty rate and monthly compounding of interest at 9 percent). Under the Internal Revenue Code, the rate of interest is determined on a quarterly basis computed from the federal short-term rate based on daily compounding.", "Representatives of consumer groups told us that providing taxpayers with better cost information could lead some taxpayers to consider and use other options to pay their tax debts before choosing installment agreements or assuming long payoff periods. By providing more information to taxpayers on the cost of agreements, IRS may be able to limit agreement use more closely to taxpayers who are unable to pay their taxes on time in a lump sum.", "IRS officials agreed that more information would be a factor in deterring some taxpayers with other available resources from using IRS\u2019 installment agreement program to pay their taxes. However, IRS officials are reluctant to provide specific cost and payoff period projections to installment agreement applicants. The officials are concerned that the estimates they provide at the beginning of an agreement could be misleading because these estimates could change over the life of the agreement. For example, the estimates could be affected by interest rates that are subject to quarterly adjustment and by missed taxpayer payments. A method to alleviate this concern would be to include revised cost and payoff period projections in the monthly statements that IRS sends taxpayers during the course of an agreement. These notices already include information specific to a taxpayer\u2019s agreement, such as the amount of payment due and the current unpaid balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Use of Direct Debit Payments Could Improve Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["IRS offers taxpayers the option of making installment payments automatically by directly withdrawing funds from the taxpayer\u2019s bank account.

IRS collection officials explained that one reason for the low rate of direct debits is that staff who set up installment agreements view direct debits as additional work because the processing involves performing more steps and gathering more information from taxpayers.", "According to IRS data, pre-assessed installment agreements accounted for almost 31 percent of the 2.6 million new agreements in fiscal year 1994. Form 9465, the form used by taxpayers to request pre-assessed agreements, does not mention the direct debit option (see app. I), leaving it up to IRS staff to pursue this option later. As noted, however, IRS collections officials indicated that this reliance on staff has limited the number of direct debits. Because of the advantages of the direct debit payment method, it may be worthwhile for IRS to test a revision of the form to include space for taxpayers to authorize direct debits and supply the information necessary to set them up."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sending Some Default Notices by Regular Mail Could Reduce Costs", "paragraphs": ["When taxpayers default on their installment agreements, service center staff must review the taxpayers\u2019 accounts and send them a default notice. That notice is a statement informing the taxpayer that the account is not current and, if not corrected, the taxpayer is subject to levy action. Depending on how taxpayers respond to these notices, IRS staff may reinstate the agreement; take some other collection action, such as a levy or lien filing; or place the account in a deferred status where only passive collection actions, such as refund offsets are taken.", "One service center has suggested that some of the costs incurred on defaulted agreements may be reduced if IRS could send default notices by regular mail rather than certified mail. This change would replace a $1.29 letter with a 23-cent letter (presorted rate) and also reduce some handling costs. Since defaults are not uncommon, the savings in postage costs could be significant. The service center estimated its own annual savings would be nearly $150,000.", "Our analysis suggests that the service center suggestion has merit. We realize that some default notices may still need to be sent by certified mail because they are used to give taxpayers notice of impending levy actions against their assets. Section 6331(d) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that IRS inform taxpayers in person or by certified mail 30 days before taking levy actions. Other defaulted installment agreements, however, are placed in deferred status, and no levy action is pending because collection action is limited to periodic notices and offsets against future refunds. Our review of the October 1 through 7, 1994, listing of 1,933 defaulted agreements in the Central Region showed that 62 percent of these agreements were below the deferral level.

However, a large portion of IRS\u2019 installment debt is for agreements that will run for more than 5 years if payments are made at their current levels. Such agreements are costly to administer, and IRS considers them riskier than shorter term agreements. IRS\u2019 manual states that installment agreements lasting more than 5 years are not likely to be paid off. Thus, these protracted agreements are candidates for other options, such as an offer in compromise, which is a program that allows taxpayers to liquidate their tax liability through a lump-sum settlement for less than the amount owed.", "About 18 percent of the agreements we reviewed from three service centers were protracted agreements. These agreements accounted for approximately 53 percent, or $846 million, of the installment debt owed at the three centers. For these agreements, the median balance owed was $5,780, the median monthly payment was $100, and the projected median payoff period was 7.6 years.", "Some of the protracted agreements in our sample are unlikely to ever be paid off because current payments were not keeping up with accruing interest. These agreements made up about 16 percent of the protracted agreements we reviewed, with a current unpaid balance totaling $292 million. The median monthly payment on these agreements was $50, and the median unpaid balance was $17,530. At IRS\u2019 9-percent annual interest rate as of December 1994, 1 month\u2019s interest on the median unpaid balance amounted to $131.", "IRS officials acknowledged the existence of these types of agreements in their inventory, adding that sometimes accepting a taxpayer\u2019s installment payment may be its best option. The officials explained that these payments often represented amounts that may otherwise not be collected.

This practice conflicts with IRS\u2019 intent to reserve installment agreements for taxpayers who cannot otherwise pay their taxes in full when they are due. The auditors also raised concerns about the ease with which taxpayers could accumulate additional tax debt by adding new income tax liabilities to existing agreements. IRS has acted to address the internal auditors\u2019 concerns.", "Our work surfaced several other concerns about certain administrative aspects of the program. For example, IRS does not tell taxpayers the extent that interest and penalty accruals will add to the costs of installment agreements and the payoff time.

In addition, IRS could reduce some of the administrative costs of servicing agreements by (1) encouraging more taxpayers to make installment payments by direct debit and (2) mailing some default notices by regular mail instead of certified mail.", "Our sample of installment agreements contained a substantial amount of installment debt associated with agreements having payoff periods longer than 5 years.
