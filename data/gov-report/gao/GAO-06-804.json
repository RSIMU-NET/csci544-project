The current indexing provisions that affect most workers and beneficiaries relate to (1) benefit calculations for new beneficiaries, (2) the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for existing beneficiaries, and (3) the cap on taxable earnings. Some reform proposals would slow benefit growth by indexing the initial benefit formula to changes in prices or life expectancy rather than wages. Some would revise the COLA under the premise that it currently overstates inflation, and some would increase the cap on taxable earnings. National pension reforms in other countries have used indexing in various ways. In countries with high contribution rates that need to address solvency issues, recent changes have generally focused on reducing benefits. Although most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries compute retirement benefits using wage indexing, some have moved to price indexing, or a mix of both. Some countries reflect improvements in life expectancy in computing initial benefits. Reforms in other countries that include indexing changes sometimes affect both current and future retirees. Indexing can have various distributional effects on benefits and revenues. Changing the indexing of initial benefits through the benefit formula typically results in the same percentage change in benefits across income levels regardless of the index used. However, indexing can also be designed to maintain benefits for lower earners while reducing or slowing the growth of benefits for higher earners. Indexing payroll tax rates would maintain scheduled benefit levels but reduce the ratio of benefits to contributions for younger cohorts. Finally, the effect of modifying the COLA would be greater the longer people collect benefits. Indexing raises considerations about the program's role, the treatment of disabled workers, and other issues. For example, indexing initial benefits to prices instead of wages implies that benefit levels should maintain purchasing power rather than maintain relative standards of living across age groups (i.e., replacement rates). Also, as with other ways to change benefits, changing the indexing of the benefit formula to improve solvency could also result in benefit reductions for disabled workers as well as retirees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The total long-term financing shortfall currently facing the Social Security  The total long-term financing shortfall currently facing the Social Security  program is significant and growing over time, thereby making system  program is significant and growing over time, thereby making system  reform an important priority.

To analyze the effects of different forms of indexing on the distribution of  benefits, we calculated benefit levels for a sample of workers using a  microsimulation model (see app. I for a more detailed discussion of our  scope and methodology). For this analysis, we selected four well-known  indexing approaches to illustrate the effects on the distribution of  benefits. To describe the distributional effects of the different indexing  approaches, we used our model to simulate benefits for workers born in  1985.

The program provides cash benefits to retired  and disabled workers and their eligible dependents and survivors.  Congress designed Social Security benefits with an implicit focus on  replacing lost wages. However, Social Security is not meant to be the sole  source of retirement income; rather it forms a foundation for individuals  to build upon. The program is financed on a modified pay-as-you-go basis  in which payroll tax contributions of those currently working are largely  transferred to current beneficiaries. Current beneficiaries include insured  workers who are entitled to retirement or disability benefits, and their  eligible dependents, as well as eligible survivors of deceased insured  workers. The program\u2019s benefit structure is progressive, that is, it provides  greater insurance protection relative to contributions for earners with  lower wages than for high-wage earners. Workers qualify for benefits by  earning Social Security credits when they work and pay Social Security  taxes; they and their employers pay payroll taxes on those earnings. In  2005, approximately 159 million people had earnings covered by Social  Security, and 48 million people received approximately $521 billion in  OASDI benefits.", "Currently, the Social Security program collects more in taxes than it pays  out in benefits.

In addition, all of the  accumulated Treasury obligations held by the trust funds are expected to  be exhausted by 2040. Social Security\u2019s long-term financing shortfall  stems primarily from the fact that people are living longer and labor force  growth has slowed. As a result, the number of workers paying into the  system for each beneficiary has been falling and is projected to decline  from 3.3 today to about 2 by 2040. The projected long-term insolvency of  the OASDI program necessitates system reform to restore its long-term  solvency and assure its sustainability. Restoring solvency and assuring  sustainability for the long term requires that either Social Security gets  additional income (revenue increases), reduces costs (benefit reductions),  or undertakes some combination of the two.", "To evaluate reform proposals, we have suggested that policy makers  should consider three basic criteria:1. the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable solvency and how  the proposal would affect the economy and the federal budget;  2. the balance struck between the goals of individual equity (rates of  return on individual contributions) and income adequacy (level and  certainty of monthly benefits); and  3. how readily such changes could be implemented, administered, and  explained to the public.", "Moreover, reform proposals should be evaluated as packages that strike a  balance among the individual elements of the proposal and the  interactions among these elements. The overall evaluation of any  particular reform proposal depends on the weight individual policy makers  place on each of the above criteria.", "Changing the indexing used by the OASDI program could be used to  increase income or reduce costs.

Benefit levels, when adjusted for inflation, fell and then jumped up  with ad hoc increases, and these fluctuations were dramatic at times.  Similarly, Congress made only ad hoc changes to the tax rate and the cap  on the amount of workers\u2019 earnings that were subject to the payroll tax,  which is also known as the maximum taxable earnings level.

They provided for automatically increasing the maximum taxable earnings  level based on increases in average earnings, and this approach is still in  use today.

In particular, the  indexing approach in the 1972 amendments resulted in (1) a \u201cdouble- indexing\u201d of benefits to inflation for new beneficiaries though not for  existing ones; (2) a form of \u201cbracket creep\u201d based on the structure of the  benefit formula that slowed benefit growth as earnings increased over  time, which offset the double indexing to some degree; and (3) instability  of program costs that was driven by the interaction of price and wage  growth in benefit calculations. (See app. II for more detail.) Within a few  years, problems with the 1972 amendments became apparent. Benefits  were growing far faster than anticipated, especially since wage and price  growth varied dramatically from previous historical experience.

The formula adjusts these  lifetime earnings by indexing them to changes in average wages. Indexing  the earnings to changes in wage levels ensures that the same relative value  is accorded to each year\u2019s earnings, no matter when they were earned.", "For example, consider a worker who earned $5,000 in 1965 and $40,000 in  2000. The worker\u2019s earnings increased by eight times, but much of that  increase reflected changes in the average wage level in the economy,  which increased by about seven times (690 percent) over the same period.  The growth in average wages in turn partially reflects price inflation;  however, wages may grow faster or slower than prices in any given year.

In  contrast, under the 1972 amendments, the bendpoints were held constant  and the replacement factors were indexed. (See app. II.)

Indexing the benefit formula in this way helps benefits  for new retirees keep pace with wage growth, which reflects increases in  the standard of living.", "Figure 2, which shows earnings replacement rates for successive groups of  illustrative workers, illustrates the program\u2019s history with indexing initial  benefits. Replacement rates declined before the first benefit increases  were enacted in 1950 and then rose sharply as a result of those increases.  From 1950 until the early 1970s, replacement rates fluctuated noticeably  more from year to year than over other periods; this pattern reflects the ad  hoc nature of benefit increases over that period. Between 1974 and 1979,  replacement rates grew rapidly for new beneficiaries, reflecting the double  indexing of the 1972 amendments. The 1977 amendments corrected for the  unintended growth in benefits from double indexing, and replacement  rates declined rapidly as a result.

Under this approach, which is used in this report, the  replacement factors are typically multiplied by a number that reflects the  index being used. The replacement factors would be adjusted for each  year in which benefits start, beginning with some future year. So such  changes would not affect current beneficiaries. Indexing the replacement  factors would reduce benefits at the same proportional rate across income  levels, while changing the indexing of lifetime earnings or the bendpoints  could alter the distribution of benefits across income levels. Recent reform  proposals, as described by the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA)  Office of the Chief Actuary in its evaluations, generally implement  indexing changes as adjustments to the PIA formula\u2019s replacement factors.", "Two indexing approaches\u2014to reflect changes in the CPI or increasing  longevity\u2014have been proposed as alternatives to the average wage index  for calculating initial benefits. Proponents of using CPI indexing for initial  benefit calculations generally offer the rationale that wage indexing has  never been fiscally sustainable and CPI indexing would slow the growth of  benefits to an affordable level while maintaining the purchasing power of  benefits. They say that maintaining the purchasing power of benefits  should be the program\u2019s goal, as opposed to maintaining relative standards  of living across age groups (that is, earnings replacement rates), which the  current benefit formula accomplishes. Proponents of longevity indexing  offer the rationale that increasing longevity is a key reason for the system\u2019s  long-term insolvency. Since people are living longer on average, and are  expected to continue to do so in the future, they will therefore collect  benefits for more years on average. Using an index that reflects changes in  life expectancy would maintain relatively comparable levels of lifetime  benefits across birth years and thereby promote intergenerational equity.  Also, longevity indexing could encourage people to work longer.", "Some indexing proposals accept the need to slow the growth of initial  benefits in general but seek to protect benefit levels for the lowest  earnings levels, consistent with the program\u2019s goal of helping ensure  income adequacy. Such proposals would modify how a new index would  be applied to the formula for initial benefits so that the formula is still  wage-indexed below a certain earnings level. As a result, they would  maintain benefits promised under the current program for those with  earnings below that level such as, for example, those in the bottom  30 percent of the earnings distribution. Such an approach has been called  progressive price indexing.", "A few proposals would alter the COLA used to adjust benefits for current  retirees. Some proposals respond to methodological concerns that have  been raised about how the CPI is calculated and would adjust the COLA in  the interest of accuracy. In general, such changes would slightly slow the  growth of the program\u2019s benefit costs. However, other proposals call for  creating a new CPI for older Americans (CPI-E) specifically tailored to  reflect how inflation affects the elderly population and using the CPI-E for  computing Social Security\u2019s COLA. Depending on its construction, such a  change could increase the program\u2019s benefit costs.", "Some proposals would index revenues in new ways. Some would apply a  longevity index to payroll tax rates, again focused on the fact that  increasing life expectancy is a primary source of the program\u2019s insolvency.  Proponents of indexing tax rates feel that benefits are already fairly  modest, so the adjustment for longevity should not come entirely from  benefit reductions. Other proposals would institute other types of  automatic revenue adjustments. Some would raise the maximum taxable  earnings level gradually until some percentage of total earnings are  covered and then maintain that percentage into the future. Implicitly, such  proposals reflect a desire to hold constant the percentage of earnings  subject to the payroll tax.

Some indexing methods affect both current and future  retirees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Retirement Indexing Approaches in Other Countries Generally Focus on Benefit Reductions instead of Increased Contributions", "paragraphs": ["A number of reforms have focused on methods that primarily adjust  benefits rather than taxes to address the fiscal solvency of national  pension systems. There are two main reasons for this. First, contribution  rates abroad are generally high already, making it politically difficult to  raise them much further. For example, while in the United States total  employer-employee Social Security contribution rates are 12.4 percent of  taxable earnings, they are above 16 percent in Belgium and France, more  than 18 percent in Sweden and Germany, above 25 percent in the  Netherlands and the Czech Republic, and over 30 percent in Italy. In fact,  some countries have stipulated a ceiling on employee contribution rates in  order to reassure the young\u2014or current contributors\u2014that the burden  would be shared among generations. For example, Japan settled, with the  2004 Reform Law, its pension premium rates for the next 100 years with an  increase of 0.35 percent per year until 2017, at which time premium levels  are to be fixed at 18.3 percent of covered wages. Similarly, Canada chose  to raise its combined employer-employee contribution rate more quickly  than previously scheduled, from 5.6 percent to 9.9 percent between 1997  and 2003, and maintain it there until the end of the 75-year projection  period. This increase is meant to help Canada\u2019s pension system build a  large reserve fund and spread the costs of financial sustainability across  generations. Germany\u2019s recent reforms set the workers\u2019 contribution rate  at 20 percent until 2020 and at 22 percent from 2020 to 2030. Second,  increasing employee contribution rates without significantly reducing  benefit levels will tend to make continued employment less attractive  compared to retirement. In the context of population aging and fiscally  stressed national pension systems facing many countries, reform measures  seek to do the opposite: encourage people to remain in the labor force  longer to enhance the fiscal solvency of pension programs. Contribution  rates that become too high are not likely to provide sufficient incentives to  continue work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indexing Approaches Aim at Containing Costs", "paragraphs": ["One commonly used means of reducing, or containing the growth of,  promised benefits involves changing the method used to compute initial  benefits. For example, France, Belgium, and South Korea now adjust past  earnings in line with price growth rather than wage growth to determine  the initial pension benefits of new retirees. In general, this shift to price  indexation tends to significantly lower benefits relative to earnings, as  over long periods prices tend to grow more slowly than wages. Because  of compounding, the effect of such a change is larger when benefits are  based on earnings over a long period than when they reflect only the last  few years of work, as in pension plans with benefits based on final  salaries. In fact, the OECD estimates that, in the case of a full-career  worker with 45 years of earnings, price indexation can lead to benefits 40  percent lower than with wage indexation. In contrast to full price  indexing, some nations use an index that is a mix of price growth and  wage growth, which tends to produce higher benefits than those  calculated using price indexation only, then adjust the relative weights of  the two to cover program costs. Finland, for example, changed its  indexation of initial benefits from 50 percent prices and 50 percent wages  to 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Similarly, Portugal\u2019s index  combines 75 percent price growth and 25 percent wage growth.", "A few countries have moved away from wage indexing but without  necessarily adopting price indexation. Sweden, for instance, uses an index  that reflects per capita wage growth to compute initial benefits, provided  the system is in fiscal balance. However, when the system\u2019s obligations  exceed its assets, a \u201cbrake\u201d is applied automatically that allows the  indexation to be temporarily abandoned. This automatic balancing  mechanism (ABM) ensures that the pension system remains financially  stable. In Germany and Japan, recent reforms changed benefit indexation  from a gross-wage base to a net-wage base\u2014i.e., gross wages minus  contributions. In Italy, workers\u2019 benefit accounts rise in line with gross  domestic product (GDP) growth so both the changes in the size of the  labor force and in productivity dictate benefit levels.", "Another approach countries have used is adding a longevity index to the  formula determining pension payments. In Sweden, Poland, and Italy, for  example, remaining life expectancy at the time of retirement inversely  affects benefit levels. Thus, as life spans gradually increase, successive  cohorts of retirees get smaller benefit payments unless they choose to  begin receiving them later in life than those who retired before them. Also,  people who retire earlier than their peers in a given cohort get significantly  lower benefits throughout their remaining life than those who retire later.", "Longevity indexing helps ensure that improvements in life expectancy do  not strain the system financially.", "Germany, on the other hand, now uses a sustainability factor that links  initial benefits to the system\u2019s dependency ratio\u2014i.e., the number of  people drawing benefits relative to the number paying into the system.  This dependency ratio captures variations in fertility, longevity, and  immigration, and consequently makes the pension system self-stabilizing.  For example, higher fertility and immigration, which raise labor force  growth, will, other things equal, improve the dependency ratio, leading to  higher pension benefits, while higher longevity or life expectancy will  increase the dependency ratio, and hence cause benefits to decline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indexing Approaches Affect Both Current and Future Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["In some of the countries we studied, changes in indexing methods affect  both current and future retirees. In Japan, for example, post-retirement  benefits were indexed to wages net of taxes before 2000. However,  reforms enacted that year altered the formula by linking post-retirement  benefits to prices. As a result, retirees saw their subsequent benefits rise at  a much slower pace. The 2004 reforms reduced retirees\u2019 purchasing power  further by introducing a negative \u201cautomatic adjustment indexation\u201d to the  formula. With this provision, post-retirement benefits increase in line with  prices minus the adjustment rate, currently fixed at 0.9 percent until about  2023. This rate is the sum of two demographic factors: the decline in the  number of people contributing to the pension program (projected at 0.6  percent) plus the increase in the number of years people collect pensions  (projected at 0.3 percent). This negative adjustment also enters the  formula determining the benefit of new recipients as past earnings are  indexed to net wages minus the same 0.9 percent adjustment rate.", "Sweden\u2019s ABM modifies both the retirement accounts of workers\u2014or  future retirees\u2014and the benefits paid to current pensioners. As explained  earlier, this mechanism is triggered whenever system assets fall short of  system liabilities. Moreover, post-retirement benefits in Sweden are  indexed each year to an economic factor equal to prices plus the average  rate of real wage increase minus 1.6 percent, which is the projected real  long-term growth in wages. As a result, if average real wages grow  annually at 1.6 percent, post-retirement benefits are adjusted for price  increases. On the other hand, if real wage growth falls below 1.6 percent,  benefits do not keep up with prices, leading to a decline in retiree  purchasing power.", "Germany\u2019s sustainability factor affects those already retired, as it is  included in the formula that adjusts their benefits each year.

We analyzed three indexing scenarios; the  dependency ratio index, which links the growth of initial benefits to  changes in the dependency ratio, the ratio of the number of retirees to  workers; the CPI index, which links the growth of initial benefits to  changes in the CPI; and the mortality index, which links the growth of  initial benefits to changes in life expectancy to maintain a constant life  expectancy at the normal retirement age. Figure 3 illustrates the  projected distribution of benefits for workers born in 1985 under three  different indexing scenarios (on the left side of the figure) and under a  so-called benefit reduction benchmark that reduces benefits just enough  to achieve program solvency over a 75-year projection period (on the far  right). Median benefits under the dependency ratio index and the CPI  index are lower than the median benefit for the benchmark; they reduce  benefits more than is needed to achieve 75-year solvency.

The left half of figure 3 illustrates this proportionality in terms of monthly  benefits. While the level of benefits differs, the distribution of benefits for  each scenario has a similar structure. However, the range of each  distribution varies by the difference in the size of the proportional  reduction. A larger proportional reduction\u2014the dependency ratio index\u2014 will result in a distribution with a similar structure, compared to promised  benefits.

Differences in the distributions deal with the timing  associated with implementing the changes. Scaling the indexing scenarios  also reveals that the shape of the distributions is the same. The  distributions of monthly benefits for the indexing scenarios are also very  similar to the distribution of benefits generated under the benefit  reduction benchmark.

Thus, under progressive price indexing, those individuals  with indexed lifetime earnings below a certain point would still have their  initial benefits adjusted by wage indexing; those individuals with earnings  above that level would be subject to a combination of wage and price  indexing on a sliding scale, with those individuals with the highest lifetime  earnings having their benefits adjusted completely by price indexing.", "The effect that progressive price indexing would have on the benefit  formula can be seen in figure 5, where the CPI indexing scenario is  compared to a progressive CPI indexing scenario and to benefits promised  under the current program formula.

However, a progressive application of CPI  indexing does not by itself achieve 75-year solvency, and further changes  would be necessary to do so. Figure 6 shows what happens to the benefit  formula when each of these indexing scenarios is scaled to achieve  comparable levels of solvency over 75 years. Under progressive price  indexing, to protect the benefits of low-income workers, the indexing to  prices at higher earnings levels begins to flatten out benefits, causing the  line in figure 6 to plateau.

The solvency effects of an index are  predicated upon the relative stability and historical trends of the  underlying economic or demographic relationships implied by the index.  For example, the 1970s were a period of much instability, in which actual  inflation rates and earnings growth diverged markedly from past  experience, with the result that benefits unexpectedly grew much faster  than expected. Finally, since the benefit formulas for the Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance (OASI) and DI programs are linked, an important  consideration of any indexing proposal is its effect on the benefits  provided to disabled workers. Disabled worker beneficiaries typically  become entitled to benefits much sooner than retired workers and under  different eligibility criteria.

In turn, maintaining purchasing power implies an absolute  standard of adequacy and an assumption that initial benefits should reflect  a fixed notion of adequacy regardless of improvements in the standard of  living. Also, any index that does not maintain purchasing power results in  workers born in one year receiving higher benefits than workers with  similar earnings born 1 year later. This would occur with any benefit  change that would reduce currently promised benefits more than price  indexing initial benefits would, since price indexing maintains the  purchasing power of initial benefits. In the case of longevity indexing, if  the growth of initial benefits were indexed to life expectancy, then this  implies that the increased costs of benefits that stem from increasing life  expectancy should be borne by all future beneficiaries, even if society has  become richer.

Notches create marked inequities between  beneficiaries close in age to each other.

However, such a benchmark assumes that no action is taken while the  proposals against which it is compared assume that action is taken, which  is inconsistent.

Subsequent amendments increased benefits by  effectively increasing the replacement factors. For example, the 1965  amendments increased benefits by 7 percent for a given average monthly  wage by increasing the replacement factors by 7 percent to 62.97 from  58.85 and to 22.9 percent from 21.4.
