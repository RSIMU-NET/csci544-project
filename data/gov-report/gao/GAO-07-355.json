Moreover, they contend that these changes may disadvantage certain groups of workers, such as sicker, older, or low-wage workers. GAO was asked to examine the practices employers are using to control the costs of benefits. To evaluate changing employer benefit practices and their potential implications, GAO examined: (1) current and emerging practices employers are using to control the costs of health care benefits; (2) current and emerging practices employers are using to control the costs of retirement benefits; and (3) employers' workforce restructuring changes. GAO reviewed studies of employer benefit trends; interviewed representatives of business, government, labor, and consumer advocacy and research organizations; and reviewed and analyzed data from surveys of employee benefits. The Department of Labor provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many employers have recently changed health benefits, often to control costs. The share of employers offering health benefits has declined from 2001 to 2006, due mostly to an 8-percentage point drop in the share of small employers offering benefits. Many employers that offer health benefits have required workers to pay a higher share of out-of-pocket costs and some have recently introduced consumer-directed health plans, which trade lower premiums for significantly higher deductibles. Also, some employers now offer mini-medical plans that provide more limited coverage at lower premiums. Similar to coverage for active workers, an increasing share of retiree health benefits costs is being shifted to retirees and many employers have terminated benefits for future retirees--a trend that experts believe will continue. Some of these recent changes may affect some workers more than others, such as low-wage workers who are less able to afford higher out-of-pocket costs and less healthy workers who use more health care. The trends in retirement benefits that have emerged over the last several decades are continuing. Active participation in defined benefit plans fell from 29 million in 1985 to 21 million in 2003 as employers terminated existing plans or froze benefits for active employees. At the same time, active participation in defined contribution plans rose from 33 million in 1985 to 52 million in 2003 as employers increased their offerings of these plans. Benefits experts stated that employers' decisions on what type of retirement plans to offer reflects their preference for benefit cost control and predictability in funding and accounting. Employers' decisions to offer defined contribution plans requires workers to assume more responsibility for their retirement planning; however, a growing number of employers are attempting to increase retirement savings by automatically enrolling workers and offering investment advice, for which recent legislation provides additional flexibilities. Workforce restructuring through the use of contingent workers--workers who are not employed full-time and year round with an employer--may affect workers' access to and participation in benefit programs. Benefits experts presented mixed views on whether employers have been changing the composition of their workforces to reduce benefit costs. Employers, individuals, and government share the responsibility for providing a U.S. benefits system that addresses the health and retirement needs of individuals of varying economic and health backgrounds, while allowing employers to remain competitive in a global market environment. The challenges workers face in assuming greater cost, risk, and control of their health and retirement benefits make it more difficult for low-wage earners to afford health care coverage and save for retirement. Although these challenges may weigh most heavily on the less wealthy and less healthy segments of the workforce, they affect a broad spectrum of the American workforce and could prove challenging to many over time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many workers receive health and retirement benefits from their  employers, and the cost of these benefits in recent years has risen faster  than wages.

We  interviewed individuals representing many perspectives on this issue,  including benefits consultants, labor union and industry representatives,  consumer advocates, academic and policy researchers with expertise on  employer-sponsored benefits, and officials from the U.S. Department of  Labor (DOL). We also reviewed and analyzed data from several surveys  that are conducted annually, including two nationally representative  surveys of employers\u2019 health benefit plans, one national survey on the  retiree health benefits offered by large private-sector employers, and two  large federal surveys that address employer-sponsored health and  retirement benefits.

In addition to wages and other benefits, employers  often provide workers with health and retirement benefits as a part of  their total compensation. Employer-sponsored health benefits provide  coverage to over 155 million individuals through coverage of active  workers and their dependents.

Several factors help explain the rise in costs, including  increasing demand for services, advances in expensive medical  technology, and an aging population. The Kaiser Family Foundation and  Health Research and Educational Trust (Kaiser/HRET) Annual Employer  Health Benefits Surveys found that from 2001 to 2006 annual premium  costs for single and family coverage rose by about 60 and 63 percent,  respectively, and in each of those years premiums grew more than twice  the rate of wages.", "To contain rising health care costs, employers have made several changes  to health benefits. For several decades, traditional fee-for-service plans  were the predominant form of private health benefits sponsored by  employers. These plans essentially reimbursed any providers for services  covered by a plan based on providers\u2019 actual costs with little or no  incentives to control utilization. In the late 1980s employers increasingly  looked to managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations  (HMO) and preferred provider organizations (PPO), as a way to contain  these rising costs. HMOs and PPOs generally rely on providers to control  service utilization and they provide financial incentives to encourage  patients to use network providers who have agreed to accept fee  discounts. Under an HMO, patients may be restricted to using only  network providers, and they typically require that all specialty care be  coordinated through a primary care physician. While enrollment in HMOs  increased, some enrollees became resistant to the restrictions imposed by  the plans and employers increasingly offered PPOs that offered more  provider choice and flexibility. PPO enrollees face lower cost-sharing  requirements when they receive care from network providers, but may  choose non-network providers at a higher cost and do not typically need  referrals to see a specialist. Despite these cost-control mechanisms,  health care costs continued to rise.", "While managed care relies primarily on health care providers to control  rising costs, more recently employers have also looked to workers to  assume greater responsibility for controlling these costs, such as by  offering consumer-directed health plans (CDHP). CDHPs combine a high- deductible health plan with a tax-advantaged account that enrollees can  use to pay for a portion of their health care expenses. Unused balances  may accrue for future use, potentially giving employees an incentive to  purchase health care more prudently. The higher deductibles generally  result in lower health insurance premiums because the enrollee bears a  greater share of the initial cost of care. Although not required to do so,  CDHP insurance carriers typically provide enrollees with decision-support  tools, such as Web-based information on costs of services and quality of  providers, to help them become more actively involved in making health  care purchasing decisions.", "While not a new concept, employers often offer voluntary health and  wellness programs in combination with CDHPs. These programs are  intended to encourage enrollees to engage in healthy behaviors to help  prevent certain chronic diseases and improve overall health. These  benefits often include disease management programs in which individuals  with certain high-risk conditions have access to a case manager to help  them manage their disease; access to health advice lines; behavior  modification programs such as smoking cessation; and health risk  assessment programs to assess enrollees\u2019 potential for health problems  and suggest ways for participants to reduce their risk of disease. Health  risk assessment programs can also provide employers with information  about the overall health profile of their worker population that can be  used to design targeted disease management and behavior modification  programs.", "While most employer-sponsored health benefit plans provide  comprehensive coverage, employers may also offer health benefits  through mini-medical plans. A mini-medical plan provides basic medical  coverage combined with lower premium costs and a lower coverage cap  than a comprehensive or major medical plan. Annual coverage limits  typically include restrictions on the number of services covered, a low  maximum dollar cap on spending, or both. For example, a mini-medical  plan might cover no more than five doctor visits or no more than $200 per  year for physician services. While these plans may include coverage for a  wide range of hospital or specialty services, annual and lifetime coverage  caps for mini-medical plans are far below those of comprehensive health  insurance plans. For example, a mini-medical plan\u2019s coverage cap might be  set at $25,000 annually with a lifetime cap of $50,000, while many  comprehensive health plans have no coverage caps or have lifetime caps  in excess of $1,000,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Employer- Provided Retirement Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Employer-provided retirement plans can generally be characterized as  either DB or DC plans. Under a traditional DB plan, an employer provides  periodic payments to workers beginning at retirement, using a formula  that considers a worker\u2019s salary, age, and years of service. An employer is  responsible for funding benefits in compliance with federal laws. To  participate in employer-sponsored DB plans, workers must meet eligibility  requirements; to receive any future benefits from the plans, workers must  be vested. Vesting provisions specify when workers acquire the  irrevocable right to pension benefits. Some employers offer hybrid DB  plans that specify the current account balance as a dollar amount like a  DC plan, but assume the financial risk to provide that amount, like a DB  plan. For example, a common type of hybrid plan is a cash balance plan,  which expresses benefits as an \u201caccount balance\u201d based on hypothetical  pay credits (percentage of salary or compensation) and hypothetical  interest credits to employee accounts rather than predetermined payment  amounts at retirement. Qualifying DB plans are federally insured by the  PBGC. The agency provides retirement benefits to eligible workers in the  event that their plans are terminated without sufficient assets to pay  promised benefits. PBGC had an accumulated $19 billion deficit at the end  of federal fiscal year 2006. The recently passed Pension Protection Act of  2006 (PPA) seeks to increase PBGC funding by requiring some plans to  pay higher PBGC insurance premiums and to bolster the financial viability  of private pension plans by requiring some employers to increase the  funding of their plans.", "Under DC plans, a worker\u2019s benefits at retirement depend upon the  accumulation of funds in a worker\u2019s account, which may include employer  and worker contributions, as well as the net investment returns on these  contributions. Workers are generally responsible for managing their  retirement assets. The common type of DC plan is the 401(k), which  allows workers to choose to contribute a portion of their pre-tax  compensation to the plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue  Code. To encourage participation in and contributions to such plans,  employers may wholly or partially match worker contributions.", "Individuals covered by employer retirement plans include:    active workers who currently work for the employer and participate in    separated vested workers\u2014workers who previously worked for an  employer and qualify for future DB pension benefits or retain a DC  account with their former employer;    designated individuals of qualified deceased workers or retirees; and   retirees.", "For the purpose of studying changes in employer-sponsored retirement  plan participation, active workers are considered a better measure  because they are part of the plans that employers are currently offering to  workers.

Employers\u2019 use of contingent workers, workers that are  not full-time, year-round employees, has remained constant over the last  decade at about 30 percent of the total workforce.

Although ERISA does not require any employer to establish benefit plans,  it does set certain minimum standards that most employers must satisfy to  obtain tax advantages if they voluntarily elect to offer pension or health  care benefits to their employees. ERISA requires that plan fiduciaries run  the plan solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries and for the  exclusive purpose of providing benefits. Fiduciaries must act prudently  and diligently and generally must diversify the plan\u2019s investments in order  to minimize the risk of large losses. ERISA requires employers to provide  their employees with a summary plan document that contains important  information about the benefit plan. They must also submit an annual  report to the Secretary of Labor and plan participants that includes, among  other things, a detailed financial statement, the number of employees  enrolled in the plan, and the names and addresses of plan fiduciaries.  Under ERISA, pension plans are generally subject to more extensive  regulation than health benefit plans. For example, while ERISA has  detailed participation and vesting requirements for pension plans, these  rules do not apply to health plans. Furthermore, employers\u2019 pension plans  must meet non-discrimination testing requirements that seek to ensure  that the plan design does not exceed certain limits in favoring highly  compensated employees in participation and benefits over non-highly  compensated employees. Although ERISA provides protections for much  of the workforce, other laws permit employers to exclude some contingent  workers, such as temporary, on-call, and part-time workers, from certain  benefits plans.", "The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) was enacted  to promote the employment of older persons based on their ability rather  than age, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment, and to  help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from  the impact of age on employment. The ADEA, with some exceptions,  prohibits employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations from  discriminating against individuals over 40 on the basis of age. Specifically,  employers may not refuse to hire an applicant or discharge an employee  because of the individual\u2019s age, and they may not otherwise discriminate  against individuals with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or  privileges of employment because of their age. Furthermore, employers  may not classify employees in a way that would deprive them of  employment opportunities or otherwise affect their status as employees  on the basis of age. However, the ADEA does identify some practices that  employers may engage in without violating the general prohibition against  discrimination. For example, under certain circumstances, an employer  may reduce benefit levels for older workers to the extent necessary to  achieve approximate equivalency in cost for older and younger workers. A  benefit plan is considered to be in compliance with the ADEA if the actual  amount of payment made, or cost incurred, on behalf of an older worker is  equal to that made or incurred on behalf of a younger worker, even though  the older worker may thereby receive a lesser amount of benefits or  insurance coverage.", "Among other things, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits employers and health insurance companies  from discriminating against employees on the basis of their health status.  Under HIPAA, an employer may not establish any employee eligibility or  continued eligibility rules that are based on certain health-status-related  factors, as applied either to the employee or his or her dependents. Health- status-related factors are defined broadly to include both physical and  mental medical conditions, an individual\u2019s past claims experience, receipt  of health care, medical history, genetic information, disability, and  evidence of insurability.

The Kaiser/Hewitt survey found that  among surveyed employers, 10, 8, and 12 percent dropped benefits for  future retirees in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. In contrast to  employer-sponsored retirement plans, employer-sponsored health plans  are not subject to ERISA\u2019s vesting rules that require plans to establish  employee rights in certain benefits based on years of service. Therefore,  retirees are generally not protected against the termination of health  benefits unless those benefits are found to have been vested, such as  through explicit contractual language included in the plan documents by  employers. Alternatively, employers may elect to include reservation of  rights clauses in plan documents, which generally permit them to modify  or terminate health benefits at any time. Terminations are more likely to  affect new hires and workers who were hired after a specific date. Some  experts believe the practice of terminating health benefits for future  retirees will continue, and the Kaiser/Hewitt survey found that 10 percent  of surveyed employers reported in 2006 that they are either very or  somewhat likely to terminate retiree health benefits for future retirees in  the next year.

Decreasing rates of coverage among  low-wage workers may be an indication that recent changes are  disproportionately affecting these workers. A recent study found that,  compared to their higher-wage counterparts, between 2001 and 2005, there  were steeper declines in the percent of low-wage workers employed by  firms that offered coverage and in the percent that enrolled in coverage  when offered (see table 5). In addition, the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality reported that between 2001 and 2004, enrollment  among eligible workers employed by large retail firms\u2014which often  employ low-wage workers\u2014fell, while enrollment among all employers  held steady. Some experts believe that the recent drop in enrollment at  the lowest income levels may be explained by the increasing cost of  benefits to workers\u2014such as higher premiums and increased cost-sharing  requirements\u2014which make them particularly difficult for low-wage  workers to afford.", "Similarly, experts are concerned that further cost-shifting of retiree health  benefits may eventually lead some retirees\u2014particularly those with lower  retirement incomes\u2014to drop this coverage, though the implications of this  for some Medicare-eligible retirees might be mitigated by the recent  introduction of Medicare Part D. Less healthy workers may be more  affected by increased cost-shifting than others, because those who are  high utilizers of health care may spend a greater share of their income on  the care they receive, and if they are unable to afford it, they may forgo  needed care.", "CDHPs may appeal to some workers, but may not benefit certain low-wage  workers or those with chronic illnesses who face higher out-of-pocket  expenses under these plans. We have previously reported, and others have  also found, that those enrolled in CDHPs tended to have higher incomes  than enrollees in other plans. While lower premiums might make these  plans more affordable for some and might encourage employers who  previously did not offer health benefits to offer a CDHP, the increased  financial risk associated with higher deductibles and cost-sharing may  particularly affect low-income workers who may be less able to afford the  upfront costs of care. Low-income workers enrolled in HSA-based plans  may also be less likely to build their savings account balances because  they have less disposable income and their tax benefit from making  contributions would be small. This may be particularly true for those  whose employers do not make contributions to their accounts. In addition,  some early research indicates that CDHP enrollees may spend more of  their annual incomes on health-related expenses than enrollees in other  plan types. Those with high health care needs, such as those with a  chronic illness, might be particularly affected by these plans as they may  be more likely to use care and less able to accrue savings in their accounts  from year to year. While some studies have found that CDHP enrollees  were more likely to exhibit cost-conscious behavior than those in  traditional insurance plans, one study found that they were also more  likely to delay or skip needed medical care than were those with less cost- sharing, and this was more pronounced among those with low incomes.  In addition, one study found that CDHP enrollees believed they did not  have the information they needed to make wise decisions about the cost  and quality of health care services. Workers whose employers only offer  CDHPs would be particularly affected by these potential implications.", "Mini-medical plans may benefit certain low-wage workers who would have  no coverage in the absence of such a plan, but health policy experts and  industry representatives we spoke to expressed several concerns about  the adequacy of these plans. Proponents of mini-medical plans believe  they will extend benefits to workers who were not previously insured  either because they could not afford coverage or it was not offered to  them. If enrolled in mini-medical plans, these workers may be more likely  to obtain routine and preventive care, which may lead to better health  outcomes and lower overall health expenditures. Representatives we  spoke to from a health policy research organization, a benefits consulting  firm, and a labor group generally agreed that these plans could provide  access to some health coverage for individuals who were previously  uninsured. However, they also expressed concern that the limitations of  these plans may be too restrictive. For example, an annual coverage cap of  $20,000 could be exceeded by a single hospitalization. In addition, there is  concern that the limitations of these plans may not be clearly  communicated to enrollees and that those who do not understand the  coverage limitations may find themselves lacking coverage they need. In  addition, some labor and consumer advocacy groups are concerned that  mini-medical plans will lead to reduced benefits for some workers, such as  those whose comprehensive benefits are fully replaced by mini-medical  plans.", "Some workers\u2019 rights and consumer advocacy groups have expressed  concerns about the privacy of workers\u2019 health information gathered  through wellness programs and that employers might use these programs  to attract or retain the healthiest workers. The privacy rule issued under  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)  places limits on health plans\u2019 use or disclosure of individually identifiable  health information. However employers not acting as a health plan are not  covered by the privacy rule. Concerning employers\u2019 use of health  information obtained through a wellness program, HIPAA generally  protects individuals from discrimination related to health coverage and  benefits based on health status factors, such as their medical condition or  history. Regulations issued by DOL, the Department of Health and Human  Services, and the Internal Revenue Service in 2006 provide that employers  may establish wellness programs without violating the prohibition against  discrimination, provided the programs meet certain guidelines. For  example, if program rewards are given to participants who meet a health  standard, such as achieving a cholesterol count below a set level, then a  reasonable alternative standard must be made available to certain  individuals, such as those who have a medical condition that makes it  unreasonably difficult for them to meet the general standard."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Ongoing Shift to Different Types of Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans Continues to Affect Both Employers\u2019 and Workers\u2019 Roles in Retirement Planning", "paragraphs": ["The trends in employer-sponsored pension benefits that have emerged  over the last several decades have continued.

Several experts stated that companies  can save money by changing from DB to DC plans; however, they added  that it is difficult for employers to compare the relative costs of providing  these plans because of the differences in the ways each type of plan is  funded. Employers\u2019 DB costs are based upon the amount of funding  necessary to provide pension payments to current and future retirees and  administrative costs, whereas DC costs are associated with employers\u2019  current contributions and administrative costs. Nonetheless, several large  companies that froze their DB plans and enhanced existing DC plans  publicly stated that the actions would save their companies money.", "Benefits experts also stated that employers are interested in making their  benefits costs more predictable. According to the benefit consultants we  interviewed, DB plan funding is subject to cost volatility from a variety of  factors, including financial market conditions, investment performance,  regulation, accounting requirements and changes in plan provisions. For  example, DB plan funding requirements are affected by changes in interest  rates and changes in the value of plan assets. In addition to interest rate  and investment risks, employers are subject to legislative and accounting  risk. For example, the PPA increases the required funding levels for DB  plans and a new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule  requires companies to include pension obligations in their balance sheets,  rather than reporting obligations in footnotes to a financial statement.
