However, the new acquisition  approach also introduces risk to the program. According to  documentation supporting the Transformation Program acquisition  plan, the primary risk of this approach is that the contract incentive  structure may not lead to cooperative behavior on the part of the  various contractors. Our prior work on approaches of this nature has  also shown that as the number of contracts and contractual  relationships increase, so does program complexity. Further, the  schedule and performance risks that arise from higher program  complexity typically result in greater costs.", "Program architecture: In March 2013, the Transformation program  was granted approval by its executive steering committee to move to  a new, more modern, solution architecture.

For example, the  Transformation Program is expected to implement organizational and  business process changes to better use IT. According to USCIS, this  increased use of IT should help achieve goals such as reducing the  immigration benefit backlog through business process change; improving  customer service through expanded electronic filing; and enhancing  national security by authenticating users and integrating with external  agency databases. Due to delays in the program, these improvements  have yet to be achieved.", "Also, we have previously found weaknesses with existing processes and  systems by which USCIS processes benefits. The agency has cited the  Transformation Program as one effort that will help to address these  concerns. For example, in our December 2014 report, we found that  collection and maintenance of data for the K nonimmigrant visa process  (form I-129F) were not reliable or were not collected or maintained in a  reportable format. However, according to USCIS Service Center  Operations officials, the agency will be able to collect and maintain more  complete data through the deployment of the electronic I-129F petition in  USCIS ELIS.

For  example, during a program review on February 16, 2012, the board  discussed a request to provide the program with an additional $21.5  million to cover unplanned costs resulting from delays in the program  schedule. Based on this discussion, the review board identified a  series of action items, including a request for USCIS to return for an  additional review after delivery of the first release to request approval  to commit additional funding for development and delivery of the next  release.

In particular, the committee fully ensured that  corrective actions were identified, and that corrective actions were  tracked until the desired outcomes were achieved. As part of its  reviews, the committee assigned corrective actions to specific  individuals and entities and tracked them until they had been  addressed. For example, in July 2013, the Executive Steering  Committee tasked the Office of Transformation Coordination with  forming a working group to propose potential options for sequencing  of forms and associated business processes to be included in  releases 10.0 through 16.0. This corrective action was tracked and  subsequently completed in September 2013.", "The governance bodies partially implemented three leading practices:", "Acquisition Review Board: The board partially addressed two  practices associated with monitoring cost and schedule against  predefined parameters and following corrective actions through to  completion.

However,  in February 2014, the program approved awarding a series of  contracts but did so without an approved acquisition program  baseline.", "With respect to corrective actions, in a July 2013 acquisition decision  memorandum, the Transformation Program was directed to take the  corrective action of returning to the Acquisition Review Board for a re- baseline decision by September 2013 in order to establish new cost  and schedule parameters against which to evaluate the program.

In  addition, in February 2014, the authority approved a bridge contract  for the solutions architect to, among other things, assist in developing  the new architecture. However, operational requirements along with  an integrated master schedule and cost estimates had not been  approved to support these decisions. This is consistent with our  previous findings. For example, in November 2011, we found that  USCIS managed the program without specific acquisition  management controls, such as reliable schedules. As such, the  review board did not have reasonable assurance that it could meet its  future milestones or that it is developing a system that will achieve  performance goals.

For  example, in March 2013, the committee voted unanimously to migrate  to a new architecture for the Transformation Program. This approval  was based, in part, on the cost analysis reported by USCIS. However,  this analysis included cost savings that did not fully account for the  added costs for merging and migrating data from the old architecture.  In addition to excluding costs for data migration, the cost analysis also  projected significant cost savings to occur based on an accelerated  date for full operating capability. Specifically, that analysis was based  on an August 2016 date, but the full operating capability date in the  draft baseline is no later than March 2019.

With respect to potential  benefits, we reported that some of the changes have the potential to  result in improvements. For example, our work has shown that, if  performed effectively, an Agile approach to software development can  provide more flexibility to respond to changing agency priorities and allow  for easier incorporation of emerging technologies.
