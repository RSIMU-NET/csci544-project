The review was conducted to assess the system\u2019s progress  toward operational effectiveness, suitability, and mission capability. Due  to the limited scope of Pilot A (with less than one-tenth of the planned  Release 1 capability), AFOTEC was not able to collect sufficient  quantitative data to determine whether the program was on track to   for  deliver desired performance at the conclusion of Release 1. However,  interviews with subject matter experts and analysis of the limited data  identified several areas of concern, including data quality, data  conversion, interoperability, usability, information assurance, and  requirements testability. For example, ECSS will have approximately 230  one-way interfaces, with approximately 120 to be implemented in Release  1. However, Pilot A had only implemented two, so there were insufficient  data to assess interface development.", "The report further noted that many requirements were written at a high  level and were not written specifically to address the performance of  ECSS and that the ECSS requirements needed to be significantly refined.  In a July 2010 memorandum, the Director of the DOD Operational Testing  and Evaluation Office noted that the ECSS PMO had taken actions and  conducted additional tests to mitigate the areas of concern. In October  2011, the Air Force DCMO testified that \u201cthe development and  implementation of ECSS have lagged.\u201d According to the Air Force  DCMO, the Air Force raised concerns to the DOD MDA and noted that  \u201cthe department is now engaged in a strategic reassessment of the  overall program.\u201d The Air Force DCMO further noted that the  reassessment maintains focus on addressing both audit readiness and  achievement of genuine return on investment.

For web-based training, 40  percent of the users indicated that the training did not prepare them to  use DEAMS.", "To address the training problems, DFAS is in the process of developing  training courses and desk guides that would be more beneficial to DFAS  employees who have to use GFEBS and DEAMS on a day-to-day basis.  DFAS is in the process of developing 4 specific courses related to  GFEBS. Besides the courses, DFAS is also in the process of developing  desk guides for use by DFAS personnel. These guides are intended to  explain further how an individual is to perform an assigned task within  GFEBS and DEAMS. Because DFAS is developing these training  courses and the operational materials on its own, the cost incurred by  DFAS will be billed to the Army and the Air Force through the prices they  charge for the services provided. As a working-capital-fund entity, DFAS  is required to recover all costs incurred; therefore, the annual amounts  billed to the Army and the Air Force for services provided may be higher  than anticipated because of the additional training DFAS is developing.  As a result, it is incumbent upon the Army and the Air Force to ensure  that the training provided to DFAS users of GFEBS and DEAMS prepares  them to perform their day-to-day mission effectively. Without this  knowledge base and proficiency in the operation of the systems, some of  the benefits that were intended with the implementation of GFEBS and  DEAMS may not be achieved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Modernizing DOD\u2019s business systems is a critical part of transforming  DOD\u2019s business operations, providing more accurate and reliable  financial information to DOD management on the results of the  department\u2019s operations, and providing the processes and data reliability  that DOD needs to produce auditable financial statements. Successful  implementation can help to standardize and streamline DOD\u2019s financial  management and accounting systems, logistics systems, and finance  processes, provide asset visibility for accountable items, and integrate  personnel and pay systems.", "DOD is currently in the midst of implementing numerous ERPs that are  critical to improving its business operations and achieving auditability.  During its implementation efforts, the department has identified system  weaknesses. It is critical that these problems be corrected as early as  possible to help ensure that the billions of dollars spent annually are used  effectively and to achieve effective implementation of the ERPs so that  DOD can begin to fully realize the systems\u2019 intended benefits.", "The monitoring of the status of DOD\u2019s ERPs implementation efforts is an  essential part of helping to ensure that the billions of dollars being  invested provide the intended capabilities. The MDA for GFEBS and  DEAMS has taken steps to help ensure that identified system  weaknesses are resolved before full deployment of the systems. The  action by the MDA provides an opportunity to prevent known weaknesses  from persisting into deployment and negatively affecting the efficiency  and effectiveness of the systems in operation. It is equally important that  the Army and the Air Force establish time lines and monitor the status of  the corrective actions to help ensure that the issues identified by DFAS  users are resolved in a timely manner. The implementation of the ERPs is  a long-term endeavor that will require the sustained and active  involvement of senior management at all levels of the department.", "The training provided to DFAS users did not adequately demonstrate how  users were to perform their expected duties using the systems. While the  training explained how the systems were different than the existing legacy  systems, it did not completely provide them with the skills needed to  perform their day-to-day operations.", "In light of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s recent decision that the Statement of  Budgetary Resources is to be audit ready by fiscal year 2014, it is critical  that the department have effective business systems in place to support  its auditability goals.

In regard to the four  recommendations with which the department concurred, DOD identified  specific actions that it has completed, underway, or planned to establish  time lines for addressing GFEBS and DEAMS issues identified by DFAS  users and for improving training provided to GFEBS and DEAMS users.  For example, with respect to our recommendations concerning the  establishment of time lines for GFEBS and DEAMS issues, the  department cited actions taken or underway to provide for greater DFAS  involvement in the ERP systems\u2019 implementation. Also, regarding  recommendations to improve training provided to GFEBS and DEAMS  users, DOD cited actions taken or underway to provide additional or  expanded user training on roles and job responsibilities under the new  ERP systems\u2019 environments.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Milestone  Decision Authority for GFEBS, GCSS-Army, DEAMS, and ECSS ensure  that any future system deficiencies identified through independent  assessments are resolved or mitigated prior to further deployment of the  systems. The department agreed that high severity system deficiencies  identified through independent assessments should be resolved or  mitigated prior to deployment. DOD cited Army and Air Force progress  towards the resolution of the deficiencies noted in our report. For  example, DOD stated that the Air Force is aggressively resolving the 245  DEAMS deficiencies identified in the January 2011 independent  assessment. However, it also commented that all system deficiencies are  not required to be remediated prior to deployment. In this regard, DOD  commented that lower severity level deficiencies may be deferred, if an  acceptable workaround exists, to avoid schedule slippages and added  cost.", "Prioritization is an important part of an effective risk-based process for  addressing deficiencies. As such, the most severe deficiencies should be  fully addressed prior to deployment. To the extent that any deficiencies  are designated as \u201clower priority\u201d and allowed to continue, at a minimum,  acceptable short-term workarounds should be in place to mitigate the  impact on operational efficiency. However, as discussed in our report, it is  also essential that corrective actions for all identified deficiencies include  specific time lines for tracking and monitoring progress. Consequently, we  continue to believe that comprehensive corrective actions should be  established for all identified deficiencies. Until DOD takes such action to  fully address all identified deficiencies, the department\u2019s ERP systems are  at risk of not being implemented on schedule, within budget, or with the  intended capabilities.
