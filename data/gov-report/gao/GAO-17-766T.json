In the Strategy, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) established seven goals related to reducing illicit drug use and its consequences by 2015. In many instances, the data used to assess progress in 2015 have only recently become available. GAO's review of this updated data indicates that, as of July 2017, the federal government made moderate progress toward achieving two goals, limited progress on two goals, and no progress on the other three goals. However, none of the overall goals in the Strategy were fully achieved. For example, progress had not been made on the goal to reduce drug-induced deaths by 15 percent. Drug-induced deaths instead increased from 2009 to 2015 by 41.5 percent. Although progress was made reducing the 30-day prevalence of drug use among 12- to 17-year-olds from the 10.1 percent reported in 2009, the goal of reducing prevalence to 8.6 percent by 2015 was not achieved. According to ONDCP, as of July 2017, work is currently underway to develop a new strategy.", "In June 2016, GAO convened a diverse panel of experts, including from ONDCP to advance the national dialogue on preventing illicit drug use. The panel focused on (1) common factors related to illicit drug use; (2) strategies in the education, health care, and law enforcement sectors to prevent illicit drug use; and (3) high priority areas for future action to prevent illicit drug use. According to forum participants, illicit drug use typically occurs for the first time in adolescence, involves marijuana, and increasingly, legal prescriptions for opioid-based pain relievers. Forum participants also discussed strategies available in the education, health care, and law enforcement sectors for preventing illicit drug use. For example, forum participants championed the use of school- or-community-based prevention programs that research has shown to be successful in preventing illicit drug use and other behaviors. They also identified several high priority areas for future actions to prevent illicit drug use, including: supporting community coalitions, consolidating federal funding streams for prevention programs, and reducing the number of opioid prescriptions.", "In February 2017, GAO issued a report on the Drug-Free Communities Support Program (DFC)\u2014a program that ONDCP and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) jointly manage. This program aims to support drug abuse prevention efforts that engage schools, law enforcement, and other sectors of a community to target reductions in the use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and the illicit use of prescription drugs. GAO reported that ONDCP and SAMHSA had strengthened their joint management of the program by employing leading collaboration practices; however, the agencies could enhance DFC grantee compliance and performance monitoring. For example, SAMHSA did not consistently confirm grantees had completed plans to achieve long-term goals after exiting the program. GAO recommended that SAMHSA develop an action plan to strengthen DFC grant monitoring and ensure it sends complete and accurate information to ONDCP. SAMHSA concurred with GAO's recommendations and reported in April 2017 that its actions to address them should be completed by this fall."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s recent work related to  the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).

Policy makers, criminal  justice officials, health care providers, and the public at large are turning  with renewed attention to the drug epidemic and its impact on our nation.  Deaths from drug overdoses have risen steadily over the past two  decades and are the leading cause of death due to injuries in the United  States. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), drug overdose deaths surpass the annual number of  traffic crash fatalities, as well as deaths due to firearms, suicide, and  homicide.

According to ONDCP, work is  currently underway to develop a new Strategy. ONDCP is also  responsible for developing a National Drug Control Program Budget  proposal for implementing the Strategy. For fiscal year (FY) 2018, a total  of $27.8 billion was requested to support federal drug control efforts.

National Drug Control Program agencies follow a detailed process in  developing their annual budget submissions for inclusion in the National  Drug Control Program Budget, which provides information on the funding  that the executive branch requested for drug control to implement the  strategy. Agencies submit to ONDCP the portion of their annual budget  requests dedicated to drug control, which they prepare as part of their  overall budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget for  inclusion in the President\u2019s annual budget request. ONDCP reviews the  budget requests of the drug control agencies to determine if the agencies  have acceptable methodologies for estimating their drug control budgets,  and includes those that do in the Drug Control Budget. In FY 2016, the  budget contained 38 federal agencies or programs.", "There are five priorities for which resources are requested across  agencies: substance abuse prevention and substance abuse treatment  (which are considered demand-reduction areas), and domestic law  enforcement, drug interdiction, and international partnerships (which are  considered supply-reduction areas) as shown in figure 1. ONDCP  manages and oversees two primary program accounts: the High Intensity  Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program and the Other Federal Drug  Control Programs, such as the DFC Support Program. ONDCP previously  managed the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign which last  received appropriations in fiscal year 2011. Also, from fiscal year 1991 to  fiscal year 2011, ONDCP managed the Counterdrug Technology  Assessment Center (CTAC).", "According to ONDCP, federal drug control spending increased from $21.7  billion in FY 2007 to the approximately $27.5 billion that was allocated for  drug control programs in FY 2017 as shown in figure 2. Spending on  supply reduction programs, such as domestic law enforcement,  interdiction, and international programs increased 16 percent from $13.3  billion in FY 2007 to $15.4 billion in FY 2017. However, federal spending  for demand programs\u2014treatment and prevention\u2014 increased at a higher  rate from FY 2007 through FY 2017. Spending in these two programs  increased 44 percent from $8.4 billion in FY 2007 to $12.1 billion in FY  2017. As a result, the proportion of funds spent on demand programs  increased from 39 percent of total spending in FY 2007 to 44 percent in  FY 2017.", "According to ONDCP\u2019s National Drug Control Budget Fiscal Year 2018  Highlights, the proposed budget supports $1.3 billion in investments  authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA),  the 21st Century Cures Act, and other opioid-specific programs to help  address the opioid epidemic, including funding prevention and treatment  efforts. Allocated funding for treatment increased in FY 2017 to  approximately $10.6 billion, a 7.5 percent increase over FY 2016.  Funding for prevention increased slightly in FY 2017 to about $1.5 billion,  a 1.4 percent increase from FY 2016.", "According to its FY 2018 Budget Highlights document, ONDCP considers  three main functions to address the drug supply: Domestic Law  Enforcement, Interdiction, and International. For Domestic Law  Enforcement, ONDCP noted that federal, state, local, and tribal law  enforcement agencies play a key role in the Administration\u2019s approach to  reduce drug use and its associated consequences. ONDCP also stated  that interagency drug task forces, such as the HIDTA program, are critical  to leveraging limited resources among agencies. Allocated funding for  domestic law enforcement in FY 2017 is approximately $9.3 billion, which  is similar to its FY 2016 spending level.", "According to ONDCP, the United States continues to face a serious  challenge from the large-scale smuggling of drugs from abroad which are  distributed to every region in the nation. Interdiction funds support  collaborative activities between federal law enforcement agencies, the  military, the intelligence community, and international allies to interdict or  disrupt shipments of illegal drugs, their precursors, and their illicit  proceeds. Allocated funding in support of Interdiction for FY 2017 is  approximately $4.6 billion, a decrease of 3.5 percent from FY 2016.", "International functions place focus on collaborative efforts between the  U.S. government and its international partners around the globe.  According to ONDCP, illicit drug production and trafficking generate huge  profits and are responsible for the establishment of criminal networks that  are powerful, corrosive forces that destroy the lives of individuals, tear at  the social fabric, and weaken the rule of law in affected countries.

ONDCP established two overarching  policy goals in the 2010 Strategy for (1) curtailing illicit drug consumption  and (2) improving public health by reducing the consequences of drug  abuse, and seven overall sub goals under them that delineate specific  quantitative outcomes to be achieved by 2015, such as reducing drug- induced deaths by 15 percent. To support the achievement of these two  policy goals and seven sub goals (collectively referred to as overall  goals), the Strategy included seven strategic objectives and multiple  action items under each objective, with lead and participating agencies  designated for each action item. Strategy objectives include, for example,  \u201cStrengthen Efforts to Prevent Drug Use in Communities\u201d and \u201cDisrupt  Domestic Drug Trafficking and Production.\u201d Subsequent annual  Strategies provided updates on the implementation of action items,  included new action items intended to help address emerging drug- related problems, and highlighted initiatives and efforts that support the  Strategy\u2019s objectives.", "In March 2013, we reported that ONDCP and the federal agencies lacked  progress on achieving the Strategy goals and were in the process of  implementing a new mechanism to monitor progress. As we reported in  May 2016, ONDCP and the federal agencies had made moderate  progress toward achieving one goal, limited progress on three goals, and  no demonstrated progress on the remaining three goals. For example,  we reported that the rate of drug use for young adults aged 18 to 25 had  increased since 2009, moving in the opposite direction of the goal.  However, we also reported that HIV infections attributable to drug use,  one of the strategy\u2019s sub-measures, had decreased from 2009 to 2014  and had exceeded the strategy\u2019s established target. In many instances,  the data used to assess progress, while the most up to date at the time,  were several years old. Based on the most recent data available,  although some of the sub-measures, such as decreasing tobacco use by  eighth graders, were achieved, none of the seven overall goals in the  Strategy have been fully achieved as of July 2017.

Specifically, the reported rate of drug use for young adults  was 21.4 percent in 2009 and 22.3 percent in 2015, moving in the  opposite direction of the goal. Marijuana remained the drug used by  the highest percentage of young adults. According to the 2015  NSDUH, 19.8 percent of young adults reported having used marijuana  in the past month.

In our February 2017 report, we found that ONDCP and  SAMHSA had improved their joint management of the program.  Specifically, we found that ONDCP and SAMHSA employed leading  collaboration practices to administer the DFC program and fund a range  of drug prevention activities. For example, ONDCP and SAMHSA had  defined and agreed upon common outcomes, such as prioritizing efforts  to increase participation from under-represented communities. The two  agencies also had funded a range of DFC grantees\u2019 activities and report  on these activities in their annual evaluation reports. For example,  ONDCP reported that from February through July 2014, grantees  educated more than 156,000 youth on topics related to the consequences  of substance abuse. Other examples of grantees\u2019 efforts included those  that enhanced the skill sets of community members, including parents, to  identify drug abuse or limit access to prescription drugs and those that  reduced language barriers precluding non-English speakers from  understanding drug prevention campaigns.", "We also found that ONDCP and SAMHSA had operating procedures in  place, but SAMHSA did not consistently follow documentation and  reporting procedures to ensure grantees\u2019 compliance and had not  accurately reported to ONDCP on grantee compliance.
