In recent years, corporate governance and accountability have received increased scrutiny and emphasis in the nonprofit, federal government, and public company sectors. Governance and accountability problems have also been identified at designated federal entities (DFE) such as the Smithsonian Institution, the Legal Services Corporation, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. This report responds to a congressional request that GAO describe (1) the statutory structure of the governing bodies for each DFE organization and (2) the role of the inspectors general (IGs) in the governance structure. To accomplish this, GAO surveyed the DFE heads and IGs on governance issues and reviewed information from a variety of sources, including the IG Act and subsequent amendments; enabling legislation for the DFEs; and legislative and regulatory standards and requirements for financial reporting and internal control. GAO is not making specific recommendations in this report, but is providing this information for consideration in future efforts to update the governance of DFEs, oversee the entities and their IGs, and continue work to improve the effectiveness of government. GAO received technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The DFEs vary in structure and requirements for governance. At the time of GAO's review, the designated size of the governing bodies of the 31 DFEs ranged from 1 to 24 members. Fifteen had at least one vacancy and 2 had more vacancies than sitting members. The frequency of DFE multimember governing-body meetings ranged from daily to rarely or not at all. In GAO's survey of DFEs, 13 indicated that they are required to comply with 12 key statutes that cover management and accountability. The remaining 18 reported varying requirements, with one not subject to any of the statutes. Only 7 DFE governing bodies have a structure that includes governance or oversight committees for ensuring oversight of management decisions, results of operations, and emerging risks. While 19 DFEs reported having orientation programs for new governing body members, only 9 reported ongoing training. IG effectiveness is influenced by an entity's governance structure and practices. Within DFEs, IGs vary in their role and relationship with management. IGs are charged with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse; conducting audits and investigations; and recommending policies to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. To accomplish these objectives, IGs must be able to establish and maintain independence; have control of their resources to plan and perform work; recruit, retain, and manage sufficient professional staff; and be able to resolve audit and investigation recommendations. GAO's survey of IGs showed that most report to the highest levels in their entities, a legislative requirement that is a key element of independence. At the same time, the IGs had limited control over their resources, and their budgets and staffing were not always adequate to perform needed audits and investigations. Only 3 IGs had the transparency that a separate line item in their entity's budget provides, and 8 needed management approval for spending. Audit resolution varied, with some IGs reporting a lack of entity responsiveness to recommendations. Only 10 DFEs reported that their governing bodies have written policies for monitoring the implementation of IG recommendations. Nine of the 10 have policies that require the governing body to respond in writing and to develop a plan to address recommendations. During the course of GAO's work, Congress passed and the President signed into law on October 14, 2008, the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, which was intended to enhance IG independence. Its implementation may mitigate some of the issues GAO found."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, corporate governance and accountability processes have  received increased scrutiny and emphasis in the nonprofit, federal  government, and public company sectors as a result of accountability  breakdowns, most notably in the public company financial scandals that  led to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Governance is the  framework of rules and practices by which a governing body, such as a  board of directors, ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency in  the entity\u2019s relationship with all of its stakeholders, including  management, employees, and government. Governance and accountability  problems have also been identified at federal entities, including the  Smithsonian Institution, Legal Services Corporation, and the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation, all of which are considered designated  federal entities (DFE).", "DFEs are the entities listed in the Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act),  as amended, which requires the head of each entity to establish an office  of inspector general (IG) and appoint an IG. Currently there are 31 DFEs,  which include boards, commissions, authorities, endowments, institutions,  agencies, and administrations created by statute to serve unique functions  and purposes. In fiscal year 2007, these entities were responsible for  annual budgets ranging from $10 million to $80 billion. The effectiveness  and independence of the DFE IG are closely related to the governance  structure of the DFE and the role that the IG plays within that structure.  IGs must be able to operate independently within the governance  framework at their respective agencies in order to be effective.", "In response to your interest in governance issues in the DFEs, this report  provides information about DFE governing bodies and the role of the IGs  in DFE governance. The purpose of this report is not to make conclusions  on the effectiveness of governance and IG practices for each entity, but to  provide information for consideration in future oversight. In evaluating the  various governance practices for each entity, a variety of factors need to  be considered including the entity\u2019s size, structure, mission, and risks. The  specific objectives of this report are to (1) describe and summarize the  statutory structure of the governing bodies for each DFE organization and  (2) describe the role of the IGs within the governance structure and  relationship with management of their respective agencies.", "To obtain the information needed for our two reporting objectives, we  reviewed and summarized information from a variety of sources, including  the IG Act and subsequent amendments; enabling legislation for the DFEs;  and relevant legislative and regulatory standards and requirements for  financial reporting and internal control. Based on prior governance and IG  work, we developed and conducted a survey of DFE agency heads and,  separately, DFE IGs,  regarding governing body structure, communication  between governing body and IG, staffing and budget for the IG, and  number of IG recommendations. In addition, we conducted interviews  with certain DFE agency heads and IGs to clarify survey answers and  obtain additional information. We also sent the general counsels of each  DFE a data request asking the entity to identify which of 12 governance  and accountability statutes that we selected for review it is subject to,  voluntarily complies with, or does not follow. We refer to these  instruments in our report as the entity head survey, the IG survey, and the  data request. Appendix I contains a more complete description of our  scope and methodology. We conducted this engagement from September  2007 to January 2009 in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality  Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objective.

Their heads may be individuals, such as a  chairperson or a director, or groups, such as commissions or boards.  Individuals and members of commissions and boards are generally  appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but members for  some entities are set statutorily without additional appointment and  confirmation. For instance, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\u2019s  statute sets the corporation\u2019s board members as the Secretary of Labor,  Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce, all of whom are  appointed to their cabinet positions by the President and confirmed by the  Senate.", "Each year, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determines and  publishes a list of DFEs and their heads. OMB uses the definition under  the IG Act, as amended, for the head of a DFE, which is any person or  persons designated by statute as the head of the DFE or if no such  designation exists, the chief policymaking officer or board of the DFE. It  is important to note that the term governing body for purposes of this  report is broad and therefore could include members in addition to the  entity head under the IG Act, as amended.", "Table 1 shows the 31 DFEs categorized by organizational structure and  entity head for 2008.", "Governance can be described as the process of providing leadership,  direction, and accountability in fulfilling an organization\u2019s mission,  meeting its objectives, and providing stewardship of public resources,  while establishing clear lines of responsibility for results. Accountability  represents the processes, mechanisms, and other means\u2014including  financial reporting and internal controls\u2014by which an entity\u2019s  management carries out its stewardship and responsibility for resources  and performance. Commonly accepted governance practices for federal  entities and nonprofit corporations have significantly evolved since the  financial scandals at large public companies in the early 2000s and passage  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act outlined a  framework for more effective corporate governance and introduced  reforms to public company financial reporting and auditing. Although the  act strengthened corporate governance only in the private sector, the  federal government and nonprofit sectors have also strengthened  governance and internal control requirements and practices. According to  OMB, passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act served as an impetus for the  federal government to reevaluate its current policies related to internal  control over financial reporting and management\u2019s related responsibility.", "The Inspector General Act of 1978 (1978 IG Act) created offices of  inspectors general at major departments and agencies to prevent and  detect fraud and abuse in their departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 programs and  operations; conduct audits and investigations; and recommend policies to  promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. In 1988, the 1978 IG Act  was amended to establish additional IG offices in certain federal entities  designated by the legislation. Generally, the DFE IGs have the same  authorities and responsibilities as those established by the 1978 IG Act, but  there is a clear distinction\u2014they are appointed and removed by their  agency heads rather than by the President and are not subject to Senate  confirmation. The 31 DFE IGs make up about half of all IG offices  established under the IG Act, as amended, and in fiscal year 2007 were  responsible for oversight with respect to gross agency budgets that ranged  from $10 million to $80.2 billion.", "The IG Reform Act of 2008 (2008 Reform Act) was enacted on October  14, 2008, to, among other things, enhance the independence of the  inspectors general. (We have reported several times on independence  issues and challenges for the IG community.) Specifically, the 2008  Reform Act provides that both the President and DFE heads must give  written reasons to Congress for removing an IG at least 30 days prior to  removal. The 2008 Reform Act mandates that IGs shall submit their budget  to their entity\u2019s head, who shall include, among other things, an aggregate  request for the IG in the entity\u2019s budget proposal to the President. The  President must include in the budget of the U.S. government submitted to  Congress a separate statement of each IG\u2019s budget request, and the  amount requested by the President for each IG. Before the act, only the  presidentially appointed IGs and three DFE IGs had such transparency  over their budgets. Regarding pay, the presidentially appointed IGs have  been paid at Executive Level IV, while the DFE IGs have been paid at the  GS-15 grade, Senior Executive Service level, or equivalent salary level  determined by their entity. The 2008 Reform Act requires that all  presidentially appointed IGs be paid at Executive Level III, plus 3 percent,  and all DFE IGs shall be paid at a level at or above the level of a majority  of senior executives of the respective DFEs.

DFEs vary in  their statutory size and structure as well as their statutory purpose and  requirements for governance. Survey responses showed that the size of  DFE governing bodies ranges from 1 to 24 members. Thirteen of the 31  DFEs had at least one vacancy in their governing body. At 2 of the DFEs\u2014 the Consumer Product Safety Commission and National Labor Relations  Board\u2014active members were outnumbered by vacancies. Only 7 of 29  DFE governing bodies have committees that deal with governance or  oversight. Committees can enhance the overall effectiveness of the  governing body by ensuring focus and oversight in areas of concern. In  order to improve governance and accountability at federal agencies, a  variety of laws covering a range of management and administrative  practices and processes have been enacted. Of 12 key governance and  accountability statutes that we selected for review, 13 of 31 DFEs  responded that they are statutorily required to comply with all 12  statutes. Based on the responses of the remaining 18 DFEs, the  applicability of the 12 statutes varied, with 1 DFE\u2014the Corporation for  Public Broadcasting\u2014stating that it is not subject to any of the 12 key  governance and accountability statutes. Some entities that said they are  not statutorily required to comply with the statutes indicated that they  have adopted the provisions voluntarily or implemented an alternative  mechanism to attain the objectives of the statute. Finally, in relation to the  governing body\u2019s effectiveness, 19 of the 29 DFEs surveyed reported  having orientation programs for the new governing body, while only 10  DFEs reported having ongoing training for governing body members.  Orientation and training programs for governing body members aimed at  providing information on governance practices and the regulatory  environment are important for the DFE governing body\u2019s ability to carry  out its responsibilities effectively and efficiently. Corporate governance  guidelines in the private sector state that governing bodies should  establish committees that will enhance their overall effectiveness by  ensuring focus and oversight for areas of concern.

Current  private sector guidance says that governing bodies need to be large  enough to accommodate the necessary skills set, but still small enough to  promote cohesion, flexibility, and effective participation. The DFE\u2019s  governing bodies range in size from 1 to 24 members. For comparison,  according to the 2006 edition of the annual Directors\u2019 Compensation and  Board Practices report by The Conference Board, the median board size  of publicly traded corporations, depending on the industry, ranges from 9  to 11 members. Of the 31 DFEs, only the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting, Legal Services Corporation, and United States Postal  Service statutorily have 9 to 11 governing body members. Three entities\u2014 the National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and  Appalachian Regional Commission\u2014statutorily have more than 11  members, while the remaining 25 DFEs have 8 or fewer governing-body  members. (See table 2.)", "At the time of our review, vacancies reportedly outnumbered active  members on the governing bodies of the Consumer Product Safety  Commission (CPSC) and the National Labor Relations Board. In recent  years, Amtrak and the Federal Election Commission have also had  significant vacancies. In January 2008, four of the six commissioner seats  for the Federal Election Commission were vacant. Over the past several  years the number of active board members at Amtrak has fluctuated, and  at least twice\u2014between December 2007 and March 2008 and between  October 2003 and June 2004\u2014the board had only two voting members  (excluding the Secretary of Transportation or his designee). Without the  minimum number of members required to conduct business, a board may  be legally unable to make certain decisions. For instance, the Federal  Election Commission\u2019s enabling legislation requires that four of its six  commissioners be present for certain entity business to be carried out.  Also, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National  Endowment for the Arts governing bodies, which are single-member  governing bodies, are currently vacant.", "According to The Conference Board\u2019s corporate governance guidelines,  corporate boards should be structured so that the composition and skill  set of a board is appropriate based on the corporation\u2019s particular  challenges and strategic vision.

In addition, governing bodies have  established committees to focus on issues or particular concerns of the  board such as risk, technology, public policy, and corporate governance.  Committees handle specific issues or topics and usually make policy  recommendations for the full board to consider.", "Most DFEs do not have governance or internal oversight committees.  However, DFEs, like all federal entities, do receive oversight by  congressional committees. Of the 29 DFEs responding to our survey, only  7\u2014the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Election Assistance  Commission, Federal Reserve Board, Legal Services Corporation, National  Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and United States Postal  Service\u2014indicated that they have committees or advisory panels for  enhancing governing body effectiveness that are commonly found in  public companies or nonprofit organizations. As shown in table 5, 5 of  those 7 have audit committees. None of the 29 governing bodies  responding to our survey reported having a standing ethics committee.  (See table 5.)", "Some federal entities have applied private sector corporate governance  guidelines for oversight committees in response to recent governance  challenges or reports on governance and accountability practices. Some of  these challenges have even resulted in board reorganization and other  governance changes. For instance, in response to an IG report, the  Corporation for Public Broadcasting created a governance committee for  its board and revised the board\u2019s by-laws to clarify the board\u2019s and  president\u2019s roles. In response to a GAO report, the Legal Services  Corporation created an audit committee and also added the  responsibilities of corporate governance to its Performance Review  committee, which was renamed Governance and Performance Review.  Based on recommendations of the Smithsonian Institution Board of  Regents\u2019 Governance Committee, the board adopted a set of duties and  responsibilities for all regents, examined the board structure, and  appointed new leadership for each committee. In the last 3 years, the  United States Postal Service has added the role of governance to the  responsibilities of its Strategic Planning Committee, added the  Government Relations and Regulatory Committee, and developed a plan to  comply with the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.

Governing bodies establish committees to enhance the overall  effectiveness of the board by ensuring focus on and oversight of matters of  particular concern. Since the IG is responsible for preventing and  detecting fraud and abuse, conducting audits and investigations, and  recommending policies to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness,  the work of an IG at an entity can benefit the governing body, particularly  governing body and committee efforts to focus on issues and provide  oversight of the entity. Because single-member governing bodies and other  noncorporate entity governing bodies have many of the same  responsibilities as corporate boards of directors, we believe that public  company and nonprofit corporation governance practices may provide  benefits to those governing bodies.", "Only five of the DFE governing bodies indicated they have an audit  committee, which is one of the key elements in effective corporate  governance. According to the National Council on Nonprofits Association,  an audit committee provides independent oversight of the organization\u2019s  accounting and financial reporting and oversees the organization\u2019s annual  audits. In the private sector, an audit committee is generally responsible  for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the external auditor;  handling board communication with the external auditor regarding  financial reporting matters; and overseeing the entity\u2019s financial reporting  and the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting. In the federal  government environment, the audit committee could also provide a key  venue for the IG\u2019s role in governance and in communicating with those  charged with governance. Unless provided otherwise, the IG is responsible  for conducting or overseeing the annual agency audit. New auditing  standards reinforce the importance of communication between the  financial auditor and those overseeing the organization\u2019s governance. The  auditing standards require that the auditor communicate with those  charged with governance, who have the duty to oversee the strategic  direction of the entity and obligations related to the accountability of the  entity. The standards recognize that multiple parties may be charged with  governance including oversight bodies, members of legislative  committees, boards of directors, audit committees, or parties contracting  the audit. Without an audit committee, organizations may find it more  difficult to ensure that weaknesses found during the financial audit as well  as IG recommendations are addressed properly.", "None of the DFE governing bodies has a separate standing ethics  committee. An ethics committee is responsible for ensuring that the  organization has systems in place to provide assurance over employee  compliance with the organization\u2019s code of conduct and ethics.
