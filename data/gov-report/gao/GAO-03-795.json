While it was too early to fully assess the effectiveness of their actions, SEC could be doing more to maximize its use of Treasury's collection services. SEC has implemented regulations, procedures, collections guidelines, and controls for using the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), which applies payments the federal government owes to debtors to their outstanding debts. However, SEC has been focusing on referring to TOP those delinquent cases with amounts levied after its new collections guidelines went into effect. The agency has not developed a formal strategy for referring older cases, reducing the likelihood of collecting monies on what could be more than a billion dollars of delinquent debt. Further impeding collection efforts, SEC does not have a reliable system for tracking monies owed on these older cases and therefore could not determine which cases were not being referred to TOP. SEC has drafted an action plan for a new system to track all cases with a monetary judgment. Once the system is in place, the agency should have a tool for identifying all cases, including older delinquent cases that can be referred to TOP. However, SEC has not established a time frame for fully implementing the plan. GAO's calculations for closed cases (collection actions completed) showed that regulators' collection rates on fines imposed between 1997 and August 2002 equaled or exceeded those from 1992 to 1996. Recalculating the rates to include closed and open cases (collection actions ongoing) affected SEC's and CFTC's collection rates, primarily because of a few large uncollected fines."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Collecting fines ordered for violations of securities and futures laws helps  ensure that violators are held accountable for their offenses and may also  deter future violations.

These reports made several recommendations to help  SEC and CFTC improve their collection programs and their oversight of the  sanctioning practices of self-regulatory organizations (SRO).", "This report responds to your July 30, 2001, request that we evaluate the  actions that SEC and CFTC have taken in response to the  recommendations made in our earlier fines collection reports.

To assess  SEC\u2019s and CFTC\u2019s efforts to enhance their oversight of the SROs\u2019  sanctioning practices, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed  related data. To calculate the fines collection rates for 1997\u20132002 for all the  SROs except NASD, we used data provided by SEC, CFTC, and the  regulators for fines levied from January 1997 through August 2002. Because  of the way its financial system was designed, NASD\u2019s calculations are  based on fines invoiced through December 2002.

Similarly, in 1974 the Commodity Exchange Act established CFTC as an  independent agency to oversee the U.S. commodity futures and options  markets. Both agencies have five-member commissions headed by  chairpersons who are appointed by the President of the United States for   5-year terms. Among other things, the commissioners approve new SEC  and SRO rules and amendments to existing rules. They also authorize  enforcement actions. SEC and CFTC are headquartered in Washington,  D.C. SEC has a combined total of 11 regional and district offices; CFTC has  5 regional offices.", "Within SEC and CFTC, the divisions of enforcement are responsible for  investigating possible violations of the securities and futures laws,  respectively. With their commissions\u2019 approval, they litigate or settle  actions against alleged violators in federal civil courts and in administrative  actions. Typically, enforcement staff investigate alleged violations of law,  prepare a memorandum for the commissioners that describes alleged  violations, and, if appropriate, make recommendations for further action.  When the commissions decide that a case warrants further action, they can  authorize filing a civil suit against the alleged violator in federal district  court or instituting a proceeding before an administrative law judge. If  either the court or the administrative law judge finds that a defendant has  violated securities or futures laws, it can issue a judgment ordering  sanctions such as fines and disgorgements and, in the case of futures  violations, restitution; it can also bar or suspend violators from the  securities and futures industries.", "The collection process for delinquent debt begins when all or part of a fine  or disgorgement becomes delinquent because the violator has failed to pay  some or all of the amount due by the date ordered by the court or  administrative law judge. If the court or administrative law judge has not  specified a payment date and no stay has been entered, SEC considers the  debt delinquent 10 days after the court enters the judgment. CFTC officials  told us that absent an appeal, they consider the debt delinquent 15 or   60 days after the administrative law judge or court entered the judgment in  administrative and civil cases, respectively. SEC and CFTC collect  delinquent monetary judgments primarily through post-judgment litigation,  negotiating payments with defendants, and making referrals to the  Department of Treasury or the Department of Justice.", "In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, SEC and  CFTC have each entered into an agreement with the Department of  Treasury to improve collections. Under this act, federal agencies are  required to submit all nontax debts that are 180 days delinquent to  Treasury\u2019s FMS.  The act also requires that FMS either take appropriate  steps to collect the debt or terminate collection actions. In addition to  using traditional methods to collect these debts, such as sending demand  letters and hiring private collection agencies, FMS can use TOP. Under TOP,  FMS identifies federal payments, such as tax refunds, that are owed to  individuals and applies the payments to their outstanding debt. All cases  referred to FMS for collection are also eligible for referral to and servicing  under TOP. FMS also uses collection agencies to negotiate compromise  offers with individual debtors. A compromise offer is an agreement  between a federal agency and an individual debtor, in which the federal  agency agrees to discharge a debt by accepting less than the full amount.  Once the collection agency negotiates a compromise offer with a debtor, it  forwards the offer to FMS. In the absence of an agreement between FMS  and the federal agency to approve compromise offers on its behalf, FMS  refers the offer to the federal agency for final approval.", "The U.S. securities and futures markets are regulated under their  respective statutes through a combination of self-regulation (subject to  federal oversight) and direct federal regulation. This regulatory scheme  was intended to give SROs responsibility for administering their own  operations, including most of the daily oversight of the securities and  futures markets and their participants. Two of the SROs\u2014NASD and  NFA\u2014are associations that regulate registered securities and futures firms  and oversee securities and futures professionals, respectively. The  remaining SROs include national exchanges that operate the markets  where securities and futures are traded. These SROs are primarily  responsible for establishing the standards under which their members  conduct business; monitoring the way that business is conducted; and  bringing disciplinary actions against their members for violating applicable  federal statutes, their own rules, and the rules promulgated by their federal  regulator. SROs can impose fines and other sanctions against members that  violate securities or futures laws or SRO rules, as applicable, through their  enforcement and disciplinary processes. Some SROs\u2019 disciplinary  proceedings are decided by a hearing panel, which examines the evidence  and decides on the appropriate sanction.

SEC also  created a collections database for all post-guidelines fines and  disgorgement cases that is maintained by headquarters and each regional  or district office, as applicable. The database tracks actions that staff have  taken to recover debt on delinquent cases, including preparing cases for  referral to FMS, and is used to help ensure that staff are following the new  collections guidelines. SEC officials told us that the agency was tracking  only post-guidelines cases because the database had limited storage  capacity and could become unstable if too many cases were added.

Further  impeding its collection efforts, SEC\u2019s original system for tracking monies  owed in pre-guidelines cases\u2014DPTS\u2014was not reliable. As a result, SEC  could not identify all the cases that had not been referred to FMS and TOP.  SEC officials told us that the agency\u2019s April 2002 procedures applied to the  pre-guidelines cases and that agency attorneys had followed these  procedures in referring some pre-guidelines cases to Treasury.

SEC  and NYSE also said that many reputable businesses provide fingerprinting  services and that SRO member firms could contract with these businesses.", "In a 1996 CFTC review of NFA\u2019s registration fitness program, CFTC  recommended that NFA conduct a review to determine the feasibility of  adopting controls to ensure that the fingerprints submitted for criminal  history checks belonged to the applicant. NFA found that a number of  obstacles stood in the way of establishing an effective program to verify  fingerprints. According to an NFA official, the agency examined the  procedures of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services of the  Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and  Naturalization Service) in responding to CFTC\u2019s recommendation. On the  basis of this examination, NFA concluded that it would not be cost- effective to replicate the bureau\u2019s procedures. For example, unlike NFA,  the bureau has fingerprinting sites throughout the country with trained  employees to take fingerprints. As part of its review, NFA considered  requiring an attestation form, which would include the fingerprinter\u2019s name  and address and the document used to verify the applicant\u2019s identity.  Ultimately, however, NFA concluded that such a form could be subject to  forgery and would not provide assurance that the fingerprints belonged to  the applicant. CFTC accepted NFA\u2019s conclusions.", "NYSE and NFA officials described other obstacles to establishing controls  over fingerprinting. They explained that space limitations on the FBI  fingerprint card made it difficult to identify the person taking the  fingerprints. Further, they said that the card provided space for the  fingerprinter\u2019s signature, which is often illegible, but not for the  fingerprinter\u2019s printed name or the name of another contact who could  verify information related to the fingerprints. NYSE officials also said that  the FBI could adjust its fingerprint card so that it required more complete  contact information for the person taking the fingerprints. An NFA official  also told us that because some SROs process registration applications both  nationally and internationally, these SROs would not be able to establish  enforceable rules regarding who should take fingerprints.", "We did not determine the extent to which individuals with a criminal  history could submit someone else\u2019s fingerprints and thus enter the  securities or futures industries undetected. However, SEC and CFTC  officials said that the SROs\u2019 fingerprinting processes are vulnerable to such  a practice because of the lack of controls for preventing applicants from  using someone else\u2019s fingerprints as their own. SRO officials said that  existing systems were reasonably designed to prevent fraud but were not  foolproof, adding that the potential cost of imposing any unduly restrictive  requirements was a concern. Some SRO officials said that to the extent  they are needed, SEC and CFTC should establish industrywide standards.  NFA officials said that since weaknesses in fingerprinting procedures apply  equally to the securities and futures industries, SEC and CFTC should  establish comparable requirements to ensure that one industry is not at a  disadvantage to the other.

The collection rates for closed cases (cases with a final  judgment order for which all collection actions were completed) for SEC,CFTC, and the SROs from January 1997 to August 2002 showed that the  regulators collected most of the fines imposed. Broadening the analysis to  include open cases (cases with a final judgment order that remained open  while collection efforts continued) had the greatest impact on SEC\u2019s and  CFTC\u2019s collection rates because of a few large uncollected fines. Our  analysis of the collection rates highlights a theme introduced in an earlier  report that the collection rate alone may not be a valid measure of the  effectiveness of collection efforts, because collections can be influenced by  factors that are outside regulators\u2019 control."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SEC, CFTC, and the SROs Collected Almost All Fines in Closed Cases", "paragraphs": ["SEC, CFTC, and the SROs collected between 75 and 100 percent of all the  fines imposed in closed cases. For these cases, collection efforts had  ceased either because the fines had been collected in full or in part or were  unlikely to be collected and thus had been written off as bad debts. As  shown in table 1, SEC and CFTC collected about 94 and 99 percent,  respectively, of the total dollars levied in cases closed from January 1997  through August 2002\u2014the period immediately following the one covered in  our 1998 fines report. These amounts represent an 11 and 18 percentage  point increase, respectively, over the rates presented in the 1998 report,  which covered the 1992\u201396 period. CFTC wrote off fewer fines as  uncollectible in the more recent period, and almost all of its collected fines  were paid in full.", "The eight securities and futures SROs for which data were available had the  same or higher collection rates on closed cases in the most recent period  compared with the earlier period. The Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s collection  rate showed significant improvement, increasing from 54 to 95 percent of  the total dollars levied. Its collection rate for the 1992\u201396 period was  heavily influenced by two large uncollected fines totaling $2.25 million.  Excluding those two cases, the rate for this period would have been about  99 percent rather than 54 percent\u2014much closer to the 95 percent rate for  the more recent period. NASD\u2019s and NFA\u2019s rates also showed significant  improvement, increasing 71 and 48 percentage points, respectively, over  the rates presented in the 1998 report, which covered the 1992\u201396 period.  However, NASD\u2019s and NFA\u2019s collection rates improved because, as we have  noted, the regulators stopped routinely assessing fines when barring  individuals from the securities and futures industry.

(See appendix III for the  collection rates of the securities regulators for open and closed cases by  calendar year.)   For example, in 1999 SEC collected 26 percent of the total  fines levied in that year, but one uncollected fine of $123 million  significantly lowered the rate. Had SEC been able to collect this one fine,  its collection rate for 1999 would have been 89 percent (fig. 1). Also, in  2002, SEC collected 61 percent of all fines, but approximately half came  from two payments made by two violators. Excluding these payments, the  reported collection rate for 2002 would have been about 30 percent (fig. 1).", "To help control for the influence of large dollar amounts on SEC\u2019s  collection rates, we analyzed the number of cases paid in full and found  that SEC had collected the full amount of the fine in the majority of cases it  levied. For the entire period from 1997 through 2001, 72 percent of the fines  levied had been paid in full. In 2002, 55 percent of the fines levied were paid  in full. The rate may be lower for 2002 because SEC has had less time\u2014 approximately 4 months\u2014to collect on cases levied through August 2002.", "CFTC collected about 45 percent of the total dollar amount of the fines it  levied over the same period. Like SEC\u2019s rate, CFTC\u2019s was heavily influenced  by a few large fines. A closer review of CFTC\u2019s annual rates from January  1997 through August 2002 showed that the regulator collected between 2  and 90 percent of the total fines levied. (See appendix IV for the collection  rates of the futures regulators for open and closed cases by calendar year.)   But in 2000, when CFTC\u2019s collection rate was just 2 percent, our  calculations included a single uncollected fine of $90 million.

Also, in 1998, when CFTC collected 90 percent of the total  dollar amount levied through August 2002, one payment for $125 million  heavily skewed the rate (fig. 2). Without this one payment and fine, CFTC\u2019s  reported collection rate would have been approximately 7 percent (fig. 2).", "To help control for the influence that large dollar amounts can have on the  rate, we again analyzed the number of cases paid in full. Over the entire  period of our study, from 1997 through August 2002, CFTC had collected  the full amount in slightly more than 50 percent of the cases it levied.  Although CFTC\u2019s collection rates over the entire period of our study were  relatively low, the agency was actively pursuing collections on all its  uncollected cases, primarily through the Departments of Treasury and  Justice. CFTC\u2019s Chief of Cooperative Enforcement told us that the agency  would continue to levy large fines when appropriate, even though large  uncollectible amounts could reduce the agency\u2019s collection rate. He said  that levying fines that are commensurate with the related wrongdoing  sends a message to the public that CFTC is serious about enforcing its  statutes.", "The collection rates for the nine securities and futures SROs were  comparable in both sets of calculations (see table 2). When we included  open cases in our calculations, these SROs\u2019 collection rates decreased  slightly, with all but two (NASD\u2019s and the New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s)  declining between 1 and 9 percentage points. One reason for the relatively  small decline was that these SROs generally had fewer and smaller  uncollected fines, suggesting that they had been more successful in  collecting on all cases than SEC and CFTC. According to an NFA official,  one reason that the SROs that operate markets had higher collection rates  was that in their role as exchanges they could sell a member\u2019s \u201cseat,\u201d or  membership, to pay off the fine, giving members an incentive to pay their  fines. Because other regulators do not have this type of leverage, their rates  are typically lower.", "NASD\u2019s collection rate for closed cases was 95 percent and its rate for open  and closed cases was 66 percent\u2014a change of 29 percentage points.  NASD\u2019s rate for open and closed cases was affected by low collections in  1997 and 1998. As a result, the rates did not necessarily reflect the effects of  the changes NASD made to its fine imposition practices in October 1999. As  indicated in figure 3, NASD\u2019s annual collection rates generally increased  from January 1997 through December 2002. In 1997, NASD collected 26  percent of the total dollars invoiced. In 2002, it collected 96 percent\u2014a 70  percentage point increase over 6 years. As we reported earlier, one of the  primary reasons for the increases was a change in the way NASD imposes  fines. Specifically, NASD stopped routinely assessing fines when barring an  individual from the industry, reducing the number of fines it invoiced each  year and improving its overall collection rate. Also, in calculating its rate,  NASD excluded about $137 million in fines that would be due and payable  only if the fined individuals were to reenter the securities industry. The  New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s collection rate for open and closed cases  was 83 percent\u2014a decline of 17 percentage points from its closed case  rate.

Nonetheless, examining the rates and  the factors influencing them can be a starting point for obtaining an  understanding of regulators\u2019 performance and changes to it. Also, in  exploring these rates regulators can identify cases that account for a  significant share of uncollected debts and decide whether continuing with  collection efforts for these cases is worthwhile.", "Primary among the external factors affecting collection rates are the large  fines and payments that we have been discussing. Just one or two  extremely large uncollected fines can lower a collection rate significantly.  Similarly, one or two large payments on such fines can raise a collection  rate. Other external factors that can influence collection rates include  violators\u2019 ability to pay and the size of the fines themselves. For example,  an SEC official said that some violators who have been barred from the  industry cannot pay their fines because their earning capacity has been  limited. In discussing CFTC\u2019s relatively low collection rate, an agency  official told us that the courts, in an attempt to match the gravity of the  sanction to the offense, have sometimes imposed fines that are more than  what an agency might realistically be able to collect. This official said that  in one case, a court fined a company $90 million\u2014triple the monetary gain  from its illegal activities.

Developing a formal strategy that prioritizes pre-guidelines cases based on  their collection potential and establishes time frames for their referral to  FMS and TOP would improve the likelihood of collecting some portion of  the debt associated with these cases, which could be more than $1 billion.", "The success of SEC\u2019s efforts to collect this debt will be closely related to  the timely replacement of DPTS. Phase one of SEC\u2019s action plan includes a  tentative deadline for replacing DPTS by the end of fiscal year 2003. At that  time, SEC will be able to identify all cases eligible for referral to FMS and  TOP and develop a strategy for making these referrals. SEC has not yet set  a milestone for completing the requirements analysis for phase two of its  action plan or established a date to fully implement the computer system  that will integrate SEC\u2019s now separate databases.

Finally, while controls were in place that should keep barred  individuals from being readmitted to the securities and futures industries,  neither the related statutes, SEC, or CFTC require the SROs to ensure that  the fingerprints sent to the FBI for use in criminal history checks belong to  the applicants who submit them. In the absence of such a requirement, the  SROs lacked related controls that could help prevent inappropriate  admissions to the securities and futures industries.

Of the 66 cases, four were eligible for  referral at the time of our review. We selected cases where judgments or  orders were entered after SEC\u2019s guidelines took effect, because staff told  us they were tracking the referral of those cases.

To assess both SEC\u2019s and CFTC\u2019s  efforts to periodically assess the pattern of readmission applications, we  interviewed officials of these agencies to determine the number of  readmission applications from barred individuals and reviewed  documentation that described the controls used to keep barred applicants  from reapplying. We focused our review on permanent bars and application  records since NASD and NFA changed their fine imposition practices in  October 1999 and December 1998, respectively. To validate both agencies\u2019  statements that they had not reviewed any readmission applications from  barred individuals since our 2001 report, we obtained the names of barred  individuals from NASD and NFA and verified that each individual had not  applied for readmission. Specifically, for NASD, we compared the names of  over 900 barred applicants who had not been fined against a list of  readmission applications. We focused on these individuals because of  concerns that individuals who had been barred and not fined might be  more willing to seek readmission than those who had been barred and  fined. For NFA, we researched the histories of 32 barred individuals, using  NFA\u2019s database to validate that none of the individuals had applied for  readmission. We examined all barred applicants, including both those who  had been fined and those who had not been, because the data did not allow  us to distinguish between these groups. To ensure that NFA\u2019s and NASD\u2019s  data were sound, we interviewed agency officials to assess the controls  these agencies had over their data systems, such as their processes for  entering and updating data, safeguards for protecting the data against  unauthorized changes, and any tests conducted to verify the accuracy and  completeness of the data. We found that the data were useable for our  purposes.", "To address concerns that surfaced during our review about controls over  the fingerprinting procedures used in criminal history checks, we  interviewed officials at NASD, NFA, NYSE, and the FBI and reviewed laws  and regulations related to fingerprinting. In addition to NYSE, other SROs  that operate markets have agreements with the FBI under which they may  submit fingerprints to the FBI for criminal history checks. We limited our  review to NYSE because it is the largest SRO that operates a market, and  we wanted to determine how another SRO\u2019s procedures might differ from  those of NASD and NFA.", "To calculate the fines collection rates for SEC, CFTC, and nine securities  and futures SROs for 1997 through 2002 (all years were calendar years), we  focused on these regulators\u2019 imposition and collection of fines through  their enforcement and disciplinary programs. The nine SROs included the  American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the  Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago  Stock Exchange, NASD, NFA, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and  NYSE. We excluded fines for minor rule infringements such as floor  conduct, decorum, and record-keeping violations that normally do not  undergo disciplinary proceedings. The exchanges generally referred to  these violations as \u201ctraffic ticket\u201d violations, and they are handled through  summary proceedings and involve smaller fine amounts. We excluded  amounts owed for disgorgement and restitution, except for NASD, because  these sanctions are different from fines in that they are imposed to return  illegally made profits or to restore funds illegally taken from investors. Due  to the way NASD tracked its fines and payments, NASD was unable to  exclude disgorgement amounts from its payment data. We also excluded  fines that were not invoiced, because they would not be due unless the  fined individual sought to reenter the securities industry. All other fines  were factored into the rate, including fines dismissed in bankruptcy, to  obtain the most complete view possible of the regulators\u2019 efforts to  discipline violators.", "To calculate annual fines collection rates and composite collection rates,  we obtained and analyzed data from SEC, CFTC, and all SROs, except  NASD, on fines levied from January 1997 through August 2002, and  collected through December 2002. NASD\u2019s data include fines invoiced from  1997 through 2002. We limited our review to fines levied through August  2002 to allow regulators through December 2002 (4 months) to attempt  collections. We calculated the collection rate in two ways. First, we  calculated the rate by including only closed cases\u2014that is, cases with a  final judgment order for which all collection actions were completed. This  approach is consistent with the one used in our 1998 report.  Second, to  provide a more complete view of regulators\u2019 collection activities, we  calculated the rate using all closed and open cases\u2014that is, cases with a  final judgment order for which collections actions were completed and  cases with a final judgment order that remained open while collection  efforts continued. For cases with a payment plan, we adjusted the levy  amount to the amount owed as of December 31, 2002, because a portion of  the original levied amount was not yet due. We could not do this for SEC or  NASD because agency data did not specify the amount owed as of  December 31, 2002. As a result, SEC\u2019s and NASD\u2019s rate may be understated.", "We also used NASD\u2019s calculations of its collection rates, because the design  of NASD\u2019s financial system did not allow us to calculate these rates with an  acceptable degree of accuracy using the approach we applied to other  SROs. First, according to NASD officials, NASD\u2019s calculations used the date  a fine was invoiced instead of the date it was levied. Fines were typically  invoiced between 15 and 45 days after they were levied. This difference  may have had a minor effect, particularly on the annual collection rates.  Second, NASD\u2019s collection rates represent the total amount collected up to  December 31, 2002, on fines invoiced from January 1997 through December  2002 (as opposed to the August 31, 2002, date for the other SROs). Third,  because NASD\u2019s system could not identify cases on a payment plan,  NASD\u2019s calculations do not adjust the fine amount to the amount owing as  of December 31, 2002, exerting a slight bias toward understating the  collection rate. Fourth, NASD\u2019s collection rates (1) include disgorgement  because NASD was not able to separate such amounts from its payment  data and (2) exclude fines that were levied but not invoiced because such  fines were not due unless the fined individual sought to reenter the  securities industry.", "We also assessed the reliability of the data provided by the 11 regulators by  asking officials about agency controls for collecting fines and payment  data, supervising data entry, safeguarding the data from unauthorized  changes, and processing that data. We also asked whether they performed  data verification and testing. Although the controls varied across the  agencies, each one demonstrated a basic level of system and application  controls.
