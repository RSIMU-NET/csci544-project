Only two of the agencies in GAO's review had explicit guidance on what details to document in IGCEs, but officials were not always familiar with the available guidance. Instead, according to the officials GAO spoke with, they often follow program office practices and noted that training did not address how to develop and document an IGCE. GAO's cost estimating guidance and federal internal control standards emphasize the need for documentation, with GAO's guidance stating that well-documented cost estimates should describe the data sources used, underlying assumptions, and the estimating methodologies used to derive costs.

According to senior Department of  Education officials, the contracting officer determined that creating  IGCEs at the task order level was not an efficient use of time and  resources because pricing per loan was fixed at the base contract  level. In another example, an Air Force contracting official, referring to  a $1.8 million task order from a noncompetitive IDIQ contract for  engineering and technical services, indicated that IGCEs for related  task orders were not needed because the Air Force has been  contracting for the services for more than 20 years and the task  orders are routine at this point.", "Research and development: One competed contract and one  noncompetitive task order we reviewed without IGCEs were DOD  awards for research and development services.

Officials for several task orders we reviewed cautioned that it  is important for them to develop separate IGCEs specific to each task  order because the base IDIQ contract may not contain the level of  detail necessary to estimate requirements at the task order level. For  example, an IGCE for a $5.3 million DHS task order for information  technology included estimates for task-specific costs, such as labor  for equipment set-up, installation, and operation costs.

In some cases, the contracts  were more than 6 years old and staff turnover and file transfers made it  difficult for us to obtain contract file documents.

In some cases, CORs said they developed  IGCEs autonomously, using their experience with prior efforts to estimate  the level of effort necessary to meet requirements needed for the service  being acquired. For example, for a Department of Education contract  worth approximately $807,000, the COR explained that the program had  worked with the contractor on a similar effort in the past and as a result,  the COR had a thorough understanding of the labor categories and labor  hours necessary to meet requirements, so did not need input from other  sources to determine the level of work necessary. However in many  cases, CORs received input from other program office officials, such as  program managers or subject matter experts, during the IGCE  development process. According to officials, IGCEs are often reviewed  and approved within program offices as one of several documents in a  procurement request, before being sent to contracting officials.

The DHS Acquisition Manual requires IGCEs for most proposed  negotiated acquisitions although it allows for several exemptions, such as  for acquisitions of commercial items and modifications to resolve cost  overruns.

But as  one HUD program official explained, if the contractor proposals exceed  the IGCEs, they may be able to request additional funding. Officials also  said that the IGCE helps determine the work they can afford and make  trade-offs before the contract is awarded.", "Communicate information about requirements and contracting  approaches. IGCEs also communicate additional information about  program office requirements to contracting staff, providing information  helpful to supporting contracting officials\u2019 work in awarding the contract,  often in conjunction with the statement of work and other requirements  documents. For example, a COR for a $3.8 million Department of  Education information technology contract told us that the IGCEs help  communicate expectations for procured services, including the labor mix  required to perform tasks and levels of expertise in each labor category,  to contracting officials. A DHS contracting officer for a research and  development contract also noted that the program staff ultimately have  the best idea of the mix of labor categories and hours needed to meet  their requirements, which they share through the lGCE.", "Additionally, program officials described IGCEs as a key piece of the  acquisition planning phase that helps contribute to decisions about  contracting approaches. For example, a DHS program official for a $1.8  million contract for professional services said he discussed the IGCE\u2019s  proposed labor mix with contracting officials, who recommended reducing  the number of labor categories to make it easier for small businesses to  compete for the work.", "Evaluate against contractor\u2019s proposed prices.

They also help  contracting officers identify potential areas for negotiation. For example,  an HHS contracting officer explained that she compares costs identified in  the IGCE with those in the contractors\u2019 proposals to identify areas where  she can negotiate a better price.", "Some officials noted that IGCEs are particularly important in sole source  contracting, as they rely more on IGCEs to determine price  reasonableness when they do not have multiple contractor proposals to  compare prices. Some officials emphasized that IGCEs can still be used  in a competitive environment to identify unreasonably low bids and to  determine whether vendors understand requirements. However, other  officials noted that in a competitive procurement, comparing proposed  prices against the IGCE is not the predominant method used to determine  price reasonableness.

The usefulness of this tool\u2014when used to determine  price reasonableness\u2014depends in part on the quality of the estimate,  which can differ from the contract value at award for a variety of reasons.  As shown in figure 3, the 62 IGCEs we reviewed varied widely in how  close they were to the estimated value of the contract action when it was  awarded. More than half of the IGCEs\u201432 out of 62\u2014were within 10  percent of the estimated value of the contract or task order at award, and  12 of these IGCEs were within 1 percent of the estimated value at award.  At the other end of the spectrum, among the 30 IGCEs that differed from  the contract value at award by more than 10 percent, 14 were more than  25 percent over or under the award value, with the IGCEs tending to be  higher than the awarded contract values.", "A difference or similarity between the estimate and the final contract price  in and of itself is not problematic; however, if the differences or similarities  are not explained in the contract files, it can sometimes raise questions.", "Officials explained that IGCEs can be close to the price at award for  various reasons. For example, there were several non-competed  contracts for existing requirements, such as follow-on contracts or short- term bridge contracts to an incumbent contractor, so that the expected  costs were well known. One IGCE for a $1.9 million Department of  Labor task order used the same labor mix as the existing award, with  rates that had already been established in an IDIQ, so the IGCE was  identical to the final task order award. In another case, the contractor\u2019s  initial offer was higher than the IGCE, but the DHS contracting officer  used the IGCE as a basis to negotiate with the contractor, ultimately  negotiating the contract price down to almost the exact estimate in the  IGCE.", "Differences, particularly significant ones, are also understandable in  certain instances when explained. For example, for a $30 million Air  Force contract for logistics support services, which was competed and  received multiple proposals, the source selection document explains that  the IGCE was higher than all of the proposals\u201439 percent higher than  the final contract value\u2014because it did not account for cost savings  measures and management innovations offered by the contractors.  Additionally, the file notes that competition played a part in reducing the  prices offered. Of the 14 cases where the IGCE and the estimated value  at award differed by more than 25 percent, the IGCE values were higher  in 9 of the contract awards. Almost all of these contracts and task orders  were competed awards with multiple offers. Several contracting officers  credited competition with reducing the contracts\u2019 estimated cost at award  compared to the IGCEs.", "However, the differences between the IGCE and the contract value at  award were not always explained in the contract files, including 10 of the  14 cases where the IGCE differed by more than 25 percent. In another  example\u2014for a non-competed $208 million HUD contract for financial  management support services\u2014the contract value at award exceeded the  IGCE by more than $33 million. An analysis in the contract file indicates  that the IGCE was one of several sources of information that a  contracting official used to negotiate the award. A senior HUD contracting  official said that the quantities represented in the IGCE later changed,  which was taken into account during the negotiation. However, the  analysis does not state why the final contract value at award exceeded  the IGCE. Program officials said that they had little contact with the  contracting office and did not know why the contract was awarded for  more than the original estimate. Under the FAR, in a negotiated  acquisition where determination of a fair and reasonable price is based on  price analysis, the contracting officer must include in the contract file a  summary of the source and type of data used to support the  determination and documentation of fair and reasonable pricing including,  when used, IGCEs. When not documented, agencies may lose  information on how certain decisions were made during the procurement  process. Federal internal control standards say that transactions should  be completely and accurately recorded to maintain their relevance for  making decisions.", "While the contract files we reviewed that had the largest difference  between the IGCE and the value of the contract at award generally did  not provide information as to why IGCEs differed from the estimated cost  at award, officials offered some general observations on what contributes  to such differences.", "Limited data sources. Several contracting and program officials  noted that they rely largely\u2014and sometimes exclusively\u2014on historic  data for developing IGCEs, often from a predecessor contract for the  same requirement. The GAO cost estimating guidance identifies  historical cost information as a valuable resource, but some officials  said that reliance on historical data can result in inaccurate estimates  because the market can change over time.For example, an Army  contracting officer noted that labor rates for information technology  services in her area had decreased in recent years, but that may be  reflected in an IGCE based on data from a previously-awarded  contract.Further, for the two HUD contracts in which the IGCEs  overestimated the price at award by the greatest amounts, documents  in the contract files explained that their reliance on historic data  contributed to the difference.", "In addition, the GAO cost estimating guidance notes that numerous  sources of suitable, relevant and available data represent a basic  characteristic of credible cost estimating. While some program  officials used a limited number of data sources to support their IGCEs,  other officials cited the importance of obtaining multiple sources. This  includes getting labor rate information from multiple contractors and  ensuring that the information reflects current market value. For  example, contracting officials at the Department of Labor explained  that they previously used historical data for developing IGCEs for  contracts awarded by Job Corps\u2014an education and training program  for economically disadvantaged youth \u2014but revised their approach to  incorporate other information, such as Bureau of Labor Statistic wage  rate data, to ensure that their IGCEs do not solely rely on data for  labor rate estimates from previously awarded contracts.", "Reliance on Federal Supply Schedules. Officials cited another  factor contributing to inaccurate IGCEs is a reliance on the General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule contract  prices and other resources that post pre-negotiated contractor labor  rates as a primary source. IGCEs based on these sources may not  take into account discounts that are customarily offered by vendors,  so may overestimate the contracts\u2019 actual costs. In one example of a  task order with a value of $1.8 million at award, a contracting official  explained that the discounts applied to GSA schedule rates in the  proposals were the primary reason that the IGCE overestimated the  cost by 18 percent. In July 2015, we reported that the prices listed on  GSA schedule contracts can vary widely, and agencies must  remember to ask for discounts from listed prices.", "New or undefined requirements. The accuracy of an IGCE can also  be affected by the level of familiarity with the requirement that the  contract action is to support. Contracting and program officials noted  that developing estimates is more difficult when the contract is  delivering a new requirement or the requirement is difficult to define.  For example, the IGCE for an HHS non-competed contract\u2014awarded  under the urgency exception to competition\u2014was a new requirement  for professional support services and almost 20 percent under the  $699,000 expected contract value at award. Once the requirement  has been established through one or more contracts over years, the  contracting officer said he can use these data to better estimate the  cost for future contracts.", "For new requirements, an inaccurate IGCE might not necessarily  result in a bad outcome for the government. Contracting and program  officials cited examples of contractors providing unexpected  efficiencies or additional services that may not necessarily be  reflected in an IGCE. A Department of Education contracting officer  described a case in which the contractor added additional security  testing for an information technology system, which had not been  factored into the program office\u2019s IGCE. Although the testing  increased the contract\u2019s costs, she considered it worthwhile.", "IGCEs dictated by budget. Contracting officers and program officials  said that budgets can influence the development of an IGCE so that it  may not fully reflect the actual cost of a contract but be dictated by  their actual budgets. Program officials from three agencies said that it  is more acceptable for IGCEs to overestimate contract costs or that  the IGCE will often function as a \u201cceiling\u201d price to represent the budget  limit. For example, contracting officials for a $5.4 million Department  of Education award observed that when an IGCE is high, it is often  because the program office built it to match their budget, because  they would rather have a high estimate than have to request  additional funds. Additionally, a HUD contracting officer noted that  sometimes the programs may not recognize that the IGCE is  supposed to represent the actual cost of the contract, rather than the  amount of funding they have available. One DHS IGCE we reviewed  specifically included a line item identified as \u201cadditional funding\u201d,  indicating that additional funds were expected to be available to  purchase more services. The contracting and program officials  indicated that the estimate was driven at least partially by funding  availability. Further, a DHS official for this contract said that the IGCE  did not necessarily reflect the specific cost of the $82.4 million task  order awarded off the information technology support contract  because the amount of services it planned to purchase was not  known at the time of award. Instead, the award, which was priced as a  cost-plus-fixed-fee order, covered information technology needs as  funding for services became available\u2014so the IGCE reflected the  funding available for the contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most IGCEs Lacked Supporting Documentation", "paragraphs": ["GAO cost estimating guidance and federal internal control standards  emphasize the need for documentation, with GAO\u2019s cost estimating  guidance stating that well-documented cost estimates describe the data  sources used, underlying assumptions, and the estimating methodologies  used to derive costs. To maximize the use of the IGCE as a high-quality  tool, having information about how it was developed, including sources of  data and methodology used, is important. In addition, we previously found  that documenting an IGCE\u2019s methodology and data source in the contract  file helped inform future contracting and program officials about the  current contract when staff changed. As shown in figure 4, of the 62  IGCEs we reviewed, only 13 included such documentation. In one such  case\u2014for a $45 million Army engineering support contract\u2014the IGCE  included a statement that the estimate is based on costs from an existing  contract and an analysis of labor hours for similar programs. In contrast,  the IGCE for another engineering support contract, a $2.8 million award  from DHS, lists the number of hours and rates for different labor  categories but does not state the source of the information or how it was  compiled. In other cases, the IGCEs that were not documented well  included some details about their development and methodology in other  contract file documents, such as the acquisition plan or price analysis, but  this information was generally vague and did not include enough  information to provide support for the estimates. Figure 4 shows the  contract awards we considered well-documented at each department.", "Several contracting officials we met with said that they need to  understand the assumptions and methodology of the IGCE, as well as the  data sources, to have confidence in the IGCE and to use it as a tool. For  example, the contracting officer for a $38 million HUD contract said she  did not use the IGCE to determine price reasonableness because she  ultimately questioned the validity of the IGCE\u2019s data sources, which were  based on historical contracts although market conditions had changed.  When information supporting the IGCE is not readily available, some  contracting officers said they must take additional steps to obtain source  information and understand how the estimate was created\u2014factors of a  credible estimate based on GAO\u2019s cost estimating guidance\u2014in order to  support their price reasonableness decisions. However, this may create avoidable inefficiencies. In several cases, contracting officials said that  when they have questions about the IGCE, they reach out to the program  office, but many said they could skip this step if the IGCEs were well- documented to begin with.", "In other cases, the contracting officials said they created their own cost  estimates because they did not have confidence in the IGCE. For  example, a contracting official for one of the task orders we reviewed said  that she developed her own cost estimates because the program office\u2019s  IGCE was not sufficiently detailed for her purposes. Another contracting  official for a $179 million contract award for financial management support  at the Department of Education said he found that the IGCEs prepared by  the program office are routinely too high, so he does his own analysis. In  yet another example, a DHS contracting officer showed us how an IGCE  she received mistakenly included costs that are covered under a different  task order and did not include needed travel estimates, so the contracting  officer had to do her own analysis to develop an accurate estimate.  Contracting officials at additional departments also said they do not find  IGCEs useful because, in their experience, program offices do not always  have the expertise available to put together a credible estimate. Without  supporting documentation, the effectiveness of the IGCE is weakened, as  contracting officers either cannot use it or must spend time gathering  information they can use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Departments\u2019 Guidance and Training Do Not Consistently Emphasize How to Develop or Document IGCEs", "paragraphs": ["Federal internal control standards state that agencies should internally  communicate quality information to achieve their objectives, which can  include developing guidance for IGCEs, following existing IGCE  guidance, or providing training to support guidance.

The other contracting activity\u2014Federal Student  Aid\u2014does not have guidance on how IGCEs should be documented,  but officials said the CAM website is available throughout the  department.", "One reason agency officials may not be following guidance is that the  CORs and program officials responsible for developing IGCEs look to  their program offices for guidance on IGCEs rather than the agency  guidance available to them. In fact, several people we interviewed were  not familiar with their agency\u2019s guidance. Officials explained that they  predominantly learned how to prepare IGCEs through on-the-job training  from experienced staff, rather than through written guidance or formal  training. For example, HHS officials at the National Institutes of Health  explained the majority of what they learned in constructing IGCEs was  through their on-the-job training and experience. Officials noted that  existing guidance helps them understand the basic parts of IGCEs, but  they learn how to estimate the costs by actually preparing them on the  job. The lack of familiarity with agency guidance was also reflected in our  review of contract files. For example, DHS guidance requires that the  IGCE document sources and assumptions, yet in some cases the DHS  contracts and task orders we reviewed did not do so. For example, the  IGCE for a $2.8 million contract for professional engineering services did  not identify the information used or assumptions incorporated into the  estimate. This was in part because officials were not aware of  department-level requirements and were more likely to follow local  practices that did not emphasize IGCE documentation.", "Further, few program officials said they had formal training on how to  develop IGCEs. Several said that the only training they had related to  IGCEs was through the standard COR training, which most of the  program officials responsible for IGCEs are required to take for their COR  certification. They reported, however, that the COR training did not  provide detailed information on how to build an IGCE, but rather focused  on its general definition and uses. For example, DHS, HHS, and  Department of Labor officials told us they took introductory IGCE training  through the Federal Acquisition Institute. The training includes a video on  the purpose of an IGCE in the acquisition process but did not explain how  to prepare one. In a few cases, officials said they had previous  experience that helped them understand how to build cost estimates. For  example, a contracting officer and program official for a HHS contract we  reviewed said they had business backgrounds that helped them become  familiar with various cost estimating techniques and helped them to  understand how detailed IGCEs can be used. One official also noted that  the businesses who contract with the government typically know more  about cost estimating processes than the government, which gives  contractors an advantage in pricing their work.", "In some cases, program officials said they had developed templates to  prepare an IGCE for their individual acquisitions for a service. For  example, at HHS, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  provides online guidance for service contracts, including IGCE templates  for the COR. DHS\u2019s Office of Procurement Operations also provides  IGCE templates. While several departments or their program offices  established templates or worksheets to help guide program officials in  developing IGCEs, Education and HHS program officials said that using  the templates is not a requirement, and only a few told us they actually  used the templates.", "In general, program or contracting officials from five of the six  departments we reviewed said they would like more training or detailed  guidance to enhance their knowledge of developing IGCEs. In a limited  number of cases, officials said they developed and provided training in  response to a recognized need for more information on IGCEs. For  example,", "Department of Labor officials said the Job Corps program established  a process for developing IGCEs and then offered a training course in  January 2016 to help standardize their approach.

When no IGCE is prepared\u2014particularly in sole source procurements  where competitive forces are not in play\u2014the contracting officer may not  have full information on the program office\u2019s needs or expected costs.
