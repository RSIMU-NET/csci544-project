For example, in May 2014, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) generally required a 2 percent reduction in agencies' fiscal year 2016 budget submission. OMB guidance also requires agencies to develop strategies for operating in an uncertain budget environment. According to IRS, extensive senior leadership turnover has contributed to the lack of a long-term strategy. Without a strategy, IRS may not be able to operate effectively and efficiently in an uncertain budget environment.", "For fiscal year 2015, IRS calculated projected return on investment (ROI) for most of its enforcement initiatives. However, due to limitations\u2014such as estimating the indirect effect coverage has on voluntary compliance\u2014IRS does not calculate actual ROI or use it for resource decisions. These limitations are important, which is why GAO recommended in 2012 that IRS explore developing such estimates. Given that these limitations could take time to address, GAO demonstrated how IRS could use existing ROI data to review disparities across different enforcement programs to inform resource allocation decisions. Comparing projected and actual ROI is consistent with OMB guidance.

IRS reported it completed 89 projects in fiscal year  2013 to reduce the amount of physical space it uses. As a result, IRS  will rent 557,779 fewer square feet, which will save $15.7 million in  rent annually.

Specifically, IRS  limited telephone assistance to only basic tax law questions during  the filing season and reassigned assistors to work account-related  inquiries;  launched the \u201cGet Transcript\u201d tool, which allows taxpayers to  obtain a viewable and printable transcript on www.irs.gov, and  redirected taxpayers to automated tools for additional guidance;  redirected refund-related inquiries to automated services and did  not answer refund inquiries until 21 days after a tax return was  filed electronically or 6 weeks after a return was filed by paper  (unless the automated service directed the taxpayer to contact  IRS);  limited access to the Practitioner Priority Services line to only  those practitioners working tax account issues;  limited live assistance and redirected requests for domestic  employer identification numbers to IRS\u2019s online tool; and eliminated free return preparation and reduced other services at  IRS\u2019s walk-in sites.", "IT reductions.

There are a number of indications that funding is unlikely to soon return to  the growing and high budget levels IRS experienced in fiscal years 2010  and 2011. First, our work on the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook shows  that growth in spending for federal health care and retirement programs  will place increasing pressure on discretionary spending. Second, in  May 2014, OMB generally required a 2 percent reduction in agencies\u2019  fiscal year 2016 budget submission. Third, under the Budget Control Act  of 2011 (BCA), sequestration of discretionary appropriations could occur  in any fiscal year through 2021. In addition, as shown in figure 4, for the  past several fiscal years IRS has been appropriated less than it  requested, with a difference of 13 percent in fiscal year 2014. Looking  back over a 10-year horizon provides further evidence that funding levels  provided in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 were an exception and that the  recent decline might be viewed more as a return to normal. All of these  factors indicate that it is increasingly important for agencies to have long- term plans to address uncertain budget environments.", "In addition, according to Executive Order No. 13576 and OMB guidance,  agencies are to develop strategies for operating effectively and efficiently  in an uncertain budget environment. We have previously reported on  steps that agencies can take to do this. These include reexamining  programs, related processes, and organizational structures to determine  whether they are effectively or efficiently achieving their mission. They  also include streamlining or consolidating management or operational  processes and functions to make them more cost effective. We have  also made recommendations to IRS on how it can more strategically  manage operations in specific areas, such as developing a long-term  strategy to improve its online services.", "A long-term strategy that includes a fundamental reexamination of IRS\u2019s  operations, programs, and organizational structure could help it operate  more effectively and efficiently in an environment of budget uncertainty.  Although IRS has taken steps in the short term, they may not be sufficient  to stem performance declines.

However, IRS does  not use this actual ROI information for resource allocation decisions  because the data do not reflect marginal ROI, nor do they include the  indirect effects of IRS enforcement activities on voluntary compliance.  Moreover, because of the time required to work enforcement cases to  completion, the costs associated with assessing and collecting additional  revenues may be spread over more than one fiscal year and are not  necessarily aligned with revenue collections that may occur in  subsequent years. These limitations are critical concerns, which is why  we recommended in 2012 that IRS develop estimates of marginal direct  revenue and marginal direct costs within each enforcement program. We  further recommended that IRS explore the potential of estimating the  marginal influence of enforcement activity on voluntary compliance.  However, given that these data gaps could take considerable time to fill,  we also demonstrated how IRS planners could in the meantime review  actual (average) ROI across different enforcement programs and across  different groups of cases within these programs to better inform resource  allocation decisions. As we noted, the planners could consider this  information in combination with their professional judgment relating to  other relevant but currently unquantifiable factors. In fact, while limited in  scope, we demonstrated how a hypothetical shift in resources could  potentially increase direct revenue by $1 billion annually, without  significant negative effects on voluntary compliance.", "The development of data relating to marginal ROI would also enable IRS  to improve its projections of ROI for enforcement initiatives, particularly  those that expand coverage for specific taxpayer categories. IRS  currently knows little about the extent to which marginal yields differ from  average yields within specific return categories; consequently, it does not  know the extent to which its ROI projections, which are based on average  yields, may be overstated. By collecting the data needed to compute  actual ROI for expanded coverage enforcement initiatives, IRS would be  able to determine whether marginal returns are significantly lower than  average returns; thereby, IRS would have better information for deciding  whether the expanded coverage should be maintained, cut back, or  expanded further in future years. Actual productivity information and  better ROI projections can also help budget decision makers in  determining funding levels for IRS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Since Inception, IRS Has Spent $859 Million to Implement PPACA, but an Updated IT Cost Estimate Is Unavailable for Review", "paragraphs": ["When enacted, PPACA gave IRS responsibility for implementing a  number of provisions.
