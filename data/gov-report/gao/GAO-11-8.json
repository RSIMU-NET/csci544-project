One approach DOD can take to evaluate offerors' proposals is the best value tradeoff process in which the relative importance of price varies compared to non-cost factors. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 required GAO to review DOD's use of the best value tradeoff process, specifically when non-cost factors were more important than price. In response, GAO determined (1) how often and for what types of contracts DOD used the best value tradeoff process; (2) why and how DOD used such an approach; and (3) challenges, if any, DOD faces in using the best value tradeoff process. GAO identified a probability sample of new, competitively awarded fiscal year 2009 contracts in which DOD obligated $25 million or more. GAO reviewed guidance, solicitations, source selection decisions, and other documents for 129 contracts and interviewed DOD contracting and program staff about the use of the best value tradeoff process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009, DOD used best value processes for approximately 95 percent of its new, competitively awarded contracts in which $25 million or more was obligated. Almost half of DOD's contracts--47 percent--were awarded using a tradeoff process in which non-cost evaluation factors, when combined, were more important than price. DOD used best value tradeoffs principally to acquire services, such as construction of troop housing, as well as for professional management services. DOD used the best value tradeoff process in 88 of the 129 contracts GAO reviewed. For 60 of the 88 contracts, DOD weighted non-cost factors as more important than price. In these cases, DOD was willing to pay more for a contractor that demonstrated it understood complex technical issues more thoroughly, could provide a needed good or service to meet deadlines, or had a proven track record in successfully delivering products or services of a similar nature. In making tradeoff decisions, GAO found that DOD selected a lower priced proposal nearly as often as it selected a higher technically rated, but more costly proposal. Overall, GAO found that DOD paid a combined total of more than $230 million in price differentials--the difference in price between the awardee and the offeror next in line for award--on 21 contracts, but chose not to pay more than $800 million in proposed costs by selecting a lower priced offer over a higher technically rated offer in 18 contracts. DOD does not track whether the use of best value tradeoff processes correlates with the contractor successfully meeting the terms of the contract and noted that many factors ultimately contribute to an acquisition's success or failure. DOD officials identified several challenges in using the best value tradeoff process, including the difficulty in determining meaningful evaluation factors and the business judgment of acquisition staff required. DOD officials also noted that the complexity of the tradeoff process increases the risk of bid protests. For example, GAO found that 15 of the 88 contracts awarded using a best value tradeoff process reviewed were protested to GAO, resulting in 4 cases in which DOD terminated the contract or made a new source selection decision when DOD determined that it failed to adhere to the solicitations' requirements. Such concerns are heightened given the expected influx of more than 6,400 new contracting personnel over the next few years. According to DOD officials, making sound tradeoff decisions, and in particular, deciding whether or not a price differential is warranted, is one of the most difficult aspects of using a best value tradeoff process. DOD is developing a new departmentwide source selection guide and intends to subsequently revise its training curriculum, but neither the guide nor DOD's current training curriculum provides agency personnel with information on assessing price differentials when performing tradeoff analyses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that to help DOD effectively employ best value tradeoff processes, DOD develop training elements, such as case studies, that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions, as it updates its training curriculum.

DOD has several approaches it can use to evaluate offerors\u2019  proposals. For example, DOD can use a best value tradeoff process, in  which it can vary the relative importance of cost or price to other factors,  such as technical approach or past performance in its solicitations to  offerors. In these cases, DOD may award a contract to other than the  lowest-priced offeror if DOD determines that a higher-priced proposal  provides a greater benefit to DOD, and this greater benefit is worth pay an additional cost, or price differential. Proper execution of the tradeoff  process is essential, however, to ensure that DOD lays the foundation for  successful acquisition outcomes. We have identified DOD contract  management as a long-standing high-risk area, due in part to DOD\u2019s use of  ill-suited business arrangements that have contributed to unmet  expectations and placed the department at risk of potentially paying more  than necessary.  ing  Section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010  directed GAO to report on DOD\u2019s use of the best value tradeoff process,  and specifically for cases in which DOD determined that it would evaluate  contractors\u2019 proposals on factors other than cost or price, if these non-cost  factors, when combined, were to be considered more important than cost  or price. To respond to the mandate, we determined (1) how often and for  what types of contracts DOD used the best value tradeoff process; (2) why  and how DOD used the best value tradeoff process; and (3) what  challenges, if any, DOD faces in using the best value tradeoff process.", "To conduct our work we used the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) to identify new, competitively awarded contracts  in which DOD obligated $25 million or more in fiscal year 2009. We  selected the $25 million threshold based on a Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requirement that contracts for  production or services with $25 million or more in estimated total costs for  any fiscal year have written acquisition plans, which contain information  on the anticipated source selection approach. This analysis identified 363  contracts on which DOD had obligated a total of $39.2 billion, or about 10  percent of the total amount DOD obligated on contracts in fiscal year 2009.  From this population, we selected a random sample of 160 contracts,  including 60 indefinite delivery contracts. We identified errors in the  information provided by FPDS-NG on 31 contracts, including contracts  that were incorrectly coded as competitively awarded or had incorrect  award amounts. We excluded these contracts from our sample and  determined that FPDS-NG was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  review after adjusting for these errors. Based on our analysis of the  remaining 129 sample contracts, we produced estimates of source  selection approaches used, contract type, and whether a product or  service was acquired. To determine the type of and rationale for the  source selection process used for the contracts, we reviewed the  associated acquisition plans, solicitations, source selection decision  memorandums, and other relevant documents for each of the contracts in  our sample. In particular, we reviewed source selection decision  documents for contracts that used a tradeoff process to determine  whether DOD paid a price differential. For the purposes of this report, we  defined a price differential as the difference in price between the  awardee\u2019s price and the price of the offeror next in line for award.", "From our sample, we also judgmentally selected buying activities from  each military department and one defense agency based on such factors as  the number of best value contracts, the type of contract, and the type of  product or service acquired. Results based on these selected buying  activities are not generalizable to a larger population. At each activity, we  reviewed contract files and interviewed program and contracting officials  to discuss their rationale for selecting a tradeoff process including the  selection of non-cost evaluation factors for 34 contracts and 23 task orders  as illustrative case studies. We also reviewed contract documents, DOD  and military department source selection guidance, and interviewed  program and contracting officials from DOD, the military departments,  and one defense agency to identify what challenges, if any, DOD faces in  using the best value tradeoff process.

In such cases, DOD may determine that cost or  price should play a dominant role in source selection. When using the  LPTA process, DOD specifies its minimal technical requirements in the  solicitation. Once DOD determines that the contractors meet or exceed  the technical requirements, no tradeoffs between cost or price and non- cost factors are permitted and the award is made based on the lowest  price offered to the government.", "By contrast, DOD may elect to use a tradeoff process in acquisitions where  the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or  the acquisition has greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost  evaluation factors, such as technical capabilities or past performance, may  play a dominant role in the source selection and tradeoffs among price and  non-cost factors allow DOD to accept other than the lowest priced  proposal.

Additionally, the FAR  requires that each factor represent key areas of importance and emphasis  to be considered in the source selection decision and that support  meaningful comparison and discrimination between and among competing  proposals. The FAR also requires the source selection authority  document the perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal and the  rationale for tradeoffs in the contract file. The resulting source select decision should be based on a comparative assessment of proposals  against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. The decision must  also include the rationale for any business judgments and tradeoffs made  or relied on by the source selection official, including benefits asso ciated  with additional costs. Although the rationale for the source selection  decision must be documented, the documentation need not quantify the  tradeoffs that led to the d ecision.", "In fiscal year 2009, DOD obligated about $380 billion on contracts for  goods and services.

Other services procured using the tradeoff process were equipment  maintenance and professional management services. For example, in fiscal  year 2009, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded a contract worth more  than $963 million to construct one of the largest pumping stations in the  world, along with floodgates and floodwalls for hurricane protection.  Similarly, the Air Force awarded the Contract Field Team program  multiple-award contract, with an estimated base value of $2.6 billion for  modification, maintenance and repair of systems including aircraft and  missile defense for the departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and  several federal agencies.

In most cases, DOD did not issue the task  or delivery orders we reviewed using a tradeoff process. For example, an  Air Force official explained that the initial task orders for the Contract  Field Team program, including 13 orders in our sample, were issued under  an LPTA process because data needed to assess contractor performance  and timeliness were not yet available to use given the short time between  award of the base contract and issuance of the first orders. An Air Force  official indicated that once they had obtained sufficient performance data,  they intended to issue task orders using a tradeoff process when possible.  DOD officials issued six other task orders on the basis of negotiating with  a contractor who had been awarded a single award IDIQ contract. The  four remaining orders were awarded using a tradeoff process. For  example, the Army wanted infrared vision enhancement equipment for  nighttime and battlefield use in Iraq and Afghanistan to be delivered as  quickly as possible.

They noted that as the complexity of the acquisition increases, so does the  need for individuals with the expertise to help develop the evaluation  factors. For example, Army Corps of Engineers officials told us that the  contract for one of the world\u2019s largest flood pump stations required  experts with experience in issues ranging from water flow management to  real estate to develop evaluation factors. Further, Navy officials explained  that while they often use past performance as a non-cost discriminator, it  can be difficult to identify differences between contractor proposals  because contractors often provide their best performance examples and  the government often lacks data to evaluate additional contractor projects.  Our past work has also identified governmentwide challenges in obtaining  needed past performance information to support contract award  decisions. Further, the absence of meaningful non-cost discriminators  can result in offerors receiving equal scores on the factors that were  identified as being significantly more important than price. As such, the  decision may default simply to a consideration of price alone.

Navy officials told us  that the tradeoff process is administratively burdensome and requires a  large time investment from program staff, which can make it challenging  to keep the same acquisition team together for an entire procurement.  During our site visits, many contract and program staff told us that the  tradeoff process often takes between 18 and 24 months. In addition, in  Afghanistan and Iraq, the challenges of conducting a tradeoff process have  contributed to decisions by the CENTCOM Joint Theater Support  Contracting Command and Army Corps of Engineers to discourage its use.  For example, recent Army Corps of Engineer projects in Afghanistan have  emphasized using simpler, less complex designs or requirements that are  more suitable for the use of a lowest price technically acceptable  approach.", "The complex nature of the best value tradeoff process, including decisions  on whether to pay a price differential, requires much greater business  judgment when compared to other acquisition approaches.

Applying a tradeoff process, however, does not  guarantee successful acquisitions, nor is it without other challenges. In  particular, using a tradeoff process can be more complex and take more  time than other source selection methods, and requires that acquisition  staff have proper guidance, needed skills, and sound business judgment.  With the anticipated influx of more than 6,400 DOD contracting personnel  over the next few years, providing a firm foundation for use of the tradeoff  process is essential. While DOD and the military departments have taken  steps to improve source selection procedures, acquisition personnel noted  a lack of training to assist them in deciding whether or not a price  differential is warranted when making tradeoff decisions. For example,  while DOD\u2019s new source selection guide provides insights on the source  selection process, it is silent on how to reach decisions on when to pay a  price differential, as is DOD\u2019s current training curriculum. DOD has an  opportunity as it updates its training curriculum to provide acquisition  staff with better insights using real life examples on reaching tradeoff  decisions. Taking this step can help DOD minimize the risk of paying a  price differential when not warranted or losing the benefit of a technically  superior solution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help DOD effectively employ the best value tradeoff process, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Director of Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy to work with the Defense Acquisition  University to develop training elements, such as case studies or scenarios  that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions, including consideration of price  differentials, as it updates the source selection curriculum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report.

To respond to the mandate, we determined (1) how  often and for what types of contracts DOD used the best value tradeoff  process; (2) why and how DOD used the best value tradeoff process; and  (3) what challenges, if any, DOD faces in using the best value tradeoff  process.", "To determine how often and for what types of contracts DOD used the  best value tradeoff process, we used data from the Federal Procurement  Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) as of January 2010 to identify a  population of contracts based on the following criteria: (1) newly awarded  by DOD in fiscal year 2009; (2) competitively awarded, and (3) had  obligations of $25 million or more in fiscal year 2009.", "We established the $25 million threshold because the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requires contracts with total  estimated costs of $25 million or more in any fiscal year to prepare written  acquisition plans, which contain information about the source selection  approach. This analysis identified 363 contracts. From this population, we  selected a probability sample of 160 contracts, including 60 indefinite  delivery contracts, and reviewed associated solicitations, source selection  decision documents, and other contract documents to determine the  solicitation approach DOD used.", "We verified the obligations and contract award fields in FPDS-NG with  contract data to ensure that the contracts within our sample were within  scope. Thirty-one contracts from our initial sample of 160 contracts were  outside the scope of our review because they were incorrectly coded in  key parameters, such as being coded as competitively awarded when they  were not or had misreported the amount of obligations made on the  contract or task order. We excluded these contracts from our sample and  determined that FPDS-NG was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  review after adjusting for these errors.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 8 percentage  points). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. Unless otherwise  noted, percentage estimates based on our sample have 95 percent  confidence intervals that are within plus or minus 8 percentage points of  the estimate itself. Confidence intervals for other numeric estimates are  reported along with the estimate itself. Table 1 summarizes the estimated  percentage of contracts of various source selection approaches reviewed.", "Based on our analysis of the remaining 129 sample contracts, we estimate  that the total number of best value tradeoff, lowest price technically  acceptable, or sealed bid award decisions (in-scope contracts) in the full  population of interest was about 293. For contracts that utilized a best  value tradeoff process, we categorized them based on the relative  importance placed on price. In addition, we determined contract type, the  type of procurement (product versus services), and the type of product or  service for our sample contracts using FPDS-NG data and verified this  information with the contract documents.", "To determine why and how DOD used the best value tradeoff process and,  in particular, when non-cost factors were considered more important than  price, we obtained and reviewed DOD and service level acquisition  guidance related to source selection policies and procedures that describe  how and when the tradeoff process may be used, including those used for  issuing task orders. In addition, for each of the contracts within our  sample, we obtained contract documentation including the acquisition  plan, solicitation, and source selection decision memorandum and  reviewed them in preparation for interviews with DOD officials. In several  cases, the solicitation was unclear as to which type of tradeoff process  was used. In these cases, we relied on the source selection decision  document to categorize the tradeoff process used.", "We judgmentally selected buying activities to visit based on factors  including the number of contracts awarded on a best value tradeoff basis,  contract type, and goods or services procured. Buying activities included  at least one command from each military department as well as a defense  agency. We reviewed 27 contracts and 23 task orders through our site  visits. Specifically, we judgmentally selected 23 of 48 task orders for  review by compiling all task orders issued on indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity contracts obligating over $10 million that were administered by  the officials at the sites we visited. We chose this dollar threshold to  exceed the FAR requirement to provide fair opportunity notices for task  orders valued at $5 million or more. Results from these selected contracts  or task orders cannot be generalized beyond the specific contract  contracts or task orders selected.", "During the course of our review, we interviewed officials from the  following commands:    Department of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans  District Office, Louisiana, and Afghanistan Engineering District, Kabul and  Kandahar, Afghanistan;    Department of the Army, Armament Research, Development and  Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey;    Department of the Army, Communications\u2013Electronics Command, Fort  Monmouth, New Jersey;    Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Combat Development Command,    Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River,  Maryland and Lakehurst, New Jersey;    Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Tinker Air  Force Base, Oklahoma;    Defense Logistics Agency Energy, Ft.

For award decisions that used a best value tradeoff process,  we discussed why the evaluation factors were chosen and how their  relative weights were assigned. We also interviewed officials about the  process used and the underlying rationale when issuing selected task  orders. We also interviewed officials to determine what the expected  outcomes were from using the best value tradeoff process.", "We reviewed applicable DOD source selection decision documents and  related memoranda to determine how often DOD paid a price differential,  the amount of the price differential, and the reasons that were given  underlying the decision to pay a higher price. We defined a price  differential as a positive difference in price between the offeror who  received the award and the offeror next in line for award.", "To determine what challenges if any, DOD faces in using the best value  tradeoff process, we reviewed DOD guidance and interviewed officials  from Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, the military  departments and defense agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2010 through October  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
