Shortcomings exist in key areas that are essential for DHS to address in order to fully implement its cybersecurity responsibilities. DHS has since developed and implemented certain capabilities, but still has not fully satisfied aspects of these responsibilities and needs to take further action to enhance the public/private partnerships needed to adequately protect cyber critical infrastructure. GAO has also previously reported on significant security weaknesses in systems supporting two of the department's programs, one that tracks foreign nationals entering and exiting the United States, and one for matching airline passenger information against terrorist watch-list records. DHS has corrected information security weaknesses for systems supporting the terrorist watch-list, but needs to take additional actions to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with systems tracking foreign nationals. NIST plays a key role in providing important information security standards and guidance. Pursuant to its responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), NIST has developed standards specifying minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems; and provided corresponding guidance that details the controls necessary for securing those systems. It has also been working with both public and private sector entities to enhance information security requirements. The resulting guidance and tools provided by NIST serve as important resources for federal agencies that can be applied to information security programs. As GAO recently testified in May, opportunities exist to improve the metrics used to assess agency information security programs. According to the performance metrics established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies reported increased compliance in implementing key information security control activities. However, GAO and agency inspectors general continue to report significant weaknesses in controls. This dichotomy exists in part because the OMB-defined metrics generally do not measure how well controls are implemented. As a result, reported metrics may provide an incomplete picture of an agency's information security program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on  computer-based (cyber) security activities at the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST).

The  information security metrics developed by OMB focus on compliance with  information security requirements and the implementation of key control  activities. OMB requires federal agencies to report on key information  security control activities as part of the FISMA-mandated annual report on  federal information security. To facilitate the collection and reporting of  information from federal agencies, OMB developed a suite of information  security metrics, including the following:    percentage of employees and contractors receiving security awareness    percentage of employees with significant security responsibilities  receiving specialized security training,    percentage of systems tested and evaluated annually,    percentage of systems with tested contingency plans,    percentage of agencies with complete inventories of major systems, and    percentage of systems certified and accredited.", "In May 2009, we testified that federal agencies generally reported  increased compliance in implementing most of the key information  security control activities for fiscal year 2008, as illustrated in figure 1.", "However, reviews at 24 major federal agencies continue to highlight  deficiencies in their implementation of information security policies and  procedures. For example, in their fiscal year 2008 performance and  accountability reports, 20 of 24 major agencies noted that their  information system controls over their financial systems and information  were either a material weakness or a significant deficiency. In addition,  23 of the 24 agencies did not have adequate controls in place to ensure  that only authorized individuals could access or manipulate data on their  systems and networks. We also reported that agencies did not consistently  (1) identify and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access; (2)  enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure that authorized access  was necessary and appropriate; (3) establish sufficient boundary  protection mechanisms; (4) apply encryption to protect sensitive data on  networks and portable devices; and (5) log, audit, and monitor security- relevant events. Furthermore, those agencies also had weaknesses in their  agencywide information security programs.", "An underlying reason for the apparent dichotomy of increased compliance  with security requirements and continued deficiencies in security controls  is that the metrics defined by OMB and used for annual information  security reporting do not generally measure the effectiveness of the  controls and processes that are key to implementing an agencywide  security program. Results of our prior and ongoing work indicated that, for  example, annual reporting did not always provide information on the  quality or effectiveness of the processes agencies use to implement  information security controls. Providing information on the effectiveness  of controls and processes could further enhance the usefulness of the data  for management and oversight of agency information security programs.", "In summary, DHS has not fully satisfied aspects of its key cybersecurity  responsibilities, one of which includes its efforts to protect our nation\u2019s  cyber critical infrastructure and still needs to take further action to  address the key areas identified in our recent reports, including enhancing  partnerships with the private sector. In addition, although DHS has taken  actions to remedy security weaknesses in its Secure Flight program, it still  needs to address our remaining recommendations for strengthening  controls for systems supporting the US-VISIT program. In taking these  actions, DHS can improve its own information security as well as increase  its credibility to external parties in providing leadership on cybersecurity.  NIST has developed a significant number of standards and guidelines for  information security and continues to assist organizations in implementing  security controls over their systems and information. While NIST\u2019s role is  to develop guidance, it remains the responsibility of federal agencies to  effectively implement and sustain sufficient security over their systems.  Developing and using metrics that measure how well agencies implement  security controls can contribute to increased focus on the effective  implementation of federal information security.", "Chairman Wu, this concludes my statement.
