Compromises of sensitive information at numerous federal agencies have raised concerns about the extent to which such information is vulnerable. The use of technological controls such as encryption--the process of changing plaintext into ciphertext--can help guard against the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. GAO was asked to determine (1) how commercially available encryption technologies can help agencies protect sensitive information and reduce risks; (2) the federal laws, policies, and guidance for using encryption technologies; and (3) the extent to which agencies have implemented, or plan to implement, encryption technologies. To address these objectives, GAO identified and evaluated commercially available encryption technologies, reviewed relevant laws and guidance, and surveyed 24 major federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Commercially available encryption technologies can help federal agencies protect sensitive information that is stored on mobile computers and devices (such as laptop computers, handheld devices such as personal digital assistants, and portable media such as flash drives and CD-ROMs) as well as information that is transmitted over wired or wireless networks by reducing the risks of its unauthorized disclosure and modification. For example, information stored in individual files, folders, or entire hard drives can be encrypted. Encryption technologies can also be used to establish secure communication paths for protecting data transmitted over networks. While many products to encrypt data exist, implementing them incorrectly------such as failing to properly configure the product, secure encryption keys, or train users------can result in a false sense of security and render data permanently inaccessible. Key laws frame practices for information protection, while federal policies and guidance address the use of encryption. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 mandates that agencies implement information security programs to protect agency information and systems. In addition, other laws provide guidance and direction for protecting specific types of information, including agency-specific information. For example, the Privacy Act of 1974 requires that agencies adequately protect personal information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 requires additional protections for sensitive health care information. The Office of Management and Budget has issued policy requiring federal agencies to encrypt all data on mobile computers and devices that carry agency data and use products that have been approved by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) cryptographic validation program. Further, NIST guidance recommends that agencies adequately plan for the selection, installation, configuration, and management of encryption technologies. The extent to which 24 major federal agencies reported that they have implemented encryption and developed plans to implement encryption of sensitive information varied across agencies. From July through September 2007, the major agencies collectively reported that they had not yet installed encryption technology to protect sensitive information on about 70 percent of their laptop computers and handheld devices. Additionally, agencies reported uncertainty regarding the applicability of OMB's encryption requirements for mobile devices, specifically portable media. While all agencies have initiated efforts to deploy encryption technologies, none had documented comprehensive plans to guide encryption implementation activities such as installing and configuring appropriate technologies in accordance with federal guidelines, developing and documenting policies and procedures for managing encryption technologies, and training users.

Designing,  building, and effectively implementing commercially available  cryptographic technologies involves more than installing the technology.  Decisions must be made for managing encryption keys and related  cryptographic components, as well as for managing mobile devices and  using public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies. Ultimately, the  effectiveness of the encryption technologies used to protect agency  information and reduce risk depends on how an agency implements and  manages these technologies and the extent to which they are an integral  part of an effectively enforced information security policy that includes  sound practices for managing encryption keys."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Encryption Key Management Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Policies and procedures. Comprehensive policies for the management of  encryption and decryption keys\u2014the secret codes that lock and unlock  the data\u2014are an important consideration. Providing lifetime management  of private keys and digital certificates across hundreds of applications and  thousands of servers, end-users, and networked devices can quickly strain  an agency\u2019s resources. For example, if a key is lost or damaged, it may not  be possible to recover the encrypted data. Therefore, it is important to  ensure that all keys are secured and managed properly by planning key  management processes, procedures, and technologies before  implementing storage encryption technologies. According to NIST, this  planning would include all aspects of key management, including key  generation, use, storage, and destruction. It would also include a careful  consideration of how key management practices can support the recovery  of encrypted data if a key is inadvertently destroyed or otherwise becomes  unavailable (for instance, because a user unexpectedly resigns or loses a  cryptographic token containing a key). An example of recovery  preparation is storing duplicates of keys in a centralized, secured key  repository or on physically secured removable media. Additional  considerations for the encryption of removable media are how changing  keys may affect access to encrypted storage on the media and what  compensating controls could be developed, such as retaining the previous  keys in case they are needed.", "Key storage location. Another consideration that NIST describes is  deciding where the local keys will be stored. For some encryption  technologies, such as full disk encryption and many file/folder encryption  products, there are often several options for key location, including the  local hard drive, a flash drive, a cryptographic token, or a trusted platform  module chip. Some products also permit keys to be stored on a centralized  server and retrieved automatically after the user authenticates  successfully. For virtual disk encryption, the main encryption key is often  stored encrypted within the disk or container itself.", "Access to encryption keys. Another consideration is properly restricting  access to encryption keys. According to NIST, storage encryption  technologies should require the use of one or more authentication  mechanisms, such as passwords, smart cards, and cryptographic tokens,  to decrypt or otherwise gain access to a storage encryption key. The keys  themselves should be logically secured (encrypted) or physically secured  (stored in a tamper-resistant cryptographic token). The authenticators  used to retrieve keys should also be secured properly.", "Managing cryptographic components related to encryption keys. In  addition to key management, NIST describes several other considerations  when planning a storage encryption technology. Setting the cryptography  policy involves choosing the encryption algorithm, mode of cryptographic  operation, and key length. Federal agencies must also use NIST-validated  cryptographic modules configured for FIPS-compliant algorithms and key  lengths. In addition, several FIPS-compliant algorithms are available for  integrity checking.

Centralized management can also automate  these functions: deployment and configuration of storage encryption  software to end user devices, distribution and installation of updates,  collection and review of logs, and recovery of information from local  failures.", "PKI technology. Because PKI technology uses a public key as part of its  encryption system, PKI systems with key management can be used to  avoid the problem of lost keys. Data encrypted with PKI relies on one  public key, so the private key of the person encrypting the data isn\u2019t  necessarily required to decrypt it. However, if an unauthorized user is able  to obtain a private key, the digital certificate could then be compromised.  Agencies considering PKI technology must ensure that the key systems of  different agencies are compatible for cross-agency collaboration on tasks  such as security incident information sharing. Further, users of certificates  are dependent on certification authorities to verify the digital certificates.  If a valid certification authority is not used, or a certification authority  makes a mistake or is the victim of a cyber attack, a digital certificate may  be ineffective.", "Ongoing maintenance of encryption technologies. Systems  administrators responsible for encryption technology maintenance should  be able to configure and manage all components of the technology  effectively and securely. According to NIST, it is particularly important to  evaluate the ease of deployment and configuration, including how easily  the technology can be managed as the technology is scaled to larger  deployments. Another consideration is the ability of administrators to  disable configuration options so that users cannot circumvent the  intended security. Other maintenance considerations NIST describes  include the effects of patching/upgrading software, changing software  settings (changing cryptographic algorithms or key sizes), uninstalling or  disabling encryption software, changing encryption/decryption keys, and  changing user or administrator passwords."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Hindrances Faced by Agencies when Implementing Encryption", "paragraphs": ["Preparing an agency for encryption presents numerous challenges to  agencies, including selecting an adequate combination of cost-effective  baseline security controls, properly configuring the networks and user  devices within the information technology (IT) infrastructure to  accommodate selected encryption technologies, providing training to  personnel, and managing encryption keys. In response to our survey,  agencies reported several conditions that hinder their ability to encrypt  sensitive information as required by the Office of Management and Budget.", "In response to our survey, all 24 agencies reported hindrances with  implementing encryption. These hindrances included prohibitive costs;  user acceptance; user training; data backup and recovery; data archival  and retrieval; interoperability; infrastructure; vendor support for  encryption products acquired; availability of FIPS-compliant products to  meet the needs of uncommon or unique devices, applications, or  environments within the agency\u2019s IT infrastructure; and management  support for migration to encryption controls. Agencies noted the level of  hindrance caused by these challenges ranged from little or no hindrance to  great or very great hindrance. The most challenging conditions are  discussed below.", "Prohibitive costs. Nine agencies reported that the cost of acquiring and  implementing encryption was their greatest hindrance, and 13 agencies  cited this condition as somewhat of a hindrance or a moderate hindrance.  As reported in appendix IV, a governmentwide initiative (SmartBUY) has  been established to assist agencies with overcoming this hindrance.", "User acceptance and training. Some encryption technologies can be  burdensome to users and can require specialized training on encryption  concepts and proper installation, maintenance, and use of encryption  products. Sixteen agencies reported facing somewhat of a hindrance or a  moderate hindrance in obtaining user acceptance of encryption  implementations and in training personnel.  Four agencies reported a great  or very great hindrance from lack of user acceptance, and 2 agencies  reported a great hindrance from insufficient training.", "Data backup, recovery, archiving, and retrieval. Agencies must establish  policies and procedures for management of encryption keys, which are  necessary to recover data from back-ups in the event of a service  interruption or disaster, or to retrieve data in archived records, perhaps  many years in the future. For example, if the key is not properly backed up  and is on a server that has been destroyed in a fire or the key used to  encrypt archived records changes over time, data encrypted with the key  may be irretrievably lost. Sixteen agencies reported facing somewhat of a  hindrance or a moderate hindrance with backup and recovery, and 15  agencies reported the same level of hindrance with data archiving and  retrieval.", "Interoperability. Key systems and technologies of different agencies need  to be compatible with each other for cross-agency collaboration. Five  agencies reported that lack of interoperability was a great or very great  hindrance, and 13 reported somewhat of a hindrance or a moderate  hindrance.", "Infrastructure considerations.

Additionally, USDA negotiated an agreement for 180,000  licenses at $9.63 each, as opposed to the GSA unit price of $170 per  license. The large number of licenses acquired allowed USDA to negotiate  the low price. Several agencies noted that considering an enterprisewide  deployment of encryption can be helpful with issues of standardization,  interoperability, and infrastructure readiness.
