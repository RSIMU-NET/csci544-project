With plans\u2019 increased focus on controlling the skyrocketing costs of health care benefits, there are concerns about the value of the health benefits purchased. As a result, several large private purchasers have begun to examine \u201cvalue-based purchasing.\u201d Key to value-based purchasing is the measurement of health plan quality using different types of quality-related data to hold plans accountable and encourage improvements.", "Lessons learned from the experience of large purchasers may be applicable to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the nation\u2019s single largest payer for health care. HCFA administers the Medicare program, which provides care for about 38 million beneficiaries, over 5.5 million of whom are currently in health maintenance organizations (HMO). It purchases health care coverage for almost all of the nation\u2019s elderly population and more than 4 million disabled beneficiaries. Like purchasers in the private sector, the federal government has looked to managed care as a way to help contain costs associated with providing health care to Medicare beneficiaries. At the same time, the agency wants to ensure that the beneficiaries currently enrolled in health plans and those who enroll in the future are receiving high-quality care. With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997\u2014a major piece of legislation affecting the Medicare program\u2014HCFA will have more plans and more types of plans to monitor for the quality of care provided to beneficiaries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purchasers Shift to Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to curb the double-digit inflation in health care costs of the 1980s, large purchasers increasingly turned to managed care. The rise in managed care enrollment has been swift. From 1987 to 1996, enrollment in managed care provided through private employers nearly tripled. According to a 1997 survey of health benefits offered by firms with 200 or more workers, only 19 percent of employees are still enrolled in indemnity programs, which allow a free choice of providers and reimburse physicians and hospitals with limited or no review of the appropriateness of services rendered. In addition, traditional indemnity coverage uses a fee-for-service payment mechanism to reimburse providers. The remainder of employees with health insurance receive care through a variety of health plans. These can include (1) HMOs, (2) preferred provider organizations (PPO), and (3) point-of-service (POS) plans.", "HCFA has also seen a rapid increase in managed care enrollment in Medicare. However, unlike the private sector, the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries still receive care through fee-for-service arrangements. In the early 1970s, the Congress encouraged commercial and Medicare use of HMOs by authorizing federal standards and oversight to ensure reasonable care and service. Between 1994 and 1997, enrollment in Medicare HMOs increased by 75 percent. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of plans Medicare contracts with. Currently, HCFA contracts with close to 400 health plans to provide health care to over 5.5 million beneficiaries, about 14 percent of the total Medicare population.", "With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act, even greater growth in Medicare beneficiary enrollment in managed care can be expected. The act permits contracts between HCFA and a variety of different managed care entities, including PPO and POS plans, which are similar to HMOs but are directly controlled by groups of providers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that as a result of the passage of the act, all types of managed care organizations will account for 25 percent of Medicare enrollees in 2002, 38 percent in 2008, and about 50 percent by 2030."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need to Monitor Quality of Care", "paragraphs": ["With increased use of managed care, public and private purchasers must consider strategies to monitor plans and ensure the quality of the care they provide. The Institute of Medicine has formally defined quality of care as \u201cthe degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.\u201d In evaluating plans, one or more of the following dimensions of quality can be measured:", "Appropriateness: Are providers giving patients the care they need?", "Technical excellence: How well are providers using medical science and knowledge to deliver care to patients?", "Accessibility: Are patients able to obtain care when needed and within reasonable proximity to where they live or work?", "Acceptability: Are patients satisfied with the care they receive?", "Since the concept of quality is multidimensional, experts describe the importance of using different types of measures to evaluate care. For example, the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT)\u2014a forum for consumers and purchasers, including HCFA\u2014argues for the importance of balancing the use of quality measures to reflect (1) the results of care, (2) whether patients are satisfied with the care received, and (3) whether the appropriate processes have been followed.", "Performance indicators are used to measure the various attributes of quality. For example, for clinical attributes, they can measure appropriateness and technical excellence\u2014that is, providers\u2019 actions and the outcomes of those actions. Process-related indicators refer to clinical interventions, such as the diagnostic tests performed by a physician when examining a patient. In contrast, outcome indicators measure the results of providers\u2019 activities, such as mortality and morbidity. Outcome measures are critical to evaluating the quality of care, but experts recognize that these measures are not fully developed.", "A number of questions have been raised about the reliability and validity of certain measures and the data sources for performance indicators. For example, data from computerized administrative databases maintained by managed care plans and from individual patient medical records kept in providers\u2019 offices may be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. This is because most administrative databases were designed for financial\u2014not clinical\u2014purposes. In addition, providers may enter incorrect information in medical records or not document certain interventions. In an earlier report, we expressed concerns about the reliability of satisfaction data, since most people lack the knowledge needed to adequately evaluate the appropriateness of the care that they receive or do not receive. We also noted in the report that plan-reported data on access-related measures, such as what constitutes a sufficient provider network, do not necessarily ensure that access to care is received. Such data must be checked by independent and systematic monitoring efforts that go beyond plan-reported, paper-based indications of compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Private Corporations Move Toward Value-Based Purchasing", "paragraphs": ["Despite problems in measurement, some large companies\u2014concerned with absenteeism and reduced productivity from illness\u2014have begun to apply value-based purchasing concepts when purchasing health plan services. For example, these companies have considered information about quality to assess, rank, and select health plans and to monitor ongoing plan performance against standards and negotiate rates based on these standards. In addition, these companies are providing information on plan performance to employees to help inform their selection of health plans. Large purchasers have spearheaded several initiatives as they search for credible tools to help them identify and demonstrate to others the \u201cvalue\u201d resulting from premiums paid to managed care plans. For purchasers, standardized measures can help them to set desirable goals or \u201cbenchmarks\u201d for health plans in different areas of interest or concern to the purchaser, provide feedback to plans on the results of such performance, and monitor the progress of plans against these goals.", "In the early 1990s, a committee of health plan representatives and corporate purchasers began to work on a set of standardized performance measures, which were later revised by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)\u2014a nonprofit institution that reviews and accredits health plans. The result of these efforts, the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), is now in its third generation and currently covers the following categories: effectiveness of care, access and availability of care, satisfaction with the experience of care, informed health care choices, descriptive information on health plans, the cost of care, health plan stability, and the use of services.", "Another major effort by purchasers, with participation by HCFA and other government agencies, was the creation of FACCT to develop standardized outcome measures. In 1996 and 1997, FACCT endorsed comprehensive measurement sets for asthma, diabetes, breast cancer, major depression, as well as other areas; some of these indicators focus on outcomes. Now FACCT is coordinating efforts with NCQA and others to create comprehensive measures for children\u2019s health, HIV/AIDS, end-of-life care, coronary artery disease, and alcohol misuse. FACCT has also developed a \u201cconsumer information framework\u201d for purchasers, which emphasizes the importance of a consistent and understandable framework for presenting quality-related information to consumers. One example of this information is the ability of health care organizations to maximize functioning and quality of life when a consumer faces chronic, incurable illnesses, such as diabetes and asthma.", "Despite the involvement of some major purchasers in the development of quality-related measures, surveys conducted by the Watson Wyatt consulting firm with the Washington Business Group on Health (WBGH) in 1996 and 1997 concluded that cost still prevails as the principal concern when most employers evaluate a managed care plan. The surveyed employers noted, however, that they are beginning to look more closely at issues such as plan coverage and access in judging health plan value. And a significant number of employers are requiring plans to report HEDIS data, with some making it a prerequisite for health plans that wish to contract with them. They also view accreditation as providing assurance that a health plan is attempting to manage the quality of care.", "While employers are beginning to make increased use of quality-related data in screening plans with which to contract, they may not necessarily be using it throughout the purchasing and monitoring process to the extent desired by proponents of value-based purchasing. A recent mapping of activities by individual employers and business coalitions concluded that only a limited number are actually implementing the principles of value-based purchasing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging asked us to study how large corporate purchasers use quality-related information collected from health plans and the applicability of purchasers\u2019 experiences to HCFA. Specifically, we agreed to describe (1) how large purchasers use quality-related data to seek or promote better quality of care and (2) lessons that can be learned from their experiences for HCFA in administering the Medicare program.", "In conducting our review, we analyzed and synthesized relevant literature about managed care and discussed value-based purchasing and quality measurement with employers and with HCFA officials. We then conducted detailed case studies with four large purchasers of managed care for employees. During site visits with these purchasers, we discussed how they incorporated quality-related data into their purchasing and monitoring decisions and the results they believe are attributable to their efforts. We also reviewed available data on results achieved through these efforts.", "For the purposes of the case study analysis, we defined \u201cresults\u201d in terms of improved health plan performance on dimensions measured; increased health plan accountability to the purchaser or enrollee; and actions taken by purchasers, health plans, providers, or consumers in response to quality-related data. As such, we defined results not in terms of outcomes in the sense of clinical quality but rather those that indicated improvement in the performance of health plans in the dimensions measured by the purchaser.", "We selected purchasers for case studies that met the following criteria: the purchaser had (1) received performance measurement information from managed care plans at least twice, (2) documentation of specific examples of data uses and results, and (3) experience with managed care markets in several regions of the country or was able to exercise major leverage as a purchaser in at least one market. Also, we sought large purchasers that were willing to allow us access to their information and to spend time responding to our questions. Given these criteria, we selected four purchasers that represented a range of characteristics and experience with managed care: the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS), Federal Express, Johnson & Johnson, and Southern California Edison.", "Of the four purchasers we studied, Federal Express and Johnson & Johnson can be characterized as national, as they purchase care for large concentrations of employees in multiple markets. Southern California Edison and CalPERS can be characterized as regional, as the vast majority of the employees for whom they purchase care are located in a single state or market. Two of the purchasers began offering managed care to their employees before 1994, and two began offering managed care since 1994. (See app. I for additional details on each purchaser.)", "We performed our work for this study between August 1996 and May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

They used these data to negotiate increased services from health plans, improve health plan performance, and inform employees about their health care choices. This chapter examines more closely those uses that have achieved demonstrable results. To date, purchaser assessments of health plan quality have largely focused on issues of accessibility and acceptability and whether health plans effectively administer their daily operations.

Improvements in access to services and in health plan capacity to report on HEDIS measures are some of the results from these activities, according to the purchasers we visited."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purchasers Use Different Types of Data From Different Sources", "paragraphs": ["Purchasers use a variety of data sources to assess whether or not to contract with health plans, monitor their ongoing performance, and develop quality-related information to provide employees. Data sources range from formal data on whether health plans have met accreditation standards set by entities such as NCQA and JCAHO, how health plans perform on certain HEDIS measures, and surveys of employees satisfaction to more qualitative data gathered through the judgments made by health benefits staff in the process of assessing health plans during the selection process. According to the 1997 Watson Wyatt/WBGH survey, the use of health care data is a resource-intensive activity; therefore, most purchasers who do so are large companies. As of 1997, 62 percent of large employers said they use HEDIS data in making purchasing decisions. In contrast, only 7 percent of small employers (those with fewer than 1,000 employees) use HEDIS data.", "Two of the purchasers we visited augment quality-related measures with site visits when selecting a health plan. To screen and conduct initial rankings of plans, these two purchasers requested evidence of NCQA and JCAHO accreditation, various HEDIS measures, and patient satisfaction surveys. They also used benefits consulting firms to assist them in selecting quality-related measures and analyzing health plan performance against targets, using HEDIS and other data. Once plans were screened and ranked, benefits staff conducted site visits. For example, one purchaser that we visited used these visits to observe plan operations, touring plan facilities including the customer service and claims processing centers and receiving an overview of the plan\u2019s internal quality assurance processes.", "Site visits can weight heavily when final decisions on health plan selection are made. For example, one purchaser ultimately selected a plan that had not received the highest quality rankings based on the analysis of quality-related data. According to the purchaser\u2019s staff, observations during site visits changed the ranking of the plans. For example, during site visits at one plan that had received a high ranking, the purchaser\u2019s staff found that medical directors at some locations in the state did not always know what medical directors at other locations in the state were doing. At a site visit at another plan, the purchaser\u2019s staff began to question the plan\u2019s commitment to customer service, given the plan\u2019s reaction to the purchaser\u2019s concerns about the process for employee selection of a primary care physician. As a result of these site visits, the purchaser did not select either of these plans.", "Purchasers also acquire data from other sources, such as regional business coalitions. One purchaser we visited participated in a business coalition to augment quality efforts in areas with small populations of employees. Two other purchasers we visited said they benefited from a regional reporting initiative to collect, analyze, and report audited HEDIS data.

Purchasers consider data on access as well as customer service to be particularly important\u2014both to their employees and as indicators of quality. The two purchasers that used quality-related data to select health plans said they had required health plans to submit data on access-related measures. One purchaser, for example, required plans to report on the percentage of employees who would have access to at least two primary care physicians within 8 miles of their residence, the average time to obtain appointments, the percent of primary care providers who were not accepting new patients, and the timeliness of response to telephone and member inquiries. In this case, the purchaser required a commitment from plans to undertake actions to fill gaps in provider networks.", "Several purchasers we visited required plans to continue to submit data on HEDIS measures to ensure the plans gathered and maintained data on quality. One purchaser found that the initial HEDIS data received from plans during the plan selection process may have lacked validity and reliability. After requiring HEDIS data for 3 years from plans and contracting with a consultant to perform a data quality assessment, the purchaser described significant improvement in the plans\u2019 ability to report and in the reliability of the data reported. For example, in 1993, only 50 percent of the managed care plans under contract could submit the HEDIS data requested, and purchaser officials described these data as only poor to fair in quality. In 1994, over 90 percent of the plans could provide HEDIS data of \u201cfair quality.\u201d By 1995, 100 percent of the plans under contract reported HEDIS data, and the data submitted by all but three plans were judged to be of acceptable quality.

The four purchasers generally used a combination of collaborative- and compliance-oriented approaches. The collaborative approach, based on a \u201cquality partnering\u201d philosophy, is characterized by a close and informal relationship between purchaser and plan staff, frequent discussions about progress made against performance goals and benchmarks, and jointly developed plans for performance improvement. The compliance approach is characterized by techniques such as the establishment of specific and quantifiable performance standards, periodic assessment of plan performance against the standards, and financial penalties for failure to meet the standards.", "Each of the four purchasers were able to identify results achieved from both approaches, including projects to streamline member access to specialty care and improvements in employee satisfaction and cost savings. While each purchaser tended to use a blend of both approaches\u2014working collaboratively with plans to improve performance while holding the same plans accountable against contractual standards and penalizing them if they do not meet these standards\u2014all four cited the importance of close interaction with plans to influence changes in behavior and said that close and continuous interaction is easier when dealing with a small number of plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Collaborative Approach Triggers Changes at Health Plans", "paragraphs": ["In employing a collaborative approach, several purchasers we visited used quality-related data to highlight problems for discussion with health plans. These discussions then triggered actions for improvement at an individual plan or resulted in the dissemination of best practices at various plans. Results achieved through this approach included the creation of a provider directory to assist employees in accessing care, the development of joint projects between purchasers and health plans to enhance ease of referrals to specialists and to educate employees with diabetes, and streamlining of procedures for complaints and grievances.", "One purchaser, for example, has been working closely with plans to improve in areas related to customer service and referrals to specialists. The purchaser identified problems in these areas using an employee satisfaction survey, employee complaints, and feedback from employee committees established to improve communications between the purchaser and employees. For example, approximately 20 percent of employees surveyed were very dissatisfied with the procedures for changing primary care physicians. The purchaser discussed these problems with the health plan during a site visit. One month later, the plan distributed listings of primary care physicians and specialists, including their hospital affiliation. The plan also committed to meet weekly with the purchaser to continue discussing the purchaser\u2019s concerns.", "Another purchaser began a joint activity with a health plan after analyzing data from the purchaser\u2019s open enrollment survey and a member satisfaction survey. Results of the survey revealed, among other items, that only 55 percent of employees were satisfied with ease of referral to a specialist. In response to these concerns and the plan\u2019s own satisfaction data, the purchaser and one of its health plans designed a specialist referral project to streamline member access to specialty care. Telephone surveys and focus groups were conducted with four provider groups and members receiving services from those groups to evaluate the impact of this project. All parties\u2014providers, the purchaser, the plan, and member representatives\u2014are currently meeting with provider groups to design solutions to member and physician concerns.", "The first purchaser also addressed the issue of specialty referrals on the basis of data from a satisfaction survey. These data indicated that employees perceived specialty referrals as being too slow and too hard to get. In some cases, members had to wait for a review committee at the health plan to approve a referral to a specialist. The purchaser\u2019s analysis of satisfaction survey data, coupled with a health plan\u2019s own analysis, prompted the appointment of a task force to develop a referral system. The system developed by the health plan gives primary care physicians the authority to approve referrals on the spot.", "This purchaser also collaborated with a health plan in developing a diabetes management program, designed to improve patient quality of life and to reduce emergency room visits. This program was developed in response to the prevalence of diabetes among employees and the purchaser\u2019s examination of quality-related data from HEDIS measures. After the purchaser initiated discussions with the health plan as part of its collaborative approach, the plan used its pharmacy database to identify diabetic employees of the purchaser. Employees recruited to participate in the program received educational materials on diabetes as well as the opportunity to participate in classes at various work sites. The plan subsequently surveyed participants to obtain information on their evaluation of materials provided and classes attended as well as outcome measures, such as perception of health status and diabetes-related quality-of-life measures.", "The purchasers also used quality-related data to identify and disseminate best practices after holding discussions with a health plan. One of the four purchasers, for example, conducts annual visits at the various sites operated by the plan that serves most of the purchaser\u2019s employees nationwide. During these visits, the purchaser and plan managers evaluate plan policies and procedures, review HEDIS data, conduct clinical audits, and analyze satisfaction survey data. At one site, the purchaser\u2019s staff identified what they viewed as an exceptional process for handling appeals.

After applying financial penalties, one purchaser said it achieved improvements in employee satisfaction. This purchaser also documented that it used HEDIS data as part of the rate negotiation process. Through this process, the purchaser communicated its unwillingness to accept higher rate increases from plans that had not performed as well as others.", "Purchasers often held health plans accountable against contractually specified standards to meet the purchasers\u2019 goals. For example, one purchaser developed standards to meet its goal of enhancing the value of health care services delivered to its members by the year 2000. Purchaser standards measuring performance included timeliness of identification card issuance, evidence of coverage booklet distribution, speed of written responses, and average time for the telephone to be answered by a person and telephone abandonment rates. In the case of one plan, its performance deteriorated over 2 quarters on two specific standards: having a plan representative answer the telephone within 35 seconds after a caller opted to speak with the representative and a telephone abandonment rate of less than 5 percent. As a result, the purchaser sent a letter to the plan requesting that it explain its poor performance and outline its corrective action. The plan was also asked to send continuing commentary on performance in these areas when submitting its quarterly results on required performance measures. The plan responded by consolidating the management of its member services and by improving the capability of its database and has since improved its performance. Other standards developed by purchasers to address areas of particular concern included identification card accuracy, appeal and grievance turnaround times, timeliness of data submissions, and physician turnover.", "Two purchasers imposed financial penalties when specific contractual standards described in the contract were not met. The standards selected described, among other items, specific purchaser expectations related to the plans\u2019 ability to maintain or improve access and employee satisfaction. Purchasers also used the rate negotiation process to reward or penalize plans for their performance.", "Since its 1994 move into managed care, one purchaser has required the five health plans covering a majority of its enrolled population to meet standards in the areas of appeals and grievances; customer service, including member satisfaction, call abandonment rate, and telephone response rate; and data reporting, including accuracy and timeliness. These standards are specified in a partnership agreement. The success of individual health plans at meeting these standards is subsequently captured in a purchaser scorecard on individual plan performance. A distinctive feature of this scorecard is a subjective, collective assessment by health benefits staff of how well plans respond to purchaser demands. If the standards are not met, this purchaser assesses a financial penalty equal to a designated small percentage of total revenues under the contract. According to the purchaser and health plans, this minor penalty has helped effect changes in the behavior of health plans, since they generally wish to avoid the embarrassment of a penalty.", "This purchaser annually evaluates health plan performance with regard to how well the purchaser\u2019s staff thinks the plan responds to these and other concerns. The purchaser\u2019s staff base their ratings on their interaction with plan staff during weekly meetings. For example, for 1995, one plan was penalized about $9,000 because the purchaser was dissatisfied with, among other issues, its responsiveness to purchaser concerns. For 1996, the purchaser found the plan to be more responsive and no penalties were levied for the plan\u2019s failing to meet this performance standard. However, during the same 1995 to 1996 time period, the purchaser staff continued to be dissatisfied with the plan\u2019s commitment to customer service. For 1995, it was penalized approximately $6,000, and for 1996, it was penalized about $7,000.", "Another purchaser also attributed improvements in quality to the use of financial penalties. As an example, this purchaser established a contract standard requiring plans to maintain an 85-percent satisfaction rate among its employees. Data submitted for the plan\u2019s midyear review showed that its rate fell from 91 to 84 percent. When the plan investigated, it found that the purchaser\u2019s employees felt plan providers lacked empathy. The plan instituted training for the providers. Six months later, employee satisfaction had risen to 93 percent.", "Another tool used by purchasers to evaluate health plans at the end of a period is the annual contract renewal and rate negotiation process. Purchasers can use quality-related data to reward or penalize plans as part of this process and, as a result, believe that they are improving the value of their health care purchasing decisions. Officials at one purchaser said they were able to improve the quality of health care while holding the line on costs because the purchaser\u2019s rates are based in part on rewarding health plans for high performance.", "Beginning in 1996, another purchaser began to target plans that proposed rate increases but had low overall HEDIS scores for further conversation.According to the consultant hired by the purchaser, the first year this strategy was used, four targeted managed care plans had proposed a 2-percent increase in premiums. After rate negotiations, the premiums decreased by 7 percent. For the next year, 21 targeted plans had proposed a 6-percent increase. A 4-percent decrease was achieved through rate negotiations. The purchaser attributes the premium decreases to the use of HEDIS data in negotiations in addition to the analysis of administrative fees, average charge per member per month, and a comparison with similar plans in the same geographic area and with their regional claims experience. The purchaser is currently studying the relationship between the cost savings achieved through rate negotiations and quality of care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Purchasers Share Quality Data With Employees", "paragraphs": ["In addition to taking actions to elicit changes at health plans, purchasers can also use data about quality to help employees make informed choices in selecting plans. Report cards provide the results of cost and quality indicators, as well as other descriptive information, comparing the performance of competing health plans. Some believe that as consumers become better informed and decide not to select health plans of lesser quality, such plans may be motivated to initiate improvements in the quality of care they provide. Research on report cards indicates that these formats are continuing to evolve as a way of presenting quality-related data. We found that of the two purchasers using report cards, one purchaser surveyed employees and concluded that employees found the information useful. The other saw only a modest increase in employee selection of the plan with the highest quality ranking in the report card.", "One purchaser that disseminated information to employees collaborated with the magazine Health Pages to report information about the quality of health plans the purchaser offered to its employees. Information in this magazine included general descriptions of the plans; characteristics of the plans; physician and hospital networks; information about preventive care, such as the rates at which plans administer childhood immunizations or perform cholesterol screenings; and satisfaction ratings. The other purchaser that disseminated information to its employees produced and distributed its own report cards comparing offered health plans during the open enrollment period. For example, one report card gave prospective enrollees comparative information on HEDIS measures in three areas: preventive health services (childhood immunizations and cholesterol screening), women\u2019s preventive health (prenatal care and pap smear and mammographies), and care for chronic illness (diabetic eye examinations). The report cards used by each purchaser also contained narrative material explaining the importance of such measures.", "The purchasers using report cards to educate employees as part of the enrollment process saw some initial results from their decision to disseminate comparative information. For example, from an employee survey intended to assess the effect of its first report card on enrollment behavior, one purchaser found that 66 percent of those responding viewed the purchaser\u2019s report card as very or somewhat important in assisting members in selecting their plan. The purchaser did not use a survey to assess the effect of its second report card; however, they did examine several hundred write-in responses returned on an enclosed tear-out sheet. The most frequent employee recommendation for future report cards was to include more data about the quality of each plan. Members also recommended providing (1) easy-to-read comparisons, such as those found in Consumer Reports; (2) feedback from existing or previous plan members; and (3) information on complaints filed against physicians or hospitals.

The advantage of this approach is that multiple sources of information can be presented in a comprehensive format, which can be used by purchasers to discuss health plan performance. Intended to reflect an employer\u2019s specific health care benefits strategy, in some cases, these scorecards can be associated with rewards for good performance and incentives for improving poor performance. A purchaser other than the four we visited, for example, will use its scorecard to reward those plans that have performed well with incentive payments and give plans with low scores the opportunity to improve over a reasonable time frame.

This legislation gives the Medicare program authority to contract with new types of managed care plans and calls for the program to provide quality-related and other comparative data to beneficiaries to promote a more informed selection of health plans. It is expected to result in more plans contracting with the program and more beneficiaries enrolling in plans. The legislation also requires managed care plans to take action to improve quality of care. As a result, HCFA will now begin to look more like purchasers that enroll most of their employees in managed care and those that provide comparative information on health plans to their employees as well as use quality-related data to prompt health plans to improve their performance.", "The experiences of purchasers we visited have implications for HCFA in three ways: (1) educating beneficiaries as to the meaning of quality-related measures when providing comparative information on health plan quality; (2) interacting with health plans to take action, either through a collaborative- or a compliance-oriented approach, when problems with health plan performance are surfaced by quality-related data; and (3) continually looking for additional opportunities to make use of quality-related data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HCFA Is Unique as a Purchaser", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the most striking difference between HCFA and other purchasers has to do with the enormity of HCFA\u2019s presence in the marketplace. Although HCFA is the nation\u2019s largest purchaser of health care, only a small percentage of Medicare beneficiaries have decided to enroll in HMOs, although this number has been rising sharply in recent years. Nevertheless, the sheer number of Medicare beneficiaries in managed care far exceeds the number of employees who would be enrolled in managed care by a private company. The purchasers we visited now enroll most of their employees in managed care health plans. The largest purchaser we visited serves 1 million people, while HCFA in its Medicare managed care program currently serves over 5.5 million beneficiaries, with potentially many more expected according to CBO estimates.", "HCFA also differs from other purchasers in the freedom of choice enjoyed by Medicare beneficiaries who have had far more latitude in selecting options for health care than others. Much of the privately insured population under 65 only has access to those health plans selected by their employer, and in many cases, the employer just chooses one plan. They also only have the option to enroll or disenroll during a specified \u201copen season.\u201d In contrast, Medicare beneficiaries have been able to select any of the Medicare-approved HMOs in their area and may switch plans monthly or choose the fee-for-service program. HMOs have been able to market their plans to Medicare beneficiaries throughout the year, not only during the required 30-day open enrollment period.", "The structure of the Medicare program, unlike private sector care, is determined by law and regulation. Any eligible health plan that agrees to meet minimum standards may participate in the Medicare program. In contrast, private sector purchasers can engage in \u201cselective contracting\u201d to select plans with lower costs and to use quality-related and other data in their selection decisions. As a result, they can exclude plans as part of the selection process. In contrast, HCFA does not have the flexibility of refusing to contract with plans that meet its minimum standards. In markets such as Los Angeles, HCFA contracts with 14 health plans; other large purchasers in that area contract with a smaller number of plans and claim that contracting with fewer plans enhances a purchaser\u2019s ability to more effectively oversee the quality of health plan performance. While other purchasers have more flexibility than HCFA in selecting plans, Medicare HMO beneficiaries in certain parts of the country have the ability to choose among more managed care plans than may be available to employees.", "HCFA also differs from other purchasers in how HMO prices are set. Other purchasers can negotiate rates with health plans on the basis of performance measured against preestablished standards. In contrast, Medicare HMO rates are determined by statutory formula, which does not allow the flexibility of negotiation.", "Like other purchasers, HCFA monitors HMO performance but does so according to law. Its two principal strategies are its HMO monitoring program and review by peer review organizations. The monitoring program implements requirements ranging from financial solvency requirements to grievance procedures. After a Medicare contract is awarded, HCFA regional staff have the responsibility of monitoring HMOs against federal statutory and regulatory requirements as part of on-site biennial reviews. HCFA is also required to contract with peer review organizations, also known as quality improvement organizations, which are physician organizations in each state that review HMO quality of care. In the past, these organizations attempted to determine instances of poor care through medical record reviews. In recent years, quality improvement organizations and plans have begun to conduct quality improvement projects in different clinical areas. For example, in one project, quality-related measures have been used to collect information, provide feedback to plans on their performance, and design interventions to improve the quality of care in outpatient diabetes management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purchaser Experiences Will Have Increased Relevance for HCFA", "paragraphs": ["A goal of title IV of the Balanced Budget Act is to encourage Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in managed care health plans.

In this regard, the information the purchasers provide employees and purchasers\u2019 monitoring experiences are especially relevant.", "The Balanced Budget Act establishes specific time frames for HCFA to meet in providing beneficiaries comparative information on covered benefits, premiums, and quality and performance of managed care plans to guide their enrollment decisions. Although HCFA had the authority to provide beneficiaries with such information prior to the act, past work by GAO found that HCFA was not doing so and recommended that HCFA help elderly consumers choose among competing Medicare HMOs by distributing comparative information on HMOs.", "According to HCFA, the agency had already begun to move in this direction prior to the passage of the Balanced Budget Act. The new legislation, however, not only establishes specific time frames for HCFA to meet but also couples the provision of comparative information with an annual open enrollment season. By the year 2002, with limited exceptions, Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in a health plan will only be able to enroll in another plan during periodic coordinated open enrollment seasons, whereas at present they can switch at any time. The reduced ability of Medicare HMO enrollees to freely change plans places an additional responsibility on HCFA for ensuring the quality of care that HMO enrollees receive.", "Purchasers have had a variety of experiences in distributing comparative information on health plans to their employees. One purchaser we visited surveyed employees on its report card and concluded that employees found the information to be useful. The purchaser later used feedback from employees to modify the report card and enhance its usefulness. The effect of the report cards, however, is not yet clear. For example, another purchaser found only a modest shift of employees into the plan with the highest quality ranking and decided to encourage changes in employee behavior by freezing enrollment in plans with continuing quality problems. In designing these report cards, both purchasers provided explanatory material so that employees would be able to better understand the meaning of the measures employed.", "These experiences by purchasers are relevant to HCFA. Not only do they provide comparative information to their employees, but in using feedback from employee surveys and by assessing the impact of such information on employee behavior, purchasers demonstrate that they continually review the value and utility of the information they present to their employees. For HCFA, this implies continual monitoring of how consumer information is used. Other lessons for HCFA relate to the need for purchasers to educate employees on the meaning of the measures contained in the report card and how to interpret these measures when deciding between health plans.", "In addition to providing quality-related data to employees, purchasers also provided this information to plans and expected the plans to take action on the basis of this information. The Balanced Budget Act provides a more explicit listing of required elements for plan quality assurance programs than had been required before. These elements include requirements for plans to take action to improve quality and assess the effectiveness of such action through systematic follow-up. In relation to this requirement, HCFA is considering how to use standardized measures to prompt quality improvement activities. Elements of this approach have already been present in collaborative projects between quality improvement organizations and health plans.", "Again, the experience of the four purchasers we visited can inform how HCFA addresses the quality assurance provisions in the Balanced Budget Act. The four we visited did not simply provide health plans with data from HEDIS measures, satisfaction surveys, and other sources of information.
