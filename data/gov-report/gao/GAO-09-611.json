To enhance land management and fulfill other public objectives, they acquire and dispose of land using exchanges--trading federal lands for lands owned by willing private entities, individuals, or state or local governments. GAO and others have raised concerns about whether the public interest has always been served in these land exchanges. GAO was asked to (1) analyze the number, trends, and characteristics of BLM and Forest Service land exchanges and (2) determine the effectiveness of agency actions to address previously identified key problems. GAO interviewed and surveyed agency officials, analyzed agency data on recent exchanges, and reviewed documents on a nongeneralizable sample of 31 land exchanges representing at least 85 percent of the acres that agencies acquired, or plan to acquire, during the time of GAO's review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From October 2004 through June 2008, BLM and the Forest Service processed 250 completed, pending, or terminated land exchanges. Completion times for exchanges within this period varied widely, from 2 months to more than 12 years. These exchanges involved 628,429 federal acres and 621,588 nonfederal acres. According to agency officials, the number of exchanges since 2000 has generally declined because of the availability of qualified staff and funding and the lower priority given to land exchanges compared with other activities. Of the 250 land exchanges, 47 were facilitated by third parties, 9 were conducted in multiple phases, and 20 were specifically legislated by Congress. GAO, the agencies' inspectors general, and others identified problems in the agencies' land exchange programs and have made recommendations to correct them. The agencies have taken actions to address most of these problems, but the effectiveness of the actions has been mixed. Specifically: (1) According to most agency officials surveyed, headquarters reviews at least somewhat improved exchange quality; often ensured that exchanges complied with laws, regulations, and policies; and were processed properly. However, the reviews did not always document problems or indicate their resolution, making the process less transparent. (2) BLM stopped using interest-bearing accounts outside of the U.S. Treasury, according to agency officials, and issued new guidance on managing ledgers, which are used to track land value imbalances over time in multiphase exchanges. However, the agency is not always adhering to this guidance and, therefore, cannot fully know how much is owed. Specifically, BLM cannot be assured that the $2.6 million land value imbalance due to the United States, recorded in its ledgers as of June 30, 2008, is accurate. (3) Both agencies issued new guidance to require full disclosure of the relationship between a third-party facilitator and other parties to an exchange. But the guidance does not clearly define third-party facilitators and officials do not consistently apply the disclosure policy. Without consistent application, the agencies fail to obtain critical information and potentially risk losing the ability to control the exchange process. (4) The agencies updated their exchange guidance to provide clearer direction on exchanges and incorporated it into their training. However, staff generally are not required to attend this training, and the agencies do not systematically track staff participation. Therefore, the agencies cannot ensure that realty staff develop and maintain necessary skills. The agencies took steps to improve appraisal timeliness, but the process, particularly for BLM, continues to delay some exchanges, officials said. Neither agency has a national strategy to guide land transactions, nor does either track all costs of individual exchanges. Developing national strategies and tracking the costs of individual exchanges will enhance the agencies' ability to make informed decisions in pursuit of shared goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service administer  millions of acres of public land, and they continue to acquire and dispose  of land in order to enhance federal land management, meet the needs of  the public, and fulfill other public objectives.

Agency realty specialists, assisted by many other experts, such  as cultural and natural resource specialists, are responsible for processing  these exchanges, and nonfederal landowners may hire third-party  facilitators to assist.

The parcels are either of equal  value, or either party may provide an equalization payment.", "BLM and the Forest Service conduct multiphase exchanges differently. At  BLM, land values exchanged in each phase do not necessarily need to be  equal, but at the final closing the land value must be equal or must be  equalized with a cash payment. BLM uses records, called land exchange  ledgers, to track the value conveyed by each party in the exchange and the  balance due to the federal government or the nonfederal party after each  phase.

The National Environmental Policy Act of  1969 (NEPA) generally requires the agencies to conduct environmental  analyses. Under NEPA, agencies generally evaluate the likely  environmental effects of projects they propose using an environmental  assessment, or if the projects likely would significantly affect the  environment, a more detailed environmental impact statement is prepared.

In terms of the lack of  staff, officials from both agencies have reported that owing to an  increasing number of retirements and the need to work on higher priority  activities\u2014such as processing energy rights-of-way\u2014staff may not be  available to process exchanges.  In commenting on a draft of this report,  Interior stated that BLM also believes that protests, appeals, and litigation  are reasons for delays in completing land exchanges.", "BLM officials also told us that issues with the appraisal process could  inhibit the timely completion of exchanges. These issues include the time  needed for the appraiser to obtain information on encumbrances on the  land, the potential need for new appraisals every few months in a volatile  market when land values change frequently, and the limited number of  private appraisers with the necessary experience to appraise the  undeveloped lands involved in BLM exchanges accurately.", "Forest Service regional officials cited the following other factors that can  impede the timely completion of land exchanges:    Adjacent landowners may have concerns about the impact of the  exchange on their property. Land exchange regulations require the  agencies to publish a notice of exchange proposal. Those opposed can  appeal or litigate land exchange decisions.", "Land surveys to validate the legal description of land and environmental  analyses can cause considerable delays in the process. Forest Service  officials reported experiencing delays of 1 to 2 years for completing the  required surveys and cited the addition and subtraction of land included in  the exchange as delaying the exchange process. When land is added to the  exchange midway through the process, this piece of land is subject to all  of the steps in the exchange process, including notifying the public of the  exchange proposal, updating environmental analyses, and conducting field  inspections and other analyses. Land may also be subtracted from the  exchange for many reasons, including the identification of a cultural site,  unresolved title issues, and the nonfederal landowner\u2019s decision not to  sell. If land is either added or subtracted during the exchange process,  then the need to balance federal and nonfederal land values after the  initial appraisals can increase the exchange processing time because new  appraisals have to be conducted.", "If a landowner dies before an exchange is completed, agency officials will  have to work with new landowners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since 2000, the Number of BLM and Forest Service Land Exchanges Has Declined for Several Reasons", "paragraphs": ["The number of land exchanges for the period we reviewed, October 1,  2004, through June 30, 2008, is lower than for the period we previously  examined, fiscal years 1989 through 1999. As we reported in 2000, the  Forest Service completed an average of 115 land exchanges annually from  fiscal years 1989 through 1999. In contrast, for the period we reviewed  through June 2008, the Forest Service completed an average of 29  exchanges annually. BLM did not provide information on the number of  exchanges completed for our 2000 report, but instead reported  transactions\u2014that is, one parcel of land either conveyed or acquired. For  the earlier period reviewed, BLM reported 238 separate transactions  annually. For our current review, BLM reported completing 38  exchanges, or an average of 10 per fiscal year.", "Fourteen of the 19 BLM and Forest Service officials we surveyed  confirmed this decrease in the number of land exchanges processed since  2000. In order of frequency, the officials cited the availability of qualified  staff, changes in the priority given to exchanges relative to other work,  and the availability of agency funding to process exchanges as the primary  reasons for the decline. More specifically:    Availability of qualified realty staff. Officials from both agencies stated  that they have experienced significant turnover in personnel, largely  because of retirements. In addition, they have been unable to replace such  staff because of declining budgets. This reduction in qualified staff limits  the agencies\u2019 ability to perform lower priority work, such as land  exchanges. For example, according to Forest Service officials, the Tonto  National Forest in Arizona has experienced a 50-percent reduction in  realty staff, from four to two, in 2 years. When realty staff leave or retire  before the exchange is completed, the agencies are less able to maintain  consistency and effectiveness. In response to staff shortages, some Forest  Service regions have begun pooling realty staff across their region to work  on complex realty transactions, such as land exchanges, rather then  specifically assigning them to a particular forest or ranger district  exclusively. They refer to these pooled resources as \u201czone teams.\u201d  According to BLM\u2019s land exchange program lead, newly hired realty staff  require coaching and training on the exchange process because they often  lack experience handling complex land exchanges.", "Changing priorities. Because exchanges typically are discretionary  activities, their processing often competes for staff time and attention with  other land transactions. In particular, the agencies have shifted focus from  processing discretionary land exchanges to processing energy rights-of- way, land acquisitions, administrative site sales, and special-use permits.  We found that BLM has focused more on sales under the Federal Land  Transaction Facilitation Act of 2000 instead of exchanges. Indeed, an  official from the BLM Nevada State Office told us the agency is not  currently pursuing any land exchanges in Nevada because it is focusing on  the sales program. As we reported in February 2008, as of May 2007, the  state accounted for 92 percent, or $88 million, of the revenue raised under  the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act through land sales. In  addition, Forest Service officials said that enactment of the Forest Service  Facility Realignment and Enhancement Act of 2005 caused a significant  priority shift to administrative site sales. According to Forest Service  officials, Regions 3 and 6 focus on administrative site sales instead of land  exchanges because these sales allow the agency to generate revenue.", "Availability of agency funding. According to agency officials we  interviewed, the same appropriation account funds land exchanges and  other land management activities, such as processing special-use permits  and energy rights-of-way, sales and other land adjustments, and boundary  and title management. Therefore, officials said, processing land exchanges  competes for funding with other activities that currently have a higher  priority. To compensate for the decline in exchange funding, the agencies  have been relying more on nonfederal parties to pay exchange processing  costs. While the agencies\u2019 guidance generally states that both the federal  and nonfederal parties should share the costs associated with processing  land exchanges equally, the agencies vary in the extent to which  nonfederal parties share the cost of processing exchanges. According to 4  of 10 BLM and 3 of 9 Forest Service officials we surveyed, the agencies  often give priority to exchanges in which the nonfederal party pays over  half of the processing costs. One of these BLM officials said that, in some  cases, when an exchange is supported by many different interest groups  and there is a clear benefit to many parties, BLM may be willing to pay the  majority of the processing costs. At the Forest Service, one survey  respondent said his region now conducts land exchanges only if the  nonfederal party pays 100 percent of the processing costs. According to  Forest Service headquarters officials, however, nonfederal parties can  never pay 100 percent of the processing costs of an exchange because they  would not pay for certain Forest Service costs, such as the Office of  General Counsel and regional reviews of land exchanges. One Forest  Service regional official cautioned that when nonfederal parties pay more  of the exchange costs, pressure increases on realty staff to complete  exchanges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some of the Land Exchanges Had Unique Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["Some of the 250 land exchanges processed from October 1, 2004, through  June 30, 2008, had unique characteristics.

For example:    BLM\u2019s Emerald Mountain exchange in Colorado involved BLM, the state,  and private landowners and was initiated in August 2004. The third-party  facilitator for this exchange, Western Land Group, worked with about 50  landowners to identify parcels available for disposal, obtained  commitments from private parties to purchase the parcels, and worked  with all parties to simultaneously close the exchange in February 2007.

According to these officials, there are a number of  advantages and disadvantages to using ledgers to track land value  imbalances. In terms of advantages, among the five respondents who  provided comments, one BLM state official said a ledger allows a balance  to be carried over for up to three years from the date of the first  transaction closing before the values must be equalized with a cash  equalization payment. Another noted that it is critical to use a ledger when  the state is the nonfederal party because states may be constitutionally  prohibited from providing cash to equalize the values of the lands  exchanged. A third BLM state office official remarked that ledgers are  invaluable because they enable the agency to move forward with NEPA  compliance, hazardous materials assessments, surveys and other work  needed to exchange some of the parcels, rather than waiting for this work  to be completed on all parcels. In terms of disadvantages to using ledgers,  three BLM state officials provided comments. For example, one official  stated that multiphase exchanges are complex and convoluted and imply  that BLM may not have fully planned the exchange transaction.

Multiphase exchanges with states continue because states  have significant amounts of land and can act as long-term exchange  partners.", "As previously stated, the Forest Service does conduct multiphase  exchanges, but only when each phase can be completed with the federal  and nonfederal values in balance. Furthermore, the Forest Service  regulations do not allow for the use of ledgers.

The following illustrates  why the agencies either did not conduct NEPA analyses or did so to a  more limited extent:    BLM\u2019s Boise Foothills/Northern Idaho exchange. The Solicitor\u2019s Office  determined that BLM did not need to conduct NEPA analyses for this  exchange because the statutory language requiring the exchange removed  any discretion by the Secretary of the Interior to approve or disapprove  the exchange or impose additional terms and conditions. Under these  circumstances, courts have found no purpose in conducting the NEPA  analyses.

The ledger for the ongoing  State of California multiphase exchange shows that the federal  government has been owed $2.2 million since 2003. Furthermore, this  exchange does not have a financial assurance in place to cover this  balance owed if the state does not pay. According to BLM officials, the  California Desert Protection Act of 1994 authorizes this exchange.  Because of the concerns about lands to be exchanged under the act, the  California State Lands Commission and the General Services  Administration (GSA) entered into a memorandum of agreement with  BLM, in lieu of an ATI. Under the memorandum and related agreements, if  the State Land Commission did not want the surplus federal property, GSA  was to sell surplus federal properties to third parties and deposit the sale  proceeds in a U.S. Treasury suspense account. After BLM received title to  the State Land Commission properties located within wilderness areas or  national park units, as identified in the 1994 act, GSA was to transfer the  money to the commission. According to BLM California State Office  officials, the exchange has been on hold since 2003, when the BLM  headquarters review team and Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor raised  concerns about the memorandum of agreement. In commenting on a draft  of this report, Interior said that it would be more accurate to state that the  exchange has been delayed because BLM and the state have been unable  to reach an agreement on value after three appraisals, the latest in 2008.   None of the appraisals were acceptable to both parties, and the state and  BLM have been discussing ways to resolve the appraisal issue and balance  the ledger.  In March 2009, a GSA official reported that GSA was still  holding $7.8 million in a Treasury account for the purpose of acquiring  land under the California Desert Protection Act.

Specifically, BLM conveyed federal land to various  private parties and received cash equal to the federal land\u2019s fair market  value from those private parties. The cash was then deposited into an  escrow account for the purpose of closing and sometimes was later  transferred to a U.S. Treasury deposit fund account. BLM would then use  this cash to pay landowners the fair market value of the nonfederal lands  BLM acquired from them. These transactions appear to be similar to the  unauthorized exchanges discussed in our 2000 report.", "BLM officials state that the CWALE multiphase exchange was conducted  pursuant to the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.  However, as we said in our 2000 report, BLM was not authorized to sell  federal land, retain the proceeds, and subsequently use the proceeds to  buy other lands under the umbrella of a land exchange. In 2000, shortly  after we issued our report, Congress passed the Federal Land Transaction  Facilitation Act (FLTFA). Under FLTFA, the gross proceeds from certain  exchanges or sales carried out under FLPMA are deposited into a special  account, known as the Federal Land Disposal Account. Funds in this  account are available to BLM and other land management agencies  without further appropriation to purchase privately owned land meeting  certain qualifications, generally referred to as \u201cinholdings.\u201d While the  federal lands conveyed in CWALE meet FLTFA\u2019s requirements, it appears  that the lands BLM acquired with the gross proceeds do not. Moreover,  instead of depositing the gross proceeds into the Federal Land Disposal  Account, BLM used some of the proceeds to acquire private lands that  were not FLTFA inholdings, and only later deposited the remaining  proceeds in the Federal Land Disposal Account.", "BLM officials further maintain that any money received served as either a  cash equalization payment or a financial assurance to secure the ledger\u2019s  imbalance. However, a cash equalization payment is intended to fulfill the  requirement that the values of the land exchanged be equal after all  reasonable efforts to equalize land by adding or excluding land from the  exchange. A payment from a nonfederal party that equals the federal land\u2019s  value appears more likely to be a purchase price than a cash equalization  payment. With respect to the financial assurance characterization, the  documents we obtained from BLM are not consistent with this  characterization. BLM\u2019s Land Exchange Handbook specifies the approved  methods for securing ledger imbalances. For cash or personal bonds, the  handbook says that BLM should obtain a personal bond, cash, and book  entry deposits form from the nonfederal party. BLM was unable to provide  us any such forms for the CWALE transactions.

For example, a 2003  BLM workgroup review highlighted the value of facilitators, but also  acknowledged the growing public perception that facilitators may have an  inappropriate level of influence over the exchange process. It  recommended that BLM develop policy and guidance related to  facilitators. In response, BLM revised its land exchange handbook in 2005  to expand its guidance and provide more detail on working with  facilitators. The earlier handbook had only called for facilitators to  disclose to the sellers their intent to transfer acquired lands and to  disclose to BLM their purchase price of nonfederal lands to be included in  an exchange.", "In contrast, the 2005 handbook states that third-party facilitators must  disclose all agreements and additional fees, costs, or surcharges to be  added to the appraised exchange property values to cover the cost of the  facilitator\u2019s participation in the exchange and must make these disclosures  before requesting an appraisal. In addition, the disclosure provision  ensures that BLM has the right to inspect the facilitator\u2019s records for up to  7 years after an exchange is completed. BLM policy also includes a  template for full disclosure language that must be used in the ATI if a  facilitator is involved.", "At the Forest Service, in 1998, the USDA Inspector General reported that  there were no guidelines for evaluating exchanges that facilitators had  proposed. Indeed, the report found that Forest Service staff at the  Humbolt-Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada had an \u201caccommodating  relationship\u201d with one facilitator, and gave the facilitator\u2019s proposed  exchanges a higher priority than other proposed exchanges. Furthermore,  forest staff improperly bargained with this facilitator and the landowner it  represented, which resulted in a loss of $5.9 million to the federal  government. The Inspector General recommended that the Forest Service  develop additional direction for dealing with facilitators and instruct all  Forest Service lands staff on the new policies. To respond to these  problems, the Forest Service said it planned to issue national guidance  defining the roles and responsibilities of Forest Service staff and  facilitators in 1999. In addition, the agency said it would provide training  on the new policies.", "The Forest Service\u2019s problems with third-party facilitators continued,  however, as evidenced by the agency\u2019s failed Blue Mountain exchange in  2006. The Blue Mountain exchange, initiated in 1998, involved a trade of  about 18,000 federal acres valued at $16 million for about 32,000  nonfederal acres valued at $15.7 million located in northeastern Oregon.  The nonfederal acres were owned by approximately 40 separate  landowners. Figure 3 shows the multiple parcels involved in this large  exchange involving three national forests and spanning six counties.", "This large and complex land exchange failed for several reasons,  according to Forest Service officials and documents we reviewed. First,  the Forest Service worked only with the third-party facilitator and did not  communicate with the nonfederal landowners about their willingness to  participate in the exchange. Second, the facilitator and the Forest Service  could not agree on the appraised values. Third, in the final stages of the  exchange, as the appraisals were about to expire, the facilitator proposed  dropping several land parcels of high value to the government, opting  instead to pay a higher cash equalization payment. The facilitator  proposed this change because, as the Forest Service later learned, several  landowners represented by the facilitator were no longer willing to  exchange their property. The officials said that while the planned cash  equalization payment\u2014$3.6 million\u2014would have been within the legal  threshold of 25 percent of the federal land value, such a large payment  would have gone against FLPMA\u2019s provision to keep such payments as low  as possible. Moreover, a regional official said that the exchange was  premised on the government receiving certain high-resource value lands  and when some of these lands dropped out, the agency decided the public  interest would no longer be served.", "A subsequent Forest Service internal regional review of the Blue Mountain  exchange indicated a number of problems with the facilitator. Specifically,  the review stated that the facilitator (1) tried to work on passing federal  legislation without the Forest Service\u2019s knowledge, (2) was very secretive  about its agreements with landowners, and (3) wanted to control the  outcome of the exchange instead of working as a partner with the Forest  Service to ensure an outcome that was in the public interest. In addition,  the review said that the facilitator never provided the Forest Service with  written documentation that landowners had granted Forest Service staff  permission to enter the landowners\u2019 properties to conduct appraisals,  surveys, and other studies, which made it difficult for Forest Service staff  and others to conduct this work. While the Forest Service did not track the  costs of processing this land exchange, it estimated that it spent $1.4  million from 1998 to 2006. In June 2008, Forest Service officials told us  that they planned to salvage parts of this exchange by working directly  with landowners and they will not involve a third-party facilitator.", "Following the failure of the Blue Mountain exchange in Oregon, in  December 2006, the Forest Service revised its guidance to its staff. The  revised guidance required staff to, among other things, obtain (1) written  permission to access properties for appraisals, inspections, and other  necessary activities; (2) written disclosure of the relationship between the  facilitator and nonfederal landowner; and (3) copies of purchase options,  agreements, or other financial arrangements affecting the value of the  appraised property.

Specifically, the facilitator misrepresented its  ownership of the nonfederal land to be acquired in the exchange, stating  that it owned all the land. However, the facilitator only held a 1-year  option to purchase part of the nonfederal land. The option expired during  the exchange process, requiring additional negotiations with the  landowner to acquire that land. The exchange was eventually completed in  December 2007.", "Thirteen survey respondents had worked with a third-party facilitator  during the period we reviewed\u20147 from BLM and 6 from the Forest  Service. These respondents worked on seven facilitated exchanges that  were subject to compliance with the disclosure guidelines. These  respondents reported that the facilitator in four exchanges did not comply  with the disclosure guidelines and two did comply, and in one case, the  respondent was not sure whether the facilitator complied. Of the two  cases where the facilitator was reported to have complied, BLM and  Forest Service officials provided incomplete supporting documentation.  Specifically, the BLM official provided us with an ATI that contained the  required provisions on disclosure but no documentation of the disclosure,  including agreements involving the facilitator and landowner, copies of  purchase options, or other financial arrangements affecting the value of  the appraised property. The Forest Service official provided us with a  letter from the landowner to the Forest Service outlining the role of the  facilitator in the exchange. The letter provides the name and role of the  facilitator and states that the facilitator has no ownership rights to any of  the nonfederal lands proposed for exchange.

Interior\u2019s Inspector General reports have reached similar  conclusions about appraiser independence, and our reports have  highlighted multiple cases of land transactions that inappropriately valued  land.", "In response to these problems, Interior reorganized its appraisal function.  Before November 2003, appraisals for land transactions in BLM and other  Interior land management agencies were conducted by staff reporting to  realty managers in each of these management agencies. Beginning in  November 2003, Interior removed appraisers from the realty offices in  each of the agencies and consolidated them in a new office, the Appraisal  Services Directorate (ASD). Interior took this action primarily to insulate  appraisers from institutional pressure. Under this new organization,  appraisers report to, and receive performance evaluations from, other  appraisers, rather than managers responsible for completing land  transactions in their respective land management agencies. Interior also  shifted administrative functions associated with appraisals\u2014previously  conducted by each land management agency\u2019s realty office\u2014to other units  within Interior. Contracting for land appraisals was one such function.", "In 2006, we reviewed ASD to determine, among other things, (1) the extent  to which Interior\u2019s appraisal policies and procedures ensure compliance  with recognized appraisal standards and (2) what, if anything, affects  ASD\u2019s working relationships with its client agencies and its overall  efficiency in providing appraisal services. We found that although the  quality of appraisals had improved since ASD\u2019s inception, Interior needed  to take several other steps to ensure that land transactions are based on  appraised values that adhere to recognized appraisal standards and to  establish a better accountability framework for ASD to help meet Interior  agencies\u2019 appraisal needs. Table 12 describes our recommendations on  quality and timeliness and the actions Interior has taken to address them.", "As table 12 shows, Interior has taken steps to act on our  recommendations. However, it has only recently acted on our  recommendation to establish dates for completing appraisals and to hold  ASD accountable for meeting these dates. We will monitor BLM\u2019s  implementation of this recommendation because we continue to believe  that appraisals need to be timely to meet schedules for completing land  exchanges.", "The Appraisal Foundation also reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s appraisal  policies and procedures in 2000. It found that, like BLM, Forest Service  staff appraisers lacked independence. Specifically, the foundation stated  that staff appraisers reported to line officers, who also control hiring,  advancement, and other personnel decisions. As a result, the staff  appraisers were not independent of the line officer to whom he or she  reports. Moreover, the line officer is in a position to influence or overrule  an appraiser\u2019s professional judgment. The report recommended that  appraisers report directly to the regional appraiser, and the regional  appraiser report to the chief appraiser.", "The Forest Service did not fully agree with the recommendation, stating  that implementing this recommendation would require it to create an  independent organization within the Forest Service that would be difficult  to administer, to establish work priorities, and to hold accountable.  However, in 2000, the Forest Service did partially implement this  recommendation by placing all staff appraisers within the regions under  the direct supervision of the regional appraiser and by placing the regional  appraiser under the direct supervision of the regional director with land  program responsibilities. Moreover, the Forest Service charged the chief  appraiser with completing the annual performance evaluations for  regional appraisers and providing these to the regional director. According  the Forest Service Chief Appraiser, as of April 2009, he does not complete  an annual performance evaluation for regional appraisers, but rather  provides comments to the regional director, who prepares the evaluation.  The Chief Appraiser added that he does complete a Valuation Compliance  Inspection of each regional appraiser once every 3 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Officials Report Appraisals Continue to Cause Problems with the Timeliness of Land Exchanges", "paragraphs": ["Eight of the 10 BLM officials, but only 1 of the 9 Forest Service officials,  surveyed found the timeliness of appraisals to be problematic. As noted  earlier, officials had cited the timeliness of appraisals as one of the most  commonly cited reasons for delays in completing land exchanges.", "In terms of the valuation process itself, BLM and Forest Service survey  respondents most frequently cited problems with the contracting process  for appraisals, the unavailability of contracted appraisers, and the  unavailability of in-house appraisers (5 of 19 in each case) as problems  their office had experienced with the valuation process. Again, BLM  respondents accounted for four of the five in each case.", "BLM and Forest Service survey respondents elaborated on these  problems. For example, two BLM respondents called the ASD contracting  process \u201ccumbersome,\u201d and one of those respondents further  characterized the ASD process as \u201csignificantly more costly and very  delayed.\u201d Another BLM respondent reported that ASD staff \u201cdid not work  well with our agency\u201d and that the process is \u201cambiguous and confusing.\u201d  Forest Service respondents also commented on the problems with the  valuation process that affect appraisal timeliness. For example, one Forest  Service respondent commented that appraisers are \u201covercommitted and  rarely meet delivery commitments,\u201d and another reported that the  availability of qualified appraisers \u201cremains somewhat limited.\u201d", "ASD appraisals may not be timely, in part because ASD has difficulty  identifying qualified contractors. ASD officials we interviewed cited  several reasons for this difficulty, including the limited number of  contractors qualified to conduct specific appraisal requests and qualified  contractors\u2019 lack of interest in conducting government appraisals. On the  second point, the ASD officials stated that contractors might not be  interested in conducting appraisals for ASD because of the long time  frames associated with exchanges and the resulting delay in receiving  payment for services, the high level of public scrutiny surrounding  exchange appraisals, and the opportunities of more lucrative  nongovernment appraisal assignments."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal land management agencies hold a public trust: to manage and  preserve millions of acres of land in pursuit of multiple national goals.  While land exchanges can be an effective tool for acquiring lands in the  public interest, the process is complex and may be lengthy and costly. It is  important, therefore, that BLM and the Forest Service effectively manage  and oversee the land exchange process to ensure that they are using their  limited resources wisely.", "Responding to criticisms that their land exchanges have not always served  the public interest or returned fair value to the federal government, BLM  and the Forest Service have taken actions intended to make the land  exchange process more transparent and accountable in order to better  assure that U.S. taxpayers are well served. Increased oversight of the land  exchange process has resulted in problems being identified and resolved  earlier in the exchange process. Furthermore, BLM\u2019s policy to discontinue  use of escrow accounts and the two agencies\u2019 revised guidance and  training have contributed to better management of the land exchange  programs. However, these actions have not always been fully implemented  or are not fully adequate to ensure the agencies are adhering to their  requirements and policies and effectively using their resources to serve the  public interest.", "Given the complexity of the land exchange process, recent policy changes,  and staff turnover in both agencies, it is critical that the agencies continue  to take actions to effectively oversee and manage land exchanges.  Improvements to the agencies\u2019 reviews would provide for a more  transparent decision-making process and provide critical information for  management and new staff on how past problems were overcome.  A  clearly stated records retention policy and adherence to that policy would  help manage and oversee land exchanges.  Furthermore, Forest Service  headquarters oversight of regional review programs will better ensure the  regions provide adequate review of land exchanges. In addition, better  management and oversight of BLM ledgers would help ensure that they are  complying with agency policy and are accurate. Clearly defining third- party facilitators, consistently applying disclosure policies to them, and  including them in the review process will provide more incentive for realty  staff to obtain required disclosure documentation, thereby helping the  agencies maintain control of the exchange process. Developing national  land tenure strategies at BLM and the Forest Service could help clarify  organizational priorities and unify agency staff in the pursuit of shared  goals for land exchanges. We continue to believe that better data on the  cost of land exchanges will help the agencies decide whether a proposed  land exchange is affordable and worthwhile. Finally, by making select  training mandatory and developing a formal system to track individuals\u2019  training, the agencies can better ensure that realty staff develop and  maintain the skills necessary to process exchanges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of  Agriculture take the following 15 actions in order to build on the  improvements to the land exchange programs BLM and the Forest Service  have made.", "We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of  Agriculture direct the heads of BLM and the Forest Service to strengthen  the review process by    assuring that key problems identified and their resolutions are    clarifying the retention policy for key exchange documents and ensuring  staff follow the policy.", "We further recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Chief of  the Forest Service to improve the review process by    making it a priority for the headquarters land exchange review team to  review regional exchange programs and follow up on implementation of  their recommendations, and    ensuring that the regions provide consistent oversight of land exchanges.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Director  of BLM to better manage value imbalances in multiphase exchanges and  protect federal funds by    ensuring that BLM state offices document their decision and supporting  rationale for whether and how to secure land exchange imbalances;    ensuring that an ATI documents how the ledger will be used to process a  multiphase exchange;  revising the standard format for ledgers prescribed in the exchange  handbook to assure that each ledger clearly demonstrates that the ledger  (1) is balanced at least every 3 years and (2) is either open or closed;    ensuring that offices prepare ledgers and follow the ledger format,  including revisions cited above;  including ledgers in feasibility and decision reviews to ensure quality; and    providing copies of ledger updates to agency headquarters for tracking of  balances due to the United States.", "Finally, we recommend that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary  of Agriculture direct the heads of BLM and the Forest Service to    clarify the definition of a third-party facilitator, ensure that disclosure  guidelines are consistently applied to all third-party facilitators, and  include disclosure documentation in the review process;    develop and issue national land tenure strategies for each agency and  encourage the BLM state and Forest Service regional offices to develop  their own plans to help guide land exchange decisions;  track the agencies\u2019 costs of processing individual land exchanges;    determine the elements of current training that should be mandatory to  ensure that staff are able to process exchanges in conformance to agency  guidance, create a formal system to track attendance at training, and  determine how often training should be retaken; and    ensure that staff have completed this mandatory training before working  on land exchanges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA for review and comment.  In written  comments, the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service generally agreed with the report  and 6 of the 9 recommendations for the Forest Service; it partially agreed with  the other 3 recommendations.  First, the Forest Service agreed in part with our  recommendation to develop and issue a national land tenure strategy, stating  that the department\u2019s National Land Acquisition Plan and agency\u2019s Strategic  Plan provide sufficient overarching guidance in the development of regional  and forest plans.  It did agree that some of the regional or forest plans on land  adjustment activities were out of date or inadequate.  We maintain that the  Forest Service\u2019s guidance does not include national strategies that could help  clarify organizational priorities and unify staff in the pursuit of shared goals.   Second, the Forest Service partially agreed with our recommendation to track  the cost of individual exchanges because it recognizes that tracking the costs of  individual exchanges may provide some benefit.  However, it stated that the  cost of developing and implementing a tracking system would outweigh the  benefit.  The Forest Service added that it is planning to test a database designed  to centralize information on the rough costs of individual land exchanges to  help make decisions, track changes, and report to stakeholders and Congress.   We commend the Forest Service for taking steps to collect data on the cost of  land exchanges.  However, it is unclear from the Forest Service\u2019s comments  whether this proposed database will enable tracking of costs as we have  recommended.  We continue to believe that better data on the cost of land  exchanges will help the agencies decide whether a proposed land exchange is  affordable and worthwhile.  Finally, the Forest Service agreed in part with our  recommendation to ensure that its staff has completed training before working  on land exchanges.  It stated that it agrees with the intent of the  recommendation to clearly describe and implement training and supervisory  requirements.  However, it did not believe that the recommendation gave it the  flexibility to allow inexperienced employees to work on exchanges with  supervision.  While we acknowledge the need for flexibility, we believe that the  Forest Service will ensure that realty staff develop the necessary skills to  process an exchange if it selectively makes training mandatory and requires the  training to be completed before handling land exchanges.  Appendix V provides  the Forest Service\u2019s written comments, along with our detailed evaluation of  those comments.  In addition, the Forest Service provided technical comments  on the draft report, which we have incorporated as appropriate.", "We also provided a draft of this report to Interior for review and comment.   In written comments, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals  Management did not directly comment on whether the department agreed  or disagreed with our recommendations.  It did state that the department  does not concur with some of the report\u2019s findings.  Interior\u2019s letter  highlighted two areas of concern:  (1) the document retention policy and  (2) the use of ledgers to track value imbalances.", "Interior disagrees with our finding that BLM\u2019s guidance does not clearly  state the document retention policy for land exchange documents.  We  continue to believe that the BLM policy for records retention is not clear  regarding land exchange records.  The four subsections pertaining to land  exchanges do not always provide clear time frames for how long  documents are to be retained.  In response to Interior\u2019s comments, we  revised the report to highlight the different interpretations of this policy by  two senior lands and realty managers.  We believe these differing  interpretations underscore the confusion inherent in the current policy.   Our assessment of the policy, along with program officials\u2019 differing  interpretations, support our conclusion that the retention policy is unclear.", "Although we found that the agency is not adhering to its guidance for  maintaining ledgers, Interior stated that BLM believes that the land  exchange case files as a whole document the values of lands conveyed and  any resulting imbalances.  Nevertheless, BLM\u2019s land exchange handbook  states, and we concur, that ledgers should completely and accurately  reflect the balances due so that values owed are easily identified.  Indeed,  as Interior stated, BLM cannot now verify the cumulative imbalance.  We  continue to believe better management and oversight of BLM ledgers  would help ensure that the ledgers are complying with regulations and  policy and that the imbalances reported are accurate.", "Interior also provided technical comments.  Most significantly, it disagrees  with our statement that the authority for certain multiphase exchanges cited  in the draft report remains questionable and that these exchanges appear to  have resulted in transfers of cash that should have been regarded as sale or  exchange proceeds or payments for land acquisitions.

We were asked to (1) analyze the number, trends, and  characteristics of BLM and Forest Service land exchanges, and (2)  determine the actions BLM and the Forest Service have taken to address  previously identified key problems and the effectiveness of these actions.", "For both of our objectives, we reviewed relevant documents and  interviewed BLM and Forest Service officials responsible for land  exchanges at headquarters, state or regional offices, and field offices, and  an official from the Colorado State Land Board. We also interviewed  officials from two for-profit, third-party facilitators\u2014Western Land Group  based in Denver, Colorado, and Summit Resources based in Phoenix,  Arizona\u2014as well as officials from the Western Lands Project, a nonprofit  organization that tracks land exchanges. To learn about the exchange  process in detail, we visited with BLM state and Forest Service regional  officials in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. We also met with BLM  officials at the Royal Gorge Field Office in Colorado and with Forest  Service officials at the Tonto National Forest in Arizona and the combined  Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests in Colorado.  We primarily selected these sites because they were processing many land  exchanges. We attended several sessions of the Complex Land Tenure  Adjustment training course at the BLM National Training Center in  Phoenix, Arizona, in June 2008.", "To address both objectives, we also conducted a Web-based survey of 10  BLM state land exchange program managers and all 9 Forest Service  regional program managers. The BLM managers were located in Arizona,  California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,  and Wyoming. The nine Forest Service managers were located in Regions  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. We surveyed these managers because their  offices were processing land exchanges during the period we reviewed. In  this survey, we asked program managers about trends and reasons for  overall exchange activity, legislated land exchanges, third-party  facilitators, BLM and Forest Service land exchange proposal reviews, the  land exchange ledgers and financial assurances BLM uses to account for  land value imbalances, BLM\u2019s land tenure strategy plans, the timeliness of  land exchanges, the valuation process, land exchange training and  guidance, and the cost of exchanges. To develop the draft survey, we  obtained and incorporated comments from the BLM and Forest Service  land exchange program leads as appropriate. We also pretested the survey  with BLM state office and Forest Service regional office land exchange  program leads and made changes in the survey\u2019s questions as appropriate.  Information about accessing our survey was provided via e-mail for all  survey participants. We provided survey respondents access to the survey  via e-mail in December 2008 and encouraged them to use all available  resources in their office to provide the most complete and accurate  answers possible. To ensure security and data integrity, we provided all  participants with a user name and a personal password that allowed them  to access the survey and ensure that no one else could edit the answers.  We achieved a 100 percent response rate for our survey.", "For our first objective, to analyze the number, trends, and characteristics  of BLM and Forest Service land exchanges, we requested that the  agencies\u2019 headquarters land exchange program leads collect information  on the universe of pending, completed, or terminated land exchanges  processed from October 31, 2004, through June 30, 2008. The data  collected included the identity and vital statistics on the exchanges, which  encompassed the number of federal and nonfederal acres, parcels, and  landowners; the appraised land values; the cash equalization payment; the  type of interests to be exchanged; the Agreement to Initiate (ATI) date; the  current exchange status; the completion date (if applicable); the third- party facilitator involved; specific legislation (if any); and BLM land  exchanges with ledgers. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing them for inconsistencies and missing information, and then  followed up with BLM state and Forest Service regional contacts as  necessary to make corrections. From the data provided, we calculated the  average time to complete exchanges using the date the ATI was signed and  the completion date. Furthermore, to determine the reasons for any  trends in land exchanges, we interviewed agency officials at each level and  used our Web-based survey to ask BLM and Forest Service land exchange  program leads about the overall trends in exchanges since 2000 and the  reasons for these trends. In addition to our survey, we gathered more  detailed information from agency officials on selected characteristics of  these exchanges: (1) multiphase exchanges, including those using a ledger;  (2) exchanges assisted by a third-party facilitator; and (3) specifically  legislated exchanges. For specifically legislated exchanges, our Office of  General Counsel summarized the provisions of the laws, and then we  compared the provisions with exchanges conducted pursuant to the  agencies\u2019 broad discretionary authority to determine how they differed, if  at all.", "See appendixes III and IV for selected information on BLM and Forest  Service land exchanges processed from October 1, 2004, through June 30,  2008.", "For our second objective, to determine the effectiveness of actions BLM  and the Forest Service have taken to address previously identified  problems, we determined the (1) previously identified problems, (2)  actions agencies took in response to those problems, and (3) effectiveness  of those actions.", "First, we reviewed GAO reports issued since 1985, Interior and USDA  inspector general reports, Appraisal Foundation reports, and BLM and  Forest Service internal reviews (see app. II for a list of these reports). For  each of these reports, we identified the problems cited and  recommendations. We placed these problems and recommendations into  seven categories: (1) assure that certain requirements are met, (2) use of  escrow accounts, (3) work with third-party facilitators, (4) planning, (5)  guidance and training, (6) cost of exchanges, and (7) appraisals. Of the 115  problems identified in the past reports, we choose to follow up on 34  problems\u2014each of which fell within one of the seven categories. We  selected these problems for follow-up based on the frequency of the  problem cited, and whether they were related to statutory and regulatory  requirements. Although the category with the most problems\u201450\u2014was  the appraisal category, we conducted limited work on appraisals because  we reviewed Interior\u2019s Appraisal Services Directorate in September 2006.", "Second, to identify actions taken in response to the seven categories of  problems, we interviewed land exchange program managers at BLM and  the Forest Service and obtained and analyzed related documentation on  the actions these officials cited. We also obtained and reviewed agency  responses to the recommendations and agency status reports.", "Third, to determine the effectiveness of the agencies\u2019 actions to address  the key problems earlier reports had identified, we analyzed the available  key documents for a sample of land exchanges processed from October  2004 through June 2008 to determine (1) whether the previously identified  problems were addressed, (2) whether internal BLM and Forest Service  reviews documented these problems, and (3) the resolution of the  documented problems. We selected a nongeneralizable sample of 31 land  exchanges out of the 250 exchanges processed from October 2004 through  June 2008, comprised of 27 exchanges that accounted for 85 percent of  acres that the agencies have or plan to acquire, and 4 others that we  reviewed during the course of our site visits. We based our selection on  acreage rather than land value because values were not available for all of  the exchanges and because acreage is a better indicator of land area  affected. We added the remaining 4 exchanges\u20141 by BLM and 3 by the  Forest Service\u2014because they were available for our review during our site  visit with the BLM state office and Forest Service regional office in New  Mexico. Of the 31 exchanges in our sample, 19 were BLM and 12 were  Forest Service exchanges. We then developed a data collection instrument  to record the results of our review of key documents associated with each  exchange.", "To examine the sample of 31 exchanges in detail, we identified the  following nine key documents for our review:    Five documents pertinent to the exchange, including the feasibility  analysis, the ATI, the draft decision, the final decision, and any land  exchange ledgers used in BLM multiphase exchanges.", "Four agency reviews of the exchange documents at two stages, including  BLM or Forest Service headquarters or regional review team reviews at  the feasibility and decision stages, and Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor  review of BLM exchanges at the feasibility and decision stages.", "The BLM and Forest Service exchange program leads confirmed that these  were the key documents in processing a land exchange.", "The data collection instrument we developed to record our review of the  31 exchanges focused on six requirements or guidelines selected on the  basis of our and other prior reports citing problems in meeting these  requirements or guidelines, interviews with the BLM and Forest Service  land exchange leads and other agency staff, document reviews, and the  information provided in the land exchange training sessions we attended.  The six requirements or guidelines were to (1) properly describe the lands  subject to an exchange; (2) ensure that the proposed exchange conforms  with the land use plan; (3) determine that the public interest will be well  served; (4) determine the dollar values of the lands to be exchanged,  including whether the values are within 25 percent of each other; (5)  ensure parties provide title to the properties involved; and (6) ensure  compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.", "In addition to our review of land exchange documents, we surveyed BLM  and Forest Service officials about the effectiveness of certain actions  related to the categories of past problems we identified: (1) assure that  certain requirements or guidelines are met, (2) use of escrow accounts, (3)  work with third-party facilitators, (4) planning, (5) guidance and training,  (6) cost of exchanges, and (7) appraisals.", "Finally, for the 31 exchanges in our sample, we obtained and reviewed (1)  documents on third-party facilitators\u2019 compliance with certain  requirements or guidelines to disclose their relationships with nonfederal  landowners involved in the exchanges, and (2) seven land exchange  ledgers used within our time frame to determine how ledgers were  implemented and conducted follow-up interviews with the BLM state  offices responsible for managing the ledgers.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 to June 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We revised the report to reflect the fact that regional staff, not  necessarily reviewers, both process and review all exchanges in the  region.  We also added a sentence to acknowledge that there is an  intentional separation between regional staff who process exchanges  and those who review them. (Now on p. 35.)  2.  We continue to believe that the Forest Service needs a more detailed  national plan to guide its land exchange activities.  The 2005 National  Land Acquisition Plan does not, in our opinion, offer a specific  strategy on making exchange and other land transaction decisions on a  national basis.  We believe a specific strategy could help clarify  organizational priorities and unify staff in the pursuit of shared goals.  (Now on p. 66.)  3.  Although the Forest Service agrees in part with our recommendation  on tracking costs and recognizes that tracking costs for individual  exchanges may provide some benefit, it does not provide any support  for its position that the effort to track the costs would exceed the  expected benefit, such as a cost-benefit analysis.  Furthermore, Forest  Service officials had told us during our review that they would need  only to establish a specific project code in their accounting system to  track such costs, and therefore the Forest Service would not need to  develop and implement a new system to track exchange costs.  We  commend the Forest Service\u2019s effort to develop a centralized database  to collect the rough costs of exchanges it does collect, but we believe  that better data on the cost of land exchanges will help the agencies  decide whether a proposed land exchange is affordable and  worthwhile. (Now on p. 66.)  4.  We slightly modified our recommendation by replacing \u201cthis\u201d with  \u201cmandatory\u201d to more closely align this recommendation with the prior  one calling for the Forest Service to identify and make certain training  mandatory.  We believe, however, that by ensuring that realty staff  working on exchanges have taken the proper training, the agency can  help these staff develop and maintain the skills necessary to process  exchanges.  Moreover, our recommendation for the agencies to  determine which elements of the current training courses to make  mandatory and how often they should be taken provides the agencies  with necessary flexibility.

We continue to believe that the BLM policy for records retention is not  clear for land exchange records.  The four subsections on land  exchanges do not always provide clear time frames for how long  documents are to be retained.  In response to Interior\u2019s comment, we  revised the report to state that two senior lands and realty managers  provided different interpretations of the policy. One stated that, in  practice, completed exchange case files are retained for 3 years and  then sent to a Federal Records Center.  The second official stated that  retention varies depending on the final disposition of a proposal, and  he was unclear on certain aspects of the policy.  While we did not  contact a BLM records management official, we believe that our  assessment of the policy, together with the differing interpretations of  program officials, support our conclusion that the retention policy is  unclear. (Now on p. 33.)  2.  BLM believes that the land exchange case files as a whole document  the values of lands conveyed and any resulting imbalances.  While this  may be the case, BLM\u2019s land exchange handbook states, and we  concur, that ledgers should completely and accurately reflect the  balances due in order that values owed are easily identified. In its  comment, BLM states that it is not currently able to verify the  cumulative imbalance.  We continue to believe that better management  and oversight of BLM ledgers would help ensure that ledgers comply  with regulations and policy and that imbalances reported are accurate.  (Now on p. 38.)  3.  We revised the report text and accompanying footnote to clarify how  the two agencies conduct multiphase exchanges and how these relate  to the agencies\u2019 separate definitions of assembled land exchanges.  (Now on p. 6.)  4.  We revised the report to clarify that categorical exclusions apply only  to Forest Service.  (Now on p. 7.)  5.  The statement in this paragraph is based on the frequency of responses  to our survey, and the additional reason the comments cited was not  among the most frequent.  However, two respondents did cite protests,  appeals, and litigation as reasons for delays in completion of land  exchanges.  We revised the text to reflect Interior\u2019s comment. (Now on  p. 15.)  6.  As the Interior letter states, a ledger was not prepared for the fifth and  final phase of the exchange and therefore could not be provided to us  for review.  Although Interior states that the case file clearly  documents that the values of the federal and nonfederal lands  exchanged were equalized in the final phase of this exchange, as stated  earlier, this information should be maintained in the ledger.  We  revised the text to clarify that we are referring to the final phase of the  Birch Creek exchange. (Now on p. 20.)  7.  As stated above, a ledger was not prepared for the final phase of the  Birch Creek exchange.  We retain the ledger status as \u201cnone\u201d and  clarified the footnote. (Now on p. 21.)  8.  We appreciate the updated figures for acreage and value in these two  exchanges. However, the numbers we list are based on BLM data  provided as of June 30, 2008.  Since we do not have updated acreage  and value data for the other 248 BLM and Forest Service land  exchanges, we will not incorporate these updated numbers for only  two exchanges in our report. (Now on p. 21.)  9.  The law addressing the State of California exchange calls for the  exchange of certain state school lands for certain public lands under  Interior\u2019s jurisdiction and any federal land which is or becomes surplus  to the needs of the federal government, but does not identify specific  parcels of land. All of the other legislated exchanges with this column  checked had specific parcels identified for exchange. We revised the  report to clarify this distinction. (Now on p. 23.)  10. We reported that BLM officials believe that the Central Washington  Assembled Land Exchange II (CWALE) multiphase exchange was  conducted pursuant to the applicable statutory and regulatory  requirements. As we stated in the report, we are pursuing the issue of  whether certain multiphase exchanges, including CWALE, are  authorized with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor. (Now on p. 36 and 40- 41.)  11. We added this explanation to the report regarding the reasons the  exchange has been pending since 2003. (Now on p. 39.)      12. We reported that BLM officials believe that the CWALE multiphase  exchange was conducted pursuant to the applicable statutory and  regulatory requirements. As we stated in the report, we are pursuing  the issue of whether certain multiphase exchanges, including CWALE,  are authorized with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor. Interior\u2019s  comments state that funds BLM received during the CWALE  multiphase exchange and placed into a deposit fund account (which  the comments erroneously call a suspense account) were for financial  assurance purposes. However, BLM was unable to produce any  documentation that the monies BLM received were financial  assurances when we requested such documentation. Most notably,  BLM was unable to provide us with the completed form that the  agency\u2019s handbook says should accompany financial assurances of  cash or personal bonds. (Now on p. 40-41.)  13. While the handbook provides guidance and land use plans provide  management direction for a specific resource area, neither offers a  national strategy on making exchange and other land transaction  decisions.  We continue to believe that developing a national land  tenure strategy at BLM could help clarify organizational priorities and  unify agency staff in the pursuit of shared goals for land exchanges.  (Now on p. 48.)  14. There is no change required because this is a direct quotation. (Now on  p. 49.)  15. We revised the text to reflect this comment.
