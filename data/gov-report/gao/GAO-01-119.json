However, small business representatives believe that some of these reforms could make it difficult for small businesses to compete for federal contracts. For example, the Clinger-Cohen Act authorizes the use of multiagency contracts. These contracts could potentially consolidate agencies' requirements, which small businesses may not be able to meet. At the same time, some procurement reforms have benefited small businesses. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, for example, increased the value of contracts set aside exclusively for small business participation. In addition, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 increased the percentage of federal contracts to be awarded to small businesses to 23 percent.

Specifically, we agreed to address (1)  provisions in acquisition reform legislation enacted in the 1990s and other  changes in procurement that took place during this time that could affect  small business contractors and (2) trends that might indicate possible  shifts in the ability of small businesses to obtain federal contracts in the  1990s. To identify the provisions of acquisition reform legislation and  possible shifts in procurement from small businesses, we analyzed key  legislative reforms and other changes and obtained the views of  representatives of several associations representing small businesses.

Federal agency acquisitions must be conducted in accordance  with a set of statutes and regulations designed to accomplish several  objectives, including full and open competition and various social and  economic goals, such as encouraging small business participation. In the  late 1980s and early 1990s, some became convinced that the federal  procurement system had become complex, unwieldy, and overwrought  with tension between the basic goals of efficiency and fairness because of a  proliferation of requirements governing almost every aspect of the  acquisition process. In this environment, there were concerns about the  government's ability to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by  the commercial marketplace. In response to these concerns, Congress  enacted two major pieces of reform legislation, FASA and Clinger-Cohen,  aimed at creating a more efficient and responsive federal acquisition  system. Concerns remain about whether the changes brought about by  acquisition reform during the 1990s have come at the expense of placing  small business at a disadvantage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative and Other Changes That Could Affect the Ability of Small Businesses to Obtain Federal Contracts", "paragraphs": ["The federal procurement process underwent many legislative and  administrative changes during the 1990s, some of which have the potential  to affect the ability of small businesses to obtain federal contracts. Other  changes occurred during this time, such as reductions in the amount the  government spent on goods and services and the size of its acquisition  workforce, which agency officials believe have also encouraged  procurement streamlining. These changes included the use of certain  contract vehicles, such as MACs. In addition, reforms have modified the  dollar range of contracts that are reserved for small businesses and  encouraged the use of purchase cards, which are similar to corporate  credit cards, for the use of certain purchases. Some organizations that  represent small businesses are concerned that these changes could  potentially erode the ability of small businesses to receive federal  contracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Factors Have Affected Federal Procurement Practices", "paragraphs": ["At the same time that acquisition reform legislation was enacted, other  factors changed how much the federal government bought as well as the  way it buys goods and services. During the 1990s, the federal government  decreased the amount spent on goods and services and downsized the  acquisition workforce.", "The total amount of goods and services that the government purchased,  including those bought with purchase cards, declined by about 7 percent  from an inflation-adjusted $224 billion in fiscal year 1993 to $209 billion in  fiscal year 1999. Consequently, all businesses had to compete for a reduced  total of federal contract expenditures. Figure 2 shows the trend in total  federal procurement expenditures during this period.", "Federal agencies also reduced their acquisition workforce personnel from  165,739 in fiscal year 1990 to 128,649 in fiscal year 1998, or approximately  22 percent, during this time, with many of these reductions taking place at  the Department of Defense (DOD). According to agency officials,  contracting officials have sought ways to streamline procurement practices  within the applicable statutes and regulations partly as a result of these  workforce reductions; this includes the use of previously authorized  contracting vehicles such as blanket purchase agreements (BPA),  indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, and GSA federal  supply schedule contracts. Appendix I provides a description of these  contract vehicles.", "Contract bundling is an acquisition practice that received a lot of attention  in the 1990s and is often associated with but, in fact, is not actually  contained in acquisition reform legislation enacted during this period.  Federal agencies combine existing contracts into fewer contracts as a  means of streamlining as well as reducing procurement and contract  administration costs, a practice generally referred to as \u201ccontract  consolidation.\u201d A subset of consolidated contracts is \u201cbundled contracts\u201d  that the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 defines as the  consolidation of two or more procurement requirements for goods or  services previously provided or performed under separate, smaller  contracts into a solicitation of offers for a single contract that is likely to be  unsuitable for award to a small business concern due to  the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the   the aggregate dollar value of the anticipated award;  the geographic dispersion of contract performance sites; or  any combination of these three criteria.", "This act requires each federal agency, to the maximum extent practicable,  to (1) promote participation of small businesses by structuring its  contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small  businesses and (2) avoid the unnecessary and unjustified bundling of  contracts that are likely to be unsuitable for small business participation as  prime contractors.", "Federal policy has also encouraged the use of governmentwide commercial  purchase cards for micropurchases. The purchase card, issued to a broad  range of authorized agency personnel to acquire and pay for goods and  services, is similar in nature to a corporate credit card and is the preferred  method for purchases of $2,500 or less.

In both fiscal years 1998 and 1999, when the  goal increased to 23 percent, small businesses received 23 percent of total  federal contract expenditures. Focusing on expenditures for new contracts  worth over $25,000, our analysis shows that small businesses have received  between 25 and 28 percent of these expenditures during this period. In  addition, focusing on the various categories of goods and services that the  federal government purchases, small businesses received a higher share in  fiscal year 1999 of expenditures in new contracts for most categories of  goods and services than they did in fiscal year 1993. Several contract  vehicles accounted for about one quarter of all governmentwide  expenditures for contracts over $25,000 in fiscal year 1999, and small  businesses received between 26 and 55 percent of expenditures for these  contract vehicles in that year. We could not determine the amount or  impact of contract bundling or the impact of the increased use of  government purchase cards on small businesses.

In  calculating the actual achievement of small business procurement goals for  individual federal agencies, SBA excludes certain categories of  procurements from the base, or denominator. SBA has identified several  categories of procurements that are excluded from the base because SBA  officials believe that small businesses do not have a reasonable opportunity  to compete for them, including (1) foreign military sales; (2) procurement  awarded and performed outside the United States; (3) purchases from  mandatory sources of supplies as listed in the Federal Acquisition  Regulation; and (4) purchases for specific programs from the Departments  of State, Transportation, and the Treasury.", "SBA's Office of Advocacy disagrees with SBA's approach of excluding  categories of procurements in establishing the base. Adding back the  categories of procurement that SBA excluded, the Office of Advocacy  reported that small businesses received about 21 percent of total federal  procurement in fiscal year 1998 (rather than the 23 percent that SBA  reported) and that, therefore, the governmentwide goal for small business  procurement was not met in fiscal year 1998.", "Some organizations that represent small businesses have expressed  concerns that small businesses are at a disadvantage when competing for  new federal contracts. Therefore, we analyzed the share of expenditures  for new contracts going to small businesses. These data do not include  modifications to existing contracts, which account for approximately half  of all governmentwide procurement expenditures during this time. Our  analysis of FPDS data of new contract expenditures shows that small  businesses have received between 25 and 28 percent of such expenditures  for contracts worth more than $25,000 between fiscal years 1993 and 1999.  Figure 4 shows the results of our analysis. In calculating the share of total  expenditures on new contracts going to small businesses from fiscal years  1993 to 1999, we used FPDC data on expenditures for new contracts worth  more than $25,000 and did not exclude the types of expenditures that SBA  excludes to calculate the small business procurement goal.", "As noted in figure 2, the federal government has been spending less money  on goods and services since fiscal year 1993. The only categories of goods  and services that experienced increases in governmentwide purchases on  new contracts worth more than $25,000 between fiscal years 1993 and 1999  were real property and other services. Despite this overall decline in  contract purchases, small businesses received a higher share in fiscal year  1999 than in fiscal year 1993 of expenditures on new contracts worth  $25,000 or more than for 5 of the 8 categories of goods and services of government procurement: equipment, research and development,  architect and engineering, automatic data processing services, and other  services. Figure 5 shows governmentwide trends for purchases under new  contracts of goods and services worth more than $25,000 and the share of  these purchases going to small businesses.", "We analyzed FPDS data on the governmentwide use of certain contract  vehicles for contracts over $25,000, including those that became popular  during the 1990s. We found that these vehicles represent a small but  growing share of federal procurement expenditures. Because FPDS only  captures data for some of these contract vehicles, we had to limit our  analysis to MACs, IDIQs, BPAs, and GSA schedules.", "Expenditures for the four types of contract vehicles we analyzed  represented 25 percent of federal procurement expenditures on contracts  over $25,000 in fiscal year 1999, compared with 16 percent in fiscal year  1994.

For example,  expenditures going to small businesses for MACs increased from  $524 million in fiscal year 1994, or 8 percent of all expenditures for MACs,  to $2 billion in fiscal year 1999, or 26 percent of all expenditures for MACs.  Expenditures going to small businesses for IDIQs from fiscal years 1994 to  1999 remained relatively stable, near $7 billion. The percentage of total  expenditures for IDIQs going to small businesses increased from  24 percent of total expenditures for IDIQs in fiscal year 1994 to 28 percent  in 1999. The small business share of GSA schedules increased from  27 percent in fiscal year 1994 to 36 percent in fiscal year 1999, from  $523 million to $3 billion. Finally, the small business share of BPAs fell from  97 percent in fiscal year 1994 to about 55 percent in fiscal year 1999,  although the expenditures increased for small businesses from about  $141 million in fiscal year 1994 to about $2 billion in fiscal year 1999."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data on Contract Bundling and Its Effect on Small Businesses Are Very Limited", "paragraphs": ["In conducting a review of contract bundling in 2000, we found that there  are only limited governmentwide data on the extent of contract bundling  and its actual effect on small businesses.

Our review of consolidated contracts worth  $12.4 billion at 3 procurement centers showed that the number of  contractors and the contract dollars were generally reduced due to  consolidation as agencies sought to streamline procurement and reduce its  associated administrative costs.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) expresses a preference for multiple awards of these contracts,  which allows orders to be placed using a streamlined, commercial style  selection process where consideration is limited to the contract awardees.  The competition between the multiple awardees is designed to encourage  better prices and responses than if the agency were negotiating with a  single contractor.
