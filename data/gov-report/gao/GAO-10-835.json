Prior GAO work has identified nine attributes of successful  performance measures. Table 3 shows the nine attributes, their  definitions, and the potentially adverse consequences of not having the  attributes.", "Our analysis found that DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance measures  lack several of the key attributes of successful performance measures.  Based on our analysis of a generalizable sample of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009  performance measures, we found the attributes of core program  activities and linkage were generally present, but other attributes such as  balance and limited overlap were missing, and attributes including  governmentwide priorities, reliability, objectivity, clarity, and measurable  targets were present in varying degrees.", "We found that the attribute of core program activities was identified in the  set of measures, while balance and limited overlap did not appear to be  present.", "Core program activities. We estimate that all of DOD\u2019s counternarcotics  performance measures cover the department\u2019s core program activities. We  have previously reported that core program activities are the activities that  an entity is expected to perform to support the intent of the program, and  that performance measures should be scoped to evaluate those activities.  For the measures we reviewed, DOD divides its core counternarcotics  activities across its 3 goals and 13 objectives (see table 2). In our analysis,  we found at least one performance measure covering each of DOD\u2019s  counternarcotics objectives. Therefore, we determined that DOD\u2019s core  program activities were covered.", "Balance. DOD\u2019s set of performance measures lack balance. We have  previously reported that balance exists when a set of measures ensures  that an organization\u2019s various priorities are covered. According to DOD,  performance measures best cover its priorities when five measurable  aspects of performance, as defined by DOD\u2014input, process, output,  outcome, and impact\u2014are present in its performance measures. As an  example, \u201cnumber of attendees to basic counterdrug intelligence course\u201d  is, in our determination, a measure of output, as it measures the services  provided by DOD. We estimate 93 percent of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009  performance measures are input, process, or output measures, while 6  percent are outcome measures and 0 percent are impact measures.  Therefore, given that DOD\u2019s set of measures is highly skewed towards  input, process, and output measures and contains no impact measures, we  determined that the set is not balanced by DOD\u2019s criteria. Performance  measurement efforts that lack balance overemphasize certain aspects of  performance at the expense of others, and may keep DOD from  understanding the effectiveness of its overall mission and goals.", "Limited overlap. We determined there to be overlap among DOD\u2019s  performance measures. We found instances where the measures and their  results appeared to overlap with other measures and results. When we  spoke with DASD-CN> officials concerning this, they stated that the set  of measures could be conveyed using fewer, more accurate measures. We  have reported that each performance measure in a set should provide  additional information beyond that provided by other measures. When an  agency has overlapping measures, it can create unnecessary or duplicate  information, which does not benefit program management.", "Of the remaining six attributes of successful performance measures, only  one attribute\u2014linkage\u2014was present in almost all of the measures, while  the other five attributes\u2014governmentwide priorities, reliability,  objectivity, clarity, and measurable targets\u2014appeared in varying degrees  (see figure 1).", "DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance measures demonstrate linkage. We  estimate that 99 percent of DOD\u2019s measures are linked to agencywide  goals and mission. DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance measurement  system database requires that for each performance measure entered into  the database, a goal and related objective of DOD\u2019s counternarcotics  mission be identified. Our analysis found that in all but one instance,  linkage between DOD\u2019s goals and performance measures is easily  identified.", "However, DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance measures did not fully  satisfy five attributes.", "Governmentwide priorities. We estimate that 41 percent of the measures  we analyzed cover a broader governmentwide priority, such as quality,  timeliness, efficiency, cost of service, or outcome. We determined, for  example, that the governmentwide priority of \u201cquality\u201d was reflected in the  measure \u201cnumber of sensors integrated and providing reliable and  dependable radar data to JIATF-S and/or host nations,\u201d because it  measures the reliability and dependability of detection services. In the  majority of the instances, however, measures did not address a  governmentwide priority. For example, the measure \u201cnumber of trained  military working dog teams trained\u201d was determined not to cover a  governmentwide priority because it does not measure the quality or  efficiency of training provided. When measures fail to cover  governmentwide priorities managers may not be able to balance priorities  to ensure the overall success of the program.", "Reliability. We estimate that 46 percent of DOD\u2019s performance measures  have data collection methods indicated in the database that generally  appear reliable. Reliability refers to whether a measure is designed to  collect data or calculate results such that the measure would be likely to  produce the same results if applied repeatedly to the same situation. For  each entry in the database, users are directed to enter, among other  information, one performance measure and its associated methodology,  target, and result. However, in numerous instances the system contained  multiple performance measures entered into fields that should contain  only one measure. Such entries could result in errors of collecting,  maintaining, processing, or reporting the data. Additionally, some  measures did not provide enough information on data collection methods  or performance targets to assure reliability. For example, a measure in the  database states \u201ccontinuous U.S. Navy ship presence in the SOUTHCOM  area of responsibility.\u201d The performance target listed for this measure is  \u201c3.5,\u201d but to what 3.5 refers\u2014such as days, number of ships, or percentage  points\u2014is not explained. Moreover, the methodology in the database for  this measure is entered as \u201cnot applicable.\u201d Therefore, the measure\u2019s  methodology does not provide insight into how DOD could measure  whether or not it reached its target of 3.5. As a result, we determined that  this measure did not have data collection methods to gather reliable  results. We have previously reported that if errors occur in the collection  of data or the calculation of their results, it may affect conclusions about  the extent to which performance goals have been achieved.", "Objectivity. We estimate that 59 percent of DOD\u2019s performance measures  for its counternarcotics activities are objective. We have previously  reported that to be objective, measures should indicate specifically what is  to be observed, in which population or conditions, and in what time frame,  and be free of opinion and judgment. We estimate that 41 percent of DOD\u2019s  measures are not objective and could therefore face issues of bias or  manipulation. For example, a measure in the database is, \u201cpercent of  inland waterways controlled by Colombian Marine Corps forces.\u201d For this  measure, no criteria for \u201ccontrolled\u201d is provided and it is not clear how the  Colombian government reports the percentage of waterways under its  control and over what time frame this control will occur.", "Clarity. We estimate that 65 percent of DOD\u2019s performance measures  exhibit the attribute of clarity. A measure achieves clarity when it is  clearly stated and the name and definition are consistent with the  methodology used for calculating the measure. However, we estimate that  35 percent of DOD\u2019s measures are not clearly stated. For example, one of  DOD\u2019s measures linked to the objective of sharing information with U.S.  and partner nations is \u201cidentify and establish methodology for  implementation.\u201d For this measure, no associated methodology is  identified, and it is unclear what is being implemented. We have previously  reported that a measure that is not clearly stated can confuse users and  cause managers or other stakeholders to think that performance was  better or worse than it actually was.", "Measurable target. We estimate that 66 percent of DOD\u2019s measures have  measurable targets. Where appropriate, performance goals and measures  should have quantifiable, numerical targets or other measurable values.  Some of DOD\u2019s measures, however, lacked such targets. For example, one  performance measure identified its target as \u201ctargets developed by the  local commander.\u201d As it is not quantifiable, this target does not allow  officials to easily assess whether goals were achieved because  comparisons cannot be made between projected performance and actual  results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Working To Improve Its Counternarcotics Performance Measures, but Implementation Challenges Exist", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials have acknowledged that weaknesses exist in the  department\u2019s current set of counternarcotics performance measures. In  May 2010 DOD issued revised guidance for its counternarcotics  performance measurement system to guide users in establishing  performance measures that more accurately capture the quantitative and  qualitative achievements of DOD\u2019s activities. To do this, the guidance  states that performance measures should be, among other attributes,  useful for management and clearly stated. The guidance describes  different types of performance measures that can be used to monitor  DOD\u2019s contribution to its strategic counternarcotics goals, such as those  that measure DOD\u2019s efficiency, capability, and effectiveness at performing  its activities. Additionally, according to the guidance, DOD components  should provide evidence of the quality and reliability of the data used to  measure performance.", "However, DOD officials noted four specific challenges that the department  faces in developing performance measures consistent with its revised  guidance.", "Creating performance measures that assess program outcomes. Some  DOD officials noted that, because DOD acts as a support agency to partner  nations and other law enforcement entities\u2014and the actual interdiction of  drugs is conducted by other entities\u2014measuring the outcome of DOD\u2019s  performance is difficult. While developing outcome measures can be  challenging, we have found that an agency\u2019s performance measures should  reflect a range of priorities, including outcomes. Moreover, we have found  that methods to measure program outcomes do exist. For example,  agencies have applied a range of strategies to develop outcome measures  for their program, such as developing measures of satisfaction based upon  surveys of customers. In addition, officials from EUCOM, AFRICOM, and  JIATF-S stated that while developing outcome performance measures can  be difficult, developing such measures for support activities is possible  and is done at other federal agencies. For example, EUCOM indicated it  could track the outcome of the support it provides to partner nations by  tracking the annual percentage increase in interdictions and arrests  related to illicit trafficking. Additionally, JIATF-W indicated that it  conducts quarterly command assessments of current programs, which  focus on aligning resources provided by JIATF-W to the outcomes of its  law enforcement partners.", "Implementing revisions in a timely manner. DOD officials noted that  implementing revisions to the department\u2019s performance measures in a  timely fashion will be difficult given that such revisions are resource and  time intensive. Further, while including dates for submission, DOD\u2019s  revised guidance does not clearly specify a time frame by which DOD  components should revise the counternarcotics performance measures  that are to be submitted to the database. We have previously reported that  establishing timetables for the development of performance measures can  create a sense of urgency that assists in the effort being taken more  seriously. DASD-CN> officials noted that time frames by which DOD\u2019s  measures would be revised are being discussed. However, these officials  do not expect new performance measures to be established in fiscal year  2010, and said that fiscal year 2011 would be the earliest year of full  implementation of the guidance.", "Ensuring adequate resources are available. DOD officials noted that  ensuring adequate resources\u2014such as expertise and training in  performance management\u2014are available to develop performance  measures at both DASD-CN> and the combatant commands will be a  challenge. These officials noted that DOD employees tasked with  developing performance measures and tracking the progress towards  achieving goals are not sufficiently trained to design and monitor outcome  performance measures. We have previously reported that access to trained  staff assists agencies in their development of performance measures.", "Ensuring reliable data. DOD officials noted that ensuring data used to  measure DOD performance are reliable is challenging. To measure the  performance of its counternarcotics activities DOD officials told us they  rely heavily on external sources of data, such as U.S. law enforcement  agencies and foreign government officials.

DASD-CN> applies some practices to facilitate the use of its  counternarcotics performance measurement system. For example, DASD- CN> has recently taken steps to demonstrate management  commitment by issuing revised guidance emphasizing the development of  improved performance measures and, according to DASD-CN>  officials, conducting working groups with some DOD components to  assist them in revising performance measures. Moreover, DASD-CN>  officials told us they are taking steps to increase staffing to better oversee  the performance measurement system. We have found that the  commitment of agency managers to result-oriented management is critical  to increased use of performance information for policy and program  decisions. Further, DASD-CN> has created a results framework that  aligns agencywide goals, objectives, and performance measures for its  counternarcotics activities. As we have previously reported, such an  alignment increases the usefulness of the performance information  collected by decision makers at each level, and reinforces the connection  between strategic goals and the day-to-day activities of managers and staff.", "However, DASD-CN> has not applied certain key practices to facilitate  the use of data, such as improving the usefulness of performance  information in its performance measurement system, developing agency  capacity to use performance information, and communicating  performance information frequently and effectively. Furthermore, DOD  officials told us they face challenges using DOD\u2019s performance  measurement system to manage their activities due to (1) the limited  utility of the performance measures and data currently in DOD\u2019s  counternarcotics database, (2) insufficient capacity to collect and use  performance information, and (3) infrequent communication from DASD- CN> regarding performance information submitted to the database.  For instance, DOD\u2019s guidance emphasizes the development of  performance measures that are, among other attributes, useful for  management and supported by credible data. However, DOD officials from  several combatant commands told us that the performance measures and  targets currently in the system are of limited utility and will need to be  revised. Moreover, officials from several DOD components emphasized the  need to build additional capacity to use performance data, such as  receiving training on how to revise performance standards and measures.  We have found that the practice of building analytical capacity to use  performance information\u2014both in terms of staff trained to do analysis and  availability of research and evaluation resources\u2014is critical to an agency  using performance information in a meaningful way. Finally, DOD  components told us that they received little feedback or direction from  DASD-CN> regarding performance information they submitted to the  system. We have previously reported that improving the communication of  performance information among staff and stakeholders can facilitate the  use of performance information in key management activities.

We have previously reported  that performance measurement systems include steps to measure  performance to gauge progress and use the information obtained to make  key management decisions. DOD acknowledges weaknesses in its  performance measurement system and has taken steps to improve the  system, such as revising its guidance for the development of performance  measures and holding working groups with DOD components. However,  its current set of measures lack key attributes of successful performance  measures, such as balance, objectivity, and reliability. Moreover, DOD  infrequently uses the information presently in its counternarcotics  performance measurement system and has yet to fully apply key practices  to facilitate its use. Absent an effective performance measurement system,  DOD lacks critical performance information to use to improve its  management decisions, eliminate wasteful or unproductive efforts, and  conduct oversight of its activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD\u2019s performance measurement system to manage and  oversee its counternarcotics activities, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense take the following two actions: 1.

In response to this mandate, we examined the extent to which  (1) DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance measurement system enables  DOD to track progress and (2) DOD uses performance information from  its counternarcotics performance measurement system to manage its  activities.", "Our work focused on the efforts of DOD to develop an effective  counternarcotics performance measurement system. Within DOD, we  spoke with officials from several relevant components involved in the  management, oversight, and implementation of DOD\u2019s counternarcotics  activities, including the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>), U.S.  Africa Command (AFRICOM), U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S.  European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM),  U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), the Joint Interagency Task Force- South (JIATF-S), the Joint Interagency Task Force-West (JIATF-W), and  the DOD Inspector General (DOD-IG). We also discussed DOD efforts with  officials from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the  organization that establishes U.S. counternarcotics goals and coordinates  the federal budget to combat drugs.", "To examine the extent to which DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance  measurement system enables the department to track its progress we  analyzed DOD strategy, budget, and performance documents, such as  DOD\u2019s Counternarcotics Strategy, Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug  Activities Budget Estimates, and Performance Summary Reports. We  reviewed relevant DOD and ONDCP guidance on performance measures,  such as DOD\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures for the Counternarcotics  Performance Metrics System and ONDCP\u2019s Drug Control Accounting  circular. Further, we evaluated a generalizable random sample of DOD\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 counternarcotics performance measures (115 of 239  measures) to assess the extent to which these measures adhered to GAO  criteria on the key attributes of successful performance measures.  Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  at a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 6 percentage  points). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. To evaluate the  sample, two analysts independently assessed each of the performance  measures against nine attributes of successful performance measures  identified by GAO. Those analysts then met to discuss and resolve any  differences in the results of their analyses. A supervisor then reviewed and  approved the final results of the analysis. In conducting this analysis, we  analyzed information contained in DOD\u2019s counternarcotics performance  measurement system database and spoke with DOD officials responsible  for managing counternarcotics activities and entering information into the  database. We did not, however, review supporting documentation  referenced but not included in the system\u2019s database, nor did we assess  other databases that might exist at the DOD component level. We also  discussed DOD\u2019s performance measures with cognizant officials from  ONDCP and several DOD components, including DASD-CN>,  AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, NORTHCOM, SOUTHCOM, JIATF-S,  JIATF-W, and the DOD-IG.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD uses performance information from  its counternarcotics performance measurement system to support its  mission, we held discussions with officials from DOD components\u2014 including DASD-CN>, AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, NORTHCOM,  SOUTHCOM, JIATF-S, and JIATF-W\u2014to determine the ways in which  these components use information from DOD\u2019s system, as well as other  sources of performance information. We also examined DOD\u2019s  Performance Summary Reports and fiscal year 2011 Drug Interdiction  and Counterdrug Activities Budget Estimates to assess the extent to  which these materials reported that DOD used performance information  from its counternarcotics performance measurement system database.  Further, we analyzed the extent to which DOD applies key management  practices previously identified by GAO to facilitate the use of  performance information from its counternarcotics performance  measurement system. We also traveled to Tampa, Miami, and Key West,  Florida where we visited CENTCOM, SOUTHCOM, and JIATF-S.
