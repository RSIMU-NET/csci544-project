GAO analyzed SBA data (generally covering from 2005-2014), policies, processes, and procedures and interviewed SBA staff, SBIC fund managers, and industry stakeholders, who were selected to represent a mix of SBIC characteristics and based on suggestions by various stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) managed by entities holding multiple licenses controlled most Small Business Administration (SBA) leverage and shared similar characteristics with entities holding a single license. At the end of fiscal year 2014, multiple licensees controlled $5.2 billion of the $7 billion (about 74 percent) in outstanding debenture SBA leverage, compared to 2005, when they controlled 24 percent (see figure, left). SBIC characteristics, including geographic distribution and management demographics, were largely similar for single and multiple licensees.", "Multiple licensees have demonstrated better aggregate investment performance than single licensees, although the investments have similar attributes. For example, from 2005 to 2014, 6 percent of multiple-license debenture SBICs were put into liquidation (typically because of excessive losses), compared with 39 percent of single-license SBICs (see figure, right). Both types of licensees invested in a roughly similar range of industries and geographic areas. Multiple-license SBICs were slightly more likely to invest in smaller enterprises or in low- or moderate-income areas. However, data on minority, women, and veteran ownership of SBIC investments are unreliable, in part because SBA does not provide guidance to SBIC licensees on how to collect and report this information. Providing such guidance would help improve the quality, consistency, and value of these data, which would help inform SBA's strategic priority of providing financial capital for underserved small businesses.", "The SBIC program's financial performance has been relatively stable in recent years, although the degree to which program performance can be attributed to SBA oversight is unclear. For instance, most losses from 2003 to 2014 were incurred from SBICs remaining in the participating securities program (where SBA held an equity interest in SBICs), for which SBA stopped issuing new licenses in 2004 due to losses. The SBIC program's risk management mechanisms include the application and licensing processes, which are largely the same for single and multiple licensees, and requirements for private capital fundraising. SBA monitors SBICs through risk assessments of their financial condition; examinations assessing regulatory compliance; and, as necessary, liquidation to recover financial assets. The effect of SBA oversight on financial performance is difficult to measure, however, because it cannot easily be isolated from other internal and external factors, such as economic conditions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SBA provide guidance to SBIC licensees on how to collect and report data on their investments in minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses.

Under the program, which is operated by SBA\u2019s  Office of Investment and Innovation, SBA does not make direct  investments in small businesses but partners with privately owned and  managed SBICs that provide financing to qualifying small businesses.  This financing consists of private capital that the SBIC has raised and  SBA\u2019s financial assistance through the SBIC program. SBICs are able to  borrow at favorable rates because SBA guarantees the loan obligations  (known as debentures) that SBICs make. When an SBIC is ready to  make an investment, in addition to using private capital, it may draw down  on SBA\u2019s leverage by issuing a debenture with a repayment schedule for  principal and interest. SBICs also may use their leverage and private  capital to pay for operating expenses.", "Entities applying for an SBIC license must raise the needed capital for an  investment fund. The fund develops its own strategy for making  investments in small businesses, offering loans, purchasing equity, or  both. Generally, applicants must raise a minimum of $5 million of private  capital to establish an SBIC. As seen in figure 1, SBA typically provides  $2 of government-guaranteed leverage for every $1 of private capital an  SBIC has raised from private investors. These investors can include  university endowments, insurance companies, banks, high-net-worth  individuals, and pension funds.", "Holders of SBIC licenses may own or operate a single SBIC or multiple  SBICs (sometimes referred to as multiple licenses under common  control). An SBIC can be organized as a corporation, limited partnership,  or limited liability company. Most SBICs are owned by relatively small  groups of local investors, although some are wholly or partially owned by  commercial banks. A few SBICs are corporations with publicly traded  stock. SBICs can invest in small businesses with tangible net worth not in  excess of $19.5 million and with an average of not more than $6.5 million  in net worth after federal tax income over the previous 2 fiscal years at  the time of investment.", "In fiscal year 2014, SBA committed to guarantee $2.55 billion in SBIC  small business investments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014,  increased the annual amount that SBA was authorized to provide to  SBICs from $3 billion to $4 billion. However, according to SBA, the SBIC  program operates on a \u201czero-subsidy\u201d basis at no cost to taxpayers, and  requires no annual appropriations from Congress. To recoup expenses  from any defaults and keep the program at zero subsidy, SBA charges  SBICs various fees. These include a 1 percent fee on the leverage  commitment, a 2 percent fee when drawing against this leverage  commitment, and an annual charge against the outstanding leverage  balance. By statute, the annual charge may not exceed 1.38 percent, and  historically it has never exceeded 1 percent, according to SBA. In  addition, SBA is allowed by statute to charge licensing and examination  fees to recoup administrative costs associated with these activities.  Overall, the SBIC program\u2019s administrative expenses as a share of the  SBA leverage (including commitments) declined from 0.24 percent in  1999 to 0.16 percent in 2013, according to SBA, which noted that the  program has grown in recent years without a corresponding increase in  administrative resources.", "Currently, there are three types of debenture SBIC licenses. The  Standard Debenture License has a broad investment mandate with few  restrictions on an SBIC\u2019s strategy or capital allocation. The Impact  Investment License requires that at least 50 percent of the fund\u2019s invested  capital be deployed into investments that have a social, environmental, or  economic impact. The Early Stage SBIC license is designed to attract  investment fund managers with experience supporting companies in the  earliest stages of growth.", "In addition to the debenture program, the participating securities program,  which started in 1994, helped fund SBICs through the issuance of  preferred equity interests, called participating securities. On October 1,  2004, SBA stopped issuing new commitments because, according to the  agency, the program experienced significant losses due to flaws in the  participating securities instrument that were magnified as investments in  technology startup and early stage small businesses lost much of their  value in the early 2000s. According to SBA, the profit participation and  fees paid for participating securities leverage were no longer sufficient to  cover the projected net losses, and Congress did not appropriate any  additional funds for the program.

An SBIC is considered  capitally impaired when its investment and operating losses relative to its  private capital exceed the maximum allowable capital impairment  percentage. SBA states that capital impairment is the primary factor it  uses to assess whether an SBIC should be liquidated. SBICs that are  capitally impaired can be transferred to liquidation or be allowed to  continue active operation. As seen in figure 7, the number of SBICs in  active operation that were capitally impaired generally declined from 2005  to 2014, and most capitally impaired SBICs were in the participating  securities program.", "SBA staff, SBIC managers, and industry participants with whom we spoke  cited several reasons why multiple licensees performed better, in the  aggregate, than single licensees. First, they said that multiple-license  fund managers generally are more experienced and have experience  operating an SBIC fund. Second, SBA and some industry participants  said that multiple-license SBICs already have demonstrated success  because approval of a subsequent SBIC license is largely based on the  financial performance, operating history, and managerial track record of  the existing SBIC fund. Finally, they said that multiple-license SBICs are  often larger than single-license SBICs, with investments in a greater  number of small businesses. Having more investments reduces exposure  to financial risk if one investment performs poorly. Larger SBICs also may  have greater staff capacity than smaller SBICs, and may be able to  provide more technical assistance to their small businesses. Nonetheless,  SBA staff noted that while these factors may help explain differences in  performance in the aggregate, single licensees and multiple licensees  can both perform successfully. In addition, SBA staff and an industry  participant told us that an SBIC\u2019s age can affect performance\u2014for  example, young SBICs that have just begun developing their businesses  are unlikely to be transferred to liquidation.

As of the end of 2014, participating securities SBICs accounted for  about 77 percent of the ultimate losses for the overall SBIC program,  although they represented 9 percent of outstanding SBIC leverage.  Ultimate losses for these SBICs totaled $3.5 billion, while losses for  debenture SBICs were about $778 million.", "SBA has said that the financial performance of the SBIC program  generally has been comparable with the private equity industry.

Each year,  as part of its budget process, SBA forecasts expected SBIC program  losses and sets fees accordingly to cover the expected losses for  financing approved during that budget year. SBA annually estimates the  program\u2019s subsidy costs as required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of  1990, using historical information and various assumptions about such  things as the fees paid by SBICs, interest income paid on SBIC  financings, recoveries, and default rates.

These reestimates reflect any changes in  actual performance of the SBIC program since the estimates were  prepared, as well as any expected changes in assumptions related to  future performance of the program. From 1994 through 2014, SBA\u2019s  reestimates for the debenture program generally have been favorable\u2014 that is, they showed a lower estimated cost to the government than the  original estimate\u2014while reestimates for the participating securities  program generally have been unfavorable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBIC Program Includes Oversight Processes and Regulatory Requirements Intended to Manage Risk", "paragraphs": ["Several statutory requirements, regulations, and oversight mechanisms  are designed to manage the financial risk presented by the SBIC  program.
