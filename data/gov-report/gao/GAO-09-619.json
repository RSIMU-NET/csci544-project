Council approved the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act made major changes to the governance of the D.C. public school system, giving the Mayor authority over public schools. This report follows a GAO testimony in March 2008 and focuses on the primary reform approaches the District has taken. This report examines the steps the District took to: (1) address student academic achievement; (2) strengthen the quality of teachers and principals; (3) develop long-term plans and involve stakeholders; and (4) improve accountability and performance of the D.C. public schools (DCPS) and the state superintendent's central offices. GAO reviewed documentation on District initiatives, and interviewed District education officials as well as representatives from the teachers' union, community organizations, and research institutions. GAO also conducted visits to four urban school districts with mayoral governance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Early efforts to improve student achievement at DCPS have focused on improving student performance, closing underutilized and reorganizing underperforming schools, and creating and enhancing data systems. During the first 2 years of its reform efforts, DCPS implemented many initiatives to improve overall student performance, such as classroom-based initiatives to improve basic skills of students. In addition, under the No Child Left Behind Act, DCPS restructured 22 schools before the fall of 2008, after the schools failed to meet academic targets for 6 consecutive years. Finally, DCPS and the state superintendent's office are developing new ways to monitor student achievement and school performance. Specifically, a longitudinal database is being developed that is intended to allow DCPS and other key users to access a broad array of data, including student test scores. DCPS is modifying its approach to many of these initiatives such as focusing on effective teaching as opposed to implementing disparate programs. DCPS has focused on improving the quality of its workforce by replacing teachers and principals and by providing professional development, but it has encountered challenges in effectively implementing these changes. After the 2007-2008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. However, because DCPS did not have an effective way to evaluate teacher performance, officials are uncertain if the new staff improved the quality of its workforce. DCPS is currently working on a new teacher evaluation system. In addition, DCPS introduced professional development initiatives for teachers and principals. For example, it began placing teacher coaches at schools to support teachers at their work sites. However, late decisions to hire these teacher coaches led to inconsistent implementation of this initiative during the 2008-2009 school year. The state superintendent's office and DCPS each developed their 5-year strategic plans and involved stakeholders in developing these plans. The state superintendent plan and the DCPS draft strategic plan each contain many elements of effective plans, such as aligning short-term objectives to long-term goals. DCPS has recently increased its efforts to involve stakeholders in various initiatives; however, it has not always involved stakeholders in key decisions and initiatives. DCPS and the state superintendent's office have taken steps to improve accountability and performance. For example, both offices have started implementation of new individual employee performance management systems. However, while DCPS has taken some additional steps to improve accountability, it has not yet linked its employee expectations and performance evaluations to organizational goals to improve central office operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia\u2019s (D.C. or the District) public school system has  had long-standing problems with student academic performance, the  condition of school facilities, and the overall management of the D.C.  school system. For example, test scores have lagged behind those of most  other urban districts in a nationally administered test. Further, the  District\u2019s public schools have fallen well behind the District\u2019s own targets  for demonstrating adequate yearly progress toward meeting the  congressionally mandated goal of having 100 percent of students  proficient in math, reading, and science by 2014, as outlined in the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No  Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA). Some parents have been enrolling their  children in charter schools, and student enrollment in D.C. public schools  (DCPS) has declined from 65,000 in 2000-2001 to 45,200 in 2008-2009, a  decline of about 30 percent. Of the nearly $762 million the District spends  on DCPS, 16 percent comes from federal sources.", "There is an increasing urgency to address these persistent problems. In an  effort to address the lack of academic progress, declining enrollment, and  dilapidated buildings, the Council of the District of Columbia (D.C.  Council) approved the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007  (Reform Act), which made major changes to the operations and  governance of the school district. The act gave the Mayor broad authority  over the District\u2019s public school system, including curricula, operations,  budget, personnel, and school facilities. In doing so, the District joined a  growing number of cities to adopt mayoral governance of public school  systems in an effort to expedite major reforms.", "Because of the District\u2019s past struggles to reform its public school system  and the broad changes in governance, Congress asked GAO to evaluate the  District\u2019s reform efforts. As part of this evaluation, we testified in March  2008 about the status of the reform efforts. In that testimony, GAO  recommended that the Mayor direct the D.C. Department of Education to  develop a long-term district-wide education strategic plan that would  include certain key elements including a mission or vision statement, long- term goals and priorities, and approaches and time frames for assessing  progress and achieving goals. To provide further evaluation of the  District\u2019s primary reform efforts, we addressed the following questions: (1)  What steps has the District taken to address student academic  achievement? (2) What actions has the District taken to strengthen the  quality of teachers and principals? (3) To what extent have the District\u2019s  education offices developed and implemented long-term plans and how  has DCPS used stakeholder input in key initiatives? (4) What steps have  DCPS and the state superintendent\u2019s office taken to improve their  accountability and performance?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed and analyzed relevant documents  and research and interviewed officials from the District\u2019s education  offices, such as DCPS and the Office of the State Superintendent of  Education. For example, we interviewed high-ranking officials such as the  State Superintendent of Education; the Chancellor of DCPS; and  departmental leaders at DCPS, including the Interim Chief Academic  Officer, the Deputy Chancellor for Human Resources and External  Relations, the Chief of Data and Accountability, and the head of the  Transformation Management Office. We also interviewed representatives  of education and research associations, and various organizations based in  the Washington, D.C. community. Across all our objectives, we measured  the progress of ongoing reform efforts against any implementation time  frames established by DCPS or the state superintendent\u2019s office. We based  our evaluation of completed initiatives on relevant recognized standards,  such as those established by GAO in past reports. To understand the steps  that have been taken to address student achievement, we gathered  information about the various academic initiatives DCPS has planned or  implemented, and reviewed and analyzed documentation of how schools  were restructured. We assessed the reliability of the restructuring data for  the 2008-2009 school year by reviewing documentation and interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also  interviewed eight principals from schools that had been consolidated as a  result of the closure of 23 schools prior to the 2008-2009 school year  primarily due to declining enrollments. We reviewed and analyzed  documentation\u2014including state-level contracts and project plans\u2014 regarding efforts to improve data collection, quality, and usage. We did not  independently verify reported improvements to DCPS and state  superintendent\u2019s office data systems. To understand how the District was  strengthening teacher and principal quality, we reviewed documents  regarding teacher and principal recruitment, development, and evaluation,  as well as licensure requirements. We also interviewed officials from the  Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, the American Federation of Teachers, and  the Council of School Officers (principals\u2019 union). To address the question  on strategic planning and stakeholder involvement, we reviewed and  analyzed strategic plans, interviewed cognizant officials from the District\u2019s  education offices, and attended public discussions relevant to strategic  planning, as well as D.C. Council hearings. We also interviewed the  Chairman of the D.C. Council and representatives from several community  and education organizations, including DC VOICE, the Council of the  Great City Schools, and Parents United for the D.C. Public Schools. To  understand the steps that DCPS and the state superintendent\u2019s office have  taken to improve performance and accountability, we reviewed the  alignment of the individual performance management plans to  organizational goals and the results of DCPS\u2019s internal customer  satisfaction survey. To provide a broader national context for our work,  we visited four urban school districts with mayoral governance: Boston,  Chicago, Cleveland, and New York City. We based our selection of these  districts on how long the school district had been under mayoral control  and student demographic information. We interviewed high-level  officials\u2014including superintendents and former superintendents, school  board presidents and members, officials from mayors\u2019 offices\u2014as well as  union leaders, and representatives from various community and research  organizations in these cities. In addition, we asked officials in the District\u2019s  education offices about their planned and actual use of economic stimulus  funds provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  (Recovery Act).", "We performed our work from May 2008 through June 2009 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Historically, DCPS has had several problems that  interfere with the education of its students. One primary problem was the  dysfunction of the central office. For example, textbooks were not  delivered on time or at all, parents complained about the lack of  responsiveness of the central office, and teachers were not always paid on  time. In addition, data systems were obsolete and inundated with errors,  making it difficult to access basic information, such as the number of  students enrolled at a school and student attendance rates. Such problems  persisted in the D.C. public school system for several years despite  numerous efforts to address them. In 1989, a report by the D.C. Committee  on Public Education noted declining achievement levels as students  moved through grades, the poor condition of the school system\u2019s physical  facilities, and the lack of accountability among D.C. agencies for the  schools. Recent reports have continued to cite these problems. In 2004,  the Council of the Great City Schools reviewed the D.C. school system and  cited the continued failure to improve student achievement.", "Efforts to improve the District\u2019s schools often included new leadership to  head the troubled school system. Over the last 20 years, DCPS has  employed more than seven superintendents with an average tenure of 2.9  years. Such frequent changes in leadership may have further complicated  efforts to improve student achievement, as each leader may have brought  a different cadre of initiatives and goals which were not fully developed or  implemented with the constant changes in leadership.

The Reform Act transferred the day-to-day management of  the public schools from the Board of Education to the Mayor and placed  DCPS under the Mayor\u2019s office as a cabinet-level agency. Prior to the  Reform Act, the head of D.C. public schools was selected by and reported  to the Board of Education. The Reform Act also moved the state functions  into a new state superintendent\u2019s office, established a separate facilities  office, and created the D.C.

Further, the District was and continues to be on the U.S.  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) high-risk list for its management  of federal education grants. The Reform Act addressed such issues by  clearly separating the two entities. Along with managing, distributing, and  monitoring the use of federal funds across DCPS and the public charter  schools, the office of the state superintendent has a significant policy  role. For example, the state superintendent\u2019s office works collaboratively  with the State Board of Education to set standards of what students  should learn in all the District\u2019s public schools. In addition, in carrying out  NCLBA, the state superintendent\u2019s office is responsible for the state-wide  assessment, or standardized test, that measures students\u2019 progress in  attaining proficiency and sets annual proficiency targets.

Under NCLBA, states are required to establish performance goals and hold  schools that receive federal funds under Title I of NCLBA accountable for  student performance by determining whether or not they have made  adequate yearly progress (AYP). The failure to make AYP, or meet  academic targets, for 2 or more consecutive years leads to specific actions  that schools must take to improve student academic achievement. These  actions, such as developing a school improvement plan or extending the  school day, are more intensive the longer the school fails to meet  academic targets. After 5 or more consecutive years of failing to meet  academic targets, a school must make plans to restructure its governance  and implement those plans the subsequent year. NCLBA specifies five  options for restructuring schools: reopening as a charter school, replacing  all or most of the school staff relevant to the failure to make AYP,  contracting with another organization to run the school, turning the  operation of the school over to the state, or undertaking another action  that would result in restructuring the school\u2019s governance.", "NCLBA also establishes a federal requirement for teacher quality. It  requires that teachers across the nation be \u201chighly qualified\u201d in every core  subject they teach by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. In general,  NCLBA requires that teachers have a bachelor\u2019s degree, have state  certification, and demonstrate subject area knowledge for every core  subject they teach. States also have flexibility to set the requirements that  teachers need to meet to demonstrate that they are highly qualified. In  March 2008, the state superintendent\u2019s office and the D.C.

Some school districts offer bonuses  for all staff or all teachers at schools who have met certain criteria  (usually including an increase in student achievement). Other school  districts offer differentiated pay to teachers based on characteristics other  than education and years of experience. For example, the Denver Public  School District has implemented a teacher compensation plan that allows  multiple pathways to compensation bonuses. Bonuses can be based on  professional evaluations using a standards-based system, progress toward  objectives as agreed upon by teachers and their principal, and growth in  student achievement on the Colorado Student Assessment Program.

DCPS also introduced Saturday classes primarily targeted to  students in grades 3 through 12 who were on the cusp of meeting  academic targets on standardized tests. It also introduced initiatives  designed to address student motivation and behavior. For example, DCPS  piloted the Capital Gains program with the specific goals of improving  student engagement, and ultimately student learning, by offering financial  incentives to students for attendance, academic performance, and other  positive behaviors.

The Chancellor noted that some  schools may have lacked the capacity to implement so many programs  effectively. In particular, some schools were undergoing significant  organizational changes that may have affected their ability to implement  these new academic initiatives. To support such schools, DCPS is  considering offering a choice of programs for schools and allowing the  principals to determine which programs best suit their schools\u2019 needs and  capacity.", "DCPS does not yet know how successful these programs have been in  improving student achievement. While DCPS students achieved gains on  the 2008 state-wide test, increasing between 8 and 11 percentage points in  math and reading for both elementary and secondary levels, it is unclear  whether these gains can be attributed to the current reform efforts or to  prior efforts.  While DCPS officials told us that it is generally difficult to  isolate and quantify the impact of any single program on student  achievement, they were able to review an analysis of reading scores  conducted by the vendor of one of its early reading programs. The  vendor\u2019s analysis showed that on some tests DCPS students who  participated in the reading program generally scored higher than those  who did not. Further, DCPS officials told us they plan to analyze, in late  summer of 2009, student outcomes, including state-wide test scores, to  assess the effectiveness of various interventions.", "In addition, DCPS officials told us the success of the math and reading  initiatives depended in part on how well teachers implemented them in the  classroom.

This new staffing model was  intended to provide all schools with a core of teachers including art,  music, and physical education, as well as social workers. It also was  intended to provide all schools with reading coaches who work with  teachers to improve reading instruction. Prior to this change, DCPS  allocated funding to schools using a weighted student formula, which  distributed funds to schools on a per pupil basis, so that the greater the  enrollment of a school, the greater the amount allocated to that school.  Principals then chose how to staff the school based on the amount of  funding available, staffing requirements, and their perception of the  school\u2019s needs. Consequently, some schools\u2014especially smaller schools\u2014 did not have the student enrollment to support programs, such as music  and art, and other schools that had the funds to support those programs  opted not to do so. While the new staffing model ensures a core staff at all  schools regardless of enrollment, DCPS allowed principals to request  changes based on their school\u2019s needs. However, DCPS lacked a  transparent process for making changes to the staffing allocation. In  particular, DCPS did not establish or communicate clear guidance or  criteria on how such requests would be treated. Further, DCPS granted or  denied requests for changes to the original staffing allocation on a school- by-school basis, and it is unclear whether similar requests were treated in  a consistent manner. A more transparent process, one that made public  their rationale for decisions, would have helped assure stakeholders,  including the D.C.

DCPS updated facilities at these receiving schools to  accommodate the influx of students from the newly closed schools. In  addition, to assist these students and schools with the transition that this  reorganization created, DCPS offered a more comprehensive version of its  staffing model. In addition to the core staff of the standard staffing model,  DCPS allocated additional staff, such as school psychologists and math  coaches to the receiving schools. During the consolidation effort, DCPS  also created several prekindergarten through grade 8 schools in some  cases where elementary schools were underenrolled.

In addition, DCPS did not renew the contracts of 42  principals, citing their failure to improve student achievement on  standardized tests and to adequately implement school-wide programs.", "To replace the teachers and principals who left the system, DCPS  launched a nationwide recruitment effort for the 2008-2009 school year.  DCPS hired 566 teachers and 46 principals for the 2008-2009 school year.  Of the 566 teachers, 395 were hired from traditional backgrounds or other  school systems and 171 came from nontraditional paths such as the D.C.  Teaching Fellows program and Teach for America.

The Chancellor has stated that she wants to recruit and retain quality  teachers by offering merit pay, which would reward teachers with higher  salaries based, in part, on their students\u2019 scores on standardized state  tests. Under the plan, which has been in negotiation with the Washington  Teachers\u2019 Union since November 2007, teachers could voluntarily  relinquish job protections in exchange for base salaries and bonuses  totaling over $100,000 per school year. This plan relies on over $200  million in contributions from private foundations to fund the teacher  contract, including salary increases and professional development.  According to the Chancellor, private foundations continue to pledge their  support, even with the current economic downturn.

Under this evaluation  system, principals evaluate teachers\u2019 subject matter knowledge, classroom  management skills, and adherence to academic standards, among other  elements. However, this system does not measure teachers\u2019 impact on  student achievement, which, according to DCPS, is a key factor in  evaluating teacher effectiveness.

This value-added measure would only apply to  about 20 percent of the teacher workforce, since not all grades and  subjects are tested. DCPS plans to use a less formal student achievement  measure for teachers in nontested grades and subjects in the short term,  but is working to increase the number of teachers for whom student  achievement growth data are available. In addition, DCPS\u2019s proposed  evaluation system would add classroom observations by third-party  observers, called master teachers, who would be knowledgeable about  teaching the relevant subject matter and grade level, to supplement school  administrators\u2019 observations of teachers.

For the 2008-2009 school year,  DCPS hired about 150 teacher coaches to improve teachers\u2019 skills in  delivering reading and math instruction and boost student test scores.  DCPS officials told us their decision to implement school-based teacher  coaches was based on research demonstrating gains in student  achievement as a result of teacher coaches collaborating with teachers to  improve instruction. For the 2008-2009 school year, teacher coaches  focused on helping new teachers and teachers with students in grades 3  through 10 in reading and math instruction.

As of late January 2009, there were 157 teacher coaches  working on-site in the District\u2019s public schools, with 14 total vacancies.  Each vacancy represents a school without the full support (either a  reading coach or both a reading coach and a math coach) that DCPS  wanted to provide. As a result, the ratio of teachers to coaches was higher  than it would have been had the positions been filled. In addition,  according to DCPS officials and Washington Teachers\u2019 Union officials we  interviewed, teacher coaches were often unclear on their responsibilities  and how to work with teachers, and received some conflicting guidance  from principals. For example, these officials told us that some principals  did not assign teacher coaches to their intended position. At the beginning  of the school year, some principals assigned coaches to cover classes for  absent teachers or to evaluate teachers\u2014a practice not allowed under  union rules\u2014meaning the coaches were not able to work with teachers.", "DCPS is also seeking to improve the quality of principals through the  Principals Academy developed for the 2008-2009 school year.

The short-term objectives are supported by various strategies, objective  measures, and performance targets. For example, one objective under the  goal of having the District\u2019s schools ready to prepare students for success  is to ensure that all students receive rigorous instruction.

For example, several objectives are aimed at improving  teacher quality; however, the plan lacks specific targets for measuring the  expected magnitude of such an improvement. Without such targets, it will  be difficult for the public to evaluate DCPS\u2019s progress toward improving  its teacher workforce. In addition, while the strategic plan discusses  increased performance-based pay for teachers, it does not specify the cost  or explicitly mention the reliance on outside funding streams to achieve  the increases.

DCPS officials  told us they have a variety of approaches to involve stakeholders,  including parents, students, and community groups, as well as institutional  stakeholders such as the D.C. Council. For example, DCPS officials told us  they reach out to parents, students, and the public by holding monthly  community forums, meeting with a group of high school student leaders  and a parent advisory group, responding to e-mail, and conducting annual  parent and student surveys to gauge the school system\u2019s performance.  DCPS introduced monthly community forums in July 2008. These forums  were generally informational sessions on topics chosen by DCPS officials,  and were followed by questions from the audience. In some cases, such as  the three forums focused on the strategic plan, DCPS officials facilitated  discussions to elicit feedback. DCPS officials told us their efforts to  involve students in reform efforts included a student leadership group that  met regarding student concerns, and which was credited by DCPS officials  for changes in the school lunch program as well as substantial changes to  the discipline policy. DCPS also involved other stakeholders, such as  parent organizations and the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union in its process of  changing the discipline policy.

For example, key  stakeholders, including D.C. Council members and parent groups, told us  they were not given the opportunity to provide input to inform DCPS\u2019s  initial proposals regarding school closures and consolidations, although  DCPS did hold numerous meetings after the initial proposal, before  finalizing decisions. Similarly, stakeholders told us DCPS did not include  them in deliberations and decisions about the establishment of  prekindergarten to grade 8 models at some schools. Representatives from  one community organization told us that some parents had concerns about  the structure and academic setting at the prekindergarten to grade 8  schools, but did not have a venue to express those concerns before  decisions about grade configurations were made.", "In addition, DCPS did not seek input from key stakeholders during the  planning and early implementation of the new staffing model that placed  art, music, and physical education teachers at schools and which  fundamentally changed the way funding is allocated throughout DCPS.  DCPS officials told us that they had not planned for the number of changes  that were requested by principals. In particular, they told us that the vast  majority of school principals requested changes to their initial staffing  allocations. Stakeholders did not have a timely opportunity to raise  concerns on the potential risks in implementing the staffing model, such as  the uneven distribution of resources across schools and overspending at  some schools. Stakeholders also said they were not given sufficient time to  review the budget for the 2008-2009 school year or to understand the  changes in the budget made after the school year began. DCPS officials  told us the budget planning process for the 2010-2011 school year involved  stakeholders extensively. In particular, DCPS invited the public to a  preliminary budget meeting and also provided training on the budget  process to some key stakeholders, such as school principals and  community members.", "Lack of stakeholder involvement in such key decisions led stakeholders,  including the D.C. Council and parents groups, to voice concerns that  DCPS was not operating in a transparent manner or obtaining input from  stakeholders with experience relevant to the District\u2019s education system.  Further, these stakeholders have questioned whether the impact of reform  efforts will be compromised because of restricted stakeholder  involvement. Stakeholders from other urban school districts we visited  told us a lack of stakeholder involvement leads to less transparency as key  decisions are made without public knowledge or discourse. In addition,  the lack of stakeholder involvement can result in an erosion of support for  ongoing reform efforts and poor decisions. For example, officials in  Chicago and Boston said public stakeholder involvement was critical to  community support for various initiatives, such as decisions on which  schools to close. Officials and stakeholders in New York cited lack of  stakeholder involvement in decisions that were eventually reversed or  revised.

Further, DCPS has  not yet instituted a system to track how and when such expectations are  set. Instead, individual managers established processes specific to their  office or department and, as a result, DCPS could not ensure that  individual performance expectations were aligned to organizational goals  as outlined in the DCPS 5-year strategic plan or in its annual performance  plans. Without such alignment, employees may not be familiar with the  overall organizational goals and their daily activities may not reflect these  goals. An explicit alignment of daily activities with broader desired results  helps individuals connect their daily activities and organizational goals and  encourages individuals to focus on their roles and responsibilities to help  achieve the broader goals. In addition, as we previously reported, DCPS  developed individual performance evaluations in December 2007 as a part  of its performance management system in order to assess central office  employees\u2019 performance. Such individual performance evaluations are  used to rate central office employees on several core competencies twice  a year. For example, employees are rated on how well they demonstrate a  commitment to providing high-quality and timely customer service to both  external and internal customers of District schools. Prior to our March  2008 testimony, DCPS officials told us that they intended to align the  performance management system with organizational goals by January  2009, and DCPS has taken some steps to improve alignment.

In the past, support for reform efforts has  waned as student achievement did not improve, as buildings deteriorated,  and as new superintendents were ushered in every few years to address  these problems.", "The need for rapid reform and results is acute and the District\u2019s Mayor and  his education team have taken bold steps\u2014such as implementing various  classroom-based initiatives, reorganizing schools, and replacing teachers  and principals\u2014to improve the learning environment of the District\u2019s  students and ultimately increase student achievement. However, DCPS  lacks certain planning processes, such as communicating information to  stakeholders in a timely manner and incorporating stakeholder feedback  at key junctures, which would allow for a more transparent process. In  addition, DCPS did not gauge its internal capacity prior to implementing  certain key initiatives, which, if addressed in the future, could help ensure  the sustainability of initiatives. Without these planning processes, an  organization risks having to revamp initiatives, leading to delays and  compromising the implementation of timely, critical work. While having  these planning processes in place will not eliminate all implementation  issues, it will help to identify and mitigate risks associated with  implementing bold initiatives and identify needed changes in the early  stages of the initiative. Furthermore, a lack of these planning processes  can result in decisions that are made on an ad hoc basis with resources  unevenly distributed as was the case with the District\u2019s new staffing  model. Ultimately, the lack of such processes while planning and  implementing initiatives has impeded the success of some of DCPS\u2019s  initiatives and could impede the District\u2019s continued success and progress  in reforming its school system.", "Stakeholder consultation in planning and implementation efforts can help  create a basic understanding of the competing demands that confront  most agencies and the limited resources available to them. Stakeholders  can then share their expertise and experience, and views on how these  demands and resources can be balanced. Continuing to operate without a  more formal mechanism\u2014other than community forums or e-mails\u2014for  stakeholder involvement could diminish support for the reform efforts,  undermine their sustainability, and ultimately compromise the potential  gains in student achievement. As more initiatives are developed, the need  to balance the expediency of the reform efforts with measures to increase  sustainability, such as stakeholder involvement, is critical.", "In addition, since the Reform Act, the District has taken several steps to  improve central office operations, such as providing more accountability  at the departmental level and implementing a new individual performance  management system. However, DCPS has not taken steps to align its  performance management system, including its individual performance  evaluations, to its organizational goals, which could result in a disparity  between employees\u2019 daily activities and services needed to support  schools. By ensuring that employees are familiar with the organizational  goals and that their daily activities reflect these goals, DCPS could  improve central office accountability and support to schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Mayor of the District of Columbia", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure the transparency, success, and sustainability of the  District\u2019s transformation of its public school system, we recommend that  the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes that include  mechanisms to evaluate its internal capacity and communicate  information to stakeholders and, when appropriate, incorporate their  views.", "To strengthen the new individual performance management system and  ensure greater accountability of central office employees in their role  supporting schools, we recommend that the Mayor direct DCPS to link  individual performance evaluations to the agency\u2019s overall goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DCPS, the Deputy Mayor of  Education, and to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education for  review and comment. These offices provided written comments on a draft  of this report, which are reproduced in appendix I. They also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated when appropriate. All three  entities concurred with our recommendations. However, they expressed  concern with the way in which we evaluated their reform efforts and the  overall tone of the draft report.", "Specifically, District officials stated that we did not measure DCPS\u2019s  progress in terms of the condition of the school system prior to the reform  efforts, but instead measured progress in terms of whether the ultimate  goals of the reform efforts had been met. We disagree. We did not measure  DCPS\u2019s progress against \u201cultimate goals.\u201d As is now reflected in the  paragraph describing our approach to this study, we measured the  progress of ongoing reform efforts by comparing DCPS\u2019s progress to its  own time frames for implementing various initiatives. In conducting our  review, we spoke with numerous DCPS officials and repeatedly asked for  documents and time frames in order to objectively gauge the District\u2019s  progress. In some cases, DCPS officials did not provide us with such  documentation; however, we made a concerted effort to accurately  identify current initiatives and related time frames. In addition, we  measured completed initiatives against recognized standards. For  example, we determined whether or not the DCPS and the state-level  strategic plans contained elements that GAO has identified as key to an  effective plan.", "In addition, we described the conditions that existed prior to the reform  efforts in order to provide context to the steps DCPS has taken. For  example, we noted that prior to the reform efforts, DCPS\u2019s teacher training  was not systematic or aligned with the school district\u2019s goals and that  DCPS is now offering on-site professional development to improve teacher  skills. We also cited the lack of individual performance evaluations for  central office employees prior to the reform efforts that DCPS has made to  improve in this area. Furthermore, we made every effort to provide  balance and objectivity in our findings. For example, some stakeholders,  such as parents groups, union representatives, and the D.C. Council, told  us that DCPS made key decisions without their involvement. We revisited  this issue with DCPS officials and described several of their efforts to  improve stakeholder involvement in the initial draft of our report.", "We visited four urban school districts with mayoral governance and  conducted in-depth interviews to help us better understand the magnitude  of the challenges that officials encountered while trying to reform their  school systems. We also spoke with superintendents and officials from  mayors\u2019 offices in these districts about the key lessons they learned as  they reformed their school systems, including the risks associated with not  having systematic stakeholder involvement.", "Finally, the District\u2019s education offices stated in their response that we  characterized the state superintendent\u2019s efforts as positive and those of  DCPS more negatively. While drafting this report, we intentionally avoided  any comparison between DCPS and the state superintendent\u2019s office, as  their tasks and challenges are dissimilar. After reviewing our draft, DCPS  provided us with more information and documentation regarding efforts to  involve stakeholders in the development of the October 2008 draft of the  DCPS strategic plan and steps taken to introduce alignment of  accountability measures to organizational goals. We made changes to our  report to reflect the updated information.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the D.C.  Mayor\u2019s Office, relevant congressional committees, and other interested  parties. Copies will also be made available upon request.
