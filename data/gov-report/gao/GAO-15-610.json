In response, FAA developed a phased approach to facilitate integration and established test sites among other things.", "GAO was asked to review FAA's progress in integrating UASs. This report addresses (1) the status of FAA's progress toward safe integration of UASs into the national airspace, (2) research and development support from FAA's test sites and other resources, and (3) how other countries have progressed toward UAS integration into their airspace for commercial purposes. GAO reviewed and analyzed FAA's integration- planning documents; interviewed officials from FAA and UAS industry stakeholders; and met with the civil aviation authorities from Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. These countries were selected based on several factors including whether they have regulatory requirements for commercial UASs, operations beyond the view of the pilot, and whether non-military UAS are allowed to operate in the airspace. In comments on this report, the Department of Transportation noted that GAO did not address environmental considerations of UAS integration; such considerations were outside the scope of this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has progressed toward its goal of seamlessly integrating unmanned aerial system (UAS) flights into the national airspace.

However, according to FAA, it is working with MITRE to develop a foundation for an implementation plan; FAA then expects to enact a plan by December 2015. While FAA still approves all UAS operations on a case-by-case basis, in recent years it has increased approvals for UAS operations. Specifically, the total number of approvals for UAS operations has increased each year since 2010, and over the past year has included approvals for commercial UAS operations for the first time. In addition, FAA has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes regulations for small UASs (less than 55 pounds).", "The FAA's six designated test sites have become operational but have had to address various challenges during the process. The designated test sites became operational in 2014, and as of March 2015, over 195 test flights had taken place. These flights provide operations and safety data to FAA in support of UAS integration. In addition, FAA has provided all test sites with a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization allowing small UAS operations below 200 feet anywhere in the United States. However, during the first year of operations, the test sites faced some challenges. Specifically, the test sites sought additional guidance regarding the type of research they should conduct. According to FAA, it cannot direct the test sites, which receive no federal funding, to conduct specific research. However, FAA did provide a list of potential research areas to the test sites to provide some guidance on areas for research. FAA has conducted other UAS research through agreements with MITRE and some universities, and in May 2015 named the location of the UAS Center of Excellence\u2014a partnership among academia, industry, and government conducting additional UAS research. Unlike FAA's agreements with the test sites, many of these arrangements have language specifically addressing the sharing of research and data.", "Around the world, countries have been allowing UAS operations in their airspace for purposes such as agricultural applications and aerial surveying. Unlike in the United States, countries GAO examined\u2014Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom\u2014have well-established UAS regulations. Also, Canada and France currently allow more commercial operations than the United States. While the United States has not finalized UAS regulations, the provisions of FAA's proposed rules are similar to those in the countries GAO examined. However, FAA may not issue a final rule for UASs until late 2016 or early 2017, and rules in some of these countries continue to evolve. Meanwhile, unlike under FAA's proposed rule, Canada has created exemptions for commercial use of small UASs in two categories that allow operations without a government-issued certification, and France and Australia are approving limited beyond line-of-sight operations. Similar to the United States, other countries are facing technology shortfalls, such as the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft and obstacles, as well as unresolved issues involving limited spectrum that limit the progress toward full integration of UASs into the airspace in these countries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1990s, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have operated on  a limited basis in the national airspace system, primarily supporting public  uses, such as military and border-security operations.

At the same time, the safety of the national  airspace is threatened on a nearly daily basis by UASs\u2019 operating without  approval. For example, one UAS nearly collided with a New York Police  Department helicopter over New York City, another came dangerously  close to a US Airways regional jet over the Florida panhandle, and  numerous UASs have been spotted flying over professional and college  football stadiums full of people. The FAA has stated the number of  reported incidents has increased recently, with 97 incidents reported from  February through March 2015, compared to just 3 incidents reported  during the same period in 2014.

Small UASs typically weigh  less than 55 pounds and can be used for a variety of commercial  purposes including photography and package delivery. According to  an industry association, small UASs are expected to comprise the  majority of UASs that will operate in the national airspace system.

For UAS operations within the operator\u2019s line of  sight\u2014for example a real estate agent taking photographs of a  house\u2014the operator relies only on their vision to avoid colliding with  other objects. On the other hand, UAS operations occurring beyond  the line of sight of the operator\u2014for example conducting rail or  pipeline inspections\u2014requires that FAA segregate the airspace or that  the UAS needs instruments to sense other aircraft and obstacles and  avoid those obstacles, as well as, other technologies that will keep the  aircraft safely operating during its mission.", "The FAA plays two major roles in integrating UASs into the national  airspace\u2014a regulator and a service provider. As the regulator, the FAA  seeks to ensure the safety of persons and property in the air and on the  ground in part by requiring that UAS operators and manufactures follow  specific operation and manufacturing standards. As the service provider,  the FAA is responsible for providing safe and efficient air-traffic control  services in the national airspace system and the other portions of global  airspace. In addition to FAA, many federal and private sector entities  have roles in the effort to integrate UAS into the national airspace system.

FAA intends to use this approach to facilitate further incremental steps  toward its goal of seamlessly integrating UAS flight into the national  airspace. Under this approach, FAA\u2019s initial focus during the  accommodation phase will be on safely allowing for the expanded  operation of UASs by selectively accommodating some use and  demonstrating progress by increasing operations throughout the  phase. In the integration phase, FAA plans to develop new  operational rules, standards, and guidance, shifting its emphasis  toward moving beyond case-by-case approval for UAS use, once  technology can support safe operations. Finally, in the evolution  phase, FAA plans to focus on revising its regulations, policy, and  standards based on the changing needs of the airspace. This phased  approach has been supported by stakeholders across both academia  and industry. The 2012 Act requires the Roadmap to be updated  annually, but as of May 2015 FAA has only issued one version of the  Roadmap. FAA intends to update the Roadmap by September 2015  and send it to the Office of Management and Budget for additional  review before it is publicly released.", "While these planning documents provide a broad framework for  integration, FAA is still in process of developing an implementation plan  for integrating UASs.

Whether or  not a UAS is considered a model aircraft or a small UAS depends upon  its operation. For example, if the operator is flying an unmanned aircraft  for recreational purposes the unmanned aircraft is considered a model  aircraft. If the exact same type of unmanned aircraft is being operated for  an authorized purpose such as a search and rescue mission, it is  considered a small UAS. The 2012 Act specifically prohibits FAA from  promulgating rules regarding model aircraft that meet specific criteria,  including model aircraft flown strictly for hobby or recreational use and  operated in a manner that does not interfere with and gives way to any  manned aircraft.

According to FAA, these sites were  chosen based on a number of factors including geography, climate,  airspace use, and a proposed research portfolio that was part of the  application. Under FAA policy, all UAS operations at a test site must be  authorized by FAA through either the use of a COA or an experimental  certificate. In addition, FAA does not provide funding to support the test  sites. Thus, these sites rely upon revenue generated from entities, such  as those in the UAS industry that are using the sites for UAS flights.

FAA and the test sites  have found ways to allow quicker access to the test site airspace and  relieve some administrative burden from FAA.", "In February 2015, FAA awarded the Northern Plains Test Site in North  Dakota four broad area COAs that were aircraft specific. According to  a test site official, these COAs allowed designated aircraft to fly over  nearly the entire state of North Dakota and will make it easier to  accommodate industry for research. Furthermore, these COAs were a  positive step in allowing quicker access to the airspace at test sites.  Reducing FAA\u2019s role in the process creates more certainty regarding  how long it will take an operator to access airspace at the test sites.  Specifically, the test site representative indicated FAA\u2019s role was  reduced because there was a process that allowed aircraft to be  added to these existing COAs that was simpler than applying for  individual COAs.", "In May 2015, FAA approved a \u201cblanket\u201d COA allowing the test sites to  conduct UAS operations at or below 200 feet anywhere in the national  airspace, similar to the authority provided to Section 333 exemptions.  In particular, these COAs will be for small UAS operations, during the  day, within line of sight of the operator, and the operations cannot  occur in restricted airspace and areas close to airports. According to  FAA, this will help improve UAS access allowing more operations in  support of research that can further the UAS integration process.  Previously, all UASs needed their own COA when operating at a test  site but this action by FAA will allow any small UASs to operate at the  test sites within the COA\u2019s requirements.", "The use of designated airworthiness representatives by the test sites  to review and approve experimental certificates may be quicker for  industry and relieve some of FAA\u2019s workload. Industry benefits from  not having to lease its aircraft to the test site, as all test sites are  operated by public entities (academic institutions or federal, state, or  local governments) and thus all aircraft must be public aircraft, unless  they are operating under a special certificate. In addition, any  industry group working with the test site would not have to go through  FAA to receive the experimental certificate. The Nevada test site has  affiliated itself with a designated airworthiness representative, who  has approved an aircraft to operate under an experimental certificate  for the Nevada test site. According to FAA, the use of a designated  airworthiness representative allows it to better leverage its resources.", "FAA officials and some test site officials told us that progress has been  made in part because of FAA\u2019s and test sites\u2019 efforts to work together.  Test site officials meet every 2 weeks with FAA officials to discuss current  issues, challenges, and progress. According to meeting minutes, these  meetings have been used to discuss many issues from training for  designated airworthiness representatives to processing of COAs. In  addition, the six test sites have developed operational and safety  processes that have been reviewed by FAA.

However,  FAA officials told us that the Antideficiency Act may prevent the  agency from directing specific test site activities without providing  compensation. In October 2014, FAA provided a list of potential  research areas to the test sites to guide the research that each test  site may conduct. According to FAA, this document was not to be  construed as a directive but more as guidance for possible research  areas.

However, test site  operators reported that test sites have additional requirements as  opposed to operating outside the test sites, including leasing the  aircraft to the test site to operate under the public COA. While test  sites have signed 22 contracts, there is a chance that some test sites  will not survive due to the financial burden. Some companies have  made a decision to go to other countries to conduct UAS testing  because they believe it takes less time to be approved for test flights.  For example, Amazon has reported it has testing under way in  multiple countries outside the United States, including a site in  Canada. In an effort to attract some industry operators, the Pan  Pacific Test Site has a location in Iceland where, according to the  Director, review and approval for test flights can happen much faster,  in as few as 10 days, relative to over 90 days a COA may take in this  country.

For  example, all these countries except Canada require government-issued  certification documents before UASs can operate commercially.addition, each country requires that UAS operators document how they  ensure safety during flights and their UAS regulations go into significant  detail on subjects such as remote pilot training and licensing  requirements. For example, the United Kingdom has established \u201cnational  qualified entities\u201d that conduct assessments of operators and make  recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority as to whether to approve  that operator. Similar regulations in these countries continue to evolve. In  November 2014, Canada issued new rules creating exemptions for  commercial use of small UASs weighing 4.4 pounds or less and from 4.4  pounds to 55 pounds. UASs in these categories can commercially  operate without a government-issued certification but must still follow  operational restrictions, such as a height restriction and a requirement to  operate within line of sight. Transport Canada officials told us this  arrangement allows them to use scarce resources to regulate situations   In  of relatively high risk. Australia, in similar fashion, is considering relieving  UASs lighter than 4.4 pounds from its requirement to obtain a UAS  Operator\u2019s certificate. France\u2019s regulation describes 4 weight-based  categories of UAS as well as 4 operational scenarios of increasing  complexity. The regulations then discuss which UAS categories can  operate in each scenario. FAA, by electing to focus on UASs up to 55  pounds in its Small UAS NPRM, has taken a similar risk-based approach.", "The United States has not yet finalized regulations specifically addressing  its small UAS operations, but if UASs were to begin flying today in the  national airspace system under the provisions of FAA\u2019s proposed rules,  their operating restrictions would be generally similar to regulations in  these other four countries. However, there would be some differences in  the details. For example, FAA proposes altitude restrictions of below 500  feet, while Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom restrict operations  to similar but slightly lower altitudes. Other proposed regulations require  that FAA certify UAS pilots prior to commencing operations, while Canada  and France do not require pilot certification in certain low risk scenarios.  While FAA continues to finalize the small UAS rule\u2014a process that could  take until late 2016 or early 2017\u2014other countries continue to move  ahead with UAS integration.

For example, according to Australian civil aviation officials, they are  developing a new UAS regulation that would allow operators to request a  certificate allowing beyond-line-of-sight operations. However, use would  be very limited and allowed only on a case-by-case basis. Similarly,  according to a French civil aviation official, France approves on a case- by-case basis, very limited beyond-line-of-sight operations. Finally, in the  United States, there have been beyond-line-of-sight operations in the  Arctic, and NASA, FAA and the UAS industry have successfully  demonstrated detect-and-avoid technology, which is necessary for  beyond line-of-sight operations.", "Like the United States, Australia, Canada, France, and the United  Kingdom distinguish between recreational model aircraft and commercial  UASs and have issued guidelines for safe operation.

At the worldwide level, the International  Civil Aviation Organization is addressing how UAS integration would  affect its existing standards. At the European level, the European UAS  Roadmap contains a strategic research and development plan that  describes anticipated deliverables along with key milestones,  timelines, and resources needed. Separate from the international  organizations, researchers in individual countries are also addressing  these challenges.

Countries around the world  also face challenges in ensuring that UAS purchasers operate them  safely. As UASs become more affordable, and increasingly available  some individuals are conducting unsafe or illegal UAS operations. In  July 2014, Australia\u2019s Parliament reported on testimony, from several  witnesses, that UASs are being flown by operators who unknowingly  break safety rules, thereby posing a safety risk to manned aircraft and  persons on the ground. In response to unsafe operations, a few  countries have placed outright bans on UAS operations. For example,  in India, in response to the surge in interest for commercial and  recreational use, the government placed an outright ban on any UAS  use until its civil aviation agency issues regulations. Similar to the  \u201cKnow Before You Fly\u201d education campaign in this country, other  countries have sought to educate operators. For example, the United  Kingdom has developed and distributed a brochure describing safe  flying practices. In Australia, UAS purchasers receive a similar  document when they purchase the product. Canada has launched a  national safety awareness campaign for UASs, which aims to help  Canadians better understand the risks and responsibilities of flying  UASs.
