DOD included information on major defense acquisition programs and supporting parts provided by each single source of supply. However, DOD did not include implementation plans and timelines for risk mitigation actions or information about the effects of the loss of suppliers, as directed. In addition, complete information about DOD organic facilities was not included. While DOD is not required to update its report, it regularly reports industrial base information to congressional committees. Without complete information about critical suppliers, congressional and DOD decision makers do not know all potential risks and effects associated with the loss of single sources of supply for weapon systems.", "Program offices do not have complete information to fully identify and manage single source of supply risks. First, program officials GAO spoke with were not aware of DOD's 2016 report, and thus did not have information about parts from single-source suppliers that are considered to be most critical, which could provide important focus for managing these risks. Second, program offices often rely on the prime contractor to identify single source of supply risks, among other types of risks, and GAO found that program offices in some instances had limited information to manage those risks because DOD does not have a mechanism to ensure program offices obtain complete information from contractors. Without such a mechanism, program offices may not be aware of risks early enough to take proactive actions to understand and, as appropriate, mitigate those risks. Third, DOD has a program intended to provide information regarding the loss of suppliers and shortages and to proactively manage these risks, called the Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) program, but GAO found that DMSMS implementation varied at selected program offices. DOD is taking steps toward improving DMSMS management, but there is no department-wide policy that clearly defines the requirements for DMSMS implementation at the program office level throughout the acquisition life cycle. Without such a policy there is no clearly defined requirement for program managers to proactively manage DMSMS issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOD provide complete information to decision makers on risk mitigation plans and timeframes, potential effects from losses, and all critical facilities, commercial and organic, regarding risks from single sources of supply; share information on critical risks with program offices; develop a mechanism to ensure program offices obtain complete information; and issue a DMSMS policy.

This supplier network, part of the defense industrial base, includes DOD  organic facilities and many private-sector companies, ranging from some  of the largest public companies to small businesses.  Due to costs,  demand, and other reasons, some parts are provided by a single source  of supply (e.g., one manufacturing facility). If that single source were no  longer able to provide the part, DOD could face a disruption in the  weapon system\u2019s supply chain and, over time, challenges in maintaining  the weapon system at the needed level of availability. For example, a fire  in February 2015 destroyed a factory that was the single source of  propellers for the C-130J aircraft, which provides tactical airlift in support  of military and peacetime missions. The Air Force was able to obtain  propellers from various stocks and the other military services and develop  alternative sources of supply for the propellers, but in the absence of a  successful mitigation effort, a disruption in the supply of propellers could  have caused manufacturing and repair delays.", "Senate Report 114-49, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, directed DOD to provide a  classified report to the congressional defense committees on matters  related to the risks of having a single source of supply for a major defense  acquisition program.  DOD completed its assessment and submitted its  classified report to the congressional defense committees in October  2016. House Report 114-102, accompanying a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, included a provision that  we review aspects of DOD\u2019s management of single sources of supply for  major defense acquisition programs.  In conjunction with this provision,  we were asked to review DOD\u2019s report on single source of supply risks.  This report evaluates the extent to which (1) DOD\u2019s 2016 report on single  source of supply risks addressed the direction in the Senate Report and  (2) DOD\u2019s weapon systems program offices have information for  identifying and managing risks from a single source of supply. This report  specifically focuses on one type of risk that can affect supply chains  within DOD\u2019s industrial base; GAO has ongoing work that will assess a  broader array of risks that can affect the defense industrial base and  associated risk mitigation strategies. That work is planned for completion  in 2018.", "For the first objective, we compared DOD\u2019s October 2016 report against  the four elements directed by Senate Report 114-49. We assessed  whether the information included in DOD\u2019s report addressed, partially  addressed, or did not address each element. Two GAO analysts  independently reviewed DOD\u2019s report and determined the degree to  which each element was addressed. We also reviewed available DOD  information and data on single sources of supply and compared the report  and related information and data to criteria outlined in, Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government such as those that state that  agency management should obtain and use quality information to achieve  the entity\u2019s objectives and should communicate the quality information  internally and externally.  We discussed the report with DOD officials who  have a role in identifying and assessing single source of supply risks in  the defense industrial base.", "For the second objective, we reviewed DOD and military department  guidance related to weapon systems acquisition and program  management, supply chain management, and risk mitigation.  We  interviewed and obtained information from officials at relevant DOD,  military department, and program executive offices.

In addition, program executive officers within the military  departments manage a portfolio of programs (e.g., aircraft, missiles,  combat vehicles, and ships). Once delivered to DOD, weapon systems  are sustained under various arrangements that may include contactors,  DOD organic facilities, or some combination of the two. Materiel support  commands in the military services, as well as the Defense Logistics  Agency, manage inventories of spare parts, and individual weapon  system programs are typically supported by a complex supplier network  that includes a prime contractor, sub-contractors, and various tiers of  parts suppliers.", "Within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Supply Chain Integration describes its mission as  establishing strategic supply chain governance and reporting and  overseeing the integration of global logistics and supply chain  performance.

Also within the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics,  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and  Industrial Base Policy (MIBP) is responsible for various industrial base  matters, including developing DOD policy and providing guidance,  oversight, and technical assistance on assessing or investing in defense  industrial capabilities to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics. MIBP supports the Office of the Secretary of  Defense and Service Acquisition Executives by providing analyses of  defense supply chains and recommendations for taking appropriate  actions to maintain the health, integrity, and technical superiority of those  supply chains.  MIBP reports annually to the Senate and House Armed  Services Committees on DOD\u2019s industrial base assessments, actions  initiated during the previous year to better understand or respond to risks,  and investments planned for certain defense industrial base funding  programs. MIBP\u2019s assessments of the supply base are intended in part  to identify and mitigate weaknesses stemming from fragile suppliers that  are likely to be disrupted or from critical characteristics that make a part  difficult to replace. MIBP typically analyzes supply base issues that jointly  affect more than one DOD component. The military services also conduct  supply base analyses that focus on their own programs.", "DOD recognizes that there are potential risks to its supply chain, including  risks associated with having single sources of supply, and DOD\u2019s policy is  to identify and manage these risks. Specifically, DOD Instruction 4140.01  states that potential disruptions in the DOD supply chain shall be  identified, monitored, and assessed to mitigate risk to supply chain  operations. The instruction further indicates that supply chain risk  management strategies shall be employed to address potential supply  chain disruptions. Some examples of supply chain disruptions are  unreliable suppliers, flooding, terrorism, labor strikes, and natural  disasters.  While DOD has multiple sources of supply for some parts, it  relies on a single source for many others. There are a number of reasons  for using single sources of supply. For example, demand for parts may  not be high enough to justify the cost of maintaining more than one  production line, and limitations on DOD\u2019s access to technical data may  also inhibit its ability to develop multiple sources of supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Critical Asset Identification Process", "paragraphs": ["DOD has established a process for analyzing defense infrastructure  called the Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP).

While DOD officials said  such instances do not occur frequently, and they took steps to  successfully resolve the issue, they stated that advance warning of risks  can result in less costly and more efficient mitigation of those risks.", "During our interviews at the selected program offices, numerous officials  stated that they expect the prime contractor for their program to identify  risks related to a single source of supply and to bring that information to  the attention of the program office. However, they acknowledged that they  do not have a way to ensure this information-sharing and that they are not  fully aware of risks that exist in the sub-tiers of contracts. In contrast,  officials from two programs, both of which manage older systems that  have long been in the sustainment phase of their life cycle, told us they  did not rely on contractors for information on supply risks. Officials from  one of these program offices stated that while a contractor can be an  important partner, the government should not rely on a contractor to  understand and manage risks to the federal government. Also, these  officials stated that independent analysis is critical to appropriately  manage risk. For example, an official from an Army program stated that  detailed analysis performed by the Army found that certain targeted  investments in critical parts, such as infrared technologies and  transmissions, would ensure continued availability of the system and  preserve the health of certain single sources of supply. The Army official  stated that this kind of detailed analysis allows program offices to have  the same or better information than the contractors and thus results in  more informed decision making and negotiations with suppliers and more  effective use of resources.", "DOD has efforts under way to obtain better information from contractors  on obsolescence risks but not for other types of related risks, such as  those stemming from a single source of supply. For example, DOD  officials said that the department and military services determined that  contract language requiring certain contractors to notify program offices of  certain obsolescence risks associated with electronic parts would benefit  program offices\u2019 ability to manage risks proactively, and they are pursuing  this type of requirement through proposed changes to the Defense  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.  However, DOD has not  developed a mechanism to ensure the timely and comprehensive sharing  of information on single-source risks from contractors to program offices.  DOD officials stated that while departmental guidance directs program  offices to obtain information about risks, this guidance could be improved  with a mechanism to ensure that program offices can obtain information  from contractors. High-quality and comprehensive information is the  foundation for proper management and decision making at any program or agency. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that agency management should obtain relevant data from both  internal and external sources in a timely manner and that these data  should be reliable and free from error and bias.  Timely and  comprehensive information from contractors about single source of  supply risks would help program offices be aware of risks early enough to  take proactive steps to understand and, where necessary, mitigate those  risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Program Offices Varied in Implementing Efforts Aimed at Managing Loss of Suppliers and Parts Shortages", "paragraphs": ["DOD has a program intended to provide information regarding the loss of  suppliers and parts shortages and to proactively manage these risks, but  program offices we met with varied in their implementation of this  program. DOD\u2019s Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material  Shortages (DMSMS) program is intended to predict and respond to the  loss, or impending loss, of manufacturers or suppliers of items, raw  materials, or software. In its DMSMS guidebook, DOD describes DMSMS  management as a process to identify issues, assess the potential for  negative effects, analyze potential mitigation strategies, and implement  the most cost-effective strategy.  The guidebook provides best practices  on how to conduct robust management of supply chain risks connected  with DMSMS, which include the loss of suppliers and single source of  supply risks. Proactive DMSMS management can mitigate risks, avoid  costs, and prevent schedule delays resulting from the loss of a single  source of supply.", "DOD has reported cost savings from proactive DMSMS management. For  example, by integrating DMSMS management into the design and build  process, the Virginia-class submarine program resolved over 1,200  obsolescence issues and avoided over $150 million in costs, according to  DOD. Similarly, DOD reported that when the manufacturer indicated that  an expensive system upgrade was required for the B-1 bomber due to an  impending obsolescence issue, the program office used its DMSMS  monitoring to determine that only minimal concerns existed and alternate  parts were readily available. In this case, DOD estimated a cost  avoidance of more than $300 million over 10 years.  Further, according  to an official leading implementation of DMSMS across the department,  when DMSMS is managed properly, there is typically more access to the  data and information, which can speed other solutions. A Navy program  official stated that, due to obsolete technologies identified through its  DMSMS management, the program is switching to a new type of  processor chip. The program was able to purchase enough of the current  type of chip to maintain its systems until the supplier completed the  lengthy redesign and requalification process for the new chip. If the  program had not been aware of the obsolescence issue, the official  stated, the program office would have had to pursue a costly solution.", "Although DOD has reported positive results from DMSMS, we found  through our interviews with officials at the nine program offices in our  sample that their implementation of DMSMS practices varied. Six  program offices had some type of DMSMS management strategy, and  three did not. Of the six program offices that had some type of strategy,  two offices relied primarily on their prime contractor to identify and  manage supply chain risks, including DMSMS concerns; two offices  retained DMSMS management within their program offices; and two used  a combination of program office and contractor management. Of the three  offices that did not have DMSMS management strategies, two were  participating in a pilot for DMSMS management through an Army  command-level program, and one was in the process of establishing but  had not yet implemented DMSMS management. Officials from one of the  offices participating in the Army pilot stated that next steps would be  determined after the completion of evaluations of various methods for  managing risks, including the pilot program.", "In June 2017, a DOD official involved in leading DMSMS efforts estimated  that between 50 and 75 percent of DOD program offices have effective  DMSMS management and that most of the programs that do not have  strong DMSMS management either rely heavily on contractors for  information about risks to their programs or are very small programs.  DOD reported in its most recent annual report to congressional  committees on defense industrial base capabilities that DMSMS issues  continue to be a concern for the department.  For example, DOD  reported that 98 percent of suppliers within the missile and munitions  sector are single sources of supply, it is not possible to find replacements  for parts if a supplier stops production, and requalification for new parts or  materials can be very costly, especially for larger missile systems.  Additionally, the report states that most programs do not plan or budget  for obsolescence, and the department and industry do not have a  coordinated mitigation approach for this issue. Further, different programs  and companies operate independently, which leads to the services paying  to solve the same issue multiple times, and a more coordinated approach  would be more efficient and less costly to the department.", "A key factor contributing to the variance in implementation of DMSMS is  that DOD guidance regarding DMSMS management contains limited  detail regarding actions required at the level of a weapon system\u2019s  program office. DOD\u2019s DMSMS guidebook details strategies and best  practices for effective DMSMS management, including that a program  manager or product support manager should establish a DMSMS  management team and that the program manager should develop and  adopt a plan to carry out the DMSMS management strategy. However,  higher-level DOD guidance containing requirements and procedures for  DMSMS management across the department, such as the DOD manual  regarding supply chain material management procedures, does not  clearly detail requirements to be followed by program managers to  implement DMSMS at the weapon system program level. Military  department-level guidance varies. The Navy instruction on acquisition  requires that program managers establish a DMSMS program to  proactively identify, resolve, and eliminate any negative effects from  DMSMS throughout all phases of a program\u2019s life cycle and requires the  development of a DMSMS plan for certain programs.  The Air Force  instruction on life-cycle management of weapon systems\u2019 programs also  details some responsibilities of its program managers to consider and  support DMSMS management.  Further, the Air Force has a command- level instruction regarding implementation of DMSMS, but it does not  require a DMSMS plan during weapon system development or clearly  describe the responsibilities at the program office level.  This guidance is  currently under revision and an Air Force official stated that DMSMS  requirements would be strengthened. The Army\u2019s industrial base process  regulation requires that program managers consider DMSMS throughout  the acquisition life cycle, including during design, redesign, and  production, but direction specific to DMSMS planning largely focuses on  post-production support planning activities.  Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states policy should be used to define  the responsibilities that should be assigned to best achieve objectives  and implement control activities.", "DOD officials are considering the need for improved DMSMS policies as  part of their efforts to improve the DMSMS program and their efforts to  address the associated risks. The improvement efforts are being led by  the Defense Standardization Program Office and a department-wide  DMSMS working group. The working group is pursuing 10 objectives,  based on 23 DMSMS program gaps it has identified. Among these  objectives is an effort to focus on improving DMSMS policies.  A DOD  official leading DMSMS efforts stated in June 2017 that the working group  is discussing changes to future versions of existing high-level DOD  acquisition and supply chain policy that would provide more focus on  obsolescence, a type of DMSMS issue. However, the official stated that  none of these changes represent a specific, stand-alone policy that  requires DMSMS implementation and management throughout a weapon  system\u2019s acquisition life cycle. For example, DOD\u2019s supply chain  management manual indicates that the military departments and DLA are  to proactively take timely and effective actions to manage DMSMS issues  and to proactively consider DMSMS through a system\u2019s life cycle. It also  directs the military departments and DLA to designate a focal point to  plan and coordinate actions, such as assessing DMSMS effects on new  DOD weapon systems, including during design, redesign, or production.   However, DOD officials stated that this guidance is used primarily by  inventory managers during the sustainment phase of the acquisition life  cycle\u2014as opposed to program managers during the earlier stages of  acquisition\u2014and noted the utility of adding DMSMS procedures and  requirements to other guidance documents used more directly by  program managers, such as DOD Instruction 5000.02. Moreover, various  members of the working group have acknowledged the need for  department-wide policy to clarify DOD\u2019s DMSMS strategy by defining  roles and responsibilities and procedures to follow as part of DMSMS  management at the program office level. The official leading DMSMS  stated that a DMSMS policy could require a service-specific, dedicated  lead for DMSMS, the development of a DMSMS plan for each program  office throughout the acquisition life cycle, and the use of consistent  metrics for monitoring the program.", "While efforts are under way within DOD to improve DMSMS  management, in the absence of a DMSMS policy\u2014such as an instruction  that clearly defines the requirements for DMSMS management at the  individual program office level and details the responsibilities and  procedures to be followed to implement that policy\u2014DOD will continue to  have inconsistent implementation of DMSMS management across  program offices. Further, program offices may not have complete  information to proactively identify and manage diminished manufacturing  sources and material shortages, including those stemming from single  source of supply risks, in order to reduce costs and prevent shortages."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD relies on many single sources of supply to provide needed parts for  its weapon systems and has reported to congressional committees on  facilities that represent risks associated with single sources of supply. In  the case of the 33 TCAs listed in the October 2016 report, these are  considered critical risks. DOD\u2019s report contains important information for  congressional and DOD decision makers. However, DOD\u2019s report did not  identify risk mitigation actions with associated implementation plans and  time lines for the assets listed in its report, including the relatively small  number of TCAs. In addition, DOD\u2019s report did not identify the severity of  operational impacts that could result from the loss of single source  suppliers or include available information on the effects of such a loss on  defense capabilities. Further, the report was limited to commercial TCAs  and did not include DOD organic facilities. Without more complete  information, such as the risks to and effects from potential losses of  commercial and organic single sources, congressional and DOD decision  makers do not have a full understanding of potential risks associated with  the loss of facilities that are single sources of supply for weapon systems.  Further, if DOD does not ensure that risk-mitigation actions have been  considered for the most critical single sources of supply, it cannot assure  that plans are in place to prevent costly delays or parts shortages that  could affect mission readiness.", "Program managers may not have complete information on single source  of supply risks within the supply chain that are associated with their  weapon systems programs.

Second, program offices often rely  heavily on the prime contractor to identify single source of supply risks,  but DOD does not have a mechanism to ensure that program offices  obtain information on risks from contractors. Third, the DMSMS program  is intended to provide information regarding the loss of suppliers and  parts shortages and to proactively manage these risks, but program  offices varied in their implementation of this program due to the lack of a  department-wide policy, such as an instruction, that clearly defines  requirements or procedures for DMSMS management by program offices.
