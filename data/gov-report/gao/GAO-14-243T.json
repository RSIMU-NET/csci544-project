This testimony draws from GAO's September 2013 report on the use and accountability of these funds to review (1) the FSM's and RMI's use of compact funds in the education and health sectors; (2) the extent to which the FSM and RMI have made progress toward stated goals in education and health; and (3) the extent to which oversight activities by the FSM, RMI, and U.S. governments ensure accountability for compact funding. Like the report, this testimony also provides information on infrastructure spending in the education and health sectors. GAO reviewed relevant documents and data, including single audit reports; interviewed officials from Interior, other U.S. agencies, and the FSM and RMI; assessed data reliability for subsets of both countries' education and health indicators; and visited compact-funded education and health facilities in both countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) spent at least half their compact sector funds in the education and health sectors. Because both countries spent significant amounts of compact funds on personnel in those sectors, the U.S.-FSM and U.S.-RMI joint management and accountability committees capped budgets for personnel in those sectors at fiscal year 2011 levels due to concerns about the sustainability of sector budgets as compact funding continues to decline through fiscal year 2023. As required by the committees, the FSM states completed plans to address annual decreases in compact funding; however, as of August 2013, the FSM National Government and the RMI had not submitted plans to address the annual decreases. Without such plans, the countries may not be able to sustain essential services in the education and health sectors.", "Data reliability issues hindered GAO's assessment of each country's progress in the education and health sectors for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Although both countries tracked annual indicators in these sectors during this period, GAO determined that many of these data were not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of measuring progress for the compacts as a whole over the time frame. In education, GAO found 3 of 14 indicators in the subsets of indicators it reviewed for both countries to be sufficiently reliable. GAO found a variety of education data reliability problems; for example, the four FSM states did not use common definitions for some indicators, resulting in inconsistent data for those indicators, and in the RMI some indicators lacked data from the outer islands. In the health sector, GAO determined that data for all 5 of the subset of indicators it reviewed in the FSM were not sufficiently reliable, and in the RMI, 1 health indicator was sufficiently reliable, 2 were not sufficiently reliable, and for 2 others, GAO had no basis to judge due to insufficient information. The joint management and accountability committees have raised concerns about the reliability of FSM's education and health data and RMI's health data and required each country to obtain an independent assessment and verification of these data; both countries have yet to meet that requirement. Without reliable data, the countries cannot assess progress toward their goals in the education and health sectors.", "The single audit reports GAO reviewed indicated challenges to ensuring accountability of U.S. funds in the FSM and RMI. For example, the governments' single audits showed repeat findings and persistent problems in noncompliance with U.S. program requirements, such as accounting for equipment. The Department of the Interior (Interior) has taken steps regarding accountability of compact funds, such as establishing a financial control commission in one FSM state, but Interior has not coordinated with other U.S. agencies about the risk status of the FSM and RMI and whether to designate either country as a high-risk grantee. Furthermore, the FSM, RMI, and U.S. offices responsible for compact administration faced limitations hindering their ability to conduct compact oversight. For example, Interior's Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) experienced a staffing shortage that disproportionately affected compact grant oversight compared to other OIA activities, leaving 6 of 11 planned positions for compact oversight unfilled as of 2012 and 5 of 11 still unfilled as of 2013."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations.

The amended  compacts, approved by Congress in 2003, provide for a combined total of  $3.6 billion in U.S. grant funds for the FSM and RMI during fiscal years  2004 through 2023. The purpose of the funds is to assist the FSM and  RMI governments in their efforts to promote the economic self-sufficiency  and budgetary self-reliance of their people. The amended compacts  provide sector grants, and associated fiscal procedures agreements  require that grant funding support the countries in six core sectors\u2014 education, health, infrastructure, environment, private sector  development, and public sector capacity building, with the education and  health sectors having the greatest priority.", "My remarks today are based on our September 2013 report, which was  issued at about the midpoint of the amended compacts\u2019 20-year grant  period.

In  reporting on these objectives, our time frame was generally fiscal years  2007 through 2011, and we also included information on both countries\u2019  infrastructure projects during that period. To perform this work, we  reviewed FSM and RMI single audits and subsets of FSM and RMI  performance indicators for the education and health sectors.

The FSM is a federation of four states and has a  population of approximately 103,000 (as of 2010) scattered over many  small islands and atolls. The RMI comprises 29 constituent atolls and five  islands with a population of approximately 53,000 as of 2011. U.S.  relations with the FSM and the RMI began during World War II when the  United States ended Japanese occupation of the region. Beginning in  1947, the United States administered the region under a United Nations  trusteeship. The four states of the FSM voted in a 1978 referendum to  become an independent nation, while the RMI established its  constitutional government and declared itself a republic in 1979. Under  the trusteeship agreement, both newly formed nations remained subject  to the authority of the United States until 1986. The United States, the  FSM, and the RMI entered into the original Compact of Free Association  in 1986, and from 1987 through 2003 the FSM and the RMI are estimated  to have received about $2.1 billion in compact financial assistance.", "In 2003, the United States approved separate amended compacts with  the FSM and the RMI that went into effect on June 25, 2004, and May 1,  2004, respectively. The amended compacts provide for direct financial  assistance to the FSM and the RMI from 2004 to 2023, decreasing in  most years. The amounts of the annual decrements are to be deposited  in trust funds established for the FSM and the RMI; the annual decrement  in grant funding is intended to steadily increase the trust funds so that  earnings from the trust can provide a source of annual revenue after the  GAO-13-675). In  grants end in 2023 (see fig. 2 on page 8 of the report,  addition to receiving compact sector grants, the FSM and the RMI are  eligible for a supplemental education grant each year. Separate from the  funding authorized and appropriated under the amended compacts\u2019  enabling legislation, the countries also receive other grants and other  assistance from U.S. agencies.", "The legislation and fiscal procedures agreements for the amended  compacts established oversight mechanisms and responsibilities for the  FSM, RMI, and the United States. To strengthen the management and  accountability and promote the effective use of compact funding, JEMCO  and JEMFAC were jointly established by the United States and,  respectively, the FSM and the RMI. Each five-member committee  comprises three representatives from the United States government and  two representatives from the corresponding country. JEMCO\u2019s and  JEMFAC\u2019s designated roles and responsibilities include the following:  reviewing the budget and development plans from each of the  governments; approving grant allocations and performance objectives; attaching terms and conditions to any or all annual grant awards to  improve program performance and fiscal accountability; evaluating progress, management problems, and any shifts in  priorities in each sector; and reviewing audits called for in the compacts.", "The three countries are required to provide the necessary staff support to  their representatives on JEMCO and JEMFAC to enable the parties to  monitor closely the use of assistance under the compacts. Each country  has established an agency dedicated to providing compact oversight and  ensuring compliance with regulations in the amended compacts, grant  award terms and conditions, and JEMCO and JEMFAC resolutions.

Compact funds in  the RMI also supported a significant portion of government expenditures  in the education and health sectors. Education sector compact funds,  supplemental education grants, and Ebeye special needs education  funds constituted about 62 percent of the RMI\u2019s total education  expenditures in fiscal year 2011, while health sector compact funds and  Ebeye special needs health funds accounted for about 33 percent of the  RMI\u2019s total health expenditures.", "We only reported specific expenditures for the FSM for fiscal years 2009 through 2011  because specific expenditure data for the FSM National Government and Chuuk were not  presented in their single audits for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. the health sector compact funds for personnel.

JEMCO and JEMFAC resolutions in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 required  the FSM National Government and state governments and the RMI  government to complete plans that would address the annual decrements  in compact funding and identify new revenue sources to replace compact  grant assistance in 2023. By the March 2013 JEMCO and JEMFAC  midyear meetings, the four FSM states had completed plans to address  the annual decrements in compact sector funding through 2023; however,  the FSM National Government and RMI government had not completed  their plans. Also, in fiscal year 2013, U.S. members of the JEMCO and  JEMFAC announced that the United States would consider withholding  certain fiscal year 2014 compact sector grant funds until the FSM  National Government and RMI submitted their plans for addressing the  annual decrements. Without such plans, the countries may not be able to  sustain essential services in the education and health sectors.", "At the annual JEMCO and JEMFAC meetings in August 2013, the  committees withheld annual sector funds from the FSM National  Government and RMI government because they failed to provide the  required plans to address the annual decrements. In September 2013,  however, JEMCO allocated sector grant funds to the four FSM states,  which provided the required plans, but continued withholding funds from  the FSM National Government because it failed to meet the requirements  of the JEMCO resolution requiring the plan. In October 2013, JEMFAC  provided sector grant funds to the RMI with the stipulation that no sector  funds would be approved in fiscal year 2015 unless the RMI fulfilled the  terms of the JEMFAC resolution requiring a decrement plan. In  November 2013, the FSM National Government provided OIA with a plan  detailing the National Government\u2019s long-term fiscal framework, which  includes a burden-sharing commitment to the four FSM states to help  address the decrement. Among the actions the National Government has  taken to address the decrement is a new law modifying the annual  compact distribution formula, reducing its share of compact sector grants  from 10 percent to 5 percent; the goal in providing an additional 5  percent in compact grant funds to the states is to ensure that priority  education and health service needs are not compromised as the annual  compact allocations decrease. The U.S. members of JEMCO have yet to  determine whether the long-term fiscal framework plan from the FSM  National Government meets the decrement plan requirements.", "Reported FSM and RMI infrastructure spending. In the FSM, in fiscal  years 2004 through 2013, approximately $229 million in compact funds  were allocated to infrastructure, and of that about $106 million has been  expended, according to OIA. Delays in establishing JEMCO-approved  priorities and unresolved land titling issues affected the construction and  maintenance of some health and education facilities in the FSM. During  fiscal years 2007 through 2012, the FSM completed 6 education-related  projects on a JEMCO-approved list of 19 priority projects, and other  projects are under way. From 2004 through 2013, approximately $106  million in compact funds were allocated to infrastructure in the RMI, and  the RMI expended about $95 million dollars on infrastructure projects,  including infrastructure maintenance, according to OIA.

For example, we found that the four FSM states did not use  common definitions for some indicators; consequently, the education  indicator reports we reviewed did not contain consistent data for these  indicators and comparisons could not be made across states. In the RMI,  we determined that data for three of the subset of five education  indicators we reviewed could not be used to assess education sector  progress for the compact as a whole because of issues such as lack of  data from the country\u2019s outer islands, inconsistencies in reported data for  some years, and revisions to data with no explanation.", "For all five of the subset of FSM health indicators we reviewed, we  determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable to assess progress  for the compacts as a whole.

In the RMI, of the subset of five health  indicators we reviewed, we determined one was sufficiently reliable and  two were not sufficiently reliable to assess progress because of various  issues with data collection and reporting. For example, we determined  that data for immunization coverage for 2-year-olds and the child mortality  rate were not sufficiently reliable due to the timeliness and accuracy of  reporting and low coverage rates for data from the outer islands. For the  remaining two FSM health indicators we examined, we had no basis to  judge the reliability of the data.", "In much of their reporting on their education and health indicators, the  FSM and RMI have noted data reliability problems and some actions they  have taken to address them.

Although OIA has a lead role  regarding audit matters, it has not formally coordinated with other U.S.  agencies to address audit findings, nor has it assessed whether its own  noncompact grants should be classified as high risk.

According to RMI officials, staff constraints in the  Office of Compact Implementation limit its ability to conduct oversight and  enforce compact requirements across multiple sectors and operations in  numerous atolls. Additionally, this office told us they are hampered by  their lack of authority to require that the RMI ministries implementing  projects funded by sector grants comply with compact requirements.
