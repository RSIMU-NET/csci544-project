USDA tracks the number of participants in direct education, such as classes and counseling, as well as other measures of program reach. For example, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed), one of USDA's largest nutrition education programs, served 3.8 million participants through direct education in fiscal year 2018. USDA also collects nationwide expenditure data for all of its nutrition education programs, which totaled nearly $907 million in fiscal year 2017\u2014the most recent year with complete data available. In addition, USDA collects some information on the effectiveness of most of its nutrition education programs; yet information USDA collects from states on SNAP-Ed effectiveness cannot be easily aggregated or reviewed. States provide this information in narrative reports, which hinders USDA's ability to assess the effectiveness of interventions used across the country and determine whether SNAP-Ed is achieving its goals.", "USDA does not have a formal coordination mechanism for its nutrition education efforts and does not fully leverage the department's nutrition expertise. According to USDA officials, coordinating nutrition education efforts has not been a priority in recent years, and the department does not have a dedicated individual or entity with leadership responsibility for nutrition education. This has resulted in limited coordination across USDA's nutrition education programs, including programs with similar target populations. GAO previously reported that effective coordination can help reduce overlap and duplication. In its absence, USDA's nutrition education programs are missing opportunities to share information and avoid duplicating efforts. Further, some USDA nutrition experts are not located in agencies or offices overseeing the nutrition education programs, and possibly because of this, program staff consult these experts on a limited basis, if at all. Failing to leverage its internal expertise hinders USDA's development of nutrition education materials that are informed by the latest nutrition guidance and research and may reduce the effectiveness of these efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to USDA, including that USDA improve how it gathers information on SNAP-Ed effectiveness, develop a formal mechanism for coordinating nutrition education across the department, and take steps to fully leverage the department's nutrition expertise for its nutrition education efforts.

Poor  nutrition contributes to costly chronic health conditions, including heart  disease and some cancers, and in 2017, these two conditions were the  leading causes of death in the United States, according to the CDC. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees nutrition assistance  programs and funds and administers a variety of nutrition education  efforts, which aim to educate Americans on nutrition and improve their  dietary choices. For example, USDA provided about $433 million in  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) federal  grants to states in fiscal year 2019 to improve the likelihood that those  eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will  make healthy food and physical activity choices.

At that time, we recommended that USDA develop a  unifying strategy to improve coordination efforts and strengthen the  linkages among these efforts. Although USDA previously took steps to  respond to our recommendation, recently there has been interest in the  level of coordination among USDA\u2019s nutrition education programs.  Specifically, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill), which  was signed into law on December 20, 2018, requires USDA to submit an  annual report to Congress that includes an evaluation of the level of  coordination between USDA\u2019s nutrition education programs.

Within states, SNAP-Ed implementing entities can select from 51  indicators and various outcome measures in the Framework to evaluate  their interventions. Although USDA has identified 7 of the Framework\u2019s 51  indicators as priority indicators, and encouraged states to use these,  each indicator has multiple outcome measures and data collection  methods associated with it (see text box). Therefore, even if the same  indicators are selected to evaluate the effectiveness of different SNAP-Ed  interventions, each state may select different outcome measures and  data collection methods, and report different information on  effectiveness. In our prior work, we found that agencies that seek to  manage an excessive number of performance measures may risk  creating a confusing excess of data that will obscure rather than clarify  performance issues.", "Elements of a Selected Medium Term Change Indicator: Healthy Eating  The medium term change indicator for healthy eating acts as a priority indicator among  the 51 indicators included in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education  (SNAP-Ed) Evaluation Framework.

Although states  report information on SNAP-Ed interventions to USDA in a data system,  including information on participation, demographic characteristics of  direct education participants, and types of education interventions, the  data system is not structured to allow states to report information on  intervention effectiveness, including cost effectiveness. Instead, USDA  uses SNAP-Ed state plans and annual reports to collect information on  state efforts to evaluate program effectiveness, among other things.  However, in their plans and reports, states identify the Framework  indicators they use and describe their evaluation efforts and outcomes in  narrative form, limiting USDA\u2019s ability to aggregate evaluation information  across states or interventions, according to USDA officials. One local  SNAP-Ed official said her state\u2019s most recent annual report was  approximately 60 pages long, highlighting the magnitude of the narrative  information some states provide.

Further,  USDA officials said they are currently in the process of determining future  SNAP-Ed reporting protocols to improve program implementation and  impact. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use  relevant, quality information from reliable sources to inform decision- making and evaluate performance in achieving key objectives.

Consistent with this focus, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm  Bill) requires USDA to submit an annual report to Congress that includes  an evaluation of the level of coordination between SNAP-Ed, EFNEP, and  other USDA nutrition education programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Not Fully Leveraged Its Expertise for Nutrition Education", "paragraphs": ["Some USDA nutrition experts are in agencies disconnected from the  nutrition education programs (see fig. 4), yet these agencies play a  significant role in developing and compiling dietary guidance, research,  and other information related to nutrition education (see table 2).", "Despite their role in developing and compiling research and information  related to nutrition education, consultation with these experts by the  program offices is limited, according to USDA officials, possibly because  they are located in separate agencies. For example,", "Although CNPP leads a cross-cutting committee that reviews nutrition  education materials developed by USDA program staff to ensure  materials are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,CNPP officials noted they have been infrequently consulted by  program officials while materials are under development or activities  are being implemented. This may have been in part related to  organizational structure, as until recently CNPP and FNS were  separate agencies that individually reported to the Office of the Under  Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, according to  USDA officials. Some nutrition education program staff also told us  they currently use the core nutrition messages on USDA\u2019s website  when developing nutrition education materials\u2014messages that CNPP  officials noted were developed in 2010 and have not been updated to  reflect the latest edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  This approach may lead to inefficiencies in the development of  nutrition education materials.", "Although ERS conducts nutrition research, nutrition education  program officials were not always aware of or using ERS resources,  possibly because most of the programs reside in a different USDA  mission area. A prior working group attempted to bridge the  organizational divide between ERS and some of USDA\u2019s other  agencies and offices that work on nutrition education by assisting  efforts to share information, but the group has since dissolved.  Currently, some national and regional officials we spoke with who  work on nutrition education programs had limited awareness of ERS\u2019s  nutrition education research. For example, some program officials in  the national office were unsure whether ERS did work related to  nutrition education and learned of ERS research through automated  email updates. Further, one regional official learned of ERS data on  food insecurity, which can help states meet federal requirements for  targeting nutrition education services to local areas based on their  level of need, through a meeting with an outside agency.", "Nutrition education program officials were also generally unaware of  ARS\u2019s efforts related to nutrition education. Specifically, USDA  nutrition education program officials we spoke to said they had little  direct contact with ARS officials and were generally unaware of ARS  efforts related to nutrition education. Further, regional officials who  work on SNAP-Ed had not used or distributed ARS resources to state  officials and also seemed generally unaware of ARS\u2019s nutrition  education efforts.", "USDA lacks a mechanism for systematically integrating its internal  nutrition expertise into its nutrition education programs, which may inhibit  the effectiveness of the department\u2019s efforts. Federal internal control  standards state that agencies should use quality information from reliable  internal sources, among others, to inform decision-making. Further, in  our prior work, we found that identifying and addressing needs by  leveraging resources is a leading practice for collaboration.

However, in order to reach these goals, USDA needs to  ensure that its programs are effectively educating participants to  maximize the impact of the federal investment in nutrition education.  Although USDA has some information on the effectiveness of its nutrition  programs, without improvements to how USDA gathers information on the  effectiveness of SNAP-Ed interventions nationwide, USDA will be unable  to ensure one of its largest investments in nutrition education is meeting  its goals.", "The 2018 Farm Bill included a requirement for USDA to begin reporting  annually on the level of coordination between its nutrition education  programs, and USDA has acknowledged the importance of coordination  and information sharing to maximize nutrition education programs\u2019  impacts. However, the department currently lacks a formal mechanism to  ensure this occurs. As a result, USDA risks missing opportunities to  increase efficiency, maximize the use of federal resources, and avoid  potential duplication of effort.

The scope of our review includes five federal programs that  provide nutrition education: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  Education (SNAP-Ed), the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education  Program (EFNEP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for  Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Team Nutrition, and the Food  Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) Grant Program. Among USDA  programs that provide nutrition education, four of these received the  greatest amount of federal funding for nutrition education in fiscal year  2018\u2014WIC, SNAP-Ed, EFNEP, and Team Nutrition. In addition, we  included FINI because it is a grant program in which nutrition education  can be a component, and the program\u2019s goal is to incentivize healthy  eating.

We also  interviewed officials from other USDA agencies overseeing nutrition- related research and guidance, including the Agricultural Research  Service, the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, and the Economic  Research Service. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the seven  FNS regional offices, including officials who work on SNAP-Ed and the  Child and Adult Care Food Program. We also interviewed  representatives of selected organizations knowledgeable about USDA\u2019s  nutrition education efforts.

We  analyzed EFNEP total direct education participation data for fiscal years  2010 through 2018. These data are reported through the Web-based  Nutrition Education, Evaluation and Reporting System (WebNEERS), an  integrated data collection system, sponsored by NIFA, and used at the  county, state, and federal levels. To assess the reliability of the SNAP-Ed  and EFNEP participation data, we interviewed FNS and NIFA officials and  reviewed relevant documentation. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting the number of direct  education participants in SNAP-Ed and EFNEP.", "We also reviewed available USDA data on the number of people reached  by nutrition education efforts in SNAP-Ed and EFNEP other than through  direct participation. SNAP-Ed collects information on the number of  people reached by nutrition education efforts that are not direct education,  such as policy, systems, and environmental change interventions and  social marketing. However, states face challenges with tracking  individuals reached by these education interventions, and these data are  likely to include duplicate records of individuals, according to USDA  officials. Therefore, we concluded that these data were not sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of reporting the number of people indirectly  reached by SNAP-Ed. EFNEP also collects information on indirect  education reach. This information tracks other family members of adults  who participated in direct education who therefore may also benefit from  the information shared, according to USDA officials.
