First, in response to language contained in a conference report prepared by the House Appropriations Committee, FTA adopted a 60 percent preference policy, which in effect, generally reduced the level of New Starts federal funding share for projects from 80 percent to 60 percent. Because FTA has not revised its program regulations to reflect this change, transit agencies, project sponsors, and the public did not have an opportunity to formally comment on the change. Explicitly stating its criteria and procedures in regulation would allow those involved in considering potential projects to make their investment decisions on the basis of a transparent process. Second, FTA revised some of the criteria used in the ratings process to include a new Transportation System User Benefits measure. Project sponsors GAO interviewed said that the measure was an improvement over the previous benefits measure because it considers benefits to both new and existing transit system riders. However, many project sponsors experienced difficulties in generating a value for the measure for a number of reasons, such as problems with their local forecasting models. FTA officials are working closely with project sponsors to correct these problems, but more guidance may be necessary to avert similar difficulties in the future. The administration's fiscal year 2004 budget proposal requests that $1.5 billion be made available for New Starts for that year, a 25 percent increase over fiscal year 2003. The budget proposal contains three initiatives--reducing the federal share to 50 percent, allowing certain nonfixed guideway projects to be funded through New Starts, and establishing a streamlined ratings process for projects requesting less than $75 million in New Starts funding. These initiatives may allow FTA to fund more projects and give local communities flexibility in choosing among transit modes. However, they may also create challenges for some future transit projects, such as difficulties in generating an increased local funding share or a reduction in the number of smaller communities that will participate in New Starts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1970s, the federal government has provided a large share of  the nation\u2019s capital investment in mass transportation.

In December 2000, FTA finalized a regulation  that stated that the evaluation and ratings process would consider, among  other things, the extent to which projects have a local financial  commitment that exceeds the 20 percent minimum. Essentially, this  regulation merely restated the TEA-21 statutory criteria.

For  example, FTA hired contractors to work with transit sponsors to correct  problems with the local travel forecasting models and the software used to  calculate the TSUB measure.
