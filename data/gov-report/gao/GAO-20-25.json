We reviewed  six of these 12 states and found that a majority of errors identified by  OCS were administrative. The CSBG Act requires OCS to conduct  compliance evaluations for several states each year. Since fiscal year  2009, OCS has conducted onsite compliance evaluations in five to seven  selected states each year, in addition to the routine oversight it conducts  for all the states. According to OCS officials, the number of states visited  each year depends upon available resources. OCS primarily bases its  selection of states for onsite compliance evaluations on a risk  assessment conducted using a scoring tool. The scoring tool generates a  risk score of 1 to 5 for each state using a number of measures, as shown  in figure 2. The various factors used in developing the total risk score are  weighted to ensure the most significant risk indicators and prioritization  factors have the most impact on the selection of states for onsite  monitoring. The list of risk factors was developed by OCS in response to  a recommendation from our 2006 report in which we found that OCS did  not systematically use available information to assess risk to focus its  monitoring resources on states with the highest risk.", "According to OCS officials, OCS rarely visits states that they identify as  low risk or states that have very few local agencies as grantees, and they  try to not visit the same state within 3 years of their last visit. OCS officials  told us that monitoring resources limit their ability to reach all of the states  for onsite review. We found that, since fiscal year 2008, eight states have  not received an onsite evaluation and 10 had been visited twice.  According to agency officials, the risk assessment is part of a larger risk  assessment and prioritization process designed to direct monitoring  resources over multiple years. After determining risk under the scoring  tool, OCS considers several other factors and may place a higher priority  on states with lower risk scores when selecting states for onsite  compliance evaluations. Agency officials said such factors include:  size of the CSBG award,  findings from single audits,  the rate at which the state spends its CSBG funds,  time since the last OCS visit, and  feedback from the OCS program manager using information gathered  from the quarterly calls with the states.", "For states selected for onsite compliance evaluations, we found that OCS  conducts a comprehensive review of each of the state\u2019s plan and annual  reports and examines the state\u2019s supporting documents to determine if  that state is meeting the requirements of the CSBG program. Although  OCS reviews the plans for all 56 states as part of its routine oversight  efforts, during the onsite visit the agency also conducts interviews with  staff and examines state statutes or regulations and supportive  information, such as financial ledgers and oversight procedural manuals.  OCS also reviews the state\u2019s grant funding to determine if the state  allocated the funds in accordance with the requirements of the CSBG  program. Additionally, OCS reviews each state\u2019s fiscal controls and  accounting procedures and associated documents to assess the financial  integrity of the state\u2019s process for drawing down federal funds, providing  funds to local agencies, and reporting financial information. For example,  OCS officials may review the state agency\u2019s bookkeeping system and  accounting software.", "In our review of OCS\u2019s file documentation for the six selected states, we  found OCS generally identified administrative errors, but in some  instances identified issues of non-compliance and other issues that the  states took action to resolve. For example, during its fiscal year 2017  onsite visit to Louisiana, OCS found that Louisiana did not implement  procedures to monitor and track prior year single audit findings for  corrective action and issue management decisions as required. To  address this concern, the state assigned a member of its staff to execute  these duties and submitted a copy of the Single Audit Process and audit  log to OCS. Additionally, OCS found that Louisiana did not visit any of its  42 local agencies in fiscal year 2015 because of limited capacity such as  staffing shortages, among other non-compliance issues. OCS determined  that Louisiana addressed this issue by visiting all of the local agencies  before the end of fiscal year 2017.

In  response to our June 2006 recommendation, OCS issued guidance  clarifying that states must conduct an onsite review of each local agency  at least once every 3 years. Besides the triennial onsite reviews, the law  requires states to conduct: (1) follow up reviews including prompt return  visits to local agencies that fail to meet state goals, standards, and  requirements, (2) an onsite review of new local agencies following the  completion of the first year receiving CSBG funds, and (3) other reviews  as appropriate, including reviews of local agencies found to have had  other grants terminated for cause.", "Each of the states we visited had developed oversight policies and  procedures that included information on how often CSBG programs  should be reviewed onsite and what program operations should be  covered during onsite visits; two states provided sample forms or  instructions on what forms to use to record findings. For example, each  state\u2019s policies and procedures established the frequency of onsite visits:  New York and Texas conduct the visits at least once every 3 years and  North Dakota conducts them once every 2 years (see table 2).

For example, in all  three of the states we visited the policies and procedures required state  officials to notify local agencies of deficiencies in writing.", "Our findings from the two local agencies we visited in each of the three  states showed that state officials identified a variety of issues during their  reviews, but none that required those local agencies to lose their CSBG  funding (see table 3). Generally, we found that the issues identified could  be characterized as fiscal, governance, or administrative. Fiscal issues  included improper use of funds. For example, state officials in one  selected state found that a local agency had improperly used a small  amount of CSBG funds to purchase a grill for agency activities.  Governance-related findings included issues with both the composition  and manner of selecting the local agency\u2019s CSBG Board of Directors  members. For example, in Texas, state officials cited one local agency for  not complying with the CSBG Act\u2019s requirement regarding the structure of  its Board. Also, North Dakota cited a local agency for not having the  required representation of low-income individuals on its Board.  Administrative issues included recordkeeping of information on  participants. For example, Texas cited a local agency for inaccurately  reporting a program participant as having transitioned out of poverty. The  state agency found that the participant\u2019s file did not contain all of the  required documentation needed to show that the participant had  maintained a certain income level for a 90-day period.", "The state agency officials we spoke with told us that their reviews  sometimes identified more serious issues that resulted in local agencies  being terminated from the program. For example, Texas terminated two  local agencies\u2019 CSBG funding due to financial mismanagement that was  uncovered during state monitoring of the local agencies. Texas officials  noted that the process for terminating local agencies with deficiencies  was, for them, a prolonged process, in part because of the steps they  took to provide technical assistance and work with agencies in an attempt  to resolve issues before terminating them from the program. They told us  they found it difficult to establish sufficient grounds for termination and, for  one of the terminations, Texas officials continued to work with the agency  for two years while also working with OCS. Texas officials told us that  they found the guidance on terminations to be unclear. OCS officials  acknowledged that the information memorandum they have developed on  terminations provides broad guidance that covers a range of issues states  might encounter, and may not have detailed guidance covering each  situation. However, they noted that they work with states on a case by  case basis, as they did with Texas, to provide guidance that is specific to  each situation.", "State officials in the selected states told us that local agencies identified  as having deficiencies are notified of those deficiencies and provided  information on how to correct them. Further, our review of corrective  actions required of selected local agencies by the states we visited  showed that the local agencies addressed the concerns raised by the  states. For example, Texas required a local agency that it found did not  comply with CSBG Board requirements concerning membership to fill the  vacancies on the Board and to provide the state a timeline for completing  the required corrective actions. In addition to taking corrective actions,  local agencies may be required to submit fiscal and programmatic reports  more frequently when monitoring uncovers problems. For example, North  Dakota\u2019s policies and procedures indicate that monthly reports may be  required of local agencies that have been found to have financial  recordkeeping problems.", "We also found that state agency officials in our three selected states  conducted onsite reviews more frequently than the once every 3 years  requirement, as well as routine offsite reviews. For example, New York  conducted quarterly onsite visits to all local agencies, where each  quarterly visit involved a targeted review of a specific aspect of a local  agency\u2019s CSBG program. For example, during the third quarterly visit of  the year, state officials focused on local agency planning efforts for the  next funding year, including the community needs assessment, while  during the last quarterly visit of the year, state officials focused on grant  closeout activities. New York, like North Dakota and Texas, also  conducted routine offsite reviews of local agencies\u2019 activities and  finances. In our three selected states, these reviews included examining  fiscal and program reports periodically submitted by local agencies to  state officials, periodic meetings and conference calls between state and  local agency staff, and reviewing audit reports. These oversight activities  also included fiscal audits conducted by the state auditor or independent  auditors when a local agency\u2019s funding met the threshold for such review.", "Our review of single audits and interviews with each state\u2019s auditor\u2019s  office in the three states we visited showed that none of the state audit  agencies focused specifically on CSBG funding during the period of our  review. Texas last conducted an audit focusing on CSBG in 2014 and  North Dakota did so in 2011; neither state reported findings as a result of  those audits. Officials from the state auditor offices in North Dakota and  Texas said CSBG funding levels are below the federally-established  threshold for programs that must be audited. New York state audit  officials told us that they had not conducted any audits focused on CSBG."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OCS and States Provided Training and Technical Assistance to CSBG Recipients", "paragraphs": ["OCS and states provided training and technical assistance through a  variety of methods to help CSBG recipients meet program requirements.  In fiscal years 2016 and 2017, OCS designated nearly $14 million over  the 2-year period for such efforts. OCS officials told us that they  determine what training is needed through input from OCS program  specialists, information obtained through a data task force, and requests  from state and local agencies. OCS officials stated that the OCS\u2019s  program specialists use the quarterly calls to identify the types of support  that states need. For example, a specialist may notice that the states  need additional guidance on using their customer survey results. In  response, the specialist may share a guide on how states can use the  survey results to set reasonable performance improvement goals. In  addition, OCS sponsors a CSBG Data Task Force to recommend  strategies for building network capacity for collecting, analyzing, reporting  and using performance data as well as identifying on-going training and  technical assistance needs. OCS officials told us that they also  conducted focus groups in 2016 to gather states\u2019 perspectives on their  training and technical assistance needs. From these focus groups, OCS  issued guidance stating its technical assistance priorities and strategy for  meeting identified needs for training and technical assistance in areas  including: performance management, governance, effective state  oversight, and results-oriented services and strategies.", "In 2017, OCS issued guidance laying out the agency\u2019s 3-year training and  technical assistance strategy to guide the development and delivery of  training and technical assistance for the CSBG network. OCS officials  said that once they establish the standards for the training and technical  assistance and identify specific training needs, the agency awards  cooperative agreements to organizations that focus on developing and  providing training to build upon guidance already provided. During the  period of our review, we found that each agreement focused on a specific  type of training. For example, the National Association for State  Community Services Programs (NASCSP) has a cooperative agreement  with OCS to provide the orientation and oversight training for new state  officials overseeing the CSBG program, and collects and coordinates the  analysis of the data provided in the state plans and annual reports. OCS  has also worked closely with NASCSP in the transition to the new  performance framework. OCS officials told us that they are currently  reviewing their training and technical assistance portfolio and may issue  additional guidance on its strategy and coordination efforts during fiscal  year 2020.", "In addition, OCS uses various methods to provide guidance to states to  help them meet CSBG requirements, but state officials differed in their  views on the usefulness of the guidance. OCS provides guidance to  states through informational memorandums, letters, webinars, and  communications with program specialists. Some of the state agency  officials in two of the states we visited said that the guidance that OCS  has provided to help states ensure compliance with program  requirements is not always clear and up to date. For example, officials in  North Dakota said that they did not understand the information  requirements for a form used to gather information from applicants for  local programs. State agency officials in Texas said that OCS issued  guidance on the new information requirements just weeks before the  reporting deadline, and that this did not allow states sufficient time to set  up their data systems to meet the new requirements.", "OCS officials acknowledged that they were aware of the issues raised by  state agency officials and explained that some states have difficulty with  the guidance because it is written at a high level so that it can apply to all  states. They also acknowledged the delays in getting new information  requirements to states and said that such delays were related to  troubleshooting the new smart forms and online database. They said that  they do not anticipate such delays in the future. As previously discussed,  Texas state officials also said that they found the guidance for terminating  a deficient agency\u2019s CSBG funding confusing. However, officials in New  York said that they found the guidance to be clear. They said that the  informational memorandum on terminating agencies\u2019 CSBG funding is  more prescriptive than previously issued CSBG guidance. OCS officials  stated that the agency is continuously seeking opportunities to work with  its technical assistance centers to identify the best means of delivering  guidance to states and to eligible entities. OCS officials also said that they  must continue to refresh training efforts when there is turnover among key  staff in a state agency and work with new state administrators to transition  into their new roles.", "State agency officials in all three states we visited told us that they used  some of their state\u2019s discretionary funding for training and technical  assistance to help local agencies meet CSBG requirements. The CSBG  Act allows states to use a maximum of 10 percent of their CSBG funds for  training and technical assistance and other specified purposes. In the  selected states, officials spent from $65,000 to over $400,000 for training  and technical assistance for local agencies (see table 4).", "Across the three selected states, we found that the training provided to  local agencies addressed what local agencies need to do to meet a wide  variety of CSBG requirements, from planning community needs  assessments to implementing performance management requirements. In  addition, some funds states provided for training were used by local  agencies to send their staff to regional or national conferences for training  (see table 5).", "State officials in two of the three states we visited said that they  determine what training they need to offer based on analysis of feedback  and specific requests from local agencies. For example, Texas identified  training needs for local agencies through a Training and Community  Affairs group that gathered information from local agencies about their  training needs. Texas officials said they analyzed assessment results,  feedback, and requests from local agencies and other sources to  determine the training needs of individual state and local agencies. State  officials said that they then met with the state association to develop the  Joint State Training and Technical Assistance Plan and, ultimately, to  provide trainings at the annual state conference, and to identify  workshops, webinars, and online resources (guides, tools, best practices,  and links to other training resources) that need to be added or changed.  Similarly, state officials in North Dakota reported working closely with the  state association of community action agencies to plan and conduct  training for local agency staff.", "State and local agency officials also said that they have relied on the  OCS-funded national resource centers for assistance. Officials in the  states we visited all reported being helped by information provided by the  national centers on topics such as the new organizational standards and  how to submit data in the new annual report. Local agency officials told us  that they send staff to the conferences sponsored by the national  resource centers to obtain training when funding is available for that  purpose.", "In addition to training, state officials in the states we visited cited a variety  of practices that contribute to effective oversight. Both New York and  North Dakota officials emphasized the importance of frequent, ongoing  communication with local agencies as crucial to successful oversight.  New York also identified frequent visits to local agencies and immediate  action in response to problems as additional key factors for effective  oversight."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OCS Reports on CSBG\u2019s National Effectiveness, but Several Elements of Its Redesigned Performance Management Approach Do Not Align with Leading Practices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OCS Uses State Outcome Data to Report on the National Effectiveness of CSBG, but the Performance Measure Used for this Purpose is of Limited Use", "paragraphs": ["OCS uses outcome data from state agencies that collect and aggregate  data from local CSBG recipients to provide an indication of CSBG\u2019s  progress in meeting the three national program goals. As previously  discussed, the three national goals of the CSBG program as established  under the CSBG Act are to (1) reduce poverty, (2) empower low-income  families and individuals to become self-sufficient, and (3) revitalize low- income communities. State agencies report data from a menu of more  than 100 performance measures established by OCS and grouped by  service types such as employment, early childhood programs, and  education. OCS sets annual targets for the overall performance of the  CSBG program and uses the aggregated state data as an indicator of  CSBG\u2019s national effectiveness to inform budget decisions consistent with  federal requirements for performance management.", "Until fiscal year 2018, OCS used one performance measure\u2014the number  of barriers to economic security that the local agencies receiving CSBG  funds eliminated for individuals, families, and communities\u2014to provide an  indication of CSBG\u2019s national effectiveness. To do this, OCS combined  the outcome data from 10 of the more than 100 performance measures  from the state annual reports to derive a cumulative total number of  barriers overcome. OCS selected the 10 measures as a way to track  outcomes from services that range from emergency services to more  comprehensive and coordinated services. The 10 measures included  outcomes such as the number of participants who obtained a job,  maintained employment, maintained an independent living situation,  reached the goals of enrichment programs, or obtained emergency  assistance.", "While this one performance measure of barriers eliminated was intended  to provide OCS with an indication of how the program was meeting CSBG  national goals, several weaknesses with this measure limited OCS\u2019s  ability to do so. First, the measure included duplicative counts. For  example, an individual may overcome a number of different barriers to  reach the outcome of obtaining a job. As a result, by tracking the number  of barriers, an outcome may be counted multiple times when combining  data from multiple measures. Second, it is also difficult to know which  CSBG funded program or service caused the positive outcome or if one  service helped achieve multiple outcomes. Third, OCS officials clarified  that when calculating this and other outcome measures, the removal of  barriers to economic security is not solely the result of CSBG funds, but of  all funding administered to local agencies that received CSBG funds. As  such, they said that it is difficult to isolate the effects of CSBG funding.", "In its agency wide budget justification for fiscal year 2020, HHS reported  that in fiscal year 2017 local agencies eliminated 32.2 million barriers to  economic security, well above the 27.6 million it set as its goal for the  year. In the same year, 16.2 million individuals received support through  local agencies receiving CSBG funds. While the performance measure  aided OCS in providing some indication of how the CSBG program  contributes to the goal of improving self-sufficiency, it still did not provide  information on the program\u2019s progress in meeting the other two national  program goals. Leading practices in performance management stress  that performance measures should be tied to the specific goals of the  program. However, no such linkage existed between the performance  measure OCS used to report on the progress of the CSBG program and  the program\u2019s three national goals. required to annually report, among other things, a summary of certain  information the states provide and its findings on state compliance to  Congress. While OCS does submit such reports, we found that there has  historically been a multi-year lag in OCS providing these reports to  Congress. In May of 2019, OCS released its fiscal year 2015 CSBG  report to Congress (see sidebar on data reported in the CSBG fiscal year  2015 report to Congress). Over the last decade, this type of reporting lag  has been common and OCS has taken an average of more than 3 years  from the end of the federal fiscal year until the time the Congress  received the final report. OCS officials told us that they submitted the draft  annual report for fiscal year 2016 for internal review by HHS in October  2018, but said that they could not project when the final report would be  issued to Congress. They said they are currently drafting the fiscal year  2017 report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Elements of OCS\u2019s Redesigned Performance Management Approach Do Not Align with Federal Leading Practices, Limiting OCS\u2019s Ability to Report on CSBG\u2019s National Progress", "paragraphs": ["OCS has taken steps to redesign its performance management approach,  but several elements of the new approach do not align with federal  performance management and internal control standards. OCS has been  redesigning how it oversees and manages the performance of the CSBG  program to better align with GPRAMA, according to OCS officials. Since  fiscal year 2016, OCS has been implementing new performance  management tools for the CSBG program, including updating what data it  collects and how it collects it on the services and outcomes, or  performance measures, of the CSBG program. OCS officials stated that  the changes are necessary to be able to provide more information and  analysis on CSBG funded programs and their outcomes. They also noted  the importance of these updates given a tightening federal budget. As  part of these changes, OCS updated its more than 100 performance  measures by revising the language of some and adding new measures  that state and local agencies can report on, including measures more  focused on outcomes in the communities they serve. State and local  agency officials told us that the increased emphasis on outcomes in the  new measures was an improvement and increased their own focus on  connecting CSBG funds to traceable results. In addition, OCS  transitioned to an online data reporting system that allows state agencies  to directly report and access CSBG program data. However, OCS is still  revising how it will use the data provided by state and local agencies to  reflect nationwide results.", "OCS is using the data collected in state annual reports to develop a new  national measure intended to provide a national total count of individuals  who achieve at least one positive outcome through programs and  services offered by local agencies that receive CSBG funds. Unlike the  prior measure on the number of barriers to economic security eliminated  by local CSBG recipients that could include duplicative counts, the new  measure will be a count of individuals. OCS stopped using the prior  measure after fiscal year 2017. Until OCS finalizes the new measure, it  does not have a performance measure in place with targets and results  that it can report to Congress. As such, it is unclear if OCS will report  national performance outcomes for fiscal year 2018 or how useful the  new measure will be while it is still in development through fiscal year  2022.", "While OCS has taken steps to redesign its performance management  approach, several elements of the new approach do not align with federal  performance management and internal control standards. Specifically,  OCS has not established (1) how the new national measure will be used  to assess CSBG goals, (2) the relationship between state and local  measures and program goals, and (3) how OCS will monitor the reliability  of state and local agencies\u2019 program data.", "How the newly developed national measure will assess CSBG  program goals. As discussed, OCS is developing a new national  measure intended to provide a total number of individuals who achieved  at least one positive outcome from CSBG funded program or services.  However, it is unclear which of the three program goals\u2014reducing  poverty, empowering low-income families and individuals to become self- sufficient, or revitalizing low-income communities\u2014the new national  measure is being used to assess. As noted previously, OCS officials have  stated that they are working to establish ways to provide more information  and analysis on programs and their outcomes. OCS officials also told us  that they are using GPRAMA as a guide for these changes and in our  prior work we have reported that these requirements can serve as leading  practices for strategic planning at lower levels within federal agencies.  GPRAMA requires agencies to establish performance goals and a  balanced set of performance indicators, including output and outcome  indicators as appropriate, in measuring or assessing progress toward  those goals. Additional leading performance management practices state  that performance measures should be tied to the specific goals of the  program. However, OCS\u2019s new measure which is intended to provide a  count of the number of individuals that achieve one or more positive  outcomes does not specify which of the three national program goals the  new measure will address, nor how the other two national program goals  will be addressed. OCS officials told us that the new measure is related to  two of the three goals because it is aggregated data from some of the  outcome measures focused on individual and family outcomes. However,  officials acknowledged that the agency has not yet developed a national  measure for revitalizing low-income communities. Officials stated they  plan to report on progress toward developing these measures and that it  will provide examples of community-level outcomes in upcoming reports  to Congress. Without clearly linking the measure to the goals, there is no  way to tell if, and to what degree, the services local agencies are  providing through CSBG grant funds are having the desired effect on their  communities, even if examples are included in the shared results.", "How state and local performance measures are related to the three  program goals. It is unclear how the large number of updated state and  local performance measures under OCS\u2019s redesigned approach aligns  with CSBG\u2019s three national program goals. OCS still collects data on  more than 100 measures but it is unclear which of these measures will be  analyzed at a national level. According to OCS officials, these data are  most useful to state and local agencies for assessing outcomes against  their unique goals and numerous measures are necessary to capture the  variety of services and outcomes across the 1,000 local agencies. In our  prior work on ways that agencies could improve performance  management, we have stated that using a minimal number of critical  measures is a leading practice. We have found that organizations that  seek to manage an excessive number of performance measures may risk creating confusing, excess data that will obscure rather than clarify  performance issues. The large number of measures can also further  complicate OCS\u2019s efforts to align the measures with CSBG\u2019s three  national program goals.", "How OCS will assess data reliability long-term. Although OCS is  taking steps to assess data collected from state and local agencies for its  new national measure, it does not have a written plan for how it will  assess the data\u2019s reliability for future years. As previously discussed,  OCS is using a new data reporting system to collect the data it will  subsequently use for its new national measure and this data will now be  received directly by OCS instead of a third party. However, OCS does not  have written plans in place for how the agency will determine if the new  data collected will be a valid measure of the national program\u2019s  effectiveness or if the data will be reported reliably by the states into  OCS\u2019s online data system. OCS received its first round of performance  data for the new measure for fiscal year 2018 on April 30, 2019, and is  working with its cooperative agreement grantees and contactors to  compile results and conduct quality assurance tests for the new  performance data using a multi-step process that involves:", "OCS staff comparing data provided in the annual report to information  previously provided in the state plans;", "OCS conducting quality assurance reviews, with assistance from the  organizations the office has cooperative agreements with, that include  checks for discrepancies and identifying items requiring clarification,  and conducting follow-up with the states; and,", "OCS soliciting feedback from state officials and consulting with  performance management experts within HHS about refinements to  assist OCS in establishing a baseline that will be used in setting future  targets.", "OCS officials also told us that the next steps will be to make any  necessary modifications to the measure, such as adjusting how states  calculate positive outcomes, and establishing a baseline to set future  targets. On October 2, 2019, OCS announced via a Federal Register  Notice that it was requesting a three year extension with minor changes  of the CSBG Annual Report.
