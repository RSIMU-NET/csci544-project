Tax returns that did not include side  income had errors in credits that are calculated based on income. For  example, if a paid preparer did not report side income in the mechanic  scenario, the resulting total income would make the mechanic eligible  for the EITC when he otherwise would not be eligible. Similarly,  because two paid preparers incorrectly chose not to include  unreported tip income for the waitress, they selected the wrong type  of tax return, the Form 1040A.", "Mechanic Scenario, Site Visits #3 and #9  Two paid preparers demonstrated what the refund amount would be if the  side income were reported compared to if it were not reported. Both  preparers did not record the side income.", "Itemized or standard deduction. All but one of the 19 returns  correctly recorded the most advantageous deduction for the two  scenarios. According to IRS guidance, taxpayers should itemize  deductions when the amount of their deductible expenses is greater  than the standard deduction amount. For the waitress scenario, the  most advantageous deduction would be the standard deduction for  head of household, and for the mechanic scenario, the itemized  deductions were more advantageous. One paid preparer chose to use  the standard deduction for the mechanic, even though it was  approximately $3,000 less than the total amount of the itemized  deductions we included in the scenario.", "Child-care expenses. All 19 paid preparers did not record child-care  expenses because neither the waitress nor mechanic was eligible to  receive the credit. While none of the paid preparers recorded the  credit, the reasons the preparers cited were often incorrect. According  to IRS guidance, a taxpayer must attempt to collect the Social  Security number of his or her child-care provider, but if unsuccessful,  can report that fact to IRS and still claim the credit. For the waitress  scenario, the reason that she was ineligible to claim the child-care  expenses was that she did not attempt to get her child-care provider\u2019s  Social Security number. Upon learning that she did not have the  Social Security number of the provider, several of the paid preparers  did not enter her child care expenses on her return.", "IRS guidance states that qualified child-care expenses only include  amounts paid while the taxpayer worked or looked for work. The  mechanic and his wife were not eligible for the credit because the  child-care expenses were incurred for running errands, and not so  that either parent could work. Again, many tax preparers said that the  reason the credit could not be claimed was because the mechanic did  not have the child-care provider\u2019s Social Security number, not  because he was otherwise ineligible.", "Student loan interest. Eight of 10 paid preparers correctly included  the deduction for student loan interest. The waitress\u2019s Form 1098-E  shows the interest the lender received from the taxpayer on qualified  student loans. A taxpayer receives a Form 1098-E if student loan  interest of $600 or more is paid during the year.", "Sales tax deduction. Seven of 9 preparers recorded sales tax as a  deduction on the mechanic\u2019s tax return, however not all chose the  most advantageous amount. According to IRS guidance, taxpayers  who itemize deductions can choose whether to deduct local income  taxes or sales taxes. Because the mechanic lived in a state that did  not have income tax, sales tax should have been deducted. Of the 7  paid preparers that deducted sales taxes, only 2 recorded the amount  that was most advantageous to the taxpayer. IRS provides an online  calculator to help taxpayers estimate the amount of sales taxes they  likely paid in a year. To determine this estimate, taxpayers input basic  information such as ZIP code and annual income in the calculator.  Five preparers chose amounts that were lower than the amount the  calculator estimated.", "Social Security and Medicare tax on unreported tips. Two of 10  paid preparers completed the Form 4137 and reported the amount of  taxes owed on the tip income. Because the waitress received  unreported cash tips, the amount of taxes owed on the unreported  cash tip income should be calculated using the Form 4137.  However, one of the preparers included a lesser amount of tip income  when performing the calculation, resulting in a smaller amount of  taxes owed. Another preparer reported the tip income by incorrectly  completing a Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business, and a  Schedule SE for self-employment taxes.", "Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC on line 64a was another area  where paid preparers made mistakes that resulted in a significant  overstatement of the refund.

All 9 paid preparers correctly  chose the American Opportunity Tax Credit for the mechanic  scenario. The mechanic had a 20-year-old son attending a community  college and paid for both his tuition and books. According to IRS  guidance, to be eligible for this credit, a student must meet certain  requirements including full-time enrollment at least half the year and  no felony drug offense convictions.

Errors in this context changed either the tax due or  the amount to be refunded. As noted before, it is important to remember  that paid preparers are used more often on more complicated returns  than on simpler ones, although we were unable to gauge the full extent to  which this might be true. Furthermore, errors on a return prepared by a  paid preparer do not necessarily mean the errors were the preparer\u2019s  fault; the taxpayer may be to blame. Preparers depend upon the  information provided by the taxpayer.", "In addition to different rates of errors on paid preparer filed returns and  self-prepared returns, the amount taxpayers owed IRS also differed.  Specifically, the estimated median amount owed to IRS was higher for  paid preparer filed returns.

As of March 2014, 55  percent of paid tax preparers are unenrolled preparers, not regulated by  IRS. Undoubtedly, many paid preparers do their best to provide their  clients with tax returns that are both fully compliant with the tax law and  cause them to neither overpay nor underpay their federal income taxes.  However, IRS data, which more broadly track compliance, show  preparers made serious errors, similar to the findings from our site visits.  The higher level of accuracy of Oregon\u2019s tax returns compared to the rest  of the country suggests that a robust regulatory regime involving paid  preparer registration, qualifying education, testing, and continuing  education may help facilitate improved tax compliance. The courts  determined that IRS does not have sufficient authority to regulate  unenrolled preparers. In March 2014, the administration proposed that the  Treasury and IRS be granted the explicit authority to regulate all paid  preparers. Providing IRS with the necessary authority for increased  oversight of the paid preparer community will help promote high-quality  services from paid preparers, will improve voluntary compliance, and will  foster taxpayer confidence in the fairness of the tax system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If Congress agrees that significant paid preparer errors exist, it should  consider legislation granting IRS the authority to regulate paid tax  preparers.", "Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Hatch, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement.
