The Act stipulates major changes to FEMA intended to enhance its preparedness for and response to catastrophic and major disasters. As GAO has reported, FEMA and DHS face continued challenges, including clearly defining leadership roles and responsibilities, developing necessary disaster response capabilities, and establishing accountability systems to provide effective services while protecting against waste, fraud, and abuse. This testimony (1) summarizes GAO's findings on these challenges and FEMA's and DHS's efforts to address them; and (2) discusses several disaster management issues for continued congressional attention."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Effective disaster preparedness and response require defining what needs to be done, where and by whom, how it needs to be done, and how well it should be done. GAO analysis following Hurricane Katrina showed that improvements were needed in leadership roles and responsibilities, development of the necessary disaster capabilities, and accountability systems that balance the need for fast, flexible response against the need to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. To facilitate rapid and effective decision making, legal authorities, roles and responsibilities, and lines of authority at all government levels must be clearly defined, effectively communicated, and well understood. Adequacy of capabilities in the context of a catastrophic or major disaster are needed--particularly in the areas of (1) situational assessment and awareness; (2) emergency communications; (3) evacuations; (4) search and rescue; (5) logistics; and (6) mass care and shelter. Implementing controls and accountability mechanisms helps to ensure the proper use of resources. FEMA has initiated reviews and some actions in each of these areas, but their operational impact in a catastrophic or major disaster has not yet been tested. Some of the targeted improvements, such as a completely revamped logistics system, are multiyear efforts. Others, such as the ability to field mobile communications and registration-assistance vehicles, are expected to be ready for the coming hurricane season. The Comptroller General has suggested one area for fundamental reform and oversight is ensuring a strategic and integrated approach to prepare for, respond to, recover, and rebuild after catastrophic events. FEMA enters the 2007 hurricane season as an organization in transition working simultaneously to implement the reorganization required by the Post-Katrina Reform Act and moving forward on initiatives to address the deficiencies identified by the post-Katrina reviews. This is an enormous challenge. In the short-term, Congress may wish to consider several specific areas for immediate oversight. These include (1) evaluating the development and implementation of the National Preparedness System, including preparedness for natural disasters, terrorist incidents, and an influenza pandemic; (2) assessing state and local capabilities and the use of federal grants to enhance those capabilities; (3) examining regional and multi-state planning and preparation; (4) determining the status and use of preparedness exercises; and (5) examining DHS polices regarding oversight assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss issues associated with the  Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) efforts to address the  shortcomings of the preparation and response to Hurricane Katrina and  enhance its capabilities for responding to major disasters, including  hurricanes. The 2007 hurricane season begins in just a few weeks.  Hurricane Katrina severely tested disaster management at the federal,  state, and local levels and revealed weaknesses in the basic elements of  preparing for, responding, to and recovering from any catastrophic  disaster. The goal of disaster preparedness and response is easy to state  but difficult to achieve and can be stated as follows:  To prevent where possible, prepare for, mitigate, and respond to  disasters of any size or cause with well-planned, well-coordinated,  and effective actions that minimize the loss of life and property and  set the stage for a quick recovery.", "Achieving this goal for major disasters, and catastrophic disasters in  particular, is difficult because success requires effective pre- and post- disaster coordination and cooperation among different levels of  government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.  Individuals can also contribute to success through such things as knowing  evacuation routes, complying with evacuation orders, and having a family  and individual disaster preparation plan and supplies.", "As the Comptroller General testified in February 2007 on DHS\u2019s high-risk  status and specifically disaster preparedness and response, DHS must  overcome continuing challenges, including those related to clearly  defining leadership roles and responsibilities, developing necessary  disaster response capabilities, and establishing accountability systems to  provide effective services while protecting against waste, fraud, and  abuse. These issues are enormously complex and challenging for all levels  of government. It is important to view preparedness for and response to  major disasters as a national system with linked responsibilities and  capabilities. This is because effective preparedness for and response to  major disasters requires the coordinated planning and actions of multiple  actors from multiple first responder disciplines, jurisdictions, and levels of  government as well as nongovernmental entities. Parochialism must be put  aside and cooperation must prevail before and after an emergency event.  The experience of Hurricane Katrina illustrated why it is important to  tackle these difficult issues.", "My testimony today (1) summarizes our key findings on leadership,  response capabilities, and accountability controls and the efforts made by  DHS and FEMA in their implementation of the Post-Katrina Reform Act  and other recommendations made in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,  and (2) highlights several disaster management issues for continued  congressional attention. My comments today are based on our body of  work on disaster and emergency management including more than   30 reports on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, our review of recent  emergency management reform legislative changes, and materials and  statements provided by FEMA. We conducted our audit work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Several federal legislative and executive provisions support preparation  for and response to emergency situations. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) primarily  establishes the programs and processes for the federal government to  provide major disaster and emergency assistance to state, local, and tribal  governments, individuals, and qualified private nonprofit organizations.  FEMA, within DHS, has responsibility for administering the provisions of  the Stafford Act.", "Besides using these federal resources, states affected by a catastrophic  disaster can also turn to other states for assistance in obtaining surge  capacity\u2014the ability to draw on additional resources, such as personnel  and equipment, needed to respond to and recover from the incident. One  way of sharing personnel and equipment across state lines is through the  use of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, an interstate  compact that provides a legal and administrative framework for managing  such emergency requests. The compact includes 49 states, the District of  Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We have ongoing work  examining how the Emergency Management Assistance Compact has been  used in disasters and how its effectiveness could be enhanced and expect  to report by this summer.", "As the committee is aware, a number of specific recommendations have  been made to improve the nation\u2019s ability to effectively prepare for and  respond to catastrophic disasters following the aftermath of Hurricane  Katrina. Beginning in February 2006, reports by the House Select  Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to  Hurricane Katrina, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, the White House Homeland Security Council, the DHS  Inspector General, and DHS and FEMA all identified a variety of failures  and some strengths in the preparations for, response to, and initial  recovery from Hurricane Katrina. In addition to these reviews, a report  from the American National Standards Institute Homeland Security  Standards Panel (ANSI-HSSP) contains recommendations aimed at  bolstering national preparedness, response, and recovery efforts in the  event of a natural disaster. A key resource identified in the document is  the American National Standard for Disaster/Emergency Management and  Business Continuity Programs (ANSI/NFPA 1600), which was developed  by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The standard defines  a common set of criteria for preparedness, disaster management,  emergency management, and business continuity programs.", "Hurricane Katrina severely tested disaster management at the federal,  state, and local levels and revealed weaknesses in the basic elements of  preparing for, responding to, and recovering from any catastrophic  disaster. Based on our work done during the aftermath of Hurricane  Katrina, we previously reported that DHS needs to more effectively  coordinate disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts,  particularly for catastrophic disasters in which the response capabilities of  state and local governments are almost immediately overwhelmed. Our  analysis showed the need for (1) clearly defined and understood  leadership roles and responsibilities; (2) the development of the necessary  disaster capabilities; and (3) accountability systems that effectively  balance the need for fast and flexible response against the need to prevent  waste, fraud, and abuse. In line with a recommendation we made  following Hurricane Andrew, the nation\u2019s most destructive hurricane until  Katrina, we recommended that Congress give federal agencies explicit  authority to take actions to prepare for all types of catastrophic disasters  when there is warning. We also recommended that DHS  1.  rigorously retest, train, and exercise its recent clarification of the  roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for all levels of  leadership, implementing changes needed to remedy identified  coordination problems;  2.  direct that the NRP base plan and its supporting Catastrophic  Incident Annex be supported by more robust and detailed  operational implementation plans;  3.  provide guidance and direction for federal, state, and local  planning, training, and exercises to ensure such activities fully  support preparedness, response, and recovery responsibilities at a  jurisdictional and regional basis;  4.  take a lead in monitoring federal agencies\u2019 efforts to prepare to  meet their responsibilities under the NRP and the interim National  Preparedness Goal; and  5.  use a risk management approach in deciding whether and how to  invest finite resources in specific capabilities for a catastrophic  disaster.", "The Post-Katrina Reform Act responded to the findings and  recommendations in the various reports examining the preparation for and  response to Hurricane Katrina. While keeping FEMA within DHS, the act  enhances FEMA\u2019s responsibilities and its autonomy within DHS. FEMA is  to lead and support the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency  management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and  mitigation. Under the Act, the FEMA Administrator reports directly to the  Secretary of DHS; FEMA is now a distinct entity within DHS; and the  Secretary of DHS can no longer substantially or significantly reduce the  authorities, responsibilities, or functions of FEMA or the capability to  perform them unless authorized by subsequent legislation. FEMA has  absorbed many of the functions of DHS\u2019s Preparedness Directorate (with  some exceptions). The statute establishes 10 regional offices with  specified responsibilities. The statute also establishes a National  Integration Center responsible for the ongoing management and  maintenance of the NIMS and NRP. The Post-Katrina Reform Act also  included provisions for other areas, such as evacuation plans and  exercises and addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities, In  addition, the act includes several provisions to strengthen the management  and capability of FEMA\u2019s workforce. For example, the statute called for a  strategic human capital plan to shape and improve FEMA\u2019s workforce,  authorized recruitment and retention bonuses, and established a Surge  Capacity Force. Most of the organizational changes became effective as of  March 31, 2007. Others, such as the increase in organizational autonomy  for FEMA and establishment of the National Integration Center, became  effective upon enactment of the Post-Katrina Reform Act on October 4,  2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Reviewing Its Responsibilities, Capabilities as It Implements Recommendations and Post-Katrina Reform Act", "paragraphs": ["After FEMA became part of DHS in March 2003, its responsibilities were  over time dispersed and redefined.

Hurricane Katrina showed the need to improve  leadership at all levels of government to better respond to a catastrophic  disaster. As we have previously reported, developing the capabilities  needed for catastrophic disasters requires an overall national  preparedness effort that is designed to integrate and define what needs to  be done, where, and by whom (roles and responsibilities), how it should  be done, and how well it should be done\u2014that is, according to what  standards. The principal national documents designed to address each of  these are, respectively, the NRP, NIMS, and the NPG.", "All three documents are undergoing extensive review and revision by  federal, state, and local government officials, tribal authorities, non- governmental and private sector officials. For example, the review of the  NRP is intended to assess the effectiveness of the NRP, identify  modifications and improvements and reissue the document. This review  includes all major components of the NRP including the base plan,  Emergency Support Functions (ESF), annexes such as the Catastrophic  Incident Annex and Supplement; as well as the role of the PFO, FCO, and  the Joint Field Office structure. Also during the current NRP review  period, FEMA has revised the organizational structure of Emergency  Support Function 6 (ESF-6), Mass Care, Housing, and Human Services,  and places FEMA as the lead agency for this emergency support function.  The Red Cross will remain as a supporting agency in the responsibilities  and activities of ESF-6. According to a February 2007 letter by the Red  Cross, this change will not take place until the NRP review process is  complete and all changes are approved.", "The revised NRP and NIMS were originally scheduled for release in June  2007. In April 2007, however, DHS officials notified stakeholders that some  important issues were more complex and require national-level policy  decisions, and additional time was needed to complete a comprehensive  draft. DHS noted that the underlying operational principles of the NRP  remain intact and the current document, as revised in May 2006, still  applies. FEMA officials have told us that the final version of the National  Preparedness Goal and its corresponding documents like the Target  Capabilities List, are currently receiving final reviews by the White House  and are expected to be out shortly.", "A key issue in the response to Hurricane Katrina was the lack of clearly  understood roles and responsibilities. One that continues to be a subject  of discussion is the roles and responsibilities of the FCO, who has the  authority to make mission assignments to federal agencies for response  and recovery under the Stafford Act, and the PFO, whose role was to  provide situational awareness to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The  May 2006 revisions to the NRP made changes designed to address this  issue. However, as we noted in March 2007, the changes may not have fully  resolved the leadership issues regarding the roles of the PFO and the FCO.  While the Secretary of Homeland Security may avoid conflicts by  appointing a single individual to serve in both positions in non-terrorist  incidents, confusion may persist if the Secretary of Homeland Security  does not exercise this discretion to do so. Furthermore, this discretion  does not exist for terrorist incidents, and the revised NRP does not  specifically provide a rationale for this limitation.", "FEMA has pre-designated five teams of FCOs and PFOs in the Gulf Coast  and eastern seaboard states at risk of hurricanes. This includes FCOs and  PFOs for the Gulf Coast Region, Northeast Region, and the Mid-Atlantic  Region, and separate FCOs and PFOs for the states of Florida and Texas.  It is critically important that the authorities, roles, and responsibilities of  these pre-designated FCOs and PFOs be clear and clearly understood by  all. There is still some question among state and local first responders  about the need for both positions and how they will work together in  disaster response. One potential benefit of naming the FCOs and PFOs in  advance is that they have an opportunity meet and discuss expectations,  roles and responsibilities with state, local, and nongovernmental officials  before an actual disaster, possibly setting the groundwork for improved  coordination and communication in an actual disaster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enhanced Capabilities Are Needed to Adequately Prepare for and Respond to Major Disasters", "paragraphs": ["Numerous reports, including those by the House, Senate, and the White  House, and our own work suggest that the substantial resources and  capabilities marshaled by state, local, and federal governments and  nongovernmental organizations were insufficient to meet the immediate  challenges posed by the unprecedented degree of damage and the number  of victims caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Developing the ability to  prepare for, respond to, and recover from major and catastrophic disasters  requires an overall national preparedness effort that is designed to  integrate and define what needs to be done and where, how it should be  done, and how well it should be done\u2014that is, according to what  standards. As previously discussed, the principal national documents  designed to address each of these are, respectively, the NRP, NIMS, and  the NPG, and each document is undergoing revision.", "Overall, capabilities are built upon the appropriate combination of people,  skills, processes, and assets. Ensuring that needed capabilities are  available requires effective planning and coordination in conjunction with  training and exercises in which the capabilities are realistically tested and  problems identified and subsequently addressed in partnership with other  federal, state, and local stakeholders. In recent work on FEMA  management of day-to-day operations, we found that although shifting  resources caused by its transition to DHS created challenges for FEMA,  the agency\u2019s management of existing resources compounded these  problems. FEMA lacks some of the basic management tools that help an  agency respond to changing circumstances. Most notably, our January  2007 report found that FEMA lacks a strategic workforce plan and related  human capital strategies\u2014such as succession planning or a coordinated  training effort. Such tools are integral to managing resources, as they  enable an agency to define staffing levels, identify the critical skills needed  to achieve its mission, and eliminate or mitigate gaps between current and  future skills and competencies. FEMA officials have said they are  beginning to address these and other basic organizational management  issues. To this end, FEMA has commissioned studies of 18 areas, whose  final reports and recommendations are due later this spring.", "An important element of effective emergency response is the ability to  identify and deploy where needed a variety of resources from a variety of  sources\u2014federal, state, local or tribal governments; military assets of the  National Guard or active military; nongovernmental entities; and the  private sector. One key method of tapping resources in areas not affected  by the disaster is the Emergency Management Assistance Compact  (EMAC). Through EMAC about 46,000 National Guard and 19,000 civilian  responders were deployed to areas directly affected by the 2005 Gulf  Coast hurricanes. We have ongoing work examining how EMAC has been  used in disasters and how its effectiveness could be enhanced and expect  to report by this summer.", "One of the resources accessed through EMAC is the National Guard.  States and governors rely on their National Guard personnel and  equipment for disaster response, and National Guard personnel are  frequently deployed to disaster areas outside their home states. However,  as we reported in January 2007, the types and quantities of equipment the  National Guard needs to respond to large-scale disasters have not been  fully identified because the multiple federal and state agencies that would  have roles in responding to such events have not completed and integrated  their plans. As a liaison between the Army, the Air Force, and the states,  the National Guard Bureau is well positioned to facilitate state planning  for National Guard forces. However, until the bureau\u2019s charter and its civil  support regulation are revised to define its role in facilitating state  planning for multistate events, such planning may remain incomplete, and  the National Guard may not be prepared to respond as effectively and  efficiently as possible. In addition, questions have arisen about the level of  resources the National Guard has available for domestic emergency  response. DOD does not routinely measure the equipment readiness of  nondeployed National Guard forces for domestic civil support missions or  report this information to Congress. Thus, although the deployment of  National Guard units overseas has decreased the supply of equipment  available to nondeployed National Guard units in the U.S., there has been  no established, formal method of assessing the impact on the Guard\u2019s  ability to perform its domestic missions. Although DOD has begun to  collect data on units\u2019 preparedness, these efforts are not yet fully mature.", "The nation\u2019s experience with hurricanes Katrina and Rita reinforces some  of the questions surrounding the adequacy of capabilities in the context of  a catastrophic disaster\u2014particularly in the areas of (1) situational  assessment and awareness, (2) emergency communications,   (3) evacuations, (4) search and rescue, (5) logistics, and (6) mass care   and sheltering. According to FEMA, the agency has described a number of  actions it has taken or has underway to address identified deficiencies in  each of these areas. Examples include designating national and regional  situational awareness teams; acquiring and deploying mobile satellite  communications trucks; developing an electronic system for receiving and  tracking the status of requests for assistance and supplies; acquiring GPS  equipment for tracking the location of supplies on route to areas of need;  and working with the Red Cross and others to clarify roles and  responsibilities for mass care, housing, and human services. However, a  number of FEMA programs are ongoing and it is too early to evaluate their  effectiveness. In addition, none of these initiatives appear to have been  tested on a scale that reasonably simulates the conditions and demand  they would face following a major or catastrophic disaster. Thus, it is  difficult to assess the probable results of these initiatives in improving  response to a major or catastrophic disaster, such as a category 4 or   5 hurricane. The section below briefly discusses actions taken or  underway to make improvements in each of these areas. Additional details  can be found in appendix I.", "Situational Awareness. FEMA is developing a concept for rapidly  deployable interagency incident management teams, at this time called  National Incident Management Team, to provide a forward federal  presence on site within 12 hours of notification to facilitate managing the  national response for catastrophic incidents. These teams will support  efforts to meet the emergent needs during disasters such as the capability  to provide initial situational awareness for decision-makers and support  the initial establishment of a unified command.", "Emergency Communications. Agencies\u2019 communications systems during  a catastrophic disaster must first be operable, with sufficient  communications to meet everyday internal and emergency communication  requirements. Once operable, systems should have communications  interoperability whereby public safety agencies (e.g., police, fire,  emergency medical services, etc.) and service agencies (e.g., public works,  transportation, and hospitals) can communicate within and across  agencies and jurisdictions in real time as needed. DHS officials have  identified a number of programs and activities they have implemented to  improve interoperable communications nationally, and FEMA has taken  action to design, staff, and maintain a rapidly deployable, responsive,  interoperable, and reliable emergency communications capability, which  we discuss further in appendix I.", "Logistics. FEMA\u2019s inability to effectively manage and track requests for  and the distribution of water, ice, food, and other supplies came under  harsh criticism in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Within days, FEMA  became overwhelmed and essentially asked the military to take over much  of the logistics mission. In the Post-Katrina Reform Act, Congress  required FEMA to make its logistics system more flexible and responsive.  FEMA\u2019s ongoing improvements to its logistics strategy and efforts are  designed to initially lean forward and provide immediate support to a  disaster site mainly through FEMA-owned goods and assets, and later on  to establish sustained supply chains with the private vendors whose  resources are needed for ongoing response and recovery activities,  according to FEMA officials. In addition, we recently examined FEMA  logistics issues, taking a broad approach, identifying five areas necessary  for an effective logistics system, which are discussed in appendix I. In  short, FEMA is taking action to transition its logistics program to be more  proactive, flexible, and responsive. While these and other initiatives hold  promise for improving FEMA\u2019s logistics capabilities, it will be several  years before they are fully implemented and operational.", "Mass Care and Shelter. In GAO\u2019s work examining the nation\u2019s ability to  evacuate, care for, and shelter disaster victims, we found that FEMA needs  to identify and assess the capabilities that exist across the federal  government and outside the federal government. In an April testimony,  FEMA\u2019s Deputy Administrator for Operations said that emergency  evacuation, shelter and housing is FEMA\u2019s most pressing priority for  planning for recovery from a catastrophic disaster. He said that FEMA is  undertaking more detailed mass evacuee support planning; the  Department of Justice and Red Cross are developing methods for more  quickly identifying and uniting missing family members; and FEMA and  the Red Cross have developed a web-based data system to support shelter  management, reporting, and facility identification activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balance Needed between Quick Provision of Assistance and Ensuring Accountability to Protect against Waste, Fraud, and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Controls and accountability mechanisms help to ensure that resources are  used appropriately. Nevertheless, during a catastrophic disaster, decision  makers struggle with the tension between implementing controls and  accountability mechanisms and the demand for rapid response and  recovery assistance. On one hand, our work uncovered many examples  where quick action could not occur due to procedures that required  extensive, time-consuming processes, delaying the delivery of vital  supplies and other assistance. On the other hand, we also found examples  where FEMA\u2019s processes assisting disaster victims left the federal  government vulnerable to fraud and the abuse of expedited assistance  payments.", "We estimated that through February 2006, FEMA made about $600 million  to $1.4 billion in improper and potentially fraudulent payments to  applicants who used invalid information to apply for expedited cash  assistance. DHS and FEMA have reported a number of actions that are to  be in effect for the 2007 hurricane season so that federal recovery  programs will have more capacity to rapidly handle a catastrophic incident  but also provide accountability. Examples include significantly increasing  the quantity of prepositioned supplies, such as food, ice, and water;  placing global positioning systems on supply trucks to track their location  and better manage the delivery of supplies; creating an enhanced phone  system for victim assistance applications that can handle up to 200,000  calls per day; and improving computer systems and processes for verifying  the eligibility of those applying for assistance. Effective implementation of  these and other planned improvements will be critical to achieving their  intended outcomes.", "Finally, catastrophic disasters not only require a different magnitude of  capabilities and resources for effective response, they may also require  more flexible policies and operating procedures. In a catastrophe,  streamlining, simplifying, and expediting decision making should quickly  replace \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and unquestioned adherence to long-standing  policies and operating procedures used in normal situations for providing  relief to disaster victims. At the same time, controls and accountability  mechanisms must be sufficient to provide the documentation needed for  expense reimbursement and reasonable assurance that resources have  been used legally and for the purposes intended.", "We have recommended that DHS create accountability systems that  effectively balance the need for fast and flexible response against the need  to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Doing so would enable DHS to provide  assistance quickly following a catastrophe and keep up with the  magnitude of needs to confirm the eligibility of victims for disaster  assistance, or assure that there were provisions in contracts for response  and recovery services to ensure fair and reasonable prices in all cases. We  also recommended that DHS provide guidance on advance procurement  practices and procedures (precontracting) for those federal agencies with  roles and responsibilities under the NRP. These federal agencies could  then better manage disaster-related procurement and establish an  assessment process to monitor agencies\u2019 continuous planning efforts for  their disaster-related procurement needs and the maintenance of  capabilities. For example, we identified a number of emergency response  practices in the public and private sectors that provide insight into how  the federal government can better manage its disaster-related  procurements. These practices include developing knowledge of  contractor capabilities and prices, and establishing vendor relationships  prior to the disaster and establishing a scalable operations plan to adjust  the level of capacity to match the response with the need.", "In my March 2007 testimony I noted that recent statutory changes have  established more controls and accountability mechanisms. For example,  The Secretary of DHS is required to promulgate regulations designed to  limit the excessive use of subcontractors and subcontracting tiers. The  Secretary of DHS is also required to promulgate regulations that limit  certain noncompetitive contracts to 150 days, unless exceptional  circumstances apply. Oversight funding is specified. FEMA may dedicate  up to one percent of funding for agency mission assignments as oversight  funds. The FEMA Administrator must develop and maintain internal  management controls of FEMA disaster assistance programs and develop  and implement a training program to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of  federal funds in response to or recovery from a disaster.

Below, we describe these five areas along with  FEMA\u2019s ongoing actions to address each.", "Requirements: FEMA does not yet have operational plans in place  to address disaster scenarios, nor does it have detailed information  on states\u2019 capabilities and resources. As a result, FEMA does not  have information from these sources to define what and how much  it needs to stock. However, FEMA is developing a concept of  operations to underpin its logistics program and told us that it is  working to develop detailed plans and the associated stockage  requirements. However, until FEMA has solid requirements based  on detailed plans, the agency will be unable to assess its true  preparedness.", "Inventory management: FEMA\u2019s system accounts for the location,  quantity, and types of supplies, but the ability to track supplies in- transit is limited. FEMA has several efforts under way to improve  transportation and tracking of supplies and equipment, such as  expanding its new system for in-transit visibility from the two test  regions to all FEMA regions.", "Facilities: FEMA maintains nine logistics centers and dozens of  smaller storage facilities across the country. However, it has little  assurance that these are the right number of facilities located in  the right places. FEMA officials told us they are in the process of  determining the number of storage facilities it needs and where  they should be located.", "Distribution: Problems persist with FEMA\u2019s distribution system,  including poor transportation planning, unreliable contractors, and  lack of distribution sites. FEMA officials described initiatives  under way that should mitigate some of the problems with  contractors, and has been working with Department of Defense  and Department of Transportation to improve the access to  transportation when needed.", "People: Human capital issues are pervasive in FEMA, including the  logistics area. The agency has a small core of permanent staff,  supplemented with contract and temporary disaster assistance  staff. However, FEMA\u2019s recent retirements and losses of staff, and  its difficulty in hiring permanent staff and contractors, have  created staffing shortfalls and a lack of capability. According to a  January 2007 study commissioned by FEMA, there are significant  shortfalls in staffing and skill sets of full-time employees,  particularly in the planning, advanced contracting, and relationship  management skills needed to fulfill the disaster logistics mission.  FEMA has recently hired a logistics coordinator and is making a  concerted effort to hire qualified staff for the entire agency,  including logistics.", "In short, FEMA is taking many actions to transition its logistics program to  be more proactive, flexible, and responsive. While these and other  initiatives hold promise for improving FEMA\u2019s logistics capabilities, it will  be years before they are fully implemented and operational."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revisions Made to Evacuation Planning, Mass Care, Housing and Human Services", "paragraphs": ["In an April 2007 testimony, FEMA\u2019s Deputy Administrator for Operations  said that emergency evacuation, shelter and housing is FEMA\u2019s most  pressing priority for planning for recovery from a catastrophic disaster. He  said that FEMA is undertaking more detailed mass evacuee support  planning; the Department of Justice and Red Cross are developing  methods for more quickly identifying and uniting missing family members;  and FEMA and the Red Cross have developed a web-based data system to  support shelter management, reporting, and facility identification  activities.", "Evacuation. Recent GAO work found that actions are needed to clarify the  responsibilities and increase preparedness for evacuations, especially for  those transportation-disadvantaged populations. We found that state and  local governments are generally not well prepared to evacuate  transportation-disadvantaged populations (i.e. planning, training, and  conducting exercises), but some states and localities have begun to  address challenges and barriers. For example, in June 2006, DHS reported  that only about 10 percent of the state and about 12 percent of the urban  area emergency plans it reviewed adequately addressed evacuating these  populations. Steps being taken by some such governments include  collaboration with social service and transportation providers and  transportation planning organizations\u2014some of which are Department of  Transportation (DOT) grantees and stakeholders\u2014to determine  transportation needs and develop agreements for emergency use of drivers  and vehicles. The federal government provides evacuation assistance to  state and local governments, but gaps in this assistance have hindered  many of these governments\u2019 ability to sufficiently prepare for evacuations.  This includes the lack of any specific requirement to plan, train, and  conduct exercises for the evacuation of transportation-disadvantaged  populations as well as gaps in the usefulness of DHS\u2019s guidance. We  recommended that DHS should clarify federal agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities for providing evacuation assistance when state and local  governments are overwhelmed. DHS should require state and local  evacuation preparedness for transportation-disadvantaged populations  and improve information to assist these governments. DOT should  encourage its grant recipients to share information to assist in evacuation  preparedness for these populations. DOT and DHS agreed to consider our  recommendations, and DHS stated it has partly implemented some of  them.", "In his April 26, 2007 testimony statement for the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, FEMA\u2019s Deputy Administrator stated that  FEMA is undertaking more detailed mass evacuation support planning to  help State and local government plan and prepare for hosting large  displaced populations. The project is to include the development of an  evacuee registration and tracking capability and implementation plans for  federal evacuation support to states.", "Mass Care and Shelter. During the current NRP review period, FEMA has  revised the organizational structure of ESF-6, Mass Care, Housing, and  Human Services, and places FEMA as the primary agency responsible for  this emergency support function. The Red Cross will remain as a  supporting agency in the responsibilities and activities of ESF-6. FEMA  continues to maintain a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Red  Cross that articulates agency roles and responsibilities for mass care. The  MOU and addendum were recently revised in May 2006 and December  2006, respectively. FEMA is currently working with Red Cross and other  support agencies to revise ESF-6 standard operating procedures.  According to a February 2007 letter by the Red Cross, this change will not  take place until the NRP review process is complete and all changes are  approved. According to FEMA's Deputy Administrator, FEMA and the Red  Cross have developed the first phase of a web-based data system to  support shelter management, reporting, and facility identification  activities. The system is intended for all agencies that provide shelter  service during disasters to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the  shelter populations and available shelter capacity.", "Temporary housing. Other recent GAO work noted that FEMA needs to  identify and assess the capabilities that exist across the federal  government and outside the federal government, including temporary  housing. In a recent report on housing assistance we found that the  National Response Plan\u2019s annex covering temporary shelter and housing in  ESF 6 clearly described the overall responsibilities of the two primary  responsible agencies\u2014FEMA and the Red Cross. However, the  responsibilities described for the support agencies\u2014the Departments of  Agriculture, Defense, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and  Veterans Affairs\u2014did not, and still do not, fully reflect their capabilities.  Further, these support agencies had not, at the time of our work,  developed fact sheets describing their roles and responsibilities,  notification and activation procedures, and agency-specific authorities, as  called for by ESF-6 operating procedures. Our February 2007 report  recommended that the support agencies propose revisions to the NRP that  fully reflect each respective support agency\u2019s capabilities for providing  temporary housing under ESF-6, develop the needed fact sheets, and  develop operational plans that provide details on how their respective  agencies will meet their temporary housing responsibilities. The  Departments of Defense, HUD, Treasury, and the Veterans Administration,  and Agriculture, concurred with our recommendations. The Red Cross did  not comment on our report or recommendations. As part of a housing task  force, FEMA is currently exploring ways of incorporating housing  assistance offered by private sector organizations. FEMA says it has also  developed a housing portal to consolidate available rental resources for  evacuees from Federal agencies, private organizations, and individuals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Homeland Security: Management and Programmatic Challenges Facing  the Department of Homeland Security.
