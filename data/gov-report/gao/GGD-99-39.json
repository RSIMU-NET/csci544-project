This report provides (1) comparisons of the percentages of FCCs and USCCs that filed income tax returns showing no tax liabilities for 1989 through 1995, the latest years for which data were available, and (2) comparisons of selected characteristics, including age, industrial sector, and certain cost ratios, of large corporations\u2014those with assets of $250 million or more or gross receipts of $50 million or more.", "Our 1995 report and studies by others have suggested that differences in characteristics between FCCs and USCCs may partially explain the difference in their profitability. As in our 1995 report, we focused most of our work on large corporations because large FCCs accounted for more than 80 percent of the assets owned and gross receipts generated by nontaxpaying FCCs.", "The data on taxes paid were obtained from corporate tax returns, as filed, and did not reflect IRS audit results or any net operating loss carrybacks from future years.

FCCs and USCCs may not pay U.S. income tax for a variety of reasons. For instance, some corporations may have zero tax liabilities because of current-year operating losses; losses carried forward from preceding tax years; or sufficient tax credits available to offset tax liabilities. Other corporations may report no taxable income because of the improper pricing of intercompany transactions. Any company that has a related company with which it transacts business needs to establish transfer prices for those intercompany transactions. The pricing of intercompany transactions affects the distribution of profits and ultimately the taxable income of the companies.", "Research efforts have attempted to explain why, on average, USCCs appear to be more profitable than FCCs. Some researchers have concluded that part of the difference is attributable to differences in the characteristics of FCCs and USCCs, while acknowledging that transfer price abuses may also explain some of the difference.", "The 1997 study, for example, focused on why FCCs tended to report a lower ratio of net income to gross receipts\u2014a measure of profitability\u2014 than USCCs did. According to this study, differences in investment income, industrial classification, age, and amount of interest expense explain much of the difference in the profitability between FCCs and USCCs. That study also found that corporations whose largest foreign shareholders owned only 25 to 50 percent of the corporations\u2019 stock had low profitability, which was similar to corporations that were 100-percent owned by a single foreign shareholder. The author suggested that, if income-shifting through transfer price abuses were an important factor in explaining the differences in profitability across corporations, then one would expect single shareholder corporations to be less profitable because they would seem to have less difficulty in shifting income between affiliates. We were unable to identify any studies that were able to control for all potential factors, other than transfer price abuse, that may explain the difference in profitability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our objectives, we obtained data from IRS\u2019 Statistics of Income (SOI) Division on corporate tax returns for 1989 through 1995. We used these data to determine the percentages of corporations that did not pay taxes in each year and to obtain information about their characteristics. We did not audit the SOI data; however, we conducted reliability tests to ensure the consistency of the data with selected FCC and USCC corporate statistics published by the SOI Division.", "In this report, we defined a corporation as being large if its reported total assets in tax year 1995 were at least $250 million or its reported gross receipts totaled at least $50 million. For years preceding tax year 1995, we deflated the $250 million asset and $50 million receipt definition of large corporate size by the gross domestic product price deflator for those years. We made this adjustment in the dollar magnitude of the definition because changing price levels, over time, alter the purchasing power of gross receipts and assets.", "Our report also compares \u201cnew\u201d and \u201colder\u201d corporations. New corporations are those whose income tax returns showed incorporation dates within 3 years of the tax year date. For example, for tax year 1995, new corporations are those with incorporation dates no earlier than 1993. Other corporations are \u201colder\u201d corporations. A limitation on the precision of our comparison between \u201cnew\u201d versus \u201colder\u201d FCCs and USCCs is that the definition of \u201cnew\u201d relies on the dates of incorporation indicated on corporate tax returns. In some cases, corporations that merge may also reincorporate under a new corporate name. While the \u201cnew\u201d entity may represent the combination of two mature corporations, our definition would count them as one \u201cnew\u201d corporation.", "The SOI data in this report are based on SOI\u2019s probability sample of taxpayer returns and thus are subject to some imprecision owing to sampling variability. Using SOI\u2019s sampling weights, we estimated confidence intervals for the percentage of nontaxpaying FCCs and USCCs for tax years 1989 through 1995.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Director of the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis.

Similarly, large nontaxpaying USCCs made up only about four-tenths of 1 percent of all nontaxpaying USCCs, yet they accounted for 80 percent of all nontaxpaying USCC assets. Also in 1995, large nontaxpaying FCCs accounted for 86 percent of the receipts generated by all nontaxpaying FCCs, while large nontaxpaying USCCs accounted for 48 percent of the receipts generated by all nontaxpaying USCCs.

In 1995, the percentage of large FCCs and USCCs that paid less than $100,000 in tax was 42 percent for FCCs and 40 percent for USCCs. In 1995, large FCCs, as a whole, paid significantly less tax per $1,000 in gross receipts than did large USCCs, despite the fact that a greater percentage of large USCCs paid no tax. The reason for this is that the large FCCs that paid relatively little or no tax had significantly greater average gross receipts than did the large USCCs that paid little or no tax.", "An earlier study of the relative profitability of FCCs and USCCs suggested that the lower relative age of FCCs partially explained their lower reported profitability.

The ratio of taxable income per dollar of receipts should be inversely related to the ratio of costs per dollar of receipts. Corporations in the manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade industries, on average, had significantly higher ratios of costs of goods sold to receipts than corporations in the financial and nonfinancial service industries. The largest component of costs of goods sold is purchases from other businesses, which, as table 3 on p. 10 indicates, are relatively unimportant for the two service industries.", "In contrast, corporations in the financial services industry, on average, had significantly higher ratios of interest expenses to receipts. This pattern of differences in cost ratios across industries was similar for both all large FCCs and all large USCCs. The pattern also was similar for large nontaxpaying FCCs and USCCs, with one exception: the ratio of interest expenses to receipts for nontaxpaying USCCs in the financial services sector was not significantly higher than that for nontaxpaying USCCs overall. (See table I.5 in app. I.)", "Wholesale trade, the industry with the highest ratio of costs of goods sold to receipts, had the lowest ratio of taxes paid to receipts, while financial services, the industry with the lowest ratio of costs of goods sold to receipts, had the highest ratio of taxes paid to receipts among the major industries. These relationships were similar for both large FCCs and large USCCs. The fact that a significantly larger percentage of all large USCCs were in the financial services industry and a significantly smaller percentage of them were in the wholesale trade industry (compared to large FCCs) may, in part, explain why the aggregate ratio of taxes paid to receipts, shown in table 3, was significantly higher for USCCs. Nevertheless, within each industry, the ratio of taxes paid to receipts was higher for large USCCs than for large FCCs in 1995. Moreover, in every major industry except the financial services industry, a greater percentage of large FCCs than large USCCs paid no tax at all for all the years that we examined.
