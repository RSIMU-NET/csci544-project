There is congressional concern that the WTO, created in 1995 to administer trade rules, is interfering with this ability. There is also congressional concern that the WTO is not treating the United States fairly in resolving trade remedy disputes. A congressional requester asked GAO to identify trends in WTO trade remedy disputes since 1995, including the outcomes of these disputes and how they affected members' ability to impose trade remedies. The requester also asked GAO to discuss the standards of review that the WTO applies when ruling on trade remedy disputes and to present U.S. agencies' and legal experts' views on the WTO's application of these standards and related trade remedy issues. In their comments on a draft of this report, the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission stated that the report needed to put more emphasis on U.S. agencies' concerns about the potential adverse impact of WTO rulings on the U.S.'s use of trade remedies. The U.S. Trade Representative provided only technical comments on the report. GAO modified the report as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About a third of the cases filed in the WTO dispute settlement system from 1995 through 2002 challenged members' trade remedies, with the ratio of such cases increasing over time. Although a relatively small proportion of WTO members' trade remedy measures were challenged in the WTO, the United States faced substantially more challenges than other WTO members. The WTO generally rejected members' decisions to impose trade remedies in the 25 trade remedy disputes resolved from 1995 through 2002. However, GAO found that the WTO ruled for and against the U.S. and other members in roughly the same ratios. Overall, WTO rulings resulted in few changes to members' laws, regulations, and practices but had a relatively greater impact on those of the United States. While U.S. agencies stated that WTO rulings have not yet significantly impaired their ability to impose trade remedies, they had concerns about the potential future adverse impact of WTO rulings. Of the legal experts GAO consulted, a majority concluded that the WTO has properly applied standards of review and correctly ruled on major trade remedy issues. However, a significant minority strongly disagreed with these conclusions. U.S. agencies also said that the WTO has not always properly applied the standards and has, in some cases, imposed obligations on members that are not found in WTO agreements. Nonetheless, the experts almost unanimously agreed that the WTO was not treating the United States any differently than other members."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides the institutional framework  for the multilateral trading system. Established in January 1995, the WTO  administers rules of international trade and provides a forum for  conducting trade negotiations. In addition, the WTO has a dispute  settlement system with panels and an Appellate Body that provides a  multilateral forum for resolving trade disputes among WTO members. A  dispute arises when one WTO member believes another member has  violated a WTO agreement and initiates a dispute settlement proceeding  through the WTO.", "Many disputes in recent years have pertained to WTO members\u2019 use of  trade remedy measures. Members impose trade remedies in the form of  duties or import restrictions after determining that a domestic industry has  been injured or threatened with injury by imports. Specifically, member  governments impose antidumping or countervailing duties when they find  that imports are priced at less than normal value, or benefit from a foreign  subsidy, and that such imports injure their domestic industry. Similarly,  members impose safeguard measures after finding that import surges have  seriously injured or threatened serious injury to domestic industry. The  WTO permits its 146 members to impose such trade remedy measures but  requires them to follow certain rules before doing so, as set forth in various  WTO agreements. Domestic agencies usually make a number of \u201cdomestic  agency determinations.\u201d When a trade measure is challenged in the WTO  dispute settlement system and a dispute settlement panel is established,  the panel reviews the domestic agency determinations supporting the  measure to determine whether they are consistent with the relevant WTO  agreements. In addition to cases challenging WTO members\u2019 domestic  determinations to impose specific trade remedy measures, WTO members  sometimes directly challenge other members\u2019 trade remedy laws.", "Over the past several years, Congress has raised concerns that some WTO  panel and Appellate Body rulings have adversely affected the U.S.\u2019s ability  to impose trade remedy measures. For example, in the Trade Act of 2002,  Congress voiced concern about certain WTO rulings on trade remedies,  including how the WTO has applied standard of review\u2014that is, how the  WTO evaluates and defers to the factual and legal determinations of WTO  members\u2019 domestic agencies. In addition, some Members of Congress are  concerned that some WTO rulings have created new obligations for WTO  members beyond those found in the WTO agreements. For example, a  Senate report accompanying the Trade Act of 2002 stated that WTO panels  and the Appellate Body have substantially rewritten part of the WTO  Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures in ways that are  disadvantageous to the United States.", "Accordingly, you asked us to conduct a review of WTO dispute settlement  activity during the past 8 years, focusing on trade remedy disputes.

In addition, the new system established a standing Appellate  Body, with the aim of making decisions more stable and predictable.", "The WTO dispute settlement system operates in four major phases:  consultation, panel review, Appellate Body review (when a party appeals  the panel ruling), and implementation of the ruling. To initiate, or file, a  dispute, a WTO member requests consultations with the defending  member. If the parties do not settle the case during consultations, the  complainant may then request that a panel be established. Nonpermanent,  three-person panels issue formal decisions, or reports, for cases that are  appealed; three members of a permanent, seven-member Appellate Body\u2014 comprised of individuals with recognized standing in the field of law and  international trade\u2014review panel findings. The Dispute Settlement Body,  which is comprised of representatives of all WTO members, approves all  final reports, and only a consensus of the members can block decisions.  Thus, no individual member can block a decision.", "When a WTO member challenges a trade remedy measure, the panels and  the Appellate Body apply standards of review, outlined in certain WTO  agreements, to evaluate members\u2019 factual and legal determinations  supporting these measures. In the United States, the Department of  Commerce and the International Trade Commission (ITC) investigate  whether the United States should impose antidumping or countervailing  duties to offset unfair foreign trade practices.

In addition, a majority of the experts who responded  concluded that WTO decisions generally have not added to obligations or  diminished rights of WTO members and that it was appropriate for the  WTO to interpret vague and ambiguous provisions in WTO agreements,  sometimes referred to as \u201cgap filling.\u201d However, a significant minority of  experts strongly disagreed with this view about WTO members\u2019 obligations  and rights and considered gap filling to be inconsistent with several  provisions of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. Regarding specific  rulings, a number of experts cited some safeguard rulings as confusing and  unclear.", "In contrast to the majority views expressed above, the U.S. agencies most  involved in trade remedy activities believed that article 17.6(ii) has been  improperly applied in some trade remedy cases, mainly because the WTO  has not applied article 17.6(ii) in a way that allows for upholding  permissible interpretations of WTO members\u2019 domestic agencies.

Specifically, these  experts maintained that Appellate Body guidance calling for panels to first  apply international rules in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to  interpret provisions of the Antidumping Agreement before they evaluate  the domestic agencies\u2019 legal determinations necessarily leads to only one  interpretation. Consequently, panels never reach the point of applying the  part of article 17.6(ii) that allows for multiple permissible interpretations  and upholding an agency determination that is based on one of these  interpretations. In fact, while several experts mentioned specific rulings  in which panels or the Appellate Body had upheld domestic agency  determinations as permissible, it was unclear whether this was due to these  bodies going through the article 17.6(ii) analysis or solely because they  agreed with the domestic agency. In this regard, in the trade remedy cases  we reviewed, no expert pointed to a clear instance in which a panel first  applied the Vienna Convention, found several permissible interpretations,  and then upheld the agency determination because it was consistent with  one of them. One expert, who was a former U.S. negotiator in the Uruguay  Round, stated that U.S. negotiators in the round had not fully appreciated  how application of the Vienna Convention would limit the possibility of  panels or the Appellate Body finding multiple permissible interpretations of  the Antidumping Agreement.", "Some experts also believed that panels and the Appellate Body have not  applied the legal standard of review in article 17.6(ii) in the deferential way  intended by the United States, as expressed in the U.S. Statement of  Administrative Action (SAA) accompanying the U.S. Uruguay Round  Agreements Act. The SAA describes article 17.6 as a special standard of  review analogous to the deferential standard applied by U.S. courts in  reviewing actions by the Commerce Department and the ITC, commonly  referred to as the Chevron standard. Thus, from the U.S. perspective,  article 17.6 was intended to ensure that WTO panels neither second-guess  the factual conclusions of domestic agencies, even when panels might have  reached a different conclusion, nor rewrite, under the guise of legal  interpretation, the provisions of the Antidumping Agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Majority Said WTO Did Not Exceed Its Authority in Applying Standard of Review", "paragraphs": ["Despite the concerns expressed above, the majority of the experts with  whom we spoke indicated that the panels and the Appellate Body generally  had not exceeded their authority in applying the standards of review in  articles 11 and 17.6 in the trade remedy cases we reviewed.

Several of this  group even questioned whether article 11 was intended to be a standard of  review provision at all and, if it was, that it did not intend the same level of  deference as article 17.6. Majority support for how panels and the  Appellate Body applied the legal standard in article 17.6(ii) included  experts who thought the panels and the Appellate Body had generally  applied the article correctly and provided the right amount of deference,  those who believed the article was not particularly deferential, and those  who considered the article to primarily set forth a method for interpreting  provisions of the Antidumping Agreement rather than for conferring  deference. Finally, a number of experts, including a few with divergent  opinions about whether the legal standard in article 17.6(ii) had been  properly applied, stated that evaluation of panel and Appellate Body  decisions should focus on their substantive rulings and not the technical  issue of standard of review.", "A majority of experts also maintained that the United States was not  successful in getting the standard of review it wanted in the Antidumping  Agreement and that the SAA only expresses the U.S.\u2019s view about the intent  of article 17.6.

Several experts also were emphatic in  describing the WTO as a plaintiff\u2019s court in trade remedy cases and pointed  out that in nearly all trade remedy decisions and all the safeguards  decisions we reviewed, respondents were asked to take some action\u2014for  example, to ensure that a safeguard measure was applied consistent with  the Safeguards Agreement. When asked why respondents usually lose trade  remedy cases, some experts cited a WTO free trade bias or bias against  trade remedies as the principal reason. Several others said that WTO  members only bring trade remedy actions in the WTO that they are  confident they can win. As to why the United States was the most frequent  defendant in trade remedy cases, several experts mentioned the fact that  the United States was the biggest market as well as the biggest user of trade  remedies.

Furthermore, they believed that the WTO had engaged in improper gap  filling in its rulings regarding the aforementioned issues, including  privatization. They said that WTO provisions on these issues were unclear  and that privatization was not specifically referred to in the Subsidies and  Countervailing Measures Agreement.

Some in this group were concerned that the rulings seemed to  require a quantitative analysis of each factor causing serious injury to  domestic industry to ensure the factors were not being improperly  attributed to increased imports, and several questioned whether domestic  agencies could perform this kind of analysis. The experts also had  concerns about how domestic agencies could implement the Appellate  Body rulings on the issue of unforeseen developments. Specifically, they  were unsure how WTO members would show that increased imports  causing serious injury resulted from developments they had not foreseen  when they made tariff concessions or assumed other obligations under  GATT.

The report  mentioned the rulings on facts available, unforeseen developments,  nonattribution, and several others as examples. The report qualified these  criticisms by stating that not all of the WTO findings it cited were based on  a problematical analytical approach or that the WTO would have  necessarily found in favor of the United States had the proper approach  been used. Nevertheless, the report emphasized that the problematic  findings were troubling due to their lack of grounding in the texts of the  negotiated agreements.", "During the course of our work, the Commerce Department and ITC  officials reiterated these concerns.

In these  officials\u2019 view, the WTO has not allowed for more than one permissible  interpretation of the relevant provisions. In this regard, the United States  recently proposed that article 17.6 be considered as a topic for discussion  in the Negotiating Group on Rules in the ongoing WTO negotiations.

First, it emphasized the potential future impact of WTO trade  remedy rulings on the U.S.\u2019s ability to impose trade remedies, noting that  this potential is far more significant than these rulings\u2019 limited impact to  date. Commerce cited, in particular, the possible negative ramifications of  two WTO rulings. Specifically, it said that the ruling on privatization could  impact a significant number of U.S. countervailing duty orders, and that as  a result of the EU bed linen ruling, the EU has recently challenged more  than 20 U.S. antidumping investigations and reviews. As a result of this  increased emphasis, we modified the sections of this report that present  U.S. agency views on the potential future ramifications of WTO decisions  on the U.S.\u2019s ability to impose trade remedies.

First, the ITC  said that the report understated the full effect of WTO rulings on the ability  of the United States to impose and maintain trade remedy measures in that  the full effect of WTO rulings likely has not yet been realized, citing for  example several systemic WTO requirements for safeguard determinations.  In response to this comment as well a similar comment from the  Commerce Department, we modified the relevant sections of the report as  discussed above and used examples that the ITC cited. Second, the ITC did  not agree that WTO panels and the Appellate Body have properly applied  the standard of review in article 17.6(ii) of the Antidumping Agreement.

For example, USTR noted that the term \u201cdomestic  determination\u201d usually connotes a final decision by the appropriate agency  as to whether dumping has occurred or whether increased imports have  caused injury or are threatening injury to domestic industry. Accordingly,  we clarified our definition in this report and made other technical changes  as appropriate. USTR also noted that U.S. trade remedy measures had been  challenged more frequently than those of other WTO members in part  because U.S. trade remedy laws and investigations are more transparent.

Our report presents data on changes to WTO members\u2019 laws,  regulations, and practices that have resulted from WTO rulings through  December 2002.  The data clearly indicate there have been few changes  in WTO members\u2019 laws, regulations, and practices to date.", "2.", "In response to the Commerce Department\u2019s (and the ITC\u2019s)  comment(s), we modified our characterization of U.S. agency views on  the impact of WTO rulings on the U.S.\u2019s ability to impose trade  remedies.  The sections of this report that provide U.S. agencies\u2019  viewpoints now reflect the agencies\u2019 increased emphasis on the  potential future ramifications of WTO decisions indicated by the  Commerce Department (and ITC).  3. The Commerce Department states that our report\u2019s presentation  implies that the impact of the WTO dispute settlement system on  members\u2019 ability to impose trade remedies must be small based on  statistical information we present.  However, our report simply  provides data on the number of WTO members\u2019 measures that were  notified to the WTO from 1995 through 2002 and the number that were  challenged.  Moreover, we have modified the report to reflect agency  concerns about the impact of the dispute settlement system on  members\u2019 ability to impose trade remedies.  4. While our report provides aggregate data on the number of trade  remedy measures imposed by all WTO members from 1995 to 2002, it  was beyond the scope of our review to analyze trends in the growth of  these measures for individual WTO members and reasons for the  challenges to these measures.  5. While the Commerce Department raised concerns regarding the  composition of the group of legal experts we consulted, we believe that  our methodology for selecting these experts as outlined in appendix I is  sound.  As noted, we selected individuals who were identified as  leading experts on WTO dispute settlement.  These individuals\u2014 academics, practitioners, and advisors on WTO-related trade remedy  issues\u2014have been active in writing and/or speaking about issues  pertaining to WTO dispute settlement.  Moreover, the Commerce  Department\u2019s assertion that we only included three experts  representing domestic petitioners\u2019 interests is incorrect.  Although we  did not choose experts on the basis of their expressed views because  we believe that approach would have been methodologically flawed,  our information indicates that of the nine practitioners we interviewed,  three represent domestic petitioners, three represent foreign  respondents, and three represent both.  Nevertheless, in responding to  agency comments, we reviewed our decision rule on the composition of  the group of experts we consulted.  Subsequently, we excluded the  views of the current WTO official and the EU representative from our  discussion of expert views since we did not include current U.S.  officials in this group.  However, we briefly noted the views of the  current WTO and EU officials.  6. While we believe that our report sufficiently emphasizes the concerns  of the minority of experts regarding standards of review and the other  trade remedy issues discussed in this report, we have made  modifications to the relevant sections of our report to ensure that  majority positions and minority concerns are presented in a balanced  manner. 7.
