This report looks at SSA's ability to stay current with future reviews, identifies potential improvements to the review process, and assesses the review process--return-to-work link."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SSA will likely face a backlog of about 200,000 continuing disability review (CDR) cases by the end of fiscal year 2003. SSA officials attribute the pending backlog to its decision to reduce the number of cases reviewed as a result of the delay in obtaining fiscal year 2003 funding. In addition, the pending backlog resulted from putting more emphasis on initial applications over CDRs. To ensure CDRs receive adequate attention, SSA has requested some fiscal year 2004 funds be \"earmarked\" for these reviews. Given SSA's ability to eliminate its previous CDR backlog using targeted funds, this maneuver could help SSA. Over the next 5 years, SSA has estimated that 8.5 million CDRs, costing about $4 billion, are needed to stay current. If SSA generates another backlog, cost savings and program integrity may be compromised by paying benefits to disability beneficiaries who are no longer eligible to receive them. SSA is not making the best use of available information when conducting its CDRs, leaving opportunities for improvement. First, SSA's decisions on the timing of CDRs are not based on systematic analysis of available information. Second, SSA's process for determining which CDR method to use is not always based on the best available information. For example, SSA requires an in-depth review for all beneficiaries who, upon entering the program, are expected to medically improve even if current information on certain of those beneficiaries indicates that improvement is unlikely and that the review would be better handled through a shorter, less expensive method. Third, SSA has not fully pursued medical treatment data available from the Medicare and Medicaid programs despite their potential to improve SSA's decisions regarding which review method to use. Fourth, SSA's CDRs continue to be hampered by missing or incomplete information on beneficiaries' case history. SSA delays the provision of new return-to-work benefits to beneficiaries expected to medically improve based on the assumption that such beneficiaries are least likely to need them. However, according to SSA data, about 94 percent of such beneficiaries are not found to have medically improved upon completion of a disability review. As a result, some individuals who might benefit from return-to-work services are initially denied access to them. SSA is reviewing this policy and while doing so, will need to consider how to best balance its financial stewardship and return-to-work goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  programs are the largest federal income programs for disabled individuals,  paying about $86 billion to about 10 million disabled beneficiaries in 2002.  These programs have been growing in recent years and are poised to grow  further as the baby boom generation ages. To help ensure that only eligible  beneficiaries remain on the rolls, the Social Security Administration (SSA)  is required by law to conduct continuing disability reviews (CDR) for all  DI beneficiaries and some SSI disability recipients to determine whether  they continue to meet the disability requirements of the law. In addition, to  assist beneficiaries who want to return to work and leave the disability  rolls, SSA began implementing the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency  Program in 2002. Under this program, beneficiaries are issued a \u201cticket,\u201d or  voucher, which they can use to obtain vocational rehabilitation,  employment, or other return-to-work services from an approved provider  of their choice.", "Through much of the 1980s and 1990s, the Congress and GAO, among  others, emphasized the importance of CDRs for maintaining DI and SSI  program integrity and, consequently, the critical need for SSA to conduct  CDRs when they are due and in a cost-effective manner. However, SSA  had difficulty completing all required CDRs when they were due, which  resulted in the development of an enormous backlog of 4.3 million cases.  In 1996, the Congress, in response to these difficulties, authorized funding  targeted exclusively for CDRs from fiscal year 1996 through 2002 to  eliminate the CDR backlog and conduct new CDRs as they became due.", "At the time beneficiaries enter the DI or SSI programs or continue their  benefits following a CDR, state-based Disability Determination Services  (DDS) determine beneficiaries\u2019 due date for a CDR based on their  potential for medical improvement. Beneficiaries classified as \u201cmedical  improvement expected\u201d are generally scheduled for a CDR within 6 to   18 months, beneficiaries classified as \u201cmedical improvement possible\u201d are  scheduled once every 3 years, and beneficiaries classified as \u201cmedical  improvement not expected\u201d are scheduled once every 5 to 7 years. Once  the date for a review arrives, SSA compiles information such as age, length  of time on the rolls, and qualifying medical condition to determine if it  would be cost-effective to complete the CDR based on information  reported by the beneficiary on a mailed-out questionnaire (\u201cmailer\u201d). In  instances where SSA determines it is best to examine the beneficiary in  person, SSA sends the beneficiaries\u2019 case file to the DDS for a full medical  review.", "To reduce work disincentives and address some beneficiaries\u2019 fear that  any work activity could result in the termination of their benefits through  a CDR, the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program prohibits SSA  from conducting CDRs for beneficiaries who are using a ticket. However,  SSA has decided that it will not issue a ticket to beneficiaries who are  expected to medically improve until their first CDR is completed. SSA  believes these beneficiaries do not require assistance to return to work.  But some disability advocates and policy experts believe that beneficiaries  expected to medically improve could benefit from early ticket services  and, therefore, should not be subject to restrictions on ticket issuance.", "Given the importance of CDRs in ensuring program integrity and  determining beneficiary eligibility for assistance under the ticket program,  the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee  on Ways and Means requested that we review the CDR process. In  response, this report discusses: (1) what impact the expiration of targeted  funding for CDR processing would have on SSA\u2019s ability to remain current  with the CDR caseload, and what level of funding would be needed over  the next 5 years to keep the workload current; (2) what opportunities exist  for SSA to improve the cost-effectiveness of the CDR process; and   (3) whether SSA\u2019s rationale for delaying return-to-work and vocational  services under the ticket program for beneficiaries who are expected to  medically improve is adequately supported by program experience. To  answer these questions, we reviewed SSA documents, including the  agency\u2019s budget request and estimates of the cost and savings from  conducting CDRs. Also, we surveyed 52 DDS directors to assess the  potential effect of the expiration of CDR-targeted funding on DDS  operations. Moreover, we analyzed SSA data on CDR outcomes, reviewed  SSA-contracted studies of the CDR process, examined legislation,  regulations, and SSA policy guidance related to CDRs and the ticket  program, and interviewed SSA officials. We performed our work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards  between August 2002 and May 2003. See appendix I for a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The DI and SSI programs are the two largest federal programs providing  cash assistance to people with disabilities. Established in 1956, DI is an  insurance program that provides monthly cash benefits to workers who  are unable to work because of severe long-term disability. Workers who  have worked long enough and recently enough are insured for coverage  under the DI program. In addition to cash assistance, DI beneficiaries  receive Medicare coverage after they have received cash benefits for   24 months. In 2002, SSA paid about $60 billion to 5.5 million disabled  workers, with average monthly cash benefits amounting to $834 per  person. DI cash benefits are paid from the Federal Disability Insurance  Trust Fund.", "SSI, created in 1972, is a means-tested income assistance program that  provides a financial safety net for disabled, blind, or aged individuals who  have low income and limited resources. Unlike the DI program, SSI has no  prior work requirement and no waiting period for cash or medical  benefits. Eligible SSI applicants generally begin receiving cash benefits  immediately upon entitlement and, in most cases, receipt of cash benefits  makes them eligible for Medicaid benefits. In 2002, about 5.5 million  people with disabilities received SSI benefits. In the same year, federal SSI  cash benefits paid to SSI beneficiaries with disabilities equaled $26 billion,  and average monthly federal SSI cash benefits amounted to about $398 per  person. SSI cash benefits are paid from general tax revenues.", "The DI and SSI programs use the same statutory definition of disability. To  meet the definition of disability under these programs, an individual must  have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) has  lasted or is expected to last at least 1 year or to result in death and   (2) prevents the individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity  (SGA). Individuals are considered to be engaged in SGA if they have  countable earnings above a certain dollar level. Moreover, for a person to  be determined to be disabled, the impairment must be of such severity that  the person not only is unable to do his or her previous work but,  considering his or her age, education, and work experience, is unable to  do any other kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy.  SSA contracts with state DDS agencies to determine whether applicants  are disabled.", "To help ensure that only eligible beneficiaries remain on the rolls, SSA is  required by law to conduct CDRs for all DI beneficiaries and some SSI  disability recipients to determine whether they continue to meet the  disability requirements of the law. In 1980, because of concerns about the  effectiveness of the CDR process and growing disability rolls, the  Congress enacted a law requiring that CDRs be conducted at least once  every 3 years for all DI beneficiaries whose disabilities are not considered  permanent and at intervals determined appropriate by SSA for DI  beneficiaries whose impairments are considered permanent. SSA issued  regulations in 1986 stating its policy of conducting CDRs for SSI disability  beneficiaries with the same frequency as it conducts CDRs for DI  beneficiaries. In 1994, the Congress established the first statutory  requirement for SSI CDRs, requiring that CDRs be conducted for a  relatively small proportion of SSI beneficiaries. Welfare reform legislation  enacted in August 1996 focused on CDRs for SSI children. This legislation  required that SSA (1) conduct CDRs at least once every 3 years for SSI  children under age 18 if their impairments are not considered permanent  and for infants during their first year of life if they are receiving SSI  benefits due to low birth weight and (2) review the cases of all SSI  children beginning on their 18th birthdays to determine whether they are  eligible for disability benefits under adult disability criteria. The  redeterminations for 18-year-olds are considered part of the CDR  workload."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CDR Process", "paragraphs": ["At the time beneficiaries enter the DI or SSI programs, DDSs determine  when beneficiaries will be due for CDRs on the basis of their potential for  medical improvement. Based on SSA regulations, DDSs classify  individuals into one of three medical improvement categories, called  \u201cdiary categories\u201d: \u201cmedical improvement expected\u201d (MIE), \u201cmedical  improvement possible\u201d (MIP), or \u201cmedical improvement not expected\u201d  (MINE). Based on the diary categories, DDSs select a \u201cdiary date\u201d for each  beneficiary, which is the date that the beneficiary is scheduled to have a  CDR. The diary date is generally within 6 to 18 months if the beneficiary is  classified as MIE; once every 3 years if classified as MIP; and once every   5 to 7 years if classified as MINE. Upon completion of a CDR, DDSs  reassess the medical improvement potential of beneficiaries who remain  eligible for benefits to determine the most appropriate medical  improvement category and time frame for conducting the next CDR.  Beneficiaries classified as MIE are not eligible to receive Ticket to Work  services until either the completion of their first CDR, or until they have  received benefits for 3 years.", "While SSA uses diary categories to determine the timing of CDRs, it has  developed another method, called profiling, to determine the most cost- effective method of conducting a CDR. Profiling involves the application  of statistical formulas that use data on beneficiary characteristics  contained in SSA\u2019s computerized records\u2014such as age, impairment type,  length of time on disability rolls, previous CDR activity, and reported  earnings\u2014to predict the likelihood of medical improvement and,  therefore, of benefit cessation. For example, SSA found that the longer an  individual is on the disability rolls, the less likely he or she is to have  benefits terminated. In addition, once an individual undergoes a CDR, the  chance that a new CDR will result in benefit termination is reduced  substantially. Reported earnings, on the other hand, greatly increase the  likelihood of termination.", "Through its profiling formulas, SSA assigns a \u201cscore\u201d to beneficiaries  indicating whether there is a high, medium, or low likelihood of medical  improvement. In general, beneficiaries with a high score are referred for  full medical reviews\u2014an in-depth assessment of a beneficiaries\u2019 medical  and vocational status\u2014while beneficiaries with lower scores are, at least  initially, sent a questionnaire, known as a \u201cmailer.\u201d The mailer consists of  a short list of questions asking beneficiaries to report information on their  medical conditions, treatments, and work activities. If beneficiaries\u2019  responses to a mailer indicate possible improvement in medical condition  or vocational status, SSA may refer these individuals for a full medical  review. However, in most cases, SSA decides that a full medical review is  not warranted and that benefits should be continued.", "In contrast to mailers, full medical reviews are labor intensive and  expensive. These reviews generally involve the following steps: (1) SSA  headquarters personnel determine that a CDR is due and notify the SSA  processing center; (2) personnel at the processing center locate the  beneficiary\u2019s file and send it to the appropriate SSA field office; (3) field  office personnel contact the beneficiary, conduct a lengthy interview, and  send the file to the appropriate DDS; (4) the DDS requests medical records  from the beneficiary\u2019s physicians and other medical sources and, if these  sources cannot provide sufficient evidence, schedules medical or  psychological examinations with consulting physicians outside the DDS;  and (5) a DDS team, consisting of a disability examiner and a physician or  psychologist, determines whether the beneficiary continues to meet SSA  disability criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDR Backlog", "paragraphs": ["As of fiscal year 1996, about 4.3 million CDRs were due or overdue.

No. 104-121), the Congress authorized a total of about   $4.1 billion to fund the 7-year CDR plan. In addition, The Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Pub. L.  No. 104-193) required SSA to conduct CDRs on several beneficiary groups,  such as low birth weight babies and authorized an additional $250 million  for CDRs in fiscal years 1997 and 1998.

SSA attributes the mounting backlog to the management decisions it made  at the beginning of the fiscal year during budget deliberations, as well as  the need to process a larger than expected workload of initial disability  applications. SSA has estimated that it will need a total of about $4 billion  to process its projected CDR workload over the next 5 years.

However, most of the backlogged  claims will consist of SSI CDRs, which may make the backlog less  problematic than it otherwise would have been because, among other  reasons, SSI CDRs have lower long-term savings than DI CDRs. In its fiscal  year 2003 budget justification, SSA indicated that it needed to process  about 1.38 million CDRs during fiscal year 2003 to stay current with its  CDR workload. Yet, SSA expects to process a total of 1.18 million CDRs, if  not more, by the end of the fiscal year. By the end of March 2003\u2014the  midpoint of the fiscal year\u2014SSA had processed about 539,000 CDRs. To  reach the 1.18 million end-year revised total, SSA will need to process  CDRs during the second half of the fiscal year at a pace similar to that  achieved during the first 6 months of the fiscal year.

Because of the uncertainty surrounding the  agency\u2019s funding level, SSA reduced the number of CDRs it sent to DDS  officials for processing as well as froze DDS hiring and overtime pay. SSA  officials told us that they took these actions because they were concerned  that the fiscal year 2003 appropriations would not support CDR activity at  the fiscal year 2002 level. SSA officials recognize that a hiring freeze can  have a longer-term impact because it disrupts the normal replacement of  disability examiners lost through attrition. SSA officials explained that  disability examiners generally do not increase overall productivity when  first hired. In fact, new disability examiners could initially decrease  productivity because experienced examiners may devote some of their  time to training these new examiners. SSA officials noted that it generally  takes 1 to 2 years before disability examiners become proficient.", "SSA\u2019s management strategy to cut back on the number of CDRs it  processed during the delays to the extended fiscal year 2003 budget  process reflects the agency\u2019s higher priority for processing of initial  applications for disability benefits. Specifically, while SSA cut back on the  number of CDRs, no similar action was reported with DI and SSI initial  eligibility decision making. SSA officials indicated that the application rate  for disability benefits increased during the beginning months of fiscal year  2003, further affecting its ability to stay current with CDRs. SSA officials  told us that although SSA sets a goal to process all CDRs and initial  applications, initial eligibility decisions are given the highest priority.  Officials said that, due to political pressure, getting disability benefits to  people in a timely manner is emphasized over reviewing whether current  beneficiaries remain eligible for benefits. DDSs, likewise, place a greater  priority on processing initial applications. Three-fourths (75 percent) of  directors said processing initial disability claims were a top priority  relative to CDRs, whereas far fewer directors (23 percent) said that  processing initial claims and CDRs were equal priorities.", "SSA has recently proposed an approach to avoid this competition between  CDRs and initial claims. Specifically, in SSA\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget  request, the Commissioner requested that almost $1.5 billion be earmarked  for three activities that could provide a return on investment\u2014CDRs, SSI  nondisability redeterminations, and overpayment workloads. While we  did not review the sufficiency of the level of this request, the earmarking  of funds for activities such as CDRs could help SSA keep current with  these activities. For example, if the number of initial applications for  disability benefits continues to increase over the next several years,  holding apart the necessary funds for CDRs could be a prudent measure.", "SSA has indicated in its annual CDR reports, as well as in its performance  and accountability report, that its ability to complete all CDRs as they  become due in the future is dependent upon adequate funding. In   2000, SSA estimated that a total of about $4 billion was needed to process  the CDR workload during the 5-year period between fiscal year 2004 and  2008 (see table 1). SSA based these \u201crough estimates\u201d on cost and  workload projections available at that time. SSA expects to release  updated workload and cost projections in the summer of 2003. While the  estimates made in 2000 are not inconsistent with recent years\u2019 authorized  CDR funding levels, they rely upon assumptions that may change in the  years ahead. For instance, the updated numbers for the fiscal year 2004 to  2008 period will likely be higher than the past estimate for this time period  because of the recent growth in the disability rolls.", "Despite the likely reemergence of a CDR backlog, the characteristics of  the backlog may mitigate its negative consequences. During fiscal year  2003, SSA has focused on DI CDRs. SSA officials cite four reasons for this:  (1) cessations of beneficiaries receiving DI benefits lead to higher savings  than cessations of recipients receiving SSI benefits, (2) SSA desires to  protect the DI trust fund, (3) legislation sets out a clearer mandate to  complete CDRs on beneficiaries receiving DI benefits than for adult  beneficiaries receiving SSI benefits, and (4) external auditors cite SSA for  noncompliance with the law when SSA does not complete the required  CDRs for DI beneficiaries.", "As a result, most of the backlog that is expected to reemerge by the end of  fiscal year 2003 will likely consist of SSI CDRs and, according to SSA  officials, this makes the backlog less problematic than if the backlog  consisted of mostly DI cases.

Another benefit derived from a more  systematic approach to diary categorization, according to SSA\u2019s study, is  improved integrity of the diary process. Such integrity improvements will  result from more timely CDRs and from actual medical improvement rates  that more closely correlate with the diary categories that SSA assigns to  beneficiaries.

In the 1990s, SSA introduced a  system that develops a \u201cprofile score\u201d for each beneficiary. The profile  score indicates the beneficiary\u2019s likelihood for medical improvement  based on a statistical analysis of beneficiary data. The purpose of the  profile score is to allow SSA to determine whether it is more cost-effective  to send a mailer or to conduct a full medical review. SSA\u2019s own contracted  studies indicate that profiling results provide the best available indication  of whether a beneficiary is likely to medically improve. Nevertheless, for  some beneficiaries, SSA continues to use the diary category that was  judgmentally assigned by DDS personnel as the basis for their decision  about whether to send a mailer or conduct a full medical review.", "SSA requires a full medical review for all beneficiaries whose diary  category indicates that medical improvement is expected (MIE) and who  have not yet undergone a CDR. This is the case even when the profile  score indicates that improvement is unlikely. In fiscal year 2002, about   14 percent of beneficiaries in the MIE diary category were assigned to the  \u201clow\u201d profile category, which indicates that medical improvement is not  likely. SSA officials acknowledged that their policy requiring full medical  reviews for all beneficiaries in this diary category departs from their usual  practice of using mailers for beneficiaries in the low profile category, but  they believe that this policy is reasonable given that these beneficiaries are  more likely to medically improve than those assigned to other diary  categories. However, SSA\u2019s data from 1998 to 2002 shows that most  beneficiaries in this category\u2014about 94 percent\u2014do not medically  improve to the point of being able to work.", "For other CDR cases, SSA may require that a mailer be sent even when the  profile score indicates that conducting a full medical review would be  most cost-effective. Specifically, SSA\u2019s policy is to send a mailer to all  beneficiaries who were assigned a diary category that indicates medical  improvement is not expected (MINE), even if the profile score indicates a  relatively high likelihood of medical improvement. Whether or not these  beneficiaries subsequently receive a full medical review will be based on  the results of their mailer. SSA officials said that MINE beneficiaries with a  high profile score are more likely to receive a full medical review based on  their mailer responses because SSA conducts a more stringent review of  their mailer responses. However, it is not clear that sending mailers to  beneficiaries in the high profile category is the most cost-effective  approach. SSA studies of the mailer process have indicated that, while this  process is effective, it does not provide the same assurance as full medical  reviews that medical improvement will be identified. As a result, the use of  mailers for beneficiaries whose profile scores indicate a high likelihood of  improvement could result in SSA identifying fewer benefit cessations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Has Not Fully Studied and Pursued the Use of Medical Treatment Data from Medicare and Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["SSA has not fully studied and pursued the use of medical treatment data  on beneficiaries available from the Medicare and Medicaid programs  despite the potential of these data to improve SSA\u2019s decisions regarding  whether to use a mailer or full medical review to complete a CDR.

Based on these results, SSA, in fiscal year 2003,  implemented a process that uses CMS Medicare data in CDR profiling to  determine if DI beneficiaries who are initially identified as candidates to  receive a full medical review should instead receive mailers. SSA expects  that this will result in administrative savings due to the reduced number of  full medical reviews the agency must conduct. SSA has also initiated a  study to assess whether CMS Medicaid data can be used in the same way  to decide if SSI beneficiaries, scheduled to receive full medical reviews,  could instead be sent mailers.", "But SSA\u2019s efforts to obtain and use CMS Medicare or Medicaid data are  incomplete because the data will only be used to reclassify full medical  reviews to mailers but not to reclassify mailers to full medical reviews.  SSA officials told us that they have no plans to pursue this additional use  of the data because they believe their current profiling system is sufficient  for identifying beneficiaries who have a low likelihood of medical  improvement. While they agreed that the CMS data could potentially be  useful for reclassifying mailers to full medical reviews, they noted that  they would need to first study this particular use of the data and would  need to develop another interagency agreement with CMS to authorize and  obtain data for this purpose. Also, they said that any action to reclassify  mailers to full medical reviews would require SSA to publish a Federal  Register notice describing this action.", "SSA could potentially achieve substantial program savings from  conducting additional full medical reviews in cases where CMS data  indicate that beneficiaries originally identified as mailer candidates have a  relatively high likelihood of medical improvement. Using CMS Medicare  data for this purpose would be consistent with the results of an SSA study  that recommended that these data be used whenever it improves the  agency\u2019s ability to accurately predict medical improvement. For example,  the study noted that the CMS data would be useful for enhancing SSA\u2019s  profiling of beneficiaries with mental impairments, including those with a  low likelihood of medical improvement for whom SSA would usually send  a mailer. To the extent that CMS data improves SSA\u2019s ability to identify  beneficiaries for full medical review, the program savings from reduced  lifetime benefit payments to those beneficiaries whose benefits are ceased  could easily exceed any increased administrative costs resulting from  additional full medical reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missing or Incomplete Case Folders May Result in Fewer Benefit Cessations", "paragraphs": ["SSA continues to be hampered in its CDR decisions by missing or  incomplete information on beneficiaries\u2019 case history, which may prevent  SSA from ceasing benefits for some individuals who no longer qualify for  benefits. To cease benefits based on a CDR, SSA must determine if the  beneficiary has improved by comparing information about the  beneficiary\u2019s current condition to information from the agency\u2019s previous  decision regarding the beneficiary\u2019s medical condition. This previous  decision and the evidence supporting it are recorded by SSA and  maintained in case folders that are usually stored in SSA records storage  facilities. However, in conducting CDRs, DDSs sometimes have difficulty  retrieving the case folders or the key medical evidence that is maintained  in these folders.", "Without the information contained in case folders, DDSs cannot establish  a comparison and, therefore, cannot determine if medical improvement  has occurred. As a result, SSA is legally required to keep the beneficiary on  the disability rolls even though the beneficiary may have been judged to no  longer qualify for benefits had the DDS been able to establish a  comparison. SSA\u2019s inability to cease benefits in cases where folders are  missing or incomplete could result in a substantial cost to the federal  government arising from continued payments of benefits\u2014cash and  medical\u2014to people who no longer meet eligibility standards.", "Our discussions with SSA officials, survey of DDSs, and review of SSA  studies indicate that missing or incomplete folders present an obstacle to  effective processing of CDRs. However, evidence on the extent of this  problem is mixed. In responding to our survey on CDRs, about 72 percent  of DDSs informed us that missing or incomplete information from case  folders negatively impacted the quality or timing of CDR decisions to a  moderate or great extent. An August 2002 study of missing or incomplete  folders conducted by SSA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reported that  DDSs, as well as other SSA components such as field offices, complained  that a large proportion of cases were missing information. This study  found that case folder retrieval is a significant problem for SSA. Among  the problems identified were untimely receipt of case folders, nonreceipt  of requested folders, and folders provided without necessary medical  evidence. The report questioned SSA\u2019s oversight of folder inventory and  retrieval processes and recommended that SSA take various actions, such  as independent quality assurance reviews, to improve management of case  folders. A study contracted by SSA also identified problems with disability  case folder management, such as misrouted or missing folders. The study  noted that \u201cinefficient folder management increases administrative and  program costs and risks data integrity\u201d and recommended that SSA  \u201canalyze the reasons for missing folders and provide recommendations for  process and systems improvements.\u201d", "SSA headquarters officials we spoke with said that SSA has examined the  incidence of missing or incomplete case folders and found that the  problem is not as significant as claimed by DDSs. For example, in fiscal  year 2000, SSA investigated allegations of substantial numbers of missing  case folders in two DDSs. SSA officials told us that they were able to  locate many of the folders that had been reported as missing. The officials  attribute the discrepancy between their findings and the allegations of  DDSs, in part, to staff shortages and workload pressures at field offices,  which result in a failure of these offices to take further steps to look for  folders. However, our survey of DDSs indicates that regardless of SSA\u2019s  ability to locate many case folders upon further investigation, DDSs are  still having difficulty obtaining the information they need to make CDR  decisions.", "In a 2002 memorandum to SSA\u2019s Inspector General, the SSA Commissioner  acknowledged that missing or incomplete case folders are a problem in  the CDR process, but noted that the problem had been overstated. The  memorandum cited data indicating a lost folder rate of about 0.5 percent  for DI CDRs and about 3 percent for SSI CDRs. The Commissioner also  said that SSA had taken a number of actions in recent years to reduce the  incidence of lost folders, such as issuance of additional guidance and  training on this issue. In addition, the Commissioner noted that the agency  was committed to building a system of electronic folders that will  \u201cvirtually eliminate the incidences of lost folders.\u201d While electronic folders  may be a key initiative in resolving SSA\u2019s problems with missing or  incomplete case folders, SSA does not plan to fully implement this system  until mid-2005.

In issuing  regulations implementing the ticket act, SSA decided to postpone issuance  of tickets to MIE beneficiaries who have not yet had a CDR based on the  premise that these beneficiaries could be expected to regain their capacity  to work without SSA assistance. However, our analysis of SSA data  indicates that the vast majority of MIE beneficiaries in the DI and SSI  programs\u2014about 94 percent\u2014are not found to have medically improved  upon completion of a CDR. As a result, some beneficiaries who might  otherwise benefit from potentially valuable return-to-work assistance must  wait up to 3 years to access services through the ticket program.", "Some disability advocacy groups and SSA\u2019s own Ticket to Work and Work  Incentives Advisory Panel have questioned SSA\u2019s policy of delaying the  issuance of tickets to MIE beneficiaries. In particular, they have  commented that delaying tickets to all MIE beneficiaries when only a  small proportion of these beneficiaries return to work underscores the  inherent weakness of relying upon the MIE category as a basis for granting  access to ticket services. Furthermore, the ticket panel cited research  indicating that the sooner a person with recent work history receives  employment services, the more likely the person will be to return to work.  In our prior work examining DI and SSI return-to-work policies, we also  noted that delays in the provision of vocational rehabilitation services can  diminish the effectiveness of such return-to-work efforts. Delaying  services to some disability beneficiaries, therefore, undermines SSA\u2019s  recent efforts to increase its emphasis on helping these beneficiaries  return to work.", "In publishing its final regulations implementing the ticket program, SSA  wrote that many commenters on the draft regulations had indicated that  the agency should provide tickets to all beneficiaries, regardless of their  diary category. The commenters also referred to the MIE diary category as  an \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d that is \u201cnot a sufficiently precise tool to  deny beneficiaries immediate access to a ticket.\u201d In responding to these  comments, SSA wrote that use of the MIE category to identify which  beneficiaries should receive tickets \u201cis the most administratively feasible  approach currently available to us.\u201d SSA acknowledged that it might be  possible to improve the system for identifying such beneficiaries and  wrote that it planned to conduct an evaluation to identify possible  improvements.", "SSA officials told us that they are examining the current policy of issuing  tickets to MIE beneficiaries to identify possible alternatives but they are  not sure when this assessment will be completed. However, they noted  that their policy of limiting ticket issuance reflects congressional interests  in striking an appropriate balance between program stewardship and  encouraging return to work. Moreover, they explained that reversing the  current policy would be costly. SSA\u2019s actuaries have estimated that issuing  tickets to all MIE beneficiaries would cost an additional $822 million over  10 years because the ticket law prohibits SSA from conducting CDRs on  beneficiaries who are using a ticket. Therefore, SSA would continue to pay  DI and SSI benefits to some beneficiaries who might have otherwise had  their benefits terminated.", "The drawbacks of SSA\u2019s current policy of postponing issuance of tickets to  MIE beneficiaries and the potential costs associated with an alternative  policy that would allow immediate issuance of tickets to these  beneficiaries highlights the need for SSA, as part of its policy  reexamination, to consider other policy alternatives that might better  balance the agency\u2019s program stewardship and return-to-work objectives.  While we did not conduct an in-depth assessment of potential alternatives  to SSA\u2019s current policy, our review of the CDR program and ticket  provisions indicate that other options may exist that would achieve a  better balance among SSA\u2019s program objectives. For example, SSA could  develop a better means of identifying beneficiaries who are expected to  medically improve. Earlier in this report, we noted that an SSA-contracted  study of the diary process recommended implementation of an improved  system that, among other things, would better identify MIE beneficiaries  through statistical modeling of diary decisions. One effect of such  improved identification, according to the study, would be to substantially  reduce the proportion of beneficiaries with an MIE diary category. For  instance, the study found that although SSA, over the past decade, has  assigned the MIE diary category to about 9 percent of DI beneficiaries, a  statistically-based diary process would result in about 3 percent of DI  beneficiaries being assigned to the MIE category. This would potentially  minimize the number of beneficiaries initially denied tickets and may also  provide more assurance, within and outside SSA, that such beneficiaries  can truly be expected to improve.", "SSA might also consider an option that provides for the issuance of tickets  to all MIE beneficiaries while allowing CDRs to be conducted as scheduled  for these beneficiaries. This policy would require a legislative change  because, as we noted earlier, the Ticket to Work Act currently prohibits  SSA from conducting a CDR while a person is using a ticket. While the  ticket program\u2019s prohibition on CDRs for ticket users was intended to  remove a potential disincentive for beneficiaries to return to work, MIE  beneficiaries currently get neither a ticket nor protection from a CDR. A  policy allowing CDRs to be conducted on these beneficiaries while they  use a ticket would at least give these beneficiaries immediate access to  return-to-work services offered under the ticket program. In addition, SSA  would still be able to achieve the cost savings that are derived from CDRs  for beneficiaries that it considers most likely to medically improve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Failure to cost effectively process CDRs as they become due could  negatively affect DI and SSI program integrity. SSA and DDSs are to be  commended for bringing the CDR workload current as of the end of   2002. SSA is also to be commended for the improvements it has made in  the CDR process. However, a confluence of events, such as the expiration  of targeted CDR funding and an increase in initial applications, is  increasing the chances of a CDR backlog recurring, which could result in  SSA paying out billions of dollars in the long term to beneficiaries who no  longer qualify for benefits. In its fiscal year 2004 budget request, SSA has  asked the Congress for targeted funding for several program activities,  including CDRs, that provide a return on investment. If approved, the  targeted funding could increase SSA\u2019s chances of staying current with its  CDR workload because this workload would not have to compete  internally for funding with the initial determination workload.", "While SSA has taken a number of steps to improve the CDR process, it has  not taken advantage of other opportunities that could further improve the  cost-effectiveness of this process and its ability to stay current. In  particular, although a more systematic and quantitative process for  assigning diary categories and dates would likely improve the timing of  CDRs, SSA does not intend to make comprehensive revisions to the diary  process based on this more rigorous approach. In addition, despite SSA\u2019s  reliance on profiling formulas to improve the agency\u2019s ability to predict  medical improvement and benefit cessation, SSA is ignoring or not giving  full consideration to information from these formulas in its decisions to  conduct mailers or full medical reviews for some beneficiaries. Also,  although SSA acknowledges that medical treatment data from Medicare  and, possibly, Medicaid improve the agency\u2019s ability to determine when a  mailer should be used, it does not see a need to consider the use of these  data to help determine when a full medical review might be preferable.  Furthermore, despite long-standing concerns, SSA has not fully addressed  the problem of missing or incomplete case folders, which limits SSA\u2019s  ability to achieve cost savings through the CDR process.", "Finally, SSA\u2019s initial assessments of which beneficiaries are most likely to  improve are not very accurate and, therefore, may not be the most  appropriate criteria to use for delaying beneficiary access to a ticket for  return-to-work services. The ticket program is relatively new so little  program information is available for SSA to draw upon in reexamining its  current policy on ticket access for beneficiaries most likely to improve.

Among such key enhancements would be the use of a statistical approach  to determine diary categories.

For beneficiaries assigned to a diary category  indicating that they are not expected to medically improve, SSA should  conduct a thorough analysis of its current policy, which allows mailers to  be used for all of these beneficiaries regardless of their profile scores.  SSA\u2019s analysis should evaluate the overall cost-effectiveness of this policy,  taking into account both the potential reduction in administrative costs  from conducting fewer full medical reviews and the potential increase in  benefit payments from reduced cessations. If this analysis indicates that  the current policy results in higher overall costs for SSA\u2019s disability  programs, SSA should revise the policy to make it consistent with the  agency\u2019s general profiling approach\u2014which prescribes the use of full  medical reviews in cases where profiling indicates that a beneficiary has a  relatively high likelihood of medical improvement.", "Study the use of Medicare and Medicaid data for the purpose of deciding  whether to use a full medical review in conducting a CDR for beneficiaries  who would otherwise receive a mailer.

SSA noted that its policy for allowing mailers  to be used for all MINE beneficiaries supplements information produced  through profiling, thereby improving the process for selecting a CDR  method. SSA said that this policy is based on evaluation and analysis of  several thousand similar cases and noted that it will verify the cost- effectiveness of this policy through its ongoing integrity reviews. We  continue to believe that any departure from SSA\u2019s analytically-based  process for using profiling scores to select a CDR method should be based  on sound analysis indicating that an alternative process would result in  improved cost-effectiveness. We, therefore, are encouraged by SSA\u2019s plans  to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of its current policy. However, it is not  clear that SSA\u2019s integrity reviews will be adequate for assessing the cost- effectiveness of the agency\u2019s mailer policy for MINE beneficiaries due to  the potential limitations of these reviews. For example, an SSA-contracted  study identified several problems with the integrity reviews that SSA  conducts for beneficiaries in the low profile category, such as the drawing  of integrity samples that are not consistently representative of the mailer  population. To the extent that such problems remain unresolved, SSA may  need to develop an alternative means of evaluating its mailer policy for  MINE beneficiaries.", "With regard to our recommendation on the use of Medicare and Medicaid  data for deciding whether to use a full medical review for beneficiaries  who would have otherwise received a mailer, SSA said that it intends to  contract for such a study in fiscal year 2004 if funding is available.

SSA is apparently  referring to our discussion of the CDR backlog where we note that most of  the backlog that is expected to develop by the end of fiscal year 2003 will  consist of SSI CDRs, which may make the backlog less problematic than it  otherwise would have been because, among other reasons, SSI CDR  cessations have lower long-term savings than DI CDR cessations.
