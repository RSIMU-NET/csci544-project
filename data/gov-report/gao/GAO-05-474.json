These are that Commerce (1) lacks explicit authority to do so, and (2) cannot arrive at meaningful conclusions regarding subsidies in such countries due to government intervention in the economy. Commerce could reclassify China as a market economy or individual Chinese industries as \"market oriented\" and apply CVDs against China as a market economy. Commerce has criteria for such determinations, but said that China is unlikely to satisfy them in the near term. It could also reverse its 1984 position and apply CVDs without any change in China's NME status. However, absent a congressional grant of authority, such a decision could be challenged in court, with uncertain results. World Trade Organization (WTO) rules do not explicitly preclude either alternative. Commerce would face challenges, regardless of the alternative adopted. Chinese subsidies remain difficult to identify and measure. Employing third-country information or \"facts available\" may help, but would not eliminate these difficulties. Commerce lacks clear authority to fully implement China's WTO commitment on use of third-country information in CVD cases. It is unclear whether, on a net basis, applying CVDs would provide greater protection than U.S. producers already obtain from antidumping duties. CVDs alone tend to be lower than antidumping duties. If Commerce grants China market economy status, both CVDs and antidumping duties could be applied simultaneously, but required methodological changes could well reduce antidumping duties. It is not clear whether CVDs would compensate for these reductions. Regardless of China's status, some duties might need to be reduced to avoid double counting of subsidies. Commerce lacks clear authority to make such corrections when domestic subsidies are involved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Imports from China have grown rapidly over the last decade, from a total  value of about $42 billion in 1995 to over $196 billion in 2004.

Similarly, Commerce could no longer apply this methodology  to individual Chinese industries after it found them to be market-oriented  in character. After either finding, Commerce would apply its market  economy approach to calculate antidumping duties. Commerce has never  attempted to calculate antidumping duties on Chinese products based on  prices charged within China. Whether these antidumping duties would be  higher, lower, or approximately the same as those derived through  Commerce\u2019s NME approach remains uncertain.

However, current trade law does not make any specific  provision for adjusting antidumping duties in such situations, and the  implications of such situations arising are therefore unclear.", "When an antidumping duty is calculated using the third-country-based  methodology that Commerce applies to NME countries, the normal value  of the product (the basis for calculating an antidumping duty) is based not  on Chinese prices (which might be artificially low as a result of domestic  subsidies) but on information from a country where prices are determined  by free markets. Thus, when the normal value is compared with the export  price, the difference will, at least in theory, reflect the price advantages that  the exporting company has obtained from both export and domestic  subsidies.", "Economists, trade law practitioners, and Commerce officials we consulted  disagreed on whether, in practice, antidumping duties derived through the  third-country-based methodology effectively offset all of the subsidy  benefits enjoyed by Chinese exporters. However, they generally agreed  that, in theory, antidumping duties derived in this way do offset much of the  value of both export and domestic subsidies.

Therefore, Commerce officials observed that they would have  no choice but to apply both duties without making any adjustments.   While at least two U.S. courts have suggested that double counting to  compensate for the same unfair trade practice is generally considered  improper, they have not ruled on the specific question of whether double  counting of actionable domestic subsidies, in particular, is improper.

It could do this  either by changing China\u2019s NME status, or by changing its current policy  and determining that it may apply CVD law against China regardless of its  NME status. However, Commerce appears unlikely to employ the first  alternative in the near future, and the Georgetown Steel ruling raises an  obstacle to employing the second, without clear authority from Congress.", "While Congress is considering legislation that would authorize Commerce  to apply CVDs to China as an NME country, substantial practical questions  about how such cases would proceed remain unanswered, and the results  that they would produce remain uncertain.

We modified our  report to clarify that Commerce could decide, in response to a petition, that  circumstances warrant and permit a change in its policy. However, given  that Commerce determined in 1984 that it did not have explicit legal  authority to take such an action, and this was subsequently upheld and  affirmed by a federal appeals court, and later confirmed by a 1994  statement of administrative action, we continue to believe that there would  be legal obstacles to Commerce changing its policy.", "With regard to our recommendations, Commerce did not comment on our  recommendation that it analyze and report on its ability to identify and  measure subsidy benefits in China. Commerce believed our recommended  report on the methodologies the department would employ if called upon  to apply CVDs to China would be too speculative, and therefore not  meaningful or appropriate before an actual case was filed, and that such a  report could prejudge the outcome of future actions. We agree that specific  decisions on how best to complete individual CVD actions against China  would depend upon the facts in particular cases. We did not intend that  Commerce provide detailed discussions of how it would respond to  particular sets of circumstances. Rather, this report would provide  Commerce, Members of Congress, and potential parties to CVD cases with  some general-level guidance about how such actions might proceed. For  example, such a report could address Commerce\u2019s use of benchmark  information from within or outside China to measure subsidy benefits and  application of China\u2019s WTO commitment regarding CVD actions involving  state-owned enterprises. Providing broad commentary on such points  would be consistent with Commerce making general guidance on its  antidumping practices publicly available.", "Regarding our matters for congressional consideration, Commerce cited  some legal authority for using external benchmarks in CVD cases.

We were  not convinced that the cited authority would clearly provide for full  implementation of the special methodology in China\u2019s WTO accession  agreement. An explicit grant of authority by Congress would remove doubt  and lesson the chances for legal disputes, and therefore we continue to  believe our suggestion is prudent. Commerce also said our suggestion that  Congress provide Commerce with authority to correct any double counting  of domestic subsidies in companion CVD and antidumping actions was not  warranted or appropriate because Commerce had not yet encountered this  situation, such corrections might be too difficult, and it would put China in  a special category distinct from all other countries. We maintain that our  analysis shows that there is substantial potential for double counting of  domestic subsidies if Commerce applies CVDs to China while continuing to  use its current NME methodology to determine antidumping duties. We  believe that, in such a situation, Commerce should be provided authority to  proactively address potential double counting, rather than waiting for it to  occur and create methodological and legal problems.

We included all countervailing duty  cases over this time period, as well as all antidumping cases in which a  petition was filed by U.S. industry for an antidumping investigation against  a similar product from the same country (e.g., honey from Argentina). Of  the 72 countervailing duty cases from 1995 through 2004, we found only 3  in which a similar antidumping petition was not also filed. Our database  includes information on the outcome of the investigations (e.g., whether an  order was issued), the status of the orders as of the end of 2004, the duty  rates imposed in each case that resulted in a CVD order and the  antidumping duty rates imposed on similar products. For each  countervailing or antidumping duty order, the Department of Commerce  may issue several different duty rates. These may include separate duty  rates for large individual companies (suppliers), as well as weighted  average \u201call others\u201d rates for smaller suppliers. We collected all of these  rates and compared the lowest and highest separate rates, the average of  all separate duty rates, and the \u201call others\u201d rates.

We agree that U.S. trade law does not explicitly bar CVD actions against  NME countries.

It is likely that, absent a clear  grant of authority, such a policy change would result in court  challenges. 2. We do not presume that applying CVD law to China would require that  China be designated a market economy under U.S. antidumping law.

Therefore, congressional action to provide Commerce with  authority to avoid double counting in these instances would be prudent.  We agree that making such adjustments could raise complex  methodological issues. It is for this reason that we recommend that, in  reporting on methodologies for completing CVD actions against China,  Commerce include discussion on responding to potential double  counting of domestic subsidy benefits.
