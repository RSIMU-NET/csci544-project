Thus, federal agencies have many programs that provide services to tribes. However, in 2018, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that, due to a variety of reasons\u2014including historical discriminatory policies, insufficient resources, and inefficient federal program delivery\u2014Native Americans continue to rank near the bottom of all Americans in terms of health, education, and employment. In February 2017 GAO designated federal management of programs that serve tribes in education, health care and energy as high risk. This designation is neither reflective of the performance of programs administered by tribes nor directed at tribal activities.", "This testimony, which is based on reports GAO issued from June 2015 through March 2019 primarily related to education, health care, and energy development, provides examples of (1) capacity and funding constraints and budget uncertainty and (2) management weaknesses that limit the effective delivery of federal programs for tribes and their members."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO previously reported that constraints in federal agency capacity and funding and budget uncertainty limit effective delivery of some federal programs and activities serving tribes.

For example:", "High staff vacancies and insufficient staff capacity. In February 2017, GAO reported that IHS had over 1,550 vacancies for health care positions in 2016, and IHS officials said that the agency's insufficient workforce was the biggest impediment to providing timely primary care. In addition, GAO's March 2019 high-risk update reported that about 50 percent of all BIE positions had not been filled, according to recent BIE documentation.", "Inadequate funding. In January 2019, GAO reported on agency and tribal perspectives on the adequacy of funding and how it impacts federal programs. GAO found that inadequate program funding to meet tribal needs (e.g., BIA estimated a funding shortfall at 60 percent for one program in a 2013 report to Congress) may limit tribal options for administering federal programs using self-determination contracts or self-governance compacts. Many tribal stakeholders told GAO that they supplement federal funding when there are shortfalls, which diverts funding from economic development and services provided to their communities.", "Effects of budget uncertainty. Budget uncertainty arises during continuing resolutions\u2014temporary funding periods during which the federal government has not passed a budget\u2014and during government shutdowns. In a September 2018 GAO report, IHS officials and tribal representatives described the effects of budget uncertainty on their health care programs and operations. GAO reported that these effects include recruitment and retention of staff challenges and additional administrative burden and cost for both tribes and IHS.", "In GAO's prior reports and March 2019 high-risk update, GAO found that management weaknesses at some federal agencies limit the effective delivery of some federal programs serving tribes. For example:", "Oversight weaknesses. In March 2016, GAO found weaknesses in IHS's oversight of timeliness of patient care leading to long wait times at IHS facilities. GAO recommended that IHS develop standards for patient wait times, monitor these wait times, and take corrective action as needed. IHS has established wait times standards and is developing monitoring capacity.", "Management weaknesses . In June 2015, GAO found shortcomings in BIA's management of energy development permitting processes that led to lengthy reviews and negatively impacted energy development on tribal lands. Among other things, GAO recommended that BIA develop a process to track its review and response times. BIA has taken initial steps to develop system enhancements to capture key dates during the review and approval process for energy development documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made more than 50 recommendations related to its high- risk area and more than 40 recommendations for tribal water infrastructure, tribal self-governance and tribal consultation of which 60 recommendations are open.

As Congress found in the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act,  \u201cthrough treaties, statutes, and historical relations with tribes, the United  States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support  Indian tribes and Indians.\u201d As further stated in that Act, the fiduciary  responsibilities of the United States to tribes are also founded in part from  specific commitments made in treaties and agreements, in exchange for  which Indians surrendered claims to vast tracts of land. The act notes that  this history of federal-tribal relations and understandings has benefited  the people of the United States and established \u201cenduring and  enforceable ederal obligations to which the national honor has been  committed.\u201d Federal law directs federal agencies to provide a variety of  services and benefits to Indian tribes and their members.", "However, in a 2018 assessment of whether the federal government was  meeting its responsibilities to tribes, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  found that Native Americans continue to rank near the bottom of all  Americans in terms of health, education and employment. In its  assessment, the commission attributed this disparity in part due to  historical discriminatory policies of the federal government toward tribes,  insufficient resources, and inefficiencies in federal programs that serve  tribes. We have previously reported that agencies can improve the  efficiency of federal programs under which services are provided to tribes  and their members. Such improvements would be consistent with the  expressed view of Congress in the act as to the federal government\u2019s  trust responsibilities and would strengthen the performance and  accountability of the federal government.", "My statement today will focus on examples of (1) capacity and funding  constraints, and budget uncertainty and (2) management practices that  limit the effective delivery of federal programs for tribes and their  members. My statement is based on work we issued from June 2015  through March 2019 related to education, health care, and energy  development programs for tribes and their members designated as high  risk, and other work on tribal water and wastewater infrastructure, tribal  self-governance and tribal consultation. To conduct our previously issued  work, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies;  reviewed agency documentation; and interviewed tribal, federal, and  industry officials. More detailed information on our objectives, scope, and  methodology for that work can be found in the corresponding issued  reports.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have many programs that provide services and benefits  to tribes and their members. For example, the Department of the Interior\u2019s  (Interior) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Office of the Assistant  Secretary-Indian Affairs (Indian Affairs) administers programs in natural  resources management, Indian child welfare, and economic  development\u2014among other responsibilities. One key BIA responsibility is  to facilitate tribes\u2019 development of energy resources on and beneath tribal  lands by reviewing and approving leases, permits, and other documents  required when the lands with Indian energy resources are held in trust or  restricted status. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), also within  Indian Affairs at Interior, administers education programs to  approximately 41,000 students on or near Indian reservations at 185  schools around the country. The Indian Health Service (IHS) within the  Department of Health and Human Services is charged with providing  health care to approximately 2.6 million Indians through more than 600  IHS or tribally operated facilities as of 2019. When services are not  available at these facilities, IHS may pay for services provided through  external providers. In addition, as part of its disease prevention efforts,  IHS provides technical and financial assistance to Indian tribes for the  cooperative development and construction of drinking water and  wastewater systems and support facilities.", "These and other federal programs may also be administered by tribal  governments under a self-determination contract or self-governance  compact under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance  Act of 1975, as amended. BIA and IHS are responsible for administering  self-determination contracts that allow for tribal administration of specific  government programs, including negotiating and approving each contract  and its associated annual funding agreement and disbursing funds to the  tribes. Each federally recognized tribe voluntarily decides whether, and to  what extent, to pursue the administration of federal programs. According  to a 2017 law journal article, by that year, nearly all tribes had used a self- determination contract or self-governance compact to take over the  administration for one or more federal programs.", "In February 2017 we added federal management of programs that serve  tribes and their members to our high-risk list of federal areas that are  most vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement or that are in  need of transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness  challenges. In particular, we found numerous challenges facing BIE and  BIA and IHS in administering education and health care services, that put  the health and safety of American Indians served by these programs at  risk. In addition, we reported that BIA mismanages Indian energy  resources held in trust and thereby limits opportunities for tribes and their  members to use those resources to create economic benefits and  improve the well-being of their communities. Our recommendations  identified in the high-risk area do not reflect the performance of programs  administered by tribes nor are they directed at any tribally operated  programs and activities.", "In our March 2019 high-risk update, we reported that the three agencies  demonstrated progress to partially meet all five criteria for addressing  high-risk issues: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan,  monitoring, and demonstrated progress. We continue to monitor and  report on progress made by the agencies in addressing issues in these  three program areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agency Capacity, Funding Constraints, and Budget Uncertainty Limit Effective Delivery of Some Federal Programs Serving Tribes", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that constraints in federal agency capacity,  funding and budget uncertainty limit effective delivery of some federal  programs for tribes and their members managed by Indian Affairs, BIA,  BIE, IHS, and in other agencies\u2019 tribal consultation activities as shown in  the following examples:", "High staff vacancies. In November 2016, we found BIA had high  vacancy rates at some agency offices and that the agency had not  conducted key workforce planning activities to ensure its workforce  resources are appropriately deployed. We recommended that BIA  establish a documented process for assessing its workforce  composition at agency offices taking into account BIA\u2019s mission,  goals, and tribal priorities. In response to our recommendation, BIA  has taken initial steps to assess its workforce composition; however  more work is needed from BIA to establish a process to regularly  assess its workforce composition and ensure it meets BIA and tribes\u2019  needs. In February 2017 when we added improving federal  management of programs that serve tribes and their members to our  high-risk list, we found that high vacancies or declining staff levels  across all three designated high-risk areas\u2014education, health care,  and Indian energy resources programs. For example, we reported  that IHS had over 1,550 vacancies for various health care positions  nationwide in 2016, and IHS officials said that the agency\u2019s insufficient  workforce was the biggest impediment to providing timely primary  care. IHS has made some progress in demonstrating it has the  capacity necessary to address the program risks we identified in our  reports. For example, among other actions, in January 2019, IHS  established an Office of Quality which includes divisions for Enterprise  Risk Management and Internal Controls, Quality Assurance,  Innovation and Improvement, and Patient Safety and Clinical Risk  Management. As of August 2019, the Office of Quality had filled 14  positions. However, there are still key positions in the agency not yet  permanently filled, including the Director of the Office of Finance and  Accounting and the Deputy Director for Management Operations. In  our August 2018 report, we also found that IHS\u2019s overall vacancy rate  for clinical care providers was 25 percent. Additionally, in our March  2019 high risk update and testimony, we reported that about 50  percent of all BIE positions had not been filled, according to recent  BIE documentation, for a variety of reasons, including difficulty  recruiting qualified individuals.", "Insufficient staff skills or knowledge. We have also identified  concerns about existing staff having the right skills and expertise to  adequately perform job duties for effective implementation of Indian  energy development programs. For instance, in November 2016, we  found that BIA had not completed key workforce planning activities,  such as an assessment of work skills gaps, that contributed to BIA\u2019s  inability to effectively support energy development. We  recommended that BIA incorporate effective workforce planning  standards by assessing critical skills and competencies needed to  fulfill BIA\u2019s responsibilities related to energy development and by  identifying potential gaps. Interior agreed with this recommendation  and in fiscal year 2019, BIA began identifying the skills and  competencies necessary for select Indian energy-related occupations.  BIA officials told us that, once complete, agency officials will be able  to use the catalog of necessary skills and competencies to identify  training needs for existing staff. Additionally, in our March 2019 report  on tribal consultation, 47 of 100 tribes that provided comments to  federal agencies in 2016 identified insufficient agency officials\u2019  knowledge or training on tribal consultation as a key factor that  hinders effective consultation. Several tribal officials we interviewed  shared similar concerns, and officials from 9 of 21 agencies we spoke  with (43 percent) identified staff knowledge or training as a factor that  hinders effective consultation.", "Inadequate funding. We have previously reported on agency and  tribal perspectives on the adequacy of funding and how it impacts  federal programs and also examined spending levels of some  programs. In May 2018, we reported that federal agencies provided  about $370 million to develop, construct, or repair tribal drinking water  and wastewater infrastructure projects to address tribes\u2019 needs in  fiscal year 2016.  This amount is about 11 percent of the more than  $3 billion in total existing tribal drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure needs that IHS had identified that same year. Further,  in January 2019, we found that funding shortfalls\u2014 estimated at 60  percent for one BIA program in a 2013 report to Congress\u2014 may limit  tribal options for administering federal programs using self- determination contracts or self-governance compacts. Many tribal  stakeholders told us that they supplement federal funding when there  are funding shortfalls. As we have previously reported, when tribes  financially supplement the federal program they take over, it diverts  funds away from other economic development opportunities and other  government functions and services they provide to their communities  and citizens. In our March 2019 report on tribal consultation,  according to tribal comments we reviewed and interviews with tribal  officials we found tribes\u2019 ability to participate in consultations is limited  by availability of funding from the tribe, federal agencies, or other  sources. Tribes and agencies both identified insufficient resources,  including funding to support tribes\u2019 participation in consultation  activities, as a key factor hindering effective consultation.", "Effects of budget uncertainty. Budget uncertainty arises during  continuing resolutions\u2014temporary funding periods during which the  federal government has not passed a budget\u2014and during  government shutdowns. Failure to enact annual appropriations for  federal tribal programs in a timely manner may exacerbate the  problem of limited resources. For example, in our September 2018  report examining advance appropriations authority for IHS, IHS  officials and tribal representatives described several effects of budget  uncertainty on their health care programs and operations. Among  other things, we reported that effects of budget uncertainty include (1)  exacerbated challenges related to recruitment and retention of staff,  and (2) additional administrative burden and costs for both IHS and  tribes involved in calculating revised allocations and modification of  hundreds of tribal contracts each time a new continuing resolution is  enacted. IHS officials and tribal representatives said that advance  appropriation authority could mitigate the effects of this uncertainty  because IHS could use this authority to ensure continuity of health  care services during lapses in annual appropriations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Weaknesses at Federal Agencies Hinder Effective Delivery of Some Federal Programs Serving Tribes", "paragraphs": ["In our prior work, we have found a range of management weaknesses  related to internal controls at Indian Affairs, BIA, BIE, and IHS that hinder  effective delivery of some federal programs for tribes as shown in the  following examples:", "Oversight weaknesses. In March 2016, we found that weaknesses  in Indian Affairs oversight led to safety and health deficiencies at BIE  school facilities that endangered students. We recommended that  Indian Affairs ensure that all BIE schools are annually inspected for  safety and health, as required by its policy, and that inspection  information is complete and accurate. Indian Affairs has taken steps  toward implementing our recommendations. For example, in April  2019 Indian Affairs provided documentation that it had assessed the  quality of two fiscal year 2018 BIE safety inspection reports. However,  Indian Affairs has not provided us with documentation that it has  assessed the quality of BIE safety inspection reports for fiscal year  2019\u2014the first year BIE was responsible for inspecting all of its  schools. We believe it is important that the agency demonstrate that  BIE is capable of inspecting all schools for safety in fiscal year 2019  and that they produce inspection reports for schools that are complete  and accurate. As of November 2019, we have not received further  updates from the agency on this recommendation\u2019s status.  Additionally, in March 2016, we reported on weaknesses in IHS\u2019s  oversight of the timeliness of patient care that led to long wait times at  IHS facilities. We found that IHS had not set any agency-wide  standards for patient wait times at IHS federally-operated facilities.  We recommended that IHS (1) develop and communicate specific  agency-wide standards for patient wait times in federally- operated  facilities, and (2) monitor patient wait times and ensure corrective  actions are taken when standards are not met. IHS agreed with our  recommendations and implemented the first recommendation by  publishing patient wait time standards as part of its Indian Health  Manual website in August 2017. As of March 2019, IHS officials said  that the agency was working to implement the second  recommendation by developing system-wide monitoring capacity. We  will continue to review IHS\u2019s progress.", "Management weaknesses. In June 2015, we found shortcomings in  BIA\u2019s management of permits, and other approvals for energy  development have led to lengthy review times and negatively  impacted energy development on tribal lands. These lengthy review  times have increased energy development costs for tribes, delayed  projects, and led to lost revenue, among other impacts. For example,  according to a tribal official, BIA took as long as 8 years to review  some of its energy-related documents. In the meantime, the tribe  estimates it lost $95 million in revenue that it could have earned from  tribal permitting fees, oil and gas severance taxes, and royalties. We  recommended that BIA develop a documented process to track its  review and response times and enhance its data collection efforts. As  of November 2019, the agency had taken initial steps toward  implementing the recommendation by developing system  enhancements to capture key dates during the review and approval  process for energy-related documents. However, BIA needs to collect  data from its system, develop time frames, and monitor agency  performance to fully address these recommendations. In our January  2019 work on tribal self-governance, we reported that Interior\u2019s  process does not ensure that funds associated with self-determination  contracts and self-governance compacts are disbursed in a timely  manner, according to tribal stakeholders. These funding delays can  therefore be a factor that hinders tribal use of these agreements.  When funds are not disbursed in a timely manner, a tribal stakeholder  told us that tribes may have to use funds from their general revenue  accounts or seek other sources to cover federal program expenses.  According to several tribal stakeholders, when a tribe has to use its  own funds for the administration of federal programs\u2014even  temporarily\u2014it can adversely affect the tribe in various ways. To  help ensure that funds are disbursed in a timely manner, we  recommended that Interior establish a process to track and monitor  the disbursement of funds associated with self-determination  contracts and self-governance compacts. Interior agreed with this  recommendation, and as of November 2019, we are following up on  its status.", "Weaknesses in planning. In May 2017, we found that Indian Affairs  did not have a comprehensive capital asset plan to guide funding for  construction projects to maintain, repair, or replace infrastructure at its  185 BIE schools. Specifically, although Indian Affairs had  determined which 10 schools it planned to replace next, it did not  have a long-term capital asset plan for the remaining 175 BIE  schools. Many of the 175 schools were in poor condition and had  safety hazards. We recommended Indian Affairs develop a  comprehensive long-term capital asset plan that includes a prioritized  list of projects with the greatest need of funding. Indian Affairs agreed  with the recommendation. As of October 2018, Indian Affairs provided  a list of deferred maintenance projects for 2018 and documentation of  processes for prioritizing such projects, among other things, but as of  November 2019 had not yet provided documentation that it had  completed a comprehensive long-term capital asset plan.", "In conclusion, the resource constraints and management weaknesses in  federal programs that serve tribes limit federal agencies\u2019 effective delivery  of programs to Native Americans. In many cases, we have made  recommendations to agencies to take steps to address identified issues.  While agencies have made some progress addressing recommendations  to improve tribal programs identified in our high-risk and other areas,  continued work to address these and other issues is needed. Sustained  congressional attention to these issues and the relevant factors  contributing to the disparities identified in the U.S. Civil Rights  Commission\u2019s report will help the federal government makes progress in  addressing the needs of Native Americans.", "Chairman Gallego, Ranking Member Cook and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
