Even though the Air Force has significantly increased this spending, it has not measured the extent to which this increased use resulted in the benefits that were expected. For example, our analysis shows that for at least one of the expected benefits, attracting new market entrants, the expected benefit has not materialized. For the most part, traditional defense contractors received these contracts. Government contracting officials face risks in using commercial acquisition. For example, improperly classifying an acquisition as a commercial acquisition can leave the Air Force vulnerable to accepting prices that may not be the best value for the department. A high-ranking DOD acquisition official testified that he is concerned about items and services being identified as commercial that are not sold in an existing marketplace because under these circumstances, the government lacks assurances that the price is reasonable. At times, Air Force officials have disagreed about the classification of some acquisitions as commercial. The Air Force's use of commercial acquisition has also been accompanied by an increased amount of dollars being awarded for sole-source contracts. Despite DOD policy to avoid sole-source commercial acquisitions because of increased risk, sole-source commercial acquisition dollars awarded by the Air Force have more than doubled from 2000 to 2005.

DOD\u2019s subsequent report to Congress in response to the  act\u2019s requirement identified several impediments to the use of commercial  acquisition, including a requirement that contractors provide cost or  pricing data to the government. Identification of providing the government  cost or pricing data as an impediment was in contrast to requirements in  the Truth in Negotiations Act of 1962. This act generally requires  contractors to submit cost or pricing data to the government before the  award of a negotiated contract and certify that the data are accurate,  complete, and current as a way to provide information parity between the  contractor and the government. Because a primary maxim in contracting  is that competition drives down prices, one of the purposes of the  legislation was to provide the government with all the facts on the cost or  pricing data the contractor used to prepare a proposal, including, as  applicable here, when there is no competition. In that way, the  government believed it would have the information necessary to protect  itself from paying excessive prices.", "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, concerns about impediments  that might prevent commercial companies from doing business with the  government continued. The concern about requiring cost or pricing data in  commercial acquisition was a factor in passing several laws in the 1990s  designed to streamline acquisition in general, and commercial acquisition  specifically, by more broadly exempting commercial acquisitions from the  cost or pricing data requirement (see fig. 1).", "Although commercial acquisition regulations now preclude the  government from obtaining cost or pricing data from contractors in  commercial acquisitions, the government is permitted to obtain pricing  information from sources other than the offering contractor. If this  information proves inadequate, the government can require the offering  contractor to provide additional information, known as information other  than cost or pricing data, although the government must, to the maximum  extent practicable, limit the scope of the request to include only  information in a form regularly maintained by the offering contractor.", "In early 2001, OSD reemphasized to the military departments and defense  agencies that commercial acquisition should be used to the maximum  extent possible to effectively provide the technological advantages needed  to win future conflicts. OSD concluded that the military departments and  agencies must uniformly look first to the commercial marketplace before  developing new systems, upgrading legacy systems or procuring spare  parts and support services. To help ensure the increased use of  commercial acquisition, OSD established and the Air Force implemented  two commercial acquisition goals to be achieved by the end of fiscal year  2005.

Nonetheless, the Air  Force did not establish measures nor did it collect information to  determine if the benefits expected from commercial acquisition were  being achieved. As a result, it is unclear if or how the Air Force has  benefited from increased use of commercial acquisition.

For example, improperly classifying an acquisition as a  commercial acquisition leaves the Air Force vulnerable to accepting prices  that may not be the best value for the department because under  commercial acquisition regulations, the government is precluded from  requesting cost or pricing information. Our review of Air Force contract  files and DOD Inspector General reports showed that Air Force officials  disagreed about the designation of some acquisitions as commercial.

A major  difference between a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15  \u201cContracting by Negotiation\u201d and Part 12 \u201cAcquisition of Commercial  Items\u201d is that under Part 12 the government is prohibited from obtaining  cost or pricing data.

The Inspector General concluded that three Air Force acquisitions\u2014the   C-130J cargo aircraft, the KC-767A tanker aircraft, and F-16 simulator  services\u2014should not have been planned or purchased as commercial  acquisitions because they were unique to the military. For example, the  Inspector General reported in March 2006 that the Air Force had  improperly used commercial acquisition to buy F-16 simulator services  because contracting officials misinterpreted the definition of commercial  services. As a result, the Air Force placed itself at a disadvantage,  restricting its ability to determine whether the price charged was  reasonable. By using commercial acquisition, the Air Force was precluded  from requesting certified cost or pricing data for a service in which the  department is the sole customer. On the basis of the Inspector General\u2019s  report, the Air Force agreed, and has begun, to change its contracting  approach from a commercial acquisition to a noncommercial acquisition.", "Other recent efforts to improve the government\u2019s use of commercial  acquisition include efforts by a high-level panel to consider changes to  potentially clarify the definition of commercial acquisition as well as  efforts by Air Force officials seeking similar regulatory changes.", "The Federal Acquisition Advisory Panel is examining, among other things,  commercial acquisition practices. The Acquisition Advisory Panel is also  reviewing preliminary recommendations to modify the commercial item  definition found in federal regulation. The panel noted, in a briefing on its  Web page, that in the private sector, competition in efficient markets is a  principle relied on to a great extent to assure price reasonableness. The  panel cites three government commercial acquisition practices related to  the commercial item definition that depart from private-sector practices:  First, commercial acquisition procedures are used for sole-source  contracts; second, items are acquired commercially even when the  government is the predominant or only buyer; and third, the \u201ccommercial  item\u201d definition is broad enough to admit items for which an efficient  market does not exist to ensure price reasonableness.", "DOD\u2019s Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy Director recently  addressed the Acquisition Advisory Panel and identified concerns that  some acquisitions are being designated commercial that are not  commercial. The Director expressed his view that a commercial item is  one in which a marketplace exists, meaning the item has been sold to  commercial companies (not just DOD). The Director stated that if  someone is selling \u201cto us (the government) and only to us, that\u2019s not a  commercial price.\u201d In addition, the Director testified that DOD intends to  create a tool, a decision matrix, that will enable contracting officials to  identify the right contracting mechanism after completing their market  research. The purpose is to have DOD and the military services use  commercial acquisition effectively and correctly, in a consistent way.", "OSD guidance specifically states that commercial acquisition was not  intended to allow military-unique items to be purchased commercially.  Misclassification of items as commercial can leave the Air Force  vulnerable to accepting prices that are not the best value for the  department. When an item is designated as commercial, the Air Force  should be able to determine if the price is reasonable on the basis of prices  in the commercial market. If the Air Force designates an item as being  commercial when it is not readily available in the commercial market, this  limits its ability to assess the reasonableness of the contractor\u2019s price  because it might, especially in sole-source situations, have less  information on prices to make its decision.", "Restrictions on the use of commercial acquisition to procure military  unique major weapons systems were recently established in the Fiscal  Year 2006 DOD Authorization Act. The act requires that to use  commercial acquisition procedures for major weapon systems, the  Secretary of Defense must now (1) determine the procurement meets the  definition of \u201ccommercial item,\u201d (2) determine that national security  objectives necessitate the purchase of the system as a commercial item,  and (3) give Congress at least 30 days notice before purchasing a major  acquisition program using commercial acquisition. To implement this  requirement, an interim Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement (DFARS) rule is pending publication.  The Air Force intends  to implement the DFARS rule by requiring requests for Secretary of  Defense approval of major weapon systems to be purchased as  commercial items, include a description of the benefits associated with  increased competition, better prices, and new market entrants and/or  technologies.", "When we discussed the purchase of major weapon systems using  commercial acquisition with top DOD officials, they informed us there are  plans to transition both the C-130J and the Joint Primary Aircraft Training  System (JPATS) contracts, as well as a future contract for F-16 fighter  aircraft simulator services, from commercial to noncommercial contracts.  Further, a top DOD acquisition official said that in the future DOD will  more carefully scrutinize the use of commercial acquisition, especially on  major acquisition programs.", "Further, Air Force contracting officials have submitted proposals as cases  to the Defense Acquisition Regulation Council and the Civilian Agency  Acquisition Council seeking clarification of the definitions of \u201ccommercial  item\u201d and \u201ccost or pricing data\u201d related to commercial acquisition. While  one case was closed, it highlights continued efforts to appropriately  classify items as commercial. For example, the Air Force proposed a  change to the DFARS, which was subsequently referred by Defense  Acquisition Regulation Council as a case for the Federal Acquisition  Regulation, to tighten the commercial item definition. The definition  found in federal regulation states in part: \u201ccommercial item means any  item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the  general public.\u201d In an attachment to the 2001 memo instituting the  commercial acquisition goals, OSD cautioned that the phrase \u201cof a type\u201d is  not intended to allow the use of commercial acquisition to acquire sole- source, military-unique items that are not closely related to items already  in the marketplace.", "A second FAR case attempts to address confusion about what qualifies as  cost or pricing data in relation to commercial acquisition.

Adequate price  competition means (1) the government receiving at least two offers  submitted by responsible offerors, competing independently, that satisfy  the government requirement; (2) there was a reasonable expectation of  competition; or (3) a proposed price is clearly reasonable based on price  analysis.
