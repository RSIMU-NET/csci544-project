In recent years, the use of spectrum in wireless applications has expanded dramatically, leading occasionally to contentious disputes between government and commercial users over access to spectrum. Considering IRAC's key role in spectrum management, Congress asked us to (1) describe the evolution of IRAC and (2) obtain IRAC agency representatives' assessment of IRAC's spectrum coordination and policy advice, role as an advisor, and whether IRAC needs to be reformed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The mission and placement of IRAC have evolved over time. IRAC began in 1922 by assisting in the assignment of frequencies to federal users and coordinating federal government spectrum use. In 1952, IRAC's mission was expanded to include responsibilities for formulating and recommending policies, plans, and actions for federal government spectrum use. Initially advising the Department of Commerce, IRAC has reported to or through various different entities, including at different times the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Office of the President. Since 1978, IRAC has directly advised the Department of Commerce's NTIA. Currently, IRAC is comprised of a full committee, six standing subcommittees, and various ad hoc committees and working groups. In interviews with GAO, IRAC agency representatives made two key points in assessing IRAC. First, IRAC is effective in accomplishing spectrum coordination tasks, but its effectiveness is at times limited by representatives' uneven level of technical knowledge. This problem could worsen, as one-half of the 20 current IRAC representatives are currently eligible to retire. Second, IRAC's ability to advise on national spectrum policy issues is limited because of representatives' lack of seniority within their agencies. The chair of IRAC (an NTIA senior executive) is in agreement with representatives on these points. He said that he has gone outside IRAC directly to senior agency executives when he needed advice on contentious spectrum disputes such as those related to the introduction of new commercial communications services that would use federally controlled spectrum. A federal task force recently released a report that identified similar issues regarding IRAC's effectiveness and areas in need of reform."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several decades, the development and use of wireless  telecommunications and information technology has expanded  dramatically, greatly increasing the use of and demand for the radio  frequency spectrum. Cellular telephones, wireless computer networks,  and global-positioning system receivers are quickly becoming as common  to everyday life as radios and televisions. Wireless communications have  become critical to private industry and a variety of government  missions\u2014ranging from scientific research and public safety to homeland  security and warfare. As a result, the radio frequency spectrum has become  crowded and, in the future, may no longer be able to accommodate all  users\u2019 needs.", "Radio frequency spectrum in the United States is managed using a dual  organizational structure. The National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA) within the Department of Commerce  manages the federal government\u2019s use of spectrum, and the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) manages all other uses. In carrying  out its responsibilities, NTIA relies on the assistance and advice of the  Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). Chaired by NTIA,  IRAC is comprised of representatives from 20 federal agencies that use  spectrum. IRAC helps coordinate federal use of spectrum and provides  policy advice on spectrum issues.", "Some recent, contentious disputes over who should have access to specific  parts of the radio spectrum have occurred between government and  commercial users. Because of IRAC\u2019s key role in spectrum management,  you asked us to (1) describe the evolution of IRAC and (2) obtain IRAC  representatives\u2019 assessment of IRAC\u2019s ability to coordinate federal  spectrum use and provide policy advice, its role as an advisor, and whether  IRAC needs to be reformed. To describe the evolution of IRAC, we  reviewed relevant historical documents and interviewed key current and  retired government officials. To obtain IRAC member opinions, we  conducted interviews with each of the 20 IRAC representatives. We  designed interviews that included a combination of closed-ended questions  and open-ended questions, which provided an opportunity for the IRAC  representatives to make additional comments. We also interviewed other  FCC and NTIA officials, including the current chairs of the IRAC full  committee and six standing subcommittees. Lastly, we also relied on audit  work from our previous reports on spectrum management in forming our  conclusions and recommendations. A list of related GAO reports on  spectrum management appears at the end of this report. We conducted our  work from October 2003 through June 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. This report summarizes the  information we provided to your staff during our June 30, 2004, briefing.  The briefing slides are included in appendix I. Key contacts and major  contributors to this report are listed in appendix VII."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRAC\u2019s Mission and Placement Have Evolved Since 1922", "paragraphs": ["IRAC\u2019s role and placement have evolved over the last 80 years. IRAC was  organized by several agencies in 1922 that, during a period of rapid growth  in the use of radio services, recognized the need for interagency  cooperation to resolve problems arising from the federal government\u2019s use  of broadcasting and radio services. The first interagency committee  meeting attended by interested federal agencies initially set out to regulate  and guide the radio broadcasting operations at the Washington Navy Yard  and any others that might be established by the federal government. In  June 1922, the committee decided that its scope should extend beyond  broadcasting and that it should be advisory to the Department of  Commerce in all matters of government radio spectrum regulation. In a  1927 letter to the Secretary of Commerce, the President affirmed IRAC\u2019s  advisory role and its mission to assign frequencies and coordinate federal  government spectrum use. In 1952, IRAC\u2019s mission was formally expanded  to include responsibilities for formulating and recommending policies,  plans, and actions for federal government spectrum use. Since its  formation, IRAC has advised the different entities responsible for  exercising the authority of the President to assign radio frequencies to  federal government users. Consequently, IRAC has reported through or to  the Secretary of Commerce; the FCC Chairman; the Telecommunications  Advisor to the President; the Director, Office of Defense Mobilization and  its successor agencies; the Director of Telecommunications Management;  and the Director, Office of Telecommunications Policy. By executive order,  in 1978, the Office of Telecommunications Policy was abolished and its  spectrum functions were transferred to the Department of Commerce.  Commerce formally established NTIA in 1978, and since then, IRAC has  directly advised NTIA. See figure 1 for a more detailed timeline of IRAC\u2019s  evolution.", "As shown in figure 2, IRAC is currently comprised of 20 federal agencies  that use radio spectrum, a chairman and an executive secretary from NTIA,  and FCC as a nonvoting liaison.", "In addition to the full committee, IRAC mission responsibilities are also  carried out in six standing subcommittees, as well as a number of ad hoc  committees and working groups.", "Frequency Assignment Subcommittee: Assignment of frequencies in  government bands of spectrum.", "Spectrum Planning Subcommittee: Planning spectrum use and certifying  major government systems that will use radio frequencies.", "Radio Conference Subcommittee: Coordination of U.S. government  positions for international conferences where agreements are made  regarding the global and regional allocation of spectrum.", "Space Systems Subcommittee: International registration of government  satellite systems and development of procedures for implementing  space-related provisions of international agreements.", "Technical Subcommittee: Addresses issues that relate to the technical  aspects of the use of radio spectrum, including the development of new  technical standards and recommendations on better utilization of the  available spectrum.", "Emergency Planning Subcommittee: Formulation and review of  emergency preparedness planning for government spectrum-dependant  systems.", "Both the IRAC full committee and six IRAC subcommittees are chaired by  NTIA. From our interviews of IRAC representatives, we found that most  IRAC representatives are satisfied with the agencies that are members of  IRAC, the FCC liaison function, and the subcommittee missions.  Specifically, 15 of 20 representatives said that the appropriate agencies are  represented on IRAC. Seventeen IRAC representatives believe that  coordinating with FCC through a liaison appointed by FCC is appropriate,  and 15 representatives agreed that most of the time, IRAC and FCC work  well together. Thirteen of 19 IRAC representatives said that the missions of  the IRAC subcommittees are appropriate, given current and future  spectrum needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRAC Representatives\u2019 Assessment of IRAC Is Mostly Positive, but Some Are Concerned That an Uneven Level of Technical Knowledge and a Lack of Seniority Limit IRAC\u2019s Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["IRAC representatives generally agree that IRAC is effective in coordinating  federal government spectrum use but are concerned about training and  succession planning. IRAC and its subcommittees perform various mission  tasks related to coordinating federal government spectrum use, including  frequency assignment, certification of spectrum-dependent equipment,  coordination of U.S. government positions for international conferences,  and registration of U.S. government satellite systems internationally. In our  interviews with IRAC representatives, they generally agreed that IRAC is  effectively accomplishing these spectrum coordination tasks. For example,  17 of 19 said that IRAC is very or mostly effective at assigning frequencies  in government-controlled spectrum, and 13 of 17 said that IRAC is very or  mostly effective at equipment certification for federal agencies. However,  training and succession planning issues could limit IRAC coordination  efforts. Eight representatives commented that some agency  representatives lack sufficient technical knowledge and/or understanding  of emerging technologies. This concern was also shared by 4 of the 6  subcommittee chairs, who believe that more technically knowledgeable  representatives would improve IRAC\u2019s performance. The potential  shortage of spectrum specialists in agencies could also limit future IRAC  coordination efforts. Ten out of 20 representatives are already retirement  eligible, and 3 more will become eligible in less than 5 years. These  concerns are consistent with the human capital findings in our 2002 report  on needed improvements in spectrum management.", "Greater concern was expressed about IRAC\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission of  providing high level policy advice on national spectrum issues. NTIA  officials and IRAC representatives said that IRAC\u2019s effectiveness in this  area is limited by the representatives\u2019 lack of seniority. Seventeen out of 20  representatives said that national spectrum policy formation must occur at  a higher level than that held by current IRAC members. According to NTIA,  only one agency on IRAC has assigned a member of the senior executive  service as the agency representative to IRAC and 13 of the 20  representatives said that the assistant secretary who oversees spectrum  management in their agency has little or no direct involvement in spectrum  management. The chairman of IRAC (an NTIA senior executive) agrees  with the majority of IRAC representatives that current IRAC  representatives are not senior enough within their agencies to provide  policy advice on issues requiring either commercial or government users to  share or relinquish spectrum. He told us that he has gone outside of the  IRAC framework when he needed advice on such contentious policy  issues, such as those related to the introduction of new commercial  communications services. For example, the IRAC chairman said that he  directly contacted senior executives from the relevant agencies after he  was unable to obtain from the IRAC representatives viable advice on how  to make possible the introduction of commercial 3G and ultra wideband  services. Both services would require federal agencies to share or  relinquish spectrum under their control. The IRAC chairman said that he  supports more involvement of senior agency executives in IRAC.", "As an advisor representing government spectrum concerns, IRAC must rely  on NTIA to negotiate with FCC in disputes between government and  commercial users over the use of spectrum. Most IRAC representatives  believe there should be a better way to resolve these disputes. When new  wireless technologies require access to government as well as commercial  spectrum, NTIA and FCC must cooperate in order to determine which  entity will have access to what spectrum. While IRAC must rely on NTIA to  negotiate with FCC to make those determinations, 10 of 20 IRAC  representatives have concerns about NTIA\u2019s ability or willingness to  support the needs of government agencies.   Some representatives told us  they did not think either NTIA or the Department of Commerce is able to  protect the interests of government users; others told us that government  users could not be well represented by an agency whose primary mission is  to promote commercial interests. In addition, 14 IRAC representatives told  us that their primary concern in the next 1 to 3 years will be either the  availability of spectrum to fulfill agency missions or the threat of harmful  interference from new technologies. Although almost three quarters of the  20 representatives said that they believe that IRAC\u2019s advice does influence  NTIA\u2019s recommendations to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, 13  representatives were able to cite important instances in which NTIA\u2019s final  position differed significantly from IRAC\u2019s advice. Of those instances in  which NTIA and IRAC differed, 7 IRAC representatives cited recent  decisions on issues of spectrum availability, such as 3G services, or  interference from new technologies, such as ultra wideband. Most IRAC  representatives said that a new process is needed to resolve disputes  between government and commercial users, but there was no consensus  among the representatives on what specifically would improve the process.", "IRAC representatives have varying opinions on whether IRAC needs to be  reformed, and if it does, what those reforms should be. Eight of the 20  representatives agreed that IRAC\u2019s organization and membership were well  suited to meet current and foreseeable challenges; 6 partially agreed with  that statement but thought some changes would improve IRAC.  Specifically, 4 representatives thought agency representatives should be  more knowledgeable or more senior, and 2 representatives said that IRAC  would be timelier in its decision-making if there were fewer members. Six  representatives did not believe that IRAC\u2019s organization and membership  are well suited to meet current and foreseeable spectrum challenges.", "The current IRAC chairman told us that he has instituted a number of  improvements in the past year designed to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of IRAC. For example, the agendas for IRAC meetings are  made available electronically for representatives to review before meetings  and IRAC meeting minutes are now posted much faster than in the past.  The chairman remains concerned about the knowledge level of some of the  agency representatives and the number of IRAC representatives who are  eligible to retire. To improve the long-term participation by agencies, he has  explored the possibility of training and certifying spectrum managers.", "A federal task force led by the Department of Commerce was conducting  its work concurrently with our review and completed its report on a wide  range of spectrum issues in late June 2004. The report included three  recommendations that fit within the scope of this report. It recommended:  (1) the government develop training programs for spectrum specialists;   (2) the Department of Commerce form a policy and plans steering group  comprised of assistant secretary-level officials from other agencies to  provide advice on spectrum policies, strategic plans, and contentious  issues; and (3) the existing White House Policy Coordinating Committee  should be used to address spectrum issues that could not be resolved by  the previously mentioned policy and plans steering group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRAC representatives generally concur that IRAC\u2019s current structure and  membership are effective in dealing with key spectrum coordination tasks  that are at the core of its mission, including assigning frequencies,  certifying equipment, coordinating agency positions for international  spectrum conferences, and managing satellite issues. IRAC\u2019s effectiveness  in these areas could be strengthened by increasing the level of technical  knowledge of some members and ensuring that agencies can provide  qualified representatives to replace current members as they reach  retirement.", "When it comes to dealing with contentious policy issues requiring  negotiation between government and commercial users, however, IRAC  representatives questioned the effectiveness of IRAC\u2019s current structure  and membership. There is a strong consensus that more senior-level agency  officials need to become involved in providing NTIA with advice on  contentious spectrum policy issues. While NTIA officials seek out such  senior-level advice as needed, this is an ad hoc process that occurs outside  the current framework of IRAC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the effectiveness of IRAC\u2019s contribution in spectrum  management, we recommend that the Secretary of Commerce take the  following two actions:   Direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and  Information to seek IRAC\u2019s assistance in establishing a set of best  practices in human capital for agencies that participate in IRAC that  include information on the appropriate knowledge and training levels  for IRAC representatives, goals for continuing education in emerging  technologies, and agency succession planning.", "Establish a special committee within IRAC comprised of senior-level  agency officials to be convened by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce  for Communications and Information as needed to provide policy advice  on contentious spectrum policy issues, such as those requiring either  commercial or government entities to share or relinquish spectrum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NTIA, FCC, and the current IRAC  member agencies for their review. The Department of Agriculture, the  Department of the Treasury, National Science Foundation, NASA, and the  Broadcasting Board of Governors all said that they support the report and  its recommendations. The Departments of Justice, Health and Human  Services, Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Postal Service and FCC did not have  any comments on the report. The Department of State (see letter at app. II),  and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security offered technical  comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) supported the best practices in human  capital recommendation but indicated that a panel of independent experts  should rule on contentious issues (see letter at app. III). As there was no  consensus among the IRAC representatives as to how to resolve spectrum  policy disputes between government and commercial interests, we chose  not to make a recommendation on the issue. DOE also stated that the  report did not identify that IRAC representatives and NTIA officials do not  always share the same goals, an issue DOE views as a key contention with  regard to spectrum management. We did not change the report because it  already notes that fifty percent of IRAC representatives have concerns  about NTIA\u2019s ability or willingness to support the needs of government  agencies. The Department of the Interior also agreed with the  recommendation to improve IRAC representatives\u2019 technical skills but  disagreed with the recommendation to establish a senior-level committee  to provide advice on contentious policy issues. It indicated that such a  committee is not warranted because IRAC has no decision-making  authority (see letter at app. IV). We chose not to change the  recommendation because 17 of the 20 IRAC representatives and the IRAC  chairman believe that more senior-level involvement is needed in  formulating national spectrum policies. The Navy said that it agreed in  spirit with the report\u2019s recommendations but suggested revising the  wording of the second recommendation (see letter at app. V).", "The Department of Commerce agreed with our recommendation for  establishing best practices in human capital for the IRAC member agencies,  but also indicated, as did the Department of Transportation (DOT), that a  high level policy task force should be created within Commerce but outside  IRAC per the Federal Spectrum Task Force\u2019s recommendation (see letter at  app. VI). The primary difference between the Federal Task Force  recommendation and ours is that the Federal Task Force recommended  that a group of senior agency executives be formed outside of IRAC to  advise on policy issues, and we recommended that the group be formed  within the structure of IRAC. We chose not to change the second  recommendation. As IRAC has been a stable, successful foundation for  spectrum coordination for more than 80 years, we believe that senior-level  executives of IRAC member agencies will be most able to provide useful  advice on contentious spectrum policy issues.", "As agreed with your offices, we are providing copies of this report to the  appropriate congressional committees, the Department of Commerce,  FCC, IRAC member agencies, and others who are interested.
