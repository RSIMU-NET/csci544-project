The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)--a DHS component agency--is the agency responsible for distributing grant funds. GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which DHS has (1) allocated PSGP funds in accordance with risk; (2) encountered challenges in administering the grant program and what actions, if any, DHS has taken to overcome these challenges; and (3) evaluated the effectiveness of the PSGP. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the PSGP risk model, funding allocation methodology, grant distribution data, and program documents, such as PSGP guidance. Additionally, GAO interviewed DHS and port officials about grant processes, funding distribution, and program challenges, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2010 and 2011, PSGP allocations were based largely on port risk and determined through a combination of a risk analysis model and DHS implementation decisions. DHS uses a risk analysis model to allocate PSGP funding to port areas that includes all three elements of risk--threat, vulnerability, and consequence--and DHS made modifications to enhance the model's vulnerability element for fiscal year 2011. For example, DHS modified the vulnerability equation to recognize that different ports can have different vulnerability levels. However, the vulnerability equation is not responsive to changes in port security--such as the implementation of PSGP-funded security projects. Additionally, the vulnerability equation does not utilize the most precise data available in all cases. DHS addressed prior GAO recommendations for strengthening the vulnerability element of grant risk models, but the PSGP model's vulnerability measure could be further strengthened by incorporating the results of past security investments and by refining other data inputs. FEMA has faced several challenges in distributing PSGP grant funds, and FEMA has implemented specific steps to overcome these challenges. Only about one-quarter of awarded grant funding has been drawn down by grantees, and an additional one-quarter remains unavailable (see table below). Funding is unavailable--meaning that grantees cannot begin using the funds to work on projects--for two main reasons: federal requirements have not been met (such as environmental reviews), or the port area has not yet identified projects to fund with the grant monies. Several challenges contributed to funds being unavailable. For example, DHS was slow to review cost-share waiver requests--requests from grantees to forego the cost-share requirement. Without a more expedited waiver review process, grant applicants that cannot afford the cost-share may not apply for important security projects. Other challenges included managing multiple open grant rounds, complying with program requirements, and using an antiquated grants management system. FEMA has taken steps to address these challenges. For example FEMA and DHS have, among other things, increased staffing levels, introduced project submission time frames, implemented new procedures for environmental reviews, and implemented phase one of a new grants management system. However, it is too soon to determine how successful these efforts will be in improving the distribution of grant funds. FEMA is developing performance measures to assess its administration of the PSGP but it has not implemented measures to assess PSGP grant effectiveness. Although FEMA has taken initial steps to develop measures to assess the effectiveness of its grant programs, it does not have a plan and related milestones for implementing measures specifically for the PSGP. Without such a plan, it may be difficult for FEMA to effectively manage the process of implementing measures to assess whether the PSGP is achieving its stated purpose of strengthening critical maritime infrastructure against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS strengthen its methodology for measuring vulnerability in ports by accounting for how past security investments reduce vulnerability and by using the most precise data available.

Additionally, ports often are not only gateways for the  movement of goods, but also industrial hubs and close to population  centers, presenting additional opportunities for terrorists intending to harm  U.S. interests. They are also potential conduits for weapons prepared  elsewhere and concealed in cargo designed to move quickly to many  locations beyond the ports themselves. Further, cruise ships, tankers, and  cargo ships present potentially desirable terrorist targets given the  potential for loss of life, environmental damage, or disruption of  commerce. Balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the free  flow of people and commerce remains an ongoing challenge for the public  and private sectors alike.", "To strengthen the security of the nation\u2019s ports against risks associated  with potential terrorist attacks, DHS administers the Port Security Grant  Program (PSGP) through its component agency, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA).

To verify the reliability of  the project funding amounts for Group I port areas as provided by FEMA,  we compared them to the total funding provided to each region and found  that these amounts aligned. We did not include project-level data for  Group II port areas due to data reliability concerns. Additionally, we did  not include project-level data for Group III and the All Other Port Areas  Group because these groups receive a small share of available grant  funding and follow a different type of funding model. For the purposes of  our report, we concluded that FEMA\u2019s financial data for the program as a  whole and FEMA\u2019s project data for Group I port areas were sufficiently  reliable. We also gathered information from FEMA on the environmental  and historical preservation (EHP) review process\u2014a key grant  requirement\u2014to determine the length of time needed to complete this  required review. However, FEMA was unable to provide complete data on  the EHP process, so we were unable to comment on the length of time  spent completing this requirement.

They contain not only terminals where goods bound for import or export  are unloaded or loaded onto vessels, but also other facilities critical to the  nation\u2019s economy, such as refineries, factories, and power plants. To  reduce the opportunity for terrorists to exploit port vulnerabilities, port  stakeholders are taking mitigation steps. For example, port stakeholders  have installed fences, hired security guards, and purchased cameras to  reduce the potential for unauthorized entry and help prevent  vulnerabilities from being exploited.", "To help defray some of the costs of implementing security at ports around  the United States, the PSGP was established in January 2002 when the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was appropriated $93.3  million to award grants to critical national seaports. In November 2002,  the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), which codified the  program, was enacted.

Risk management is a continuous process that includes the  assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine  what actions should be taken to reduce one or more of these elements of  risk. One way in which DHS has applied risk management principles to  the PSGP is through the use of a risk model to assess the relative risk  posed to ports throughout the nation and to help determine PSGP  eligibility and funding levels. The PSGP risk methodology is similar to the  methodology used to determine funding eligibility for other DHS state and  local grant programs. The model consists of three variables: threat (the  relative likelihood of an attack occurring), vulnerability (the relative  exposure to an attack), and consequence (the relative expected impact of  an attack). Data for each of these variables are collected from offices and  components throughout DHS, as well as from other data sources, and  then, using the model, each port is ranked against one another and  assigned a relative risk score. At the recommendation of the Coast  Guard, DHS considers some ports as a single cluster\u2014known as a port  area\u2014due to geographic proximity, shared risk, and a common waterway.  Based on risk, each port area is placed into one of three funding groups\u2014  Ports not identified in Group I, II, or III are  Group I, Group II, or Group III.eligible to apply for funding as part of the \u201cAll Other Port Areas\u201d Group.Figure 2 below shows the location of port areas for groups I and II\u2014the  two highest risk groups that receive the bulk of grant funding.", "To promote a regional approach to risk management in the highest risk  port areas, FEMA required\u2014beginning with the fiscal year 2007  supplemental guidance\u2014that all Group I and II port areas\u2014the highest  risk port areas\u2014develop and implement a Portwide Risk Mitigation Plan  (PRMP).

For fiscal year 2011, there  were 35 port areas in Group III. However, unlike Groups I and II,  these port areas do not receive a specific allocation based on risk.  Instead, DHS allocates a set amount of funding to Group III as a  whole and port areas within Group III compete against each other for  this funding based on risk and project effectiveness.", "All Other Port Areas: Port areas not evaluated using the risk model,  but which operate under an Area Maritime Security Plan (AMSP),are eligible to compete for funding with the All Other Port Areas  Group\u2013\u2013in a manner similar to Group III, but without using risk scores  as a factor in project selection.", "After DHS announces the allocation amounts for all of the groups through  the release of the grant guidance, applicants must apply for funding\u2013\u2013 either through the fiduciary agent or directly to FEMA\u2013\u2013within 45 days of  the release of the grant guidance. Applicants are entities within a port  area\u2014such as port authorities, facility operators, and state and local  government agencies\u2014that provide port security services. During the  award process, DHS and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)  evaluate the port areas\u2019 projects and determine which projects to fund.  Before the projects reach DHS and DOT for review they are vetted  locally. The local evaluation process\u2013\u2013known as field-level review\u2013\u2013for  Groups I and II differs from that of Group III and All Other Port Areas  Group as described below.", "Groups I and II: Beginning with the fiscal year 2007 supplemental  guidance, port areas in Groups I and II received a single direct  funding allocation based on risk. Once the allocation is made,  stakeholders in the port area then undergo a collaborative process to  determine the projects to fund with the grant allocation. To help  manage the new direct allocation process, DHS introduced the use of  fiduciary agents to help manage the PSGP at the local level and  ensure that all port partners were incorporated into the planning and  grant allocation processes. For Group I and II port areas, FEMA  awards the port area allocation to each port area\u2019s selected fiduciary  agent. According to the grant guidance, while the fiduciary agent acts  as the principal point of contact with FEMA for application,  management, and administration of the Group I and II grant awards,  the fiduciary agent is not the sole decision maker regarding the use of  the PSGP grants. Instead, a field-level review process is conducted  by the applicable Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) in  coordination with DOT, the Maritime Administration, and appropriate  personnel from the Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC)  including federal, state, and local agencies. At the completion of the  field-level review process, the COTP\u2014through the fiduciary agent\u2014 submits to FEMA a prioritized list of projects for funding ranked from  highest to lowest in terms of their contributions to risk reduction and  cost effectiveness.

At this point, the process mirrors the Group I and II process.", "Before grant awards are finalized, project proposals undergo a national  review process conducted by the National Review Panel (NRP), a group  of subject matter experts from DHS and DOT.

In addition to the risk scores of the port  areas, DHS made two implementation decisions when finalizing grant  allocations for fiscal year 2011.

To  achieve this stability, DHS utilized funding \u201cfloors\u201d in the fiscal year 2011  risk model, which limited how much a port area allocation could decrease  from year to year, despite changes in risk identified by the model. A  senior FEMA official reported that floors were used in the fiscal year 2011  PSGP risk model to mitigate wide fluctuations in funding so that port  areas could better plan for long-term security improvements. This official  also noted that floors have been used in the PSGP risk model since fiscal  year 2008 and were also used in the fiscal year 2011 Homeland Security  Grant Program (HSGP) risk model.", "In the fiscal year 2011 model, DHS set the funding floor for Group I port  areas at 25 percent\u2014meaning that the port area\u2019s funding level could not  decrease by more than 25 percent from its fiscal year 2010 allocation  regardless of how much its risk profile changed. Similarly, for fiscal year  2011, DHS set the funding floor for Group II port areas at 50 percent\u2014 meaning that the port area\u2019s allocation could not decrease by more than  50 percent from its fiscal year 2010 allocation regardless of changes in  risk. According to FEMA data, if the floors had not been used in fiscal  year 2011, the allocations to 3 Group I port areas would have fallen by  more than 25 percent and the allocations to 8 Group II port areas would  have fallen by more than 50 percent. However, due to the use of funding  floors, these 11 port areas collectively received fiscal year 2011  allocations that were about $11.6 million\u2014or about 26 percent\u2014higher  than their risk profiles would have indicated. See table 3 below.", "In fiscal year 2011, DHS modified how port vulnerability\u2014the relative  exposure to an attack\u2014is calculated in the PSGP risk model, but  additional changes could improve how vulnerability is measured in the  model. Prior to fiscal year 2011, the PSGP risk model held vulnerability  constant, rather than accounting for differences across ports. We have  reported on the value of measuring vulnerability in risk analysis models in   In June 2008, we reported that DHS chose to hold  two prior reports.vulnerability constant and consider all states and urban areas equally  vulnerable in the HSGP risk analysis model, which reduced the value of  the model in estimating risk.In June 2009, we reported that DHS also  chose to consider all transit agencies equally vulnerable in its Transit  Security Grant Program (TSGP) risk analysis model. Regarding both  models\u2014which are similar in structure to the PSGP risk model\u2014we  recommended that DHS formulate a method to measure vulnerability in a  manner that captures variations across jurisdictions, and apply this  vulnerability measure in future iterations of the grant allocation model. To  respond to these recommendations and other external feedback  regarding the grant programs, and to produce a more complete risk  picture, DHS modified the vulnerability index in the fiscal year 2011 PSGP  model such that vulnerability is no longer held constant. Instead, the  new vulnerability index recognizes that different ports can have different  vulnerability levels. In the fiscal year 2011 PSGP model, port vulnerability  is assessed using four data components thought to influence a port\u2019s  vulnerability to attack, as shown below in table 4. The fiscal year 2011  PSGP risk model is provided in full in appendix II.", "Although FEMA has taken the first step towards improving how port  vulnerability is measured in the PSGP risk model, further improvements  are needed to ensure that the vulnerability score for a specific port is  responsive to changes in security that may occur in that port\u2014such as  the implementation of new security measures. The fiscal year 2011  vulnerability index does not provide a mechanism to account for how new  security measures\u2014such as the installation of cameras or the provision of  additional training to security officials \u2014affect a port\u2019s vulnerability, even if  those security measures were funded using PSGP grant dollars. This  limitation is due to the fact that the data elements within the vulnerability  index are counts of activities, which recognize the number of activities  that may occur\u2014such as how many ferry passengers board a ferry\u2014but  do not account for the protective actions taken to secure them. For  example, if a port installed security cameras throughout a ferry system to  monitor vessel or ferry passenger activity, one would expect to reduce the  ferry system\u2019s vulnerability to attack. However, because the \u201cferry  passenger\u201d data element within the model\u2019s vulnerability index is simply a  count of passengers utilizing the ferry system and is not a reflection of the  security measures in place to protect the ferry system, the new camera  system would not reduce the port\u2019s vulnerability score as calculated by  the risk model. Thus, with this type of measure, in this example, a port  could only reduce its vulnerability score by reducing the number of  passengers utilizing the ferry system. The model\u2019s robustness is thereby  limited because activity counts do not reflect improvements made to port  security.", "It is important to note that some security improvements may be captured  by the inclusion of the Coast Guard\u2019s Maritime Security Risk Analysis  Model (MSRAM) results in the PSGP risk model.which are updated annually\u2014provide information to the model on the  percentage of national high-risk assets that reside within each port.  However, MSRAM does not account for all types of security  improvements because it is an asset-based model that assesses  improvements to individual port assets such as a ferry terminal or a  chemical plant. As such, MSRAM is not designed, for example, to  evaluate security projects that may affect multiple assets in a port.", "The National Infrastructure Protection Plan states that when measuring  vulnerability, one should describe all protective measures in place and  how they reduce vulnerability. FEMA officials reported that capturing data  on all security improvements would be challenging due to the need to  collect and validate data for all ports included in the PSGP risk model.  However, FEMA officials acknowledged the importance of incorporating  completed security projects as part of the vulnerability component of the  risk model and stated that FEMA will continue to refine its vulnerability  assessments. Without accounting for the reductions in vulnerability  achieved through new security measures implemented in a port, including  those funded through the PSGP, the robustness of the risk model may be  limited and not accurately reflect the relative risk of port areas throughout  the nation. Instead, the risk model would likely continue to recognize the  same ports as the highest risk, regardless of the security improvements  made in those ports. In addition, by not accounting for security  improvements resulting from PSGP grants, the security benefits of the  PSGP are also not recognized. Incorporating completed security projects  into the vulnerability component of the risk model could help increase its  robustness and more accurately direct allocations to the highest risk port  areas.", "While FEMA officials reported that developing an improved vulnerability  index that incorporates the effect of security improvements would be a  challenging process, there are interim measures that FEMA could take to  ensure that the most precise data available are being used to populate  the existing vulnerability index. FEMA made some progress in this regard  by modifying how the HAZMAT Population data component was  calculated in the fiscal year 2011 model. Rather than measuring only  hazardous materials imports, as was done in the fiscal year 2010 and  prior models, the modified measure also accounts for the transit of  hazardous materials through a port where the port is not their final  destination, providing added precision to the model.

Thus,  even though progress may be underway in improving port security, until  the grantee draws down their funds, this progress is not evident. FEMA  officials reported that grantees may not draw down their grant funds right  away for two main reasons. First, as a reimbursement grant program,  grantees are not eligible to draw down awarded PSGP funds until they  have incurred a cost. FEMA officials reported that costs for PSGP grants  are often not incurred until late in the grant performance period. For  example, grantees may choose to wait until project completion before  paying contractors to ensure that the project is completed according to  the terms of the contract. Thus, the draw down of grant funds would occur  late in the performance period, after project completion. Second, grantees  may choose not to draw down funds immediately after incurring a cost.  Instead, the grantee might choose to wait until the end of the performance  period to draw down funds or choose to draw down funds at select points  throughout the year. Often, according to FEMA officials, this delay is due  to the parameters of local accounting systems or the need to seek  approval from local government entities before requesting  reimbursement. As a result of these two factors, grantees have likely  made more progress towards implementing grant projects to improve port  security than is reflected in the draw down numbers, according to FEMA  officials.", "To encourage grantees to draw down funds more promptly, FEMA\u2019s GPD  released an information bulletin in January 2011 requesting that  whenever possible, grantees draw down funds no less than on a quarterly  basis. According to the information bulletin, more frequent draw downs  would provide a more accurate representation of FEMA grant fund  usage. According to FEMA data on monthly draw down rates over time,  there was an initial increase in draw down rates for some grant years  after the information bulletin was released, but draw down rates have  since leveled off."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "One-Quarter of Awarded PSGP Grant Funding Is Unavailable to Grantees Due to Various Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Of the nearly $1.7 billion in port security grants that FEMA awarded to  port areas in fiscal years 2006 through 2010, more than $400 million\u2014or  about 24 percent\u2014remained unavailable to grantees as of September  2011, as shown in table 6 below.

This PRMP requirement was  announced in August 2007 for the fiscal year 2007 supplemental grant  round and was part of a broader FEMA effort to shift the grant program  from supporting asset-specific projects\u2014such as fences around a  facility\u2014that benefited just one facility, to supporting more regional,  portwide projects\u2014such as interoperable communication systems\u2014that  would benefit an entire port area. This new requirement caused delays  because port areas were not eligible to submit specific projects to FEMA  for approval until their PRMP was approved, and many PRMP  submissions and approvals were delayed. The fiscal year 2007  supplemental grant guidance included a time line and specific  deliverables to guide port areas in the plan development and approval  process.finalized by May 2008. However, only 3 of the 11 port areas we  interviewed had an approved plan in place by this time. Plans for the  remaining 8 port areas were approved between July 2008 and September  2009. In June 2011, a senior FEMA official told us that FEMA did not hold  stakeholders to the time lines for plan development because the time  lines were unreasonably aggressive for some port areas. Another senior  FEMA official stated that FEMA did not want to rush the plan  development process because that could have been detrimental to the  quality of the plans. Due to the delayed plan submissions, FEMA faced  challenges in approving draft plans. For example, the senior FEMA official   Based on this time line, all port area PRMPs should have been  reported that it was difficult to convene the review panel to approve plans  on a sporadic basis. Thus, rather than hold weekly or biweekly meetings  to discuss one or two plans, which would pose a burden on their federal  partners on the review panel, FEMA instead held review panel meetings  every 2 months. As a result, the official reported that it took longer than  expected to approve risk mitigation plans which then delayed the  submission of grant projects from port areas. Until a port area\u2019s PRMP  was approved, it was not eligible to submit projects to FEMA for approval.  As a result, the delays associated with PRMP approval contributed to  delays in the use of grant funds. For example, the PRMP for the  Columbia-Snake River System was not approved until September 2009,  meaning that the port area could not submit projects to FEMA for  approval for more than 2 years after the fiscal year 2007 supplemental  grant guidance was released, creating delays in the use of grant funds in  this port area.", "Fiduciary agents and FEMA officials reported that the initial delays  resulting from delays in PRMP approval were exacerbated by the fact that  multiple grant rounds\u2014beginning with the fiscal year 2007 supplemental  grant round when the PRMP requirement was announced\u2014were  underway by the time port area PRMPs were approved and that these  grant rounds had varying cost-share requirements. In the case of all 11  port areas in our review, multiple grant rounds had been announced\u2014 through the release of grant guidance\u2014before the port area\u2019s PRMP was  approved, as shown in figure 5.", "For example, both the fiscal year 2007 supplemental and the fiscal year  2008 grant rounds had been announced\u2014in August 2007 and February  2008 respectively\u2014before the first PRMPs\u2014for the New York-New  Jersey port area and the New Orleans port areas\u2014were approved in April  2008. In some cases, additional grant rounds were announced before  port area PRMPs were approved. For example, as shown in figure 5, four  grant rounds (fiscal year 2007 supplemental, fiscal year 2008, fiscal year  2009, and ARRA) were announced before the Columbia-Snake River Port  Area\u2019s PRMP was approved in September 2009.", "With multiple grant rounds open, applicants could choose under which  grant year to apply for funding. Fiduciary agents and FEMA officials  reported that the cost-share requirement was a significant factor in  applicant decisions regarding under which grant year to apply for  funding.", "As shown in table 7 below, the PSGP has traditionally required a cost- match, but this requirement has been modified or waived in numerous  grant rounds as a result of legislative action.", "Fiduciary agents in 8 of 11 port areas in our review reported a lessened  demand for grant funds in grant years where there was a cost-share  requirement, particularly for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Fiduciary agents  cited a variety of challenges with the cost-share requirement, including:  (1) applicants were aware of long delays in the distribution of grant funds  and faced difficulty preserving the cost-share obligation in their entity\u2019s  budget while pending receipt of awarded grant funds, (2) facility owners  who were compliant with security requirements under MTSA were  hesitant to invest their own money for additional security projects beyond  the requirements, and (3) applicants were unable to afford the cost-share  requirement due to the economic downturn. For example, one fiduciary  agent reported that while she generally supports a cost-share  requirement because it ensures stakeholder buy-in, the cost-share  requirement has been challenging due to the poor economic environment.  As a result of the cost-share, this fiduciary agent reported conducting  three distinct rounds of project solicitations in the fiscal year 2008 grant  round in order to generate enough demand to spend the port area\u2019s entire  allocation. We reported in October 2010 that a cost-share requirement is  a key factor for effective federal grants because it ensures that federal  grants supplement\u2014rather than substitute for\u2014 stakeholder spending.  We further reported that a cost-share requirement is reasonable given  that grant benefits can be highly localized.", "As a result of the inconsistent cost-share requirement, several fiduciary  agents told us that applicants were more likely to request funding under  the grant rounds with the most lenient cost-share requirement or delay  project submission while waiting to learn whether or not the next round of  grants would include the cost-share requirement. This uncertainty about  the cost-share requirement created a disincentive for grant applicants to  request funding during cost-share years. For example, the fiduciary agent  in one port area told us that the port area received project proposals  totaling twice the port area\u2019s total allocation for fiscal year 2011. Thus,  projects had to be denied for fiscal year 2011 funding during the field- level review, even though more than $9 million in fiscal year 2008 and  2009 grant money remained unused. As shown in table 8 below, a  greater portion of money from cost-share years remains unused as  compared to money from non-cost-share years, even though cost-share  grant years preceded the non-cost-share grant year. For example, about  22 percent of grant funding awarded to Group 1 port areas during cost- share years remains unused, as compared to less than 4 percent during  fiscal year 2010, when the cost-share requirement was waived.", "Fiduciary agents reported that the lengthy cost-share waiver process\u2014 used by applicants seeking an exemption from the required cost-share\u2014 further exacerbated the impact of the cost-share requirement under the  PSGP. Grant applicants unable to meet the cost-share requirement are  eligible to apply for a waiver. The waiver approval process requires 22  steps\u2014which include approval by leadership within FEMA\u2019s GPD,  approval by FEMA\u2019s Administrator, and finally, approval by the Secretary  of Homeland Security. According to statute, the Secretary can grant a  waiver of the cost-share requirement if she determines that a proposed  project is meritorious but cannot be undertaken without additional federal  support. However, 5 of the 11 fiduciary agents we interviewed told us  that they had concerns with the cost-waiver request process\u2014including  with the length of time required for a decision. For example, one fiduciary  agent\u2014who oversaw a cost-waiver application that took about 7 months  to be approved\u2014told us that the cost-waiver request process was time- consuming and confusing. According to FEMA officials, an unknown  portion of this 7-month approval process was spent ensuring that the  fiduciary agent had submitted all of the required documentation and thus,  the actual approval time once the request was finalized was less than 7  months.", "The cost-share requirement was waived for all applicants under the  ARRA, fiscal year 2010, and fiscal year 2011 grant cycles. However,  grant applicants may continue to submit cost-share waiver requests for  new projects to be funded under the fiscal year 2007 supplemental, fiscal  year 2008, and fiscal year 2009 grant cycles\u2014which were cost-share  years\u2014if money in their port area remains unused from those years. As  shown earlier in table 8, about $110 million in PSGP funds awarded to  Group I port areas from fiscal year 2007 through 2009\u2014years in which  the cost-share was required\u2014remains unused. As port areas solicit  projects for these unused funds, some applicants may submit cost-share  waiver requests as well. For example, one fiduciary agent from a Group 1  port area reported that her port area recently completed the field-review  process to identify projects to fund using their unused fiscal year 2009  grant monies. As a result, the port area submitted 10 projects to FEMA for  approval in October 2011, of which 8 projects include a cost-share waiver  request.", "Although FEMA has taken steps to improve the cost-waiver process, it  continues to be lengthy and additional efforts may help expedite these  reviews. In July 2009, FEMA issued an information bulletin to clarify the  process that grantees should follow when submitting cost-share waiver  requests. Since the issuance of this information bulletin, FEMA has  received a total of 31 cost-share waiver requests\u2014of which, 22 were  approved. In November 2009, following a Fiduciary Agent Workshop,  FEMA released written responses to questions posed at the workshop. In  this document, FEMA stated that a decision on a waiver request could be  expected approximately 30 days after all documentation was provided to  FEMA in accordance with the process outlined in the July 2009  information bulletin. However, according to FEMA records, for cost-share  waivers reviewed since December 2009 DHS took\u2014on average\u2014126  days to approve a request once all of the required information had been  received. Approval time lines ranged between 55 days and 268 days for  these waiver requests. Of the 126 days, on average, it took 74 days from  the date requests were considered complete to achieve approval by  GPD\u2019s leadership. It took an additional 52 days, on average, to complete  the remaining 11 steps of the waiver process\u2014including approval at the  Administrator of FEMA level and the Secretary of Homeland Security  level. According to DHS, due diligence requires both component and  department level clearances, including secretarial clearance, in order to  responsibly award funding. This process ensures that PSGP projects  meet program goals and objectives. However, FEMA records show that  no approval recommendations from GPD leadership were overturned as  a result of the additional 52 days, on average, of required review. Further,  only 1 of the 31 waiver requests submitted since the July 2009  information bulletin was issued has been denied\u2014and it was denied at  the GPD level.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  \u201cpertinent information should be identified, captured, and distributed in a  form and time frame that permits people to perform their duties  efficiently.\u201d FEMA officials told us that FEMA has taken internal actions  to improve the review process such as meeting with other key offices  involved in the waiver process in the spring of 2011 to discuss and  standardize information requirements for the waiver package. FEMA  officials reported that they believe that this effort has helped improve  some aspects of the process, but further action may be required to  streamline the process. Additionally, fiduciary agents remain wary of the  cost-waiver request process. For example, one fiduciary agent told us  that its field review team\u2014including the COTP\u2014would be unlikely to  recommend a project for funding if that project relies on a cost-share  waiver. Another fiduciary agent told us that there is little interest in the  fiscal year 2009 funds due in part to the lengthy waiver review process.  Without a more efficient review process, certain grant applicants that  cannot fund the cost-match requirement may not receive grant funds to  implement their projects, or may not even apply for funds. Evaluating the  waiver review process could help to ensure that the process is completed  in a timely manner.", "In addition to funding that is unavailable because it is unused, some  funding is also unavailable because it is on-hold due to delays in  achieving compliance with postaward requirements and challenges with  FEMA\u2019s grant management system. After FEMA approves the use of  grant funds for a specific project, stakeholders reported that additional  delays in making funds available resulted from compliance with  postaward requirements. FEMA cannot make grant funds available to  grantees to begin work on approved projects until all postaward  requirements, including budgetary and environmental reviews, are met.  One cause of delay was inefficiency in the reviews conducted pursuant to  the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires a review of the  impacts of proposed actions as well as reasonable alternatives to those  actions. Grantees submit Environmental and Historical Preservation  (EHP) information to the Grant Program Directorate\u2013\u2013Environmental and  Historical Preservation (GPD-EHP) office for review. If the project does  not require a detailed EHP analysis, it can be reviewed and approved by  a GPD analyst. However, projects that require a more detailed analysis  are reviewed either by the GPD-EHP team or passed to a FEMA regional  environmental officer depending on the scope of the review.", "Fiduciary agents we interviewed in 5 of 11 port areas reported that slow  EHP reviews caused delays. During a July 2009 FEMA-sponsored  stakeholder conference, participating port areas stated that the EHP  submission and review process associated with the PSGP was causing  delays, which increased project costs and limited what grantees could  accomplish with grant funds. The group requested the establishment of a  more structured postaward time line, including deadlines for EHP reviews,  so that grantees would be better able to plan their projects. A senior  FEMA official reported that delays in EHP reviews were due to the fact  that prior to 2008, GPD had not historically conducted EHP reviews on  preparedness projects and thus, had no established program for doing  so. This official further reported that creating an \u201cEHP Team\u201d within GPD  with the assistance of subject matter specialists via technical support  contract and standardizing the format for project submittals has helped  expedite EHP reviews.", "According to FEMA officials, the delays caused by inefficient review  processes have been amplified by FEMA\u2019s reliance on an antiquated data  management system. As we reported in our June 2009 report on the  Transit Security Grant Program, FEMA did not have a mechanism for  systematically collecting data on the status of individual grant projects  through the review process. For example, although FEMA has systems  to track the financial information related to its grants programs, these  systems did not allow FEMA to track the status of grant reviews, such as  EHP reviews. According to FEMA, the data management system used to  manage the Transit Security Grant Program is also used to manage the  PSGP and no changes have been made to the system since our 2009  report. As such, GPD officials reported that each PSGP program analyst  maintained separate spreadsheets that tracked the grants for which they  were responsible. Using numerous data systems and spreadsheets  resulted in inefficiencies and, in some cases, lost data, as program  analysts had to search across systems for information or were reliant on  systems\u2013\u2013such as the Homeland Security Information Network\u2013\u2013that lost  application information. The overall result was a data system that did  not provide information in a timely manner and that could not be used  effectively to manage the grant lifecycle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and FEMA Have Taken Steps to Address Unavailable Balances", "paragraphs": ["DHS and FEMA have taken a number of steps to address unavailable  balances. To ensure that grant awards were used for specific projects in a  timely manner, FEMA implemented project submission deadlines  beginning in fiscal year 2010. Prior to this, FEMA did not have deadlines  for submitting projects which resulted in money being unused for projects  and therefore unavailable until the port area could identify enough  projects to fund\u2013\u2013a process that, in some cases, took years to complete.  Starting in fiscal year 2010, port areas had 45 days from the initial  fiduciary agent application deadline to submit specific project proposals.  In fiscal year 2011, FEMA took an additional step to shorten application  time frames by requiring all Group I and II port areas to submit specific  project proposals at the time of the fiduciary agent\u2019s application.  According to FEMA officials, this change will ensure that grant money  allocated in the future will be immediately used, which will expedite the  grant distribution process.", "DHS has also taken a number of steps to address the delays in the EHP  review process that contributed to funds being on-hold. See table 9 for a  list of key DHS actions:  As a result of these changes, some fiduciary agents reported  improvement in the EHP review process; however, these views could not  be verified using FEMA data. Specifically, 5 of 11 fiduciary agents  reported that the EHP review process has improved. For example, 1  fiduciary agent believed that the EHP process has improved primarily  because of FEMA\u2019s categorization of projects according to the amount of  expected impact they would create. However, due to data reliability  issues with FEMA\u2019s EHP data\u2013\u2013there were too many missing EHP dates  for an accurate analysis\u2013\u2013we were not able to confirm whether the EHP  process was improving. Because of limitations with FEMA\u2019s existing grant  management system, all EHP data are managed on separate  spreadsheets maintained by program analysts and these spreadsheets  have varying levels of completeness. FEMA officials acknowledged the  limitations with their data, including the omission of key dates in the EHP  review process, such as the date when the EHP information was  submitted for review or the date when the project\u2019s EHP review was  approved. However, FEMA officials noted that the evolution of the Non  Disaster Grants (ND Grants) system, which is discussed below, may  allow for better tracking of EHP submissions and approvals in the future.", "To address challenges exacerbated by the antiquated data management  system used to manage the PSGP, DHS took the first step towards  consolidating its data management system in fiscal year 2011 by  implementing the first of two planned phases of the ND Grants system.  According to FEMA, the ND Grants system is intended to consolidate  FEMA\u2019s disparate data systems and improve the ability of FEMA grant  managers to track grants through the review and approval process. In  February 2011, FEMA anticipated that the ND Grants system would be  fully completed by the end of fiscal year 2014. Given the early stages of  this process, it is too early to assess the extent to which the ND Grants  system will alleviate data management challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Is Developing Measures to Assess PSGP Administration but Does Not Have Measures to Assess Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["In July 2011, during the course of our review, FEMA finalized eight  performance measures designed to track how well FEMA GPD  administers and manages the PSGP.

According to FEMA officials, data collection for these  eight measures will begin in the fiscal year 2012 grant cycle and the 2012  baseline data will be used to develop targets for each measure beginning  with the fiscal year 2013 grant cycle. For more information on these  measures, see appendix V. In addition to these eight measures, FEMA  officials reported that four additional measures are under development.  By implementing these internal measures, FEMA officials should be  better positioned to determine whether the changes they have made in  recent months are sufficient to better ensure more efficient grant  administration going forward or whether additional actions are required.  However, since targets for the eight measures will not be established until  at least fiscal year 2013, and the four additional measures remain under  development, it is too early to know how effective they will be in helping  FEMA to assess its performance and improve its grant management.", "FEMA has not evaluated the effectiveness of this program in  strengthening critical maritime infrastructure against risks associated with  potential terrorist attacks because it has not implemented measures to  track progress toward achieving program goals. In 2006, the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that as the  PSGP continues to evolve, an important challenge DHS should undertake  is the measurement of its impact. The Inspector General also reported  that DHS has raised the overall bar of preparedness through the port  security grants but it is not clear that DHS knows how much actual risk  reduction has been achieved. Four years later, in January 2010, FEMA  formed a task force to develop draft performance measures for the  PSGP. This task force conceptualized 11 potential measures of  effectiveness for the PSGP; however, baseline data needed to implement  the measures did not exist for all 11 draft measures. According to FEMA  documentation, baseline data existed for 2 of the 11 measures, additional  data collection would be needed to populate 3 measures, and 6  measures would require further refinement or coordination with federal  partners.", "In December 2010, FEMA transferred responsibility for developing  performance measures from GPD to FEMA\u2019s National Preparedness  Directorate, specifically the National Preparedness Assessment Division  (NPAD).the development of effectiveness measures within the directorate  containing assessment experts.

In July  2011, a senior NPAD official told us that the division was briefed on the   FEMA officials report that this change was made to consolidate  draft measures developed by the GPD task force, but they were  considering developing different measures as well. In October 2011, the  same official told us that the division had developed a number of  prospective performance measures for the PSGP, but that FEMA was still  reviewing the draft measures.

The Port Security Grant Program (PSGP)\u2014administered by FEMA  and supported with subject matter expertise from the Coast Guard\u2014is  one tool DHS uses to protect critical maritime infrastructure from these  risks. Risk management has been endorsed by the federal government to  help direct finite resources to areas of greatest risk and grant programs  have provided substantial resources toward this effort. We found that  PSGP allocations were highly correlated to risk for the grant years we  examined and DHS has taken steps to strengthen the PSGP risk  allocation model by improving the quality and precision of the data inputs.  However, additional efforts\u2014such as accounting for how new security  measures affect port vulnerability and using the most precise data  available in the risk model\u2014could further strengthen the model and build  upon the progress made. While the allocation process has been risk- based, FEMA has faced significant challenges administering the grant  program. For example, FEMA awarded nearly $1.7 billion in port security  grants for fiscal years 2006 through 2010; however, draw down levels for  the PSGP are low\u2014with about one-quarter of fiscal year 2006 through  2010 grant monies drawn down as of September 2011. While FEMA may  not consider draw down levels to be an accurate measure of progress  made in improving port security, this measure has become the de facto  yardstick for assessing progress in securing our ports because no other  measures exist. Additionally, about a quarter of the awarded funding  remains unavailable due to delays in using grant funds, challenges with  the cost-match and associated waiver process, and challenges that  grantees have had complying with postaward requirements. As a result,  about $400 million in awarded grant funding remains unavailable to  grantees for port security projects.", "FEMA has taken steps to improve the availability of funds and has  developed internal performance measures to begin evaluating its  administration of the grant program.

However, DHS did not provide details regarding its  plan to implement this recommendation.", "DHS concurred with our second recommendation that FEMA coordinate  with the Coast Guard to determine the most precise data available to  populate the data elements within the vulnerability index and to utilize this  data as an interim measure until a revised vulnerability index is  developed. Specifically, DHS stated that FEMA will continue to coordinate  with subject matter experts, including the Coast Guard, to determine the  best data available for use in the vulnerability index. Further, DHS stated  that FEMA and the Coast Guard will continue discussions regarding data  elements to be used in future grant years, and that these meetings will  focus on what data elements are currently available for use as an interim  measure while additional enhancements to the vulnerability component  are developed. Such action should address the intent of this  recommendation.", "DHS concurred with our third recommendation that FEMA evaluate the  cost-share waiver request process in conjunction with the Office of the  Secretary of Homeland Security to identify sources of delay and take  measures to expedite the process. Specifically, it reported that FEMA and  DHS are exploring the best solution to reduce delays and expedite the  cost-share waiver request evaluation process and will work to implement  appropriate process improvements as they are identified. Such action,  when implemented, should address the intent of this recommendation.", "Finally, DHS concurred with the fourth recommendation that it develop  time frames and related milestones for implementing performance  measures to monitor the effectiveness of the PSGP. Specifically, DHS  stated that FEMA\u2019s Grant Programs Directorate (GPD) is in the process  of developing external measures to determine how effective grantees are  in managing and administering the grants and that these external  measures will be completed by January 1, 2012. DHS also stated that  specific measures to monitor the performance of the PSGP are being  developed within FEMA. Further, DHS stated that FEMA is also  developing performance objectives for core capabilities, as required by  Presidential Policy Directive 8 and the new National Preparedness Goal,  and will be reviewing all prevention and protection measures, including  those for PSGP. Finally, DHS stated that FEMA\u2019s National Preparedness  Directorate will work with GPD and the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2012 to  develop some specific measures towards building and sustaining  capabilities. These efforts, as described above, are important steps  towards implementing this recommendation.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Table 10 shows that the percentage of  funding directed at Group I port areas and all other port areas has been  relatively stable over time, whereas this percentage has changed more  drastically for Group II and Group III port areas. As discussed in the  report, DHS allocations to individual port areas were made largely in  accordance with risk, and were based on DHS\u2019s risk analysis and  implementation decisions. DHS\u2019s decision to direct the majority of PSGP  funding to the highest risk port areas\u2014as shown in table 10\u2014was one  such implementation decision.

Rather than holding vulnerability constant, as  was done in fiscal year 2010, DHS chose to modify the vulnerability index  in fiscal year 2011 to recognize that different ports can have different  vulnerability levels. The current vulnerability component\u2014as shown in  figure 6\u2014considers how port vulnerability is affected by ferry and cruise  ship ridership, foreign vessel calls, and hazardous material transits.  However, as discussed in the report, further improvements are needed to  ensure that the vulnerability score for a specific port is responsive to  changes in security that may occur in that port\u2014such as the  implementation of new security measures\u2014and that the vulnerability  index is populated using the most precise data available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Financial Status of PSGP Awarded Funds, Fiscal Years 2006 through 2010", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides information on the financial status of PSGP funds  awarded during fiscal years 2006 through 2010.
