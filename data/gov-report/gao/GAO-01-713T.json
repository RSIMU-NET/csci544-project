Medicare provides valuable and extensive coverage for beneficiaries\u2019 health care needs. Nevertheless, recent discussions have underscored the significant gaps that leave some beneficiaries vulnerable to sizeable financial burdens from out-of-pocket costs. Most beneficiaries have additional supplemental coverage that helps to fill Medicare\u2019s coverage gaps and pay some out-of-pocket expenses. Privately purchased Medigap is an important source of this supplemental coverage because it is widely available to beneficiaries. The other sources\u2014employer- sponsored policies, Medicare+Choice plans, and Medicaid programs\u2014are not as widely available to all beneficiaries. However, concerns exist that supplemental coverage can be expensive and may undermine the legitimate role of cost sharing in a health insurance plan\u2014to encourage cost-effective use of services.", "To assist the Subcommittee as it considers proposals to improve coverage for beneficiaries and the financial health of the Medicare program, my remarks today focus on the design of Medicare\u2019s benefit package and the role of private supplemental coverage. Specifically, I will discuss (1) beneficiaries\u2019 potential financial liability under Medicare\u2019s current benefit structure and cost-sharing requirements, (2) the cost of Medigap policies and the extent to which they provide additional coverage, and (3) concerns that Medigap\u2019s so-called \u201cfirst dollar\u201d coverage undermines the cost control incentives of Medicare\u2019s cost-sharing requirements. My comments are based on our prior and ongoing work on Medicare and Medigap as well as other published research.", "In summary, Medicare\u2019s benefits package and cost-sharing requirements leave beneficiaries liable for high out-of-pocket costs. As currently structured, Medicare provides no limit on out-of-pocket spending and no coverage for most outpatient prescription drugs\u2014a component of medical care that is of growing importance in treatment and rapidly increasing in cost. At the same time, Medicare\u2019s cost-sharing requirements are poorly targeted and fail to promote prudent use of services.", "Medigap policies that many Medicare beneficiaries purchase help to fill in some of Medicare\u2019s gaps but are themselves problematic. Premiums paid for Medigap policies averaged $1,300 in 1999, with 20 percent going to administrative costs. While these policies pay for some or all Medicare cost-sharing requirements, they do not fully protect beneficiaries from potentially significant out-of-pocket costs. In particular, some Medigap policies offer prescription drug coverage, however, this coverage can be inadequate because beneficiaries still pay most of the cost and the maximum Medigap benefit is capped. In addition, Medigap first-dollar coverage eliminates the effect Medicare\u2019s cost-sharing requirements could have to promote prudent use of services. The danger is that some services may be overused\u2014ultimately increasing costs for beneficiaries and the Medicare program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Individuals who are eligible for Medicare automatically receive Hospital Insurance (HI), known as part A, which helps pay for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and certain home health care services. Beneficiaries pay no premium for this coverage but are liable for required deductibles, coinsurance, and copayment amounts. (See table 1.) Medicare eligible beneficiaries may elect to purchase Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), known as part B, which helps pay for selected physician, outpatient hospital, laboratory, and other services. Beneficiaries must pay a premium for part B coverage, currently $50 per month. Beneficiaries are also responsible for part B deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.", "Most Medicare beneficiaries have some type of supplemental coverage to help pay for Medicare cost-sharing requirements as well as some benefits not covered by Medicare. They obtain this coverage either through employers, Medicare+Choice plans, state Medicaid programs, or Medigap policies sold by private insurers.", "About one-third of Medicare\u2019s 39 million beneficiaries have employer- sponsored supplemental coverage. These benefits typically pay for some or all of the costs not covered by Medicare, such as coinsurance, deductibles, and prescription drugs. However, many beneficiaries do not have access to employer-sponsored coverage. A recent survey found that more than 70 percent of large employers with at least 500 employees did not offer these health benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees. Small employers are even less likely to offer retiree health benefits.", "Approximately 15 percent of Medicare beneficiaries enroll in Medicare+Choice plans, which include health maintenance organizations and other private insurers who are paid a set amount each month to provide all Medicare-covered services. These plans typically offer lower cost-sharing requirements and additional benefits compared to Medicare\u2019s traditional fee-for-service program, in exchange for a restricted choice of providers. However, Medicare+Choice plans are not available in all parts of the country. As of February 2001, about a third of all beneficiaries lived in counties where no Medicare+Choice plans were offered.", "About 17 percent of Medicare beneficiaries receive assistance from Medicaid, the federal-state health financing program for low-income aged and disabled individuals. All Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below the federal poverty level can have their Medicare premiums and cost sharing paid for by Medicaid. Beneficiaries with incomes slightly above the poverty level may have all or part of their Medicare premium paid for by Medicaid. Also, some low-income individuals may be entitled to full Medicaid benefits (so called \u201cdual eligibles\u201d), which include coverage for certain services not available through Medicare, such as outpatient prescription drugs. However, the income level at which beneficiaries qualify for full Medicaid benefits varies, as determined by each state, and many Medicare beneficiaries with low incomes may not qualify.", "Medigap is the only supplemental coverage option available to all beneficiaries when they initially enroll in Medicare at age 65 or older. Medigap policies are offered by private insurance companies in accordance with state and federal insurance regulations. In 1999, more than 10 million individuals\u2014more than one-fourth of all beneficiaries\u2014 were covered by Medigap policies. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 required that Medigap policies be standardized and allowed a maximum of 10 different benefit packages offering varying levels of supplemental coverage to be provided. All policies sold since July 31, 1992 have offered one of the 10 standardized packages, known as plans A through J. (See table 2.) Policies sold prior to this time were not required to comply with the standard benefit package requirements.", "Under OBRA 1990, Medicare beneficiaries are guaranteed access to Medigap policies within 6 months of enrolling in part B regardless of their health status. Subsequent laws have added guarantees for certain other beneficiaries. Beneficiaries who enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan when first becoming eligible for Medicare and then leave the plan within one year are also guaranteed access to any Medigap policy; those who terminated their Medigap policy to join a Medicare+Choice plan can return to their previous policy or, if the original policy is not available, be guaranteed access to plans A, B, C, or F.  Also, individuals whose employers eliminate retiree benefits or whose Medicare+Choice plans leave the program or stop serving their areas are guaranteed access to these 4 standardized Medigap policies.  However, none of these 4 guaranteed policies include prescription drug coverage. Otherwise, insurers can either deny coverage or charge higher premiums to beneficiaries who are older or in poorer health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Cost- Sharing Requirements And Benefit Design Are Out Of Step With Current Private Sector Practices", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s design has changed little since its inception 35 years ago, and in many ways has not kept pace with changing health care needs and private sector insurance practices. Medicare cost-sharing requirements are not well designed to discourage unnecessary use of services. At the same time, they can create financial barriers to care. In addition, the lack of a cost-sharing limit can leave some beneficiaries with extensive health care needs liable for very large Medicare expenses. Moreover, gaps in Medicare\u2019s benefit package can contribute to substantial financial burdens on beneficiaries who lack supplemental insurance or Medicaid coverage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare\u2019s Cost-Sharing Requirements Not Well Structured", "paragraphs": ["Health insurers commonly design cost-sharing provisions\u2014in the form of deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments\u2014to ensure that beneficiaries are aware there is a cost associated with the provision of services and to encourage them to use services prudently. Ideally, cost sharing should encourage beneficiaries to evaluate the need for discretionary care but not discourage necessary care. Optimal cost-sharing designs would generally require coinsurance or copayments for services that may be discretionary and could potentially be overused, and would also aim to steer patients to lower cost or better treatment options. Care must be taken, however, to avoid setting cost-sharing amounts so high as to create financial barriers to necessary care.", "The benefit packages of Medicare+Choice plans illustrate cost-sharing arrangements that have been designed to reinforce cost containment and treatment goals. Most Medicare+Choice plans charge a small copayment for physician visits ($10 or less) and emergency room services (less than $50). Relatively few Medicare+Choice plans charge copayments for hospital admissions. Plans that offer prescription drug benefits typically design cost-sharing provisions that encourage beneficiaries to use cheaper generic drugs or brand name drugs for which the plan has negotiated a discount.", "Medicare fee-for-service cost-sharing rules diverge from these common insurance industry practices in important ways. For example, as indicated in table 1, Medicare imposes a relatively high deductible for hospital admissions, which are rarely optional. In contrast, Medicare requires no cost sharing for home health care services, even though historically high utilization growth and wide geographic disparities in the use of such services have raised concerns about the potentially discretionary nature of some services. Medicare also has not increased the part B deductible since 1991. For the last 10 years the deductible has remained constant at $100 and has thus steadily decreased as a proportion of beneficiaries\u2019 real income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Does Not Limit Beneficiaries\u2019 Cost-Sharing Liability", "paragraphs": ["Also unlike most employer-sponsored plans for active workers, Medicare does not limit beneficiaries\u2019 cost-sharing liability, which can represent a significant share of their personal resources.

The average beneficiary who obtained services in 1997 had a total liability of $1,451, consisting of $925 in Medicare copayments and deductibles in addition to the $526 in annual part B premiums required that year.", "The burden of Medicare cost sharing can be much higher, however, for beneficiaries with extensive health care needs. In 1997, the most current year of available data on the distribution of these costs, slightly more than 3.4 million beneficiaries (11.4 percent of beneficiaries who obtained services) were liable for more than $2,000. Approximately 750,000 of these beneficiaries (2.5 percent) were liable for more than $5,000, and about 173,000 beneficiaries (0.6 percent) were liable for more than $10,000.

The average beneficiary in 2000 is estimated to have incurred about $3,100 in out-of-pocket expenses for health care\u2014 an amount equal to about 22 percent of the average beneficiary\u2019s income.", "Some beneficiaries potentially face much greater financial burdens for health care expenses. For example, elderly beneficiaries in poor health and with no Medicaid or supplemental insurance coverage are estimated to have spent 44 percent of their incomes on health care in 2000. Low- income single women over age 85 in poor health and not covered by Medicaid are estimated to have spent more than half (about 52 percent) of their incomes on health care services.

The average annual Medigap premium was more than $1,300 in 1999. Premiums varied widely based on the level of coverage purchased.

While varying average premiums may reflect geographic differences in terms of use of Medicare and supplemental services and costs, beneficiaries in the same state may face widely varying premiums for a given plan type offered by different insurers. For example, in Nevada, plan A premiums for a 65-year-old ranged from $446 to as much as $1,004, depending on the insurer. Similarly, in Florida, plan F premiums for a 65-year-old male ranged from $1,548 to $2,123; and in Maine, plan J premiums ranged from $2,697 to $3,612.", "Medigap policies are becoming more expensive.

Medigap plans without prescription drug coverage rose by 4 to 10 percent in 2000.", "A major reason premiums are high is that a large share of premium dollars are used for administrative costs rather than benefits. More than 20 cents from each Medigap premium dollar is spent for costs other than medical expenses, including administration. Administrative costs are high, in part, because nearly three-quarters of policies are sold to individuals rather than groups. The share of premiums spent on benefits varies significantly among carriers. The 15 largest sellers of Medigap policies spent between 64 and 88 percent of premiums on benefits in 1999. The share of premiums spent on benefits is lower for Medigap plans than either typical Medicare+Choice plans or health benefits for employees of large employers.

In contrast, employer- sponsored plans typically require small copayments of $8 to $20 or coinsurance of about 20 to 25 percent, depending on whether the enrollees purchase generic brands, those for which the plan has negotiated a price discount, or other drugs.
