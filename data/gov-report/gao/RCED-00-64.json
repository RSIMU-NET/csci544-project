During the 1990s, DOE spent hundreds of millions of dollars to treat, store, and dispose of radioactive wastes generated at over 50 of its nuclear facilities around the country. Some of these wastes, including spent (used) fuel and liquid wastes from chemically processing spent fuel, are highly radioactive. By volume, however, most of DOE\u2019s radioactive wastes are classified as \u201clow-level wastes,\u201d that is, wastes contaminated with relatively small amounts of radioactivity. Some low-level wastes also contain components such as lead that are hazardous in their own right; these wastes are called \u201cmixed wastes.\u201d DOE generates these low-level and mixed wastes as by-products of its research and nuclear weapons missions. Cleanup activities at contaminated facilities also produce low-level wastes in the form of contaminated soils, debris from dismantled buildings, and other materials. Many of these wastes can be disposed of on-site in designated facilities. However, over the next several decades, DOE expects to permanently dispose of about 2.1 million cubic meters of low-level and mixed wastes at six locations where it operates disposal facilities. This volume of waste would fill an area the size of a football field stacked to nearly one and a half times the height of the Empire State Building.", "Concerned that DOE may not be managing and disposing of its low-level and mixed wastes as cost-effectively as possible, you asked us to review (1) the factors that influence DOE\u2019s decisions about the treatment, storage, and disposal of low-level and mixed wastes and (2) DOE\u2019s costs to treat, store, and dispose of these wastes and the cost-effectiveness of DOE\u2019s disposal decisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOE defines low-level waste as all radioactive waste that does not fall within other classifications, such as high-level waste and spent (used) nuclear fuel. Mixed waste is low-level radioactive waste with hazardous components, such as lead and mercury. Low-level wastes can range from barely contaminated soil and debris to waste with enough radioactivity to require remote handling. The wastes can include items such as contaminated equipment, protective clothing, rags, and packing material.", "DOE\u2019s low-level and mixed wastes are regulated under several statutes and authorities, depending on their content and where they are disposed of. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, gives DOE authority to regulate the treatment, storage, and disposal of low-level wastes. The hazardous components of mixed wastes are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by a state authorized by EPA to establish its own program, in place of EPA\u2019s, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA). For a facility that disposes of wastes containing hazardous components, a RCRA permit issued by EPA or an authorized state sets out, among other things, the detailed conditions under which the facility may operate. The act provides that a facility that was in existence in November 1980 may continue to operate under \u201cinterim status\u201d as long as it applies for a RCRA permit and complies with general-facility and unit-specific standards until EPA or the host state issues or denies the RCRA permit. EPA also oversees the on-site treatment, storage, and disposal of both low-level and mixed wastes resulting from DOE\u2019s cleanup of contaminated sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA).", "Finally, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, requires a federal agency to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement for every major federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Such a statement includes a discussion of alternatives to the action and of measures to avoid or minimize any adverse effects of the action. In May 1997, DOE issued a final environmental impact statement addressing its programs for managing and disposing of various types of wastes, including low-level and mixed wastes, at all of its facilities. DOE completed this environmental impact statement process on February 25, 2000, for low-level and mixed wastes, by issuing its Record of Decision on key policies for managing and disposing of these wastes.", "DOE manages its low-level and mixed wastes through two separate organizational programs within its Office of Environmental Management: The Environmental Restoration program manages wastes from cleanup activities under CERCLA, while the Waste Management program generally manages wastes produced from previous operations and wastes from current mission activities. The Environmental Restoration program\u2019s cleanup activities can generate large volumes of wastes. Many of these wastes can be disposed of on-site in disposal facilities developed for a CERCLA cleanup action. (App. I discusses DOE\u2019s process for establishing on-site CERCLA disposal facilities, including the estimated costs of constructing, operating, and closing them.) If CERCLA cleanup wastes cannot be disposed of on-site in a CERCLA facility, they are generally transferred to the Waste Management program or to a commercial facility for disposal.", "DOE estimates that it has or, over the next several decades, will have over 34 million cubic metersof low-level and mixed wastes at its sites throughout the country; however, it expects to leave almost three-quarters of these wastes, largely contaminated soils, in place.The remaining wastes will be retrieved and disposed of in one of two ways. First, most wastes that will be generated from cleanup activities are expected to be disposed of in designated on-site CERCLA disposal facilities. Second, wastes from operations and cleanup wastes that cannot be disposed of in on-site CERCLA disposal facilities (about 2.1 million cubic meters) must be disposed of at the six DOE sites with existing disposal facilities for low- level and/or mixed wastes, or at a commercial disposal facility.

Moreover, the one commercial disposal site that is readily available to DOE can accept only low-level and mixed wastes that contain very low concentrations of radioactivity. As a result, with few options available, most of DOE\u2019s waste managers had little opportunity to consider costs when making their waste disposal decisions. On February 25, 2000, DOE issued a new waste disposal policy, making the low-level and mixed waste disposal facilities at two of its sites\u2014the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and the Hanford Site\u2014available to all of its waste- generating sites. But before DOE can fully implement this new policy, it will need to secure the cooperation of Nevada and Washington State."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opportunities for Disposal at DOE\u2019s Facilities Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["Over 50 DOE sites generate low-level and/or mixed wastes, but 20 of these sites are expected to generate almost all of DOE\u2019s low-level and mixed wastes.DOE requires its waste-generating sites to dispose of their low- level and mixed wastes on the site where they are generated or at another DOE site, unless it is not practicable or cost-effective to do so. In some instances, DOE grants exemptions from these requirements for disposal at a commercial facility.", "Six of DOE\u2019s 20 major waste generators have on-site disposal facilities. Of the six, only Hanford and NTS can dispose of all the low-level and mixed wastes that they themselves generate, as well as low-level wastes from other sites. The other four sites- the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Idaho; the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico; the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee; and the Savannah River Site, South Carolina\u2014cannot dispose of any mixed wastes and can only dispose of some or all of their own low-level wastes.Figure 2 shows the location of DOE\u2019s 20 major waste-generating sites, including the 6 sites with disposal facilities. (See app. II for the volumes of wastes estimated for these 20 sites.)", "Variation in the size and physical characteristics of the six disposal sites, as well as in the type and design of their disposal facilities, limits the quantities and types of wastes the facilities can dispose of. For example, Oak Ridge and Savannah River are located in humid, rainy climates, where contaminants can readily leach into groundwater, which is located near the surface. Therefore, most of the active facilities for disposing of low-level wastes at these sites are aboveground, are expensive to construct, and have limited capacity (see fig. 3). Savannah River recently spent $1.6 million on a supercompactor to reduce waste volumes and extend the life of one of its aboveground disposal vaults. Oak Ridge has only one aboveground facility (expected to close in 2003), which it has reserved for its high-radioactivity, short-lived low-level wastes. The site does not have disposal facilities for its remaining low-level wastes.", "Waste acceptance criteria established by DOE for each of the six disposal sites\u2014dictated in part by the physical characteristics of the disposal facilities\u2014also limit the disposal options available to DOE\u2019s waste- managers. These criteria identify the requirements, terms, and conditions under which the facilities will accept wastes for disposal. The criteria specify, among other things, the allowable types and quantities of radioactive materials; the types of containers required; and any restrictions on specific wastes, materials, or containers. At Savannah River, for example, an open trench can be used to dispose of only mildly radioactive wastes, such as lightly contaminated rubble and soil.", "Of the six disposal sites, Hanford and NTS afford the greatest flexibility. They have the greatest current and potential disposal capacity and are both large enough and remote enough to isolate their disposal facilities. Located in arid regions where evaporation exceeds precipitation, they are positioned high above groundwater, allowing for the use of low-cost, open trenches. Compared with Oak Ridge and Savannah River, Hanford and NTS pose few concerns about contaminants leaching into groundwater. NTS disposes of low-level wastes in trenches and in subsidence craters created by previous underground weapons testing.In addition, both NTS and Hanford have facilities for disposing of mixed wastes generated on-site or in state. Neither site currently disposes of mixed wastes from sites outside its respective state. Figure 4 shows subsidence craters used for disposal at NTS and one of Hanford\u2019s two mixed waste disposal trenches. Further information about DOE\u2019s disposal facilities appears in appendix III.", "While Hanford and NTS have the characteristics and capacity needed to dispose of nearly all the low-level and mixed wastes that DOE generates nationwide, DOE\u2019s policies have limited the waste-generating sites\u2019 access to the two sites\u2019 disposal facilities. For example, in 1979, when the Department essentially stopped using commercial disposal facilities because of uncertainties over their continued operation, DOE directed most of its waste-generating sites to use either Hanford or NTS, but not both, for off-site disposal. Specifically, it directed its sites with wastes from defense-related activities to use NTS and those with wastes from non- defense-related activities (e.g., energy research) to use Hanford.", "Before DOE\u2019s waste-generating sites could ship their low-level wastes to NTS or Hanford for disposal in accordance with DOE\u2019s 1979 policy decision, they had to obtain approval from NTS or Hanford. NTS and Hanford based their approval on reviews of the waste-generating sites\u2019 waste management programs\u2014reviews assessing the adequacy of the sites\u2019 quality assurance and waste characterization activities and the compatibility of the sites\u2019 wastes with NTS\u2019 or Hanford\u2019s waste acceptance criteria. By October 1990, NTS had approved the disposal of wastes from 15 waste-generating sites, and Hanford had approved the disposal of wastes from 26 other sites. Several sites, including the Idaho, Oak Ridge, and Savannah River sites, had not obtained approval from either NTS or Hanford. In October 1990, DOE stopped NTS and Hanford from approving additional sites to avoid prejudicing the outcome of the environmental impact statement on its waste management programs that it had agreed to conduct as part of a legal settlement.The environmental impact statement, which was issued in May 1997, was designed to demonstrate, on a national basis, the environmental effects of alternative approaches to managing and disposing of DOE\u2019s wastes, including low-level and mixed wastes. As a result, since October 1990, the sites that had not obtained approval to dispose of their wastes at NTS or Hanford before that date- including the Idaho, Oak Ridge, and Savannah River sites\u2014have had to store any low- level wastes that they could not dispose of on-site. Also, a December 1996 decision on an NTS-related environmental impact statement limited access for the disposal of low-level wastes at NTS to already approved waste generators until DOE completed the low-level and mixed waste part of its waste management environmental impact statement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Disposal at Commercial Facilities Have Also Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["While DOE sometimes authorizes disposal at a commercial facility, few commercial facilities are in operation, and only one is a viable option for most of DOE\u2019s waste-generating sites.To grant an exemption for disposal at a commercial facility, DOE must determine that the use of commercial disposal is cost-effective and in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of DOE, after taking into account, among other factors, life-cycle disposal costs, potential liability to DOE, and the protection of public health and the environment. Since 1988, DOE orders have authorized exemptions for the use of commercial disposal facilities that meet specific criteria. According to DOE, its field managers evaluate the cost-effectiveness of available disposal options. If commercial disposal is more advantageous, the managers can approve exemptions and ensure that proper permits are in place and notifications completed.", "Three commercial disposal facilities are in operation. One of them, operated by US Ecology, is located at DOE\u2019s Hanford Site on land leased by DOE to the state of Washington, which subleases it to the facility operator. Washington and seven other western states, which formed a compact to manage commercial low-level wastes within that compact\u2019s region, control access to this disposal facility.DOE (or any waste generator not located within the region) would have to obtain the approval of Washington, and of the compact, before it could dispose of its low-level wastes at this commercial facility. Another facility, Barnwell Waste Management near Savannah River, accepts a wide range of low-level wastes, excluding mixed wastes, but is very expensive. Over the last 3 years, only 1 of the 20 sites we contacted reported shipping wastes to Barnwell- a small quantity of wastes too radioactive for other commercial facilities to accept. Envirocare of Utah, Inc. is licensed to treat and dispose of some of DOE\u2019s wastes- but only low-level and mixed wastes that are only lightly contaminated with specific radionuclides.The facility\u2019s license also restricts the chemical properties of the wastes.", "DOE has issued contracts for low-level and mixed waste disposal at Envirocare that are available to all of its waste generators, and these waste generators have been sending low-level and/or mixed wastes to Envirocare since 1992. Over the last 3 years, for example, 9 of the 20 major waste- generating sites sent low-level wastes to Envirocare, and 15 sent mixed wastes. According to DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management,from 1992 through September 1998, DOE sites shipped 31,430 cubic meters of mixed wastes to Envirocare for disposal\u2014an amount equal to about 10 percent of the nearly 300,000 cubic meters of mixed wastes DOE estimates its Waste Management program will have to dispose of between 1998 and 2070."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Disposal Choices Have Afforded Few Opportunities to Consider Disposal Costs", "paragraphs": ["The limited disposal options available to DOE\u2019s waste generators have given them few opportunities to consider cost-effectiveness in their waste management and disposal decisions. Generally, the waste managers we contacted at DOE\u2019s 20 major waste-generating sites said that the policies and other constraints described above play significant roles in their disposal decisions. For their different waste streams, these waste managers reported considering the availability of disposal facilities, the facilities\u2019 waste acceptance criteria, and the costs of disposal. They also said they consider other factors, such as transportation risks, stakeholders\u2019 willingness to accept the wastes, and regulatory agreements and milestones. Finally, they said, cost comparisons of the disposal alternatives were relevant only when more than one disposal option existed.", "Occasionally, when the costs of disposal seemed too high, a site\u2019s waste manager decided against off-site disposal. For example, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California decided to continue storing radioactively contaminated solvents when it learned that incineration would cost $1 million. Similarly, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory decided not to ship some remote-handled low- level wastes off-site when it determined that the packaging and transportation costs would be too high.", "The factors cited by DOE\u2019s waste managers were similar to those cited in a September 1998 DOE Inspector General\u2019s report, which stated that DOE generally did not dispose of low-level and mixed wastes as cost-effectively as possible because factors other than cost played an integral role in disposal decisions.These factors included environmental impact, transportation routes, state equity, litigation involving disposal sites, interaction with the public and regulators, and funding limitations. The Inspector General estimated that, had cost been the only criterion in sites\u2019 disposal decisions, DOE could have reduced its low-level waste disposal costs by $5.3 million at three sites from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1996. According to the report, officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management were of the view that political and environmental sensitivities sometimes outweigh simple cost comparisons in making the most effective decisions for their programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to Designated Disposal Facilities May Continue to Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["Although DOE\u2019s February 25, 2000, Record of Decision designated Hanford and NTS as the primary locations for off-site disposal of the Department\u2019s low-level and mixed wastes, DOE may not be able to fully implement its decision until it has met all relevant regulatory requirements, such as those for obtaining RCRA permits from Washington and Nevada for its mixed waste disposal facilities. In addition, the Los Alamos and Oak Ridge sites will continue to dispose of their own low-level wastes to the degree practicable, and the Idaho and Savannah River sites will continue to dispose of their own low-level wastes and those from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. The nearly 3-year delay between the May 1997 issuance of the final environmental impact statement on waste management and the February 2000 issuance of the Record of Decision naming specific sites for low-level and mixed waste disposal occurred, according to DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management, to fulfill DOE\u2019s commitment to have further discussions with states, stakeholders, and tribal entities before making the decision. DOE officials from the Environmental Management program said these discussions were designed to help prevent political and legal problems after the decision was issued.", "Even after issuing the Record of Decision, DOE may not be able to implement its new disposal policy immediately, and its sites may not have access to disposal facilities for all of their low-level and mixed wastes. DOE may still have to meet regulatory requirements that will allow the designated disposal facilities to function as intended under the decision. For example, before the designated mixed waste disposal facilities can dispose of mixed wastes from other sites, they must meet the requirements of, and obtain the permits needed under, RCRA. Hanford must obtain a RCRA permit from Washington, NTS from Nevada. Currently, neither site has obtained the required RCRA permit for its mixed waste disposal facility. Instead, both facilities are operating under RCRA\u2019s interim status provisions and standards. Interim status has enabled the two sites\u2019 facilities to dispose of on-site mixed wastes while the sites seek to obtain RCRA permits.", "DOE does not expect to begin disposing of off-site mixed wastes at Hanford until April 2001, at the earliest, when it expects to complete an environmental review of the management of solid wastes at the site. DOE officials have stated that Hanford\u2019s interim status does not preclude the disposal of mixed wastes from other DOE sites, because there is no restriction on the source of the wastes. However, the Governor of Washington has publicly vowed to fight DOE\u2019s plan to increase shipments of low-level and mixed wastes to Hanford if DOE does not agree to set and meet deadlines for cleaning up the site. For example, although Hanford\u2019s mixed waste disposal facilities are designed to comply with RCRA\u2019s requirements\u2014the facilities are lined and have leachate collection systems\u2014the state could limit the site\u2019s disposal capacity for future trenches when it issues the RCRA permit. Hanford officials expect the state to issue the RCRA permit sometime after June 2002, the date the state has asked DOE to submit its application for a permit.", "NTS uses an unlined pit for disposing of mixed wastes generated on-site and currently does not dispose of mixed wastes from sites outside the state.The site is limited to disposing of mixed wastes generated on-site or elsewhere within the state of Nevada, for which DOE\u2019s Nevada Operations Office has responsibility. NTS\u2019 mixed waste disposal facility operates under interim RCRA status. To receive a RCRA permit from the state, the facility must either be modified to meet certain general requirements\u2014for example, incorporation of liners, a leachate collection system, and a leak detection program- or demonstrate alternative methods of meeting the RCRA permitting requirements. The site first applied to the state for a RCRA permit in 1992 and has revised its application several times, most recently in November 1999. DOE does not expect the state to issue a RCRA permit for the facility for another 1 to 2 years.", "Nevada is taking the position that it has already done more than any other state in support of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons development and testing and nuclear waste disposal. In addition, the state vigorously opposes DOE\u2019s efforts to determine if Yucca Mountain, located adjacent to NTS, is suitable for use as a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of highly radioactive wastes. In early February 2000, for example, Nevada\u2019s state engineer denied DOE\u2019s application for a permit to use water to build and operate a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Thus, we believe the state may oppose NTS\u2019 designation as a primary disposal site for DOE\u2019s low-level and mixed wastes, especially if DOE continues to move forward on the Yucca Mountain project despite the state\u2019s objections.", "DOE\u2019s experiences with the state of Tennessee illustrate the types of problems the Department could face in implementing its new disposal policy. Tennessee has blocked DOE from incinerating some mixed wastes containing hazardous and toxic components at DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge incinerator- the only DOE incinerator with a permit for treating radioactive wastes with certain hazardous or toxic materials, such as PCBs.The incinerator destroys essentially all of the PCBs and hazardous constituents, allowing most of the ash to be disposed of at a commercial disposal facility. Since 1997, Tennessee, by rejecting DOE\u2019s plans for burning wastes in the incinerator, has effectively imposed a moratorium on the receipt of most out-of-state DOE wastes- except for some wastes from sites formerly under Oak Ridge\u2019s operations. The state has rejected DOE\u2019s plans because DOE (1) has not incinerated Oak Ridge\u2019s wastes as planned, (2) has not provided Oak Ridge with access to NTS for the disposal of existing and future low- level waste inventories, and (3) has repeatedly reduced funding levels for Oak Ridge\u2019s cleanup activities. With the issuance of the recent Record of Decision on low-level waste disposal, DOE expects that Tennessee will lift its restrictions on out-of-state wastes in the near future.", "The lack of an available option for disposing of DOE\u2019s mixed wastes (including those with PCBs that could be incinerated at Oak Ridge), the almost 3-year delay in issuing the Record of Decision, and the additional time that DOE may need to develop a mixed waste disposal facility could significantly affect at least one of the DOE waste-generating sites- Rocky Flats\u2014that expects to finish its cleanup activities by the end of 2006. The site continues to store a number of waste streams, known as \u201corphan wastes,\u201d which do not yet have identified treatment or disposal options because of technical and/or regulatory concerns. Site officials said that while none of these waste streams is particularly large on a relative scale, all must be addressed before the site can be closed.When we asked the officials about their management and disposal of low-level and mixed wastes, they said they do not anticipate that mixed waste disposal facilities at NTS or Hanford will be available in time for Rocky Flats to meet its 2006 closure schedule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Is Spending Millions on Waste Management, but Managers Lack Information and Guidance for Making Cost-Effective Disposal Decisions", "paragraphs": ["DOE spent over $700 million over the last 3 fiscal years to manage and dispose of its low-level and mixed wastes.These costs, particularly for waste storage, may have been higher than they would have been without DOE\u2019s restrictions on disposal options- all but two waste-generating sites have had to store their mixed wastes while awaiting DOE\u2019s policy decision on the management and disposal of low-level and mixed wastes. Although this decision would, if fully implemented, give all of DOE\u2019s waste managers at least two disposal options, these managers do not have all of the information on costs and guidance from DOE that they will need to make cost-effective disposal decisions.

This amount included about $525 million to treat, store, or otherwise prepare these wastes for disposal and about $180 million to dispose of the wastes. At least one-fourth of the disposal costs were spent on disposal at a commercial facility. Mixed wastes, by volume, represent a small fraction of DOE\u2019s projected low-level wastes. Yet, of the $378 million spent by DOE\u2019s six sites with disposal facilities, most of the expenditures were on mixed, rather than low-level, wastes.

Storage and treatment costs were high for mixed wastes because four of the six sites had no disposal options for many of these wastes. For example, Oak Ridge, which has about one- half of DOE\u2019s mixed waste inventory, spent $53 million over 3 years to store these wastes. In contrast, DOE spent $33 million to store low-level wastes at all six of its disposal sites. Thus, while the majority of the costs for mixed wastes were for treatment and storage, the majority of the costs for low- level wastes were for disposal.

These fees are not consistent among the disposal sites and do not include all of each site\u2019s annual disposal costs.

Furthermore, the DOE officials pointed out, the federal government\u2019s annual budget process does not provide a mechanism for DOE to set aside funds from each year\u2019s budget to cover future costs at its disposal facilities. Therefore, according to the officials, the fees should cover only current costs. However, commercial facilities can and do set aside funds to cover fixed and other long-term costs, and their fees reflect these costs. The fees that Envirocare charges, for example, are designed to cover all of the costs of developing, operating, and closing its disposal facility. Until DOE includes these same cost categories, it cannot compare the costs of disposal at its own facilities with the costs at commercial facilities.", "To develop cost estimates that reflect the life-cycle costs of its disposal facilities (as commercial facilities must do to charge disposal fees to recover their past, present, and future costs), DOE needs to accurately estimate the future costs of closing its existing disposal facilities and of monitoring them over the long term. Closure requires the construction of caps over the disposal facilities and of other barriers to prevent deterioration or intrusion at the sites. The design of a disposal facility\u2019s closure cap may be affected by, among other things, the final size of the disposal facility, decisions on neighboring cleanup areas, and timing. Officials at NTS, for example, said their closure estimates do not account for disposal volumes beyond those predicted for the sites currently disposing of their wastes at NTS. Hanford officials said the cost of a closure cap over Hanford\u2019s disposal facilities would depend on whether existing roads will have to be moved or can stay in place until the entire site is closed and the roads are no longer needed. Figure 7 illustrates a typical closure cap for a waste disposal facility, based on the design of the cap for the CERCLA disposal facility at Hanford.", "In July 1999, DOE required the operators of its six disposal sites to develop preliminary closure plans.Among other things, these plans are intended to address how the disposal facilities will be closed to achieve long-term stability and minimize the need for active maintenance, as well as estimate the waste volumes to be disposed of at each facility over its expected operational life. However, estimates of the costs of closure activities are not required.", "In addition to the costs of constructing closure caps, DOE will incur what it refers to as long-term stewardship costs after it closes its disposal sites. DOE has not estimated these costs. Long-term stewardship covers activities required to protect human health and the environment from hazards remaining after cleanup is complete. Such activities include maintaining records of contamination, maintaining and repairing closure caps, monitoring and treating environmental contamination and precipitation run-off, erecting and maintaining barriers, and enforcing land- use restrictions. DOE recently reported that, for sites where cleanups do not reduce contamination to a level suitable for unrestricted use, the costs of stewardship activities are unknown.In October 1999, DOE announced a study on long-term stewardship, which it anticipates will be issued in late fall 2000. \u201csubmit a report to the defense committees of Congress not later than March 1, 2000, on the life-cycle cost comparisons of on-site versus off-site disposal of low-level radioactive wastes.

Relying on data from studies previously prepared for other purposes, DOE estimated that the life-cycle cost to dispose of its low-level and mixed wastes either primarily or exclusively at its disposal facilities would slightly exceed $4 billion (in fiscal year 1998 dollars). In contrast, DOE estimated that using only commercial disposal facilities would cost over $7 billion. The report does not provide the projected life-cycle costs for individual disposal facilities. Thus, the report does not provide managers at DOE\u2019s waste-generating sites or other program officials with the kind of disposal cost data that would be useful in making disposal decisions. DOE recognized this limitation in the report by pointing out that, without additional and more detailed analysis, efforts to estimate and compare the life-cycle costs of DOE and commercial facilities remain uncertain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Focus Across DOE May Increase Overall Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s decentralized management approach encourages site-level decision- making on waste treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste managers need consider only the effects of their decisions on their site\u2019s annual budget and may not consider the immediate or future costs of the decisions to the Department. Furthermore, because the costs for storage, treatment, and disposal are interdependent, managers may- without DOE guidance- make decisions in their site\u2019s interests that could result in higher costs for other sites or for DOE as a whole. For example, the fees that one of DOE\u2019s waste disposal facilities would charge a waste-generating site would add to that site\u2019s waste management costs. Higher waste management costs could, in turn, encourage the site to assign higher priority in its budget to other cleanup or operational activities. By contrast, the absence of disposal fees could encourage the same waste-generating site to assign higher priority to waste disposal activities.", "The lack of a DOE-wide policy on charging fees for disposal services has given the Department\u2019s existing disposal sites wide latitude in deciding whether to charge fees and, if so, what components of their disposal costs should be included in the fee structure. The disposal sites\u2019 fee decisions are intertwined, however, with the disposal decisions of other DOE sites. The fees set by some of DOE\u2019s disposal facilities are sensitive to increases or decreases in disposal volumes. Therefore, a decision by one waste- generating site to dispose of its wastes elsewhere could raise the unit cost and, in turn, the fees charged to other waste-generating sites. A site\u2019s decision to use the Envirocare disposal facility, for example, would decrease the amount of waste disposed of at a DOE disposal facility. In such a case, that facility might raise the fees it charges to DOE\u2019s other waste-generating sites. In addition, according to officials at one DOE disposal facility, a waste-generating site\u2019s use of a commercial facility means that DOE \u201cpays twice\u201d for disposal services\u2014once to maintain its disposal facilities in support of its waste-generating sites and again to dispose of wastes at a commercial facility. However, DOE has not assessed the effects of the use of commerical disposal facilities on its overall waste management and disposal costs.", "According to some site officials, charging disposal fees to waste-generating sites may, in some instances, reduce efficiencies. For example, officials at NTS stated that their disposal fees encourage an end-of-year shipping rush by waste-generating sites anxious to use funds by the end of the fiscal year. The result may be higher costs both for continuing to store the wastes at the waste-generating sites during the year and for operating inefficiencies at the disposal facilities caused by workflow fluctuations. Overestimating waste volumes could also result in fees that were too low to cover a disposal facility\u2019s operating costs. During a pilot program in fiscal year 1998, for example, Savannah River incurred a $4 million shortfall by relying on waste generators\u2019 estimates of waste volumes that were twice as high as the actual volumes. Conversely, underestimating waste volumes could result in fees that were too high, producing excess collections that might need to be returned to the generators.", "Disposal decisions made at DOE headquarters and at individual DOE waste-generating and disposal sites can affect the entire complex of nuclear facilities. As discussed, storage costs were high, especially for mixed wastes, during the years that DOE was preparing to designate NTS and Hanford as its primary disposal sites. In addition, satisfying a particular facility\u2019s waste acceptance criteria can be burdensome and costly. The Idaho site, for example, did not have the authority to dispose of any of its wastes at an off-site DOE disposal facility. To meet its restrictive criteria for on-site disposal and to conserve disposal space, from August 1994 through December 1997, the site\u2019s operator shipped 5,200 cubic meters of one type of low-level waste to a commercial facility for incineration and ash compaction.The waste volume was reduced by a ratio of 400 to 1, and the compacted ash was returned to the Idaho site for disposal. Waste treatment, storage, and disposal decisions can also affect other on-site activities.

The facility is being used primarily to dispose of contaminated soils and debris removed from cleanup areas near the Columbia River. The facility is located relatively high above groundwater and is in the same general area as DOE\u2019s low-level and mixed waste disposal facilities and the US Ecology facility, which disposes of commercially generated low-level wastes. DOE estimated that the life-cycle cost\u2014for the construction, operation, and eventual closure\u2014of Hanford\u2019s CERCLA disposal facility would be about $275 million.This estimate includes about $45 million to close the facility and $7.5 million\u2014$250,000 per year for 30 years\u2014to monitor and maintain the closed facility. The estimate does not include about $160 million projected as needed to transport wastes from around the Hanford Site itself to the disposal facility.", "According to DOE, the unit cost to dispose of cleanup wastes at the Hanford CERCLA facility, excluding on-site transportation costs, is about $63 per cubic meter. In contrast, DOE estimated that Envirocare\u2019s fees for disposing of mixed wastes would range from about $416 to $660 per cubic meter (depending on the condition of the wastes). To dispose of low-level wastes, some of DOE\u2019s waste generators paid Envirocare fees of about $207 per cubic meter of waste in 1999. (These commercial disposal fees do not include the costs of shipping the low-level and mixed wastes to Envirocare\u2019s Utah facility.) Also in fiscal year 1999, DOE\u2019s low-level waste disposal facility at Hanford charged the DOE waste-generating sites authorized to use that facility $496 per cubic meter or more, depending on the types of wastes, to dispose of their wastes.", "While DOE has decided to develop a CERCLA disposal facility at INEEL, it has not begun constructing the facility. The design of the planned facility, according to DOE, will (1) meet RCRA\u2019s substantive standards for the treatment and disposal of mixed wastes, (2) provide the \u201cbest available technology\u201d for protecting the sole-source Snake River Plain Aquifer beneath the site, and (3) accommodate the types of wastes that will be generated throughout INEEL by CERCLA remediation activities. These wastes include low-level and mixed wastes, as well as limited quantities of wastes with toxic and other substances regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA). In September 1998, the Department estimated that the planned low-level and mixed waste treatment and disposal facility, which would have a total capacity of about 390,000 cubic meters of wastes, would cost about $239 million to construct, operate, close, and then monitor. This estimate, equal to about $613 per cubic meter of waste, does not include the cost of transporting the wastes to the treatment facility but does include the cost of transportation from the treatment facility to the disposal facility. DOE also estimated that treating and disposing of these wastes at the Envirocare facility would cost about $1,854 per cubic meter. The scope of DOE\u2019s cost estimate study did not include estimates of the cost to dispose of these wastes at the existing disposal facilities for low-level and mixed wastes at Hanford and the Nevada Test Site (NTS).", "At Oak Ridge, as at INEEL, DOE plans to develop a CERCLA disposal facility for the site\u2019s mixed and low-level cleanup wastes but has not yet constructed the facility. DOE estimated that a facility designed to dispose of 273,000 cubic meters of wastes would cost about $101 million ($370 per cubic meter),while a facility designed to dispose of 1.3 million cubic meters of wastes would cost about $170 million ($131 per cubic meter). Each estimate includes the costs of constructing, operating, and closing a proposed facility and then providing surveillance and maintenance of the facility for 100 years. Neither estimate includes the costs of retrieving and transporting wastes to the proposed facility. The estimated closure costs, depending on the volume of wastes disposed, range from $12 million to $59 million. The planned facility would be constructed above groundwater and would have leachate detection and collection systems. Alternatively, DOE considered the costs of disposing of the majority of these wastes at the Envirocare facility and of storing wastes that could not be disposed of at Envirocare at Oak Ridge until another disposal option became available. DOE estimated that this alternative would cost about $135 million for disposing of 216,000 cubic meters of wastes ($625 per cubic meter) at Envirocare and about $456 million for disposing of 1 million cubic meters of wastes ($456 per cubic meter) at Envirocare. Transportation costs accounted for about 32 percent of each of these cost estimates for disposal at Envirocare.", "Finally, DOE considered developing a CERCLA disposal facility at the Savannah River Site for low-level\u2014but not mixed\u2014cleanup wastes in the form of radioactive soils and debris. DOE rejected that option as too expensive for disposing of the limited quantity of qualifying wastes. In a May 1997 report addressing the potential for developing an on-site CERCLA disposal facility or shipping wastes off site, DOE and its operating contractor at the site identified 20 separate areas on the site with low-level cleanup soils and debris.DOE determined which of these 20 areas\u2019 soils and debris were candidates for cleanup and consolidation in an on-site CERCLA disposal facility. The criteria used to determine whether the wastes should be cleaned up and consolidated were the location and future use of each area and the extent to which cleanup and consolidation would (1) reduce the area of the site that must remain restricted because of radioactivity, (2) reduce the site\u2019s risks, and (3) contribute to increased groundwater contamination. DOE concluded that the wastes in 16 of the 20 areas should not be retrieved, primarily because of their proximity to nuclear fuel production reactors, nuclear materials separation facilities, or underground tanks containing high-level radioactive wastes.", "DOE also determined that wastes in the remaining four areas at Savannah River, estimated to contain about 62,400 cubic meters of soil and debris, were candidates for retrieval and disposal in existing on-site or off-site disposal facilities. On the basis of its contractor\u2019s modeling of groundwater, DOE concluded that a large volume of the wastes would require treatment prior to disposal in an on-site CERCLA facility. DOE also concluded that the wastes in these four areas do not warrant the construction of a new on- site disposal facility for contaminated soil and debris. Therefore, DOE considered disposing of at least some of the low-level wastes from the four areas in the site\u2019s existing trenches or vaults, which were developed for the disposal of low-level wastes, and disposing of other wastes at NTS and/or Envirocare. According to the operating contractor\u2019s May 1997 report, excavating and then disposing of these wastes on-site in existing trenches or vaults would cost about $348 ($357 in 1999 dollars) or $1,435 ($1,473 in 1999 dollars), respectively, per cubic meter.In contrast, excavating, packaging, transporting, and disposing of the wastes at NTS or Envirocare would cost about $1,365 or $467, respectively, per cubic meter. Savannah River now plans to ship approximately 4,250 cubic meters of low-level soil and debris from CERCLA cleanup actions to Envirocare for disposal. This plan is designed to segregate CERCLA wastes from other types of low-level wastes and maintain clear regulatory lines of authority. The shipment is scheduled to begin in the summer of calendar year 2000 if sufficient funding is available. Also, according to DOE, the costs to treat these wastes, combined with the on-site disposal costs, made off-site disposal cost-effective.", "In February 2000, DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Restoration issued a report assessing the expected life-cycle costs of the Hanford, INEEL, and Oak Ridge CERCLA disposal facilities, the Fernald facility (discussed below), and the two CERCLA facilities where DOE disposes of uranium mill tailings.

The cleanup has generated both low-level and mixed wastes, some of which will be disposed of in the on-site CERCLA facility and others of which must be disposed of off-site. After considering several alternatives for treating and disposing of the site\u2019s low- level and mixed cleanup wastes, including estimates of the costs of each alternative, DOE decided, in February 1996, to develop a CERCLA disposal facility on-site. Low-level wastes that do not meet the criteria for disposal in this facility are disposed of at NTS or Envirocare. Mixed wastes that do not meet criteria for disposal at Fernald or Envirocare are stored until DOE can dispose of these wastes at NTS.", "Fernald\u2019s project, under CERCLA, is to clean up DOE\u2019s former Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium metal production facility that operated on-site from the early 1950s until 1989.

Subsequently, in 1996, DOE, its operating contractor, and Ohio\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency signed an agreement that, among other things, integrated and streamlined the remediation and closure requirements under CERCLA and RCRA. The agreement recognized that under CERCLA, EPA oversees the cleanup of the site\u2019s radioactive wastes while under RCRA, the state of Ohio regulates the treatment, storage, and disposal of the site\u2019s hazardous wastes. The agreement required DOE and its contractor to prepare one remediation plan to comply with the requirements of both acts. Under CERCLA, the Fernald site has been divided into five \u201coperable units\u201d for cleanup. The on-site CERCLA disposal facility is designed for cleanup wastes generated from operable units 2, 3, and 5.

Soil and soil-like material will make up about 85 percent of the wastes disposed of in the facility, while the remainder will consist of debris from the demolition of the site\u2019s buildings. The disposal facility covers about 140 acres and includes the disposal area, which consists of a series of disposal cells, and a buffer zone around the disposal area. When all of the planned disposal cells have been constructed, the facility will be about 800 feet wide, 3,700 feet long, and 65 feet high.
