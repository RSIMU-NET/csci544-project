The Single Audit Act, as amended, is  intended to promote sound financial management, including effective  internal controls over these federal awards. Before passage of the act, the  federal government relied on audits of individual grants to help gain  assurance that state and local governments and nonprofit organizations  were properly spending federal awards. The concept of the single audit was  created to replace these grant audits with one audit of an entity as a whole.  Rather than a detailed review of individual grants or programs, often times  by multiple audit organizations where there was more than one federal  funding source, the single audit is an organizationwide audit that focuses  on accounting and administrative controls.", "Single audits, as implemented by Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit  Organizations, provide a tool that federal agencies can use to identify  meaningful information on entities\u2019 financial status, their management of  federal funds, and areas that need further audit or investigative work. Each  year, about 30,000 single audits are conducted, and several thousand of  them identify weaknesses in award recipients\u2019 financial management and  internal control systems relating to these federally funded programs.", "On February 19, 2002, we briefed you on the results of the initial phase of  the work done in response to your request for information on how federal  agencies use single audit results. As agreed with your office, this report  summarizes the matters discussed during that briefing. To assess how  agencies are using the results of single audits, we conducted a survey of the  24 agencies subject to the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. (See  appendix I for a list of the CFO Act agencies.) The objectives of the survey  were to capture information on federal agency    single audit processes and responsibilities,    use of single audits, and    use of the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) database.", "The briefing materials we used are included as appendix II to this letter.  Work is underway on the remaining segment of your request dealing with  what several agencies are doing to assure that recipients of federal awards  have corrected problems identified by single audits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess how agencies are using the results of single audits, we conducted  a survey of the 24 agencies subject to the CFO Act. We pretested our survey  with one federal agency, solicited comments from OMB, and modified the  survey based on the comments we received. The survey included two  sections. The first section captured background information on agency  federal awards programs, the single audit process from an agencywide  perspective, and the offices within the agency that are responsible for  fulfilling the task of implementing the various single audit responsibilities  defined under OMB Circular A-133. The second part of the survey captured  information on how agency CFO, IG, and program offices use the results of  single audits in each agency\u2019s largest grant program. We distributed the  surveys to the agencies for completion. We then performed follow-up  interviews with representatives from CFO, IG, and program offices to  obtain, discuss, and clarify their survey responses.", "Our survey results reflect the information provided by and the opinions of  the agency officials who participated in our survey. We did not  independently verify the responses to our questions. We received  responses from all of the CFO Act agencies. One of the 24 agencies  returned but did not complete the survey because it does not have grant- making authority, and, therefore, has no experience with single audits. As a  result, our survey results are based on responses from 23 agencies. We  conducted our work from July 2001 through December 2001, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. We discussed a  draft of this report with representatives from OMB and have incorporated  their comments and views where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to OMB, federal awards for fiscal year 2001 totaled about $325  billion of the $1.8 trillion federal budget. The Departments of Agriculture,  Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development,  and Transportation were responsible for managing about 86 percent of the  federal awards in fiscal year 2001. The Single Audit Act, as amended,  established the concept of the single audit to replace multiple grant audits  with one audit of the recipient as a whole. As such, a single audit is an  organizationwide audit that focuses on the recipient\u2019s internal controls and  compliance with laws and regulations governing federal awards and should  be viewed as a tool that raises relevant or pertinent questions rather than as  a document that answers all questions. Federal awards include grants,  loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, interest  subsidies, insurance, food commodities, and direct appropriations and  federal cost reimbursement contracts.", "The objectives of the Single Audit Act, as amended, are to    promote sound financial management, including effective internal  controls, with respect to federal awards administered by nonfederal  entities;    establish uniform requirements for audits of federal awards  administered by nonfederal entities;    promote the efficient and effective use of audit resources;    reduce burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and    ensure that federal departments and agencies, to the maximum extent  practicable, rely upon and use audit work done pursuant to the act.", "Recipients of federal awards who expend $300,000 or more in a year are  required to comply with the Single Audit Act\u2019s requirements. In general,  they must (1) maintain internal control over federal programs, (2) comply  with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements,  (3) prepare appropriate financial statements, including the Schedule of  Expenditures of Federal Awards, (4) ensure that the required audits are  properly performed and submitted when due, and (5) follow up and take  corrective actions on audit findings.", "OMB Circular A-133 establishes policies for federal agency use in  implementing the Single Audit Act, as amended, and provides an  administrative foundation for consistent and uniform audit requirements  for nonfederal entities that administer federal awards. It details federal  responsibilities with respect to informing grantees of their responsibilities  under the act. A significant part of OMB Circular A-133 is the Compliance  Supplement. This document serves as a source of information to aid  auditors in understanding federal program objectives, procedures, and  compliance requirements relevant to the audit, and it identifies audit  objectives and suggested procedures for auditors\u2019 use in determining  compliance with the requirements. For example, it includes guidance on  audit procedures applicable to 14 areas including allowable activities,  allowable costs, cash management, eligibility, and reporting. (Appendix III  lists and briefly describes the 14 areas.)", "Organizations that must comply with the Single Audit Act, as amended, are  required to submit a reporting package to the FAC. The FAC serves as the  central collection point, repository, and distribution center for single audit  reports. Its primary functions are to    receive the SF-SAC Form\u2014a data collection form that contains  summary information on the auditor, auditee and its federal programs,  and audit results\u2014and the audit report from the auditee,    archive copies of the SF-SAC Form and audit report,    forward a copy of the audit report to each federal awarding agency that  has provided direct funding to the auditee when the report identifies a  finding relating to that agency\u2019s awards, and    maintain an electronic database that is accessible through the Internet.", "In our June 1994 report, Single Audit: Refinements Can Improve  Usefulness (GAO/AIMD-94-133), nearly two-thirds of the program  managers we interviewed said that a database of single audit information  would be a significant help in comparing information about entities  operating their programs. Eighty percent of the managers said they would  like to use the database to identify all entities operating their programs that  had serious internal control or noncompliance problems disclosed in single  audit reports.", "The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 led to the establishment of an  automated database of single audit information\u2014the FAC database. OMB  Circular A-133 requires all entities that must submit single audit reports to  the FAC to prepare and submit a data collection form (SF-SAC Form) with  the audit report. The FAC uses this form as the source of the information  for its automated, Internet-accessibledatabase of information contained in  single audit reports. The database contains about 4 years of information on  over 30,000 annual single audit reports. The various data query options  available provide potential users, including program managers, auditors,  and other interested parties, with significant amounts of readily available  information on grant recipient financial management and internal control  systems and on compliance with federal laws and regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Single Audit Processes in Place but Use of Results Varies Significantly among Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Our survey results indicated that the CFO Act agencies have generally  developed processes and assigned responsibilities to meet their  requirements under the Single Audit Act, as amended. The CFO, IG, and  program offices perform these activities either individually or in  coordination with each other. Federal agencies indicated that they use  single audit results for many purposes. The most common reported use  was as a tool to monitor auditee compliance with administrative and  program requirements and to monitor the adequacy of internal controls.  Although agencies have identified many uses for the single audit results,  our survey results show that they are generally not using the FAC  automated database to obtain summary information on the audit results or  the entities that are receiving funds under their programs.

For example, in completing the survey, program office  officials indicated that they (1) ensure that award recipients are given  information that describes the federal award, (2) advise recipients of other  applicable award requirements, (3) advise recipients of the requirement to  obtain a single audit when they expend $300,000 or more in federal awards  in a year, (4) ensure that single audits are completed and the reports are  received in a timely manner, and (5) follow up on issues identified in the  reports that require corrective action. Specifically,    20 agency program offices responded that they ensure recipients are  given the information necessary to describe the federal award and  advise recipients of other applicable award information,    19 responded that they advise recipients of the requirements to obtain a  single audit when they expend $300,000 or more in federal awards in a  year,    19 responded that they follow up on issues that are identified in the  reports that require corrective action,    17 responded that they provide information to auditors about the federal    10 responded that they ensure that single audits are completed and the  reports are received in a timely manner.", "Additionally, at some agencies more than one office responded that they  are responsible for the application of the provisions of OMB Circular A-133.", "The FAC distributes single audit reports to each federal awarding agency  that has provided direct funding and for which the report identifies an audit  finding related to an award managed by that agency. Based on our survey,  receipt of single audit reports from the FAC and distribution of the reports  to the applicable agency office is predominately the responsibility of the  OIG. Our results show that 18 OIGs responded that they receive the single  audit reports directly from the FAC and that they distribute them to  applicable agency offices.", "Audits provide important information on recipient performance and are a  critical control that agencies can use to help ensure that entities that  receive federal funds use those funds in accordance with program rules  and regulations. Agency OIGs play a key role in this area by performing  quality control reviews (QCR) to ensure that the audit work performed  complies with auditing standards. Our survey results show that 10 of the  CFO Act agency OIGs performed 109 QCRs during fiscal year 2001,  although this total may be overstated since OIGs occasionally perform joint  QCRs and our survey did not capture information on the number of times  this occurred. Although the number of QCRs performed is small compared  to the approximately 30,000 single audits performed annually, several OIGs  conducting QCRs have identified problems with the audit work performed.  For example, 7 OIGs noted problems with the internal control and/or  compliance testing performed by the auditors, and 3 OIGs reported  problems relating to auditor compliance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "Audit follow-up is an integral part of good management and is a shared  responsibility of agency management officials and auditors. Corrective  action taken by the recipient on audit findings and recommendations is  essential to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of government  operations. In addition, federal agencies need to ensure that recipients take  timely and effective corrective action. OMB Circular A-133 notes that audit  follow-up is the responsibility of the federal awarding agency. The Circular  requires agencies to issue a management decision on audit findings within  6 months after receipt of the recipient\u2019s audit report and to ensure that the  recipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action.", "Analysis of our survey results indicates that both the IG and program  offices have a role in the audit follow-up process. For example, 15 IG and 9  program offices responded that they are responsible for reviewing reports  to verify that the report contains agency program-specific information.  When single audit reports do not have enough information, both IG and  program offices indicated that they follow up with either the recipient or  the auditor. Thirteen IG and 14 program offices stated that they follow up  with the recipient, and 13 IG and 10 program offices stated they follow up  with the auditor.", "Program offices, on the other hand, are responsible for evaluating the  corrective action plans filed by recipients to determine whether they  address the audit findings. Sixteen program offices responded that they are  responsible for evaluating the corrective action plans to determine whether  the issues are valid and what corrective action is necessary.

However, between 1 and 8 agencies indicated that, for several  reasons, they did not use the reports for some or all of these purposes.  When asked why they did not use single audit reports, several agencies  noted that their programs were too small to be covered in the scope of an  audit performed under the Single Audit Act. For example, the Single Audit  Act requires auditors to use combined expenditure and risk-based criteria  to determine which programs to include in the scope of a single audit.  Since the expenditure portion of the criteria identifies awards with large- dollar expenditures, agencies whose programs do not meet this criteria are  less likely to have their programs audited during a single audit.  Additionally, agencies said the single audit reports did not provide relevant  information for specific purposes such as support for the agency financial  statements or holding federal program offices accountable for  administrative and program compliance.
