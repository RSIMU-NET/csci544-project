Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), MOE requires districts to spend at least the same amount on special education services for students with disabilities that they spent in the preceding year, with some exceptions. In response to GAO's 50-state survey, states reported that nearly all districts met MOE based on the most recent data available in all states (school year 2012-13). However, most states reported that at least some of their districts faced challenges in doing so. In a separate GAO survey of districts, many cited budget and cost reductions\u2014such as state or local revenue declines and new state caps on benefits, which lowered the cost of a special education teacher\u2014as key challenges in meeting MOE.", "State and district officials had mixed views on MOE's effects on services for students with and without disabilities. MOE is one of several safeguards meant to protect special education funding, and while some officials reported positive effects, others said the requirement can sometimes create unintended consequences for the services provided to special education students. They said that because the MOE requirement lacks flexibility, it can discourage districts from altering their baseline of special education spending, even when doing so would benefit students with disabilities or result in more efficient delivery of the same services. For example, despite other grant provisions in IDEA that promote innovation, some district officials commented that the MOE requirement can serve as a disincentive to districts' efforts to pilot innovative or expanded services requiring a temporary increase in funds because it would commit them to higher spending going forward. In addition, some district officials noted that prioritizing special education spending to meet MOE resulted in cuts to general education spending that affected services for all students, including the many students with disabilities who spend much of their days in general education classrooms.", "The Department of Education's (Education) delayed monitoring feedback has hampered states' efforts to facilitate district compliance with MOE. In 2010, Education initiated its latest round of reviews of states' processes for overseeing their districts' compliance with IDEA, including MOE. However, Education currently has no standards for providing timely feedback on this process and\u2014as of August 2015\u2014had not provided feedback from these reviews to about half the states, due in part to competing priorities. Such delays are contrary to federal standards that call for prompt resolution of findings. Officials in one state said Education's untimely feedback had delayed the state's ability to provide guidance to districts regarding MOE, and in another state, monitoring was on hold until Education approved the state's process for determining MOE compliance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To promote innovation and efficiency while safeguarding special education funding, GAO suggests that Congress consider options for a more flexible local MOE, such as adopting a less stringent requirement.

In fiscal year 2015, Congress appropriated  $11.5 billion in federal IDEA, Part B funds to help defray the excess costs  of educating children with disabilities. To be eligible for these funds,  school districts must meet certain conditions, including what is called local  maintenance of effort (MOE). Local MOE generally requires that school  districts spend at least the same amount of money on the education of  children with disabilities that they spent in the preceding fiscal year.

We  received responses from 87, for a response rate of 84 percent. (See  apps. I and II for more information on our surveys.) We augmented these  surveys by gathering state-wide MOE data in five states: Alabama,  Arizona, Michigan, Texas, and Virginia. We selected these states to  represent diversity on a number of factors that could affect districts\u2019 ability  to meet MOE, such as recent changes in state funding for elementary and  secondary education and the number of districts in the state that  anticipated having trouble meeting MOE in our 2011 survey. (See app. III  for profiles of the five states included in our review.) We also conducted  interviews and reviewed additional documents in three of these states  (Michigan, Texas, and Virginia), chosen to reflect a variety of factors that  could affect their districts\u2019 ability to meet MOE. In each of these three  states, we interviewed officials at the state level and in four districts  representing a range of experiences with meeting MOE and reviewed  documents related to their processes for determining compliance with the  MOE requirement. In these three states we also contacted state-level  special education advisory panels representing individuals with disabilities  and parents, Protection and Advocacy programs, and state  associations representing school administrators.", "To examine characteristics of school districts that did and did not  anticipate trouble meeting MOE, we linked Education data on school  district characteristics to GAO\u2019s 2011 district survey and used our district  follow-up survey to compare characteristics of those districts that  ultimately did and did not meet MOE. We conducted similar analyses on  the characteristics of districts meeting and not meeting MOE in the five  states where we gathered statewide MOE data. Results of analyses  based on the 2011 survey are generalizable to school districts nationwide  in 2011, but results based on analyses of the five states and our district  follow-up survey are not nationally generalizable.

This indicates that the state and local share of special  education spending has done the opposite: generally increasing since  2005 and holding steady at about 84 percent since 2010. State and local  governments are responsible for funding most of the costs of special  education and other K-12 programs, relying primarily on state income and  sales tax, as well as local residential and commercial property taxes. As a  result of the 2008 national recession, however, state and local revenues  fell, resulting in cuts to education and other areas of spending.

Education  provides districts with various methods for calculating their MOE amount:  They can use only local funding or both state and local funding and can  base their calculation on either the total or per-pupil amount. Also, a  district may be able to reduce its expenditures and still meet the MOE  requirement if it qualifies for certain allowable exceptions or the funding  adjustment specified in IDEA law and regulations (see fig. 1).", "IDEA also contains a state MOE requirement for state funding of special  education.

As reflected in responses to our  district survey, illustrated in figure 6 below, and our discussions with  selected districts, often the key reasons that districts faced challenges or  failed to meet MOE involved circumstances that decreased special  education spending from one year to the next but were not covered by the  allowable exceptions and, in some cases, were outside the districts\u2019  control. Specifically, in response to our survey and in interviews at  selected sites, district officials identified budget or revenue reductions and  various circumstances related to cost reductions\u2014such as local actions to  implement efficiencies\u2014as key challenges in meeting MOE.", "Districts surveyed most frequently cited reductions in state funding of K- 12 education and reductions in the state contribution to funding for special  education as a factor in not meeting MOE (see fig. 6). The MOE  requirement does not include an exception for such challenges and is, in  fact, designed to protect special education funding in such circumstances.  Officials in one Texas district we interviewed told us their state funding  had been cut for the 2011-12 school year, in spite of an increase in the  district\u2019s student population. In response to reduced funding, the district  made cuts to special education as well as general education spending,  and as a result it had come close to not meeting MOE for the 2011-12  school year. A Virginia district we interviewed met MOE in 2011-12 and  2012-13, but officials said it has been difficult to maintain special  education expenditures because the county cut its funding in response to  declines in local revenue."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost Reductions", "paragraphs": ["District officials reported three different types of circumstances that can  result in reduced costs that are not allowable exceptions to MOE: (1) local  actions to increase efficiencies, (2) state policy changes to staff salary or  benefits, and (3) a gradual decline in enrollment over multiple years.", "Increased efficiencies. District officials we surveyed and interviewed  described various challenges stemming from efforts to implement  efficiencies, even when these changes had no effect on service  delivery. In response to our survey, 17 districts reported challenges  due to local actions to increase efficiencies in the provision of direct  services, and 14 districts reported challenges due to efficiencies in  administrative functions (see fig. 6). For example, a New Jersey  district official commented on our survey that his district failed to meet  MOE after reorganizing to share the cost of a special education  director with another district. Similarly, officials we interviewed in one  Michigan district told us that they negotiated a staff pay cut of 10  percent due to a budget deficit. As a result, they were paying 10  percent less for the same services. The district met MOE only  because Michigan elects to test its MOE compliance in aggregate with  other districts, according to local officials who oversee that district and  others. Another Michigan district we interviewed said that when they  had difficulty hiring a staff psychologist they had to contract for  psychologist services, which turned out to be less costly than what the  district spent on those services previously, causing challenges in  meeting MOE. A Texas district official told us that when their state  funding was cut, they reduced costs by increasing the number of  classes taught by middle and high school teachers, allowing them to  cut 237 staff positions without eliminating any courses, programs, or  special education services. Despite continuing to deliver the same  services, because it was less costly, they came close to not meeting  MOE.", "State salary or benefit changes. Survey respondents from 15  districts cited state policy changes to teacher or staff salary or benefits  as a challenge (see fig. 6). All districts we interviewed in Michigan told  us they faced challenges meeting MOE when the state legislature  passed a law capping the amount that public employers, such as  school districts, could contribute toward employee health benefits.  This effectively reduced the amount districts spent on special  education teachers and other staff, the majority of any district\u2019s  special education spending. One Michigan district we visited was very  small and had only one special education teacher. As a result of the  new state cap, officials said that their teacher decided to opt out of the  district\u2019s health insurance plan for the 2013-14 school year, which  decreased their special education spending by about $10,000. The  district did not meet MOE on its own for 2013-14, but it did meet it in  aggregate with other districts (the level the state tests for compliance),  according to local officials.", "Gradual enrollment decline. Officials we interviewed in several  selected districts said meeting MOE could be a challenge if a district  experienced a gradual decline in enrollment over multiple years that  eventually resulted in needing fewer special education teachers on  staff. In the three states we visited, officials interpreted the decreasing  enrollment exception as applying only to year-to-year decreases. One  local official in Michigan who oversees several school districts said  that they have experienced gradual reductions in special education  caseloads as a result of population decline that do not always  necessitate immediate staff reductions. He explained that if districts  let one staff member go at the end of each year, it would be easier to  meet MOE using either the per capita calculation or the exception for  a decrease in enrollment (see fig. 1 for a description of MOE  calculations and exceptions). However, districts often wait 3 or 4  years until they reach a crisis point and have to lay off two or more  special education staff, which makes meeting MOE more difficult.  Officials in one of the districts he oversees explained that they would  not eliminate staff positions due to the loss of only two or three  students, but over the course of 5 years, a gradual decline could  justify a decrease in staff."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "States and Districts Report That MOE Protects Funding, but Can Create Unintended Consequences Affecting Services for Students", "paragraphs": ["State and district officials had mixed views on MOE\u2019s effects on services  for students with and without disabilities.

Instead, they  said they fund special education services based on the IEP process and  are required by law to provide the services outlined in those plans  regardless of MOE. However, a disability advocate we interviewed noted  that the amount of services districts prescribe in the IEP is often  determined by the funding available, and MOE helps to prevent districts  from decreasing those funds. \u201cMOE hinders our ability to offer  innovative methods for delivery of  services, if the cost of the new, innovative  method is less than in the previous year.\u201d  \u201cThe MOE requirement also fosters a lack  of innovation in the program [special  education] for fear of adding to the  spending base.\u201d", "At the same time, some state and district officials we interviewed said  MOE can discourage efforts to implement innovations or expand services.  For example, some district officials we spoke with said that because of  MOE, they do not want to commit to a higher level of spending to  implement innovative services, despite other provisions in IDEA that are  intended to encourage innovation. An official in one Texas district said  that although their special education director recommended expanding  their integrated athletics program for children with disabilities, they chose  not to because they did not want to commit to the increased costs in an  environment of ongoing budget uncertainty. Similarly, a Michigan district  official said that program innovations, such as introducing new technology  or new co-teaching methods, can be costly to implement and cannot be  piloted and discontinued if unsuccessful without decreasing spending and  jeopardizing the district\u2019s ability to meet MOE. This concern is consistent  with our past work that concluded that federal MOE requirements without  sufficient flexibility can discourage program expansion and innovation.", "Moreover, as noted earlier, implementing efficiencies can create  challenges in meeting MOE. As a result, some district officials said that  MOE can discourage efforts to implement efficiencies that could help  reduce costs and can lead to unnecessary spending to comply with the  requirement. For example, one Wisconsin district official commenting on  Education\u2019s 2013 NPRM said that because of state legislative changes  that required reductions in their contributions to teacher benefits, they had  to find other ways to spend money on special education to meet MOE  regardless of whether the expenditures were needed. Further, a Virginia  state education official we interviewed said that Virginia districts feel  penalized for complying with IDEA\u2019s directive to serve more students with  disabilities in general education classrooms since this more inclusive  model can be less costly than placing all these students in special  education classrooms; yet the MOE requirement is not flexible enough to  allow for this without putting districts at risk of failing to meet MOE. At  the same time, a disability advocate we interviewed noted that if districts  do have cost savings in special education, districts should reinvest those  savings back into special education.", "Similarly, district officials reported mixed views about whether MOE had  positive or negative effects on students in our 2015 follow-up survey of  districts that had indicated in 2011 that they anticipated trouble meeting  MOE in 2011-12. More districts said MOE had a positive effect on  services for students with disabilities than for students without disabilities.  But, even for students with disabilities, the majority of districts said it had  a negative effect or no effect on services for these students (see fig. 7).  Several district officials noted that protecting special education funding  does not necessarily equate to protecting or improving special education  services. For example, a Minnesota district official said the 100 percent  MOE requirement may discourage districts from striving to make students  with disabilities as independent as possible if such actions would reduce  special education spending. He was concerned that not enough attention  was being given in the IEP process to encouraging greater independence  and inclusion and that the process was being driven by maintaining  expenses rather than responding to the evolving needs of students. Also,  a Texas district official commented that a district could still meet MOE if it  were to give a 3-percent raise to special education educators while  reducing costs related to services and programs by an equal amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Districts Reported That MOE Contributes to Budget Pressures That Can Lead to Cuts in General Education Services", "paragraphs": ["When districts experience reductions in state and local funding and are  forced to make cuts, they generally must prioritize special education to  meet the MOE requirement, which can result in cuts to general education  services. The 100 percent requirement is significantly stricter than the 90  percent MOE requirement established by law for other K-12 education  programs and provides districts less latitude to adjust spending to  minimize negative effects on services. Moreover, while state education  funding may be beginning to recover from the recession, many districts  have experienced severe budget challenges in the last 4 years. For  example, according to Education data for fiscal year 2011, 33 states  had decreases in their state and local K-12 per-pupil revenue, and for 20  of these states, the decreases ranged between 2 and 13 percent. In our  2015 district follow-up survey, about half of those responding (44 of 87)  reported reducing general education spending at least once during school  years 2011-12 through 2013-14. Of those reporting reductions, about half  (21) said MOE was one of several reasons for the cut, and one district  reported that MOE was the primary reason in at least one of these school  years (see fig. 8). In addition, one Virginia district official we interviewed  noted that if a district is penalized for not meeting MOE, the penalties hurt  students by further reducing already constrained district resources.", "As figure 9 shows, cuts to general education spending can affect services  in a variety of ways. Responses from the 22 districts that attributed  general education service cuts, at least in part, to MOE, indicated that  these cuts often led to reductions in teachers and support staff, classroom  materials, and technology. Some district officials we interviewed noted  that such cuts can result in increased classroom sizes, decreased class  offerings, and reduced extracurricular activities.", "General education service reductions negatively affect all students\u2014both  those with and without disabilities. But this may be especially true for the  growing number of special education students being served in general  education classrooms\u2014another unintended consequence of MOE.  Education recently reported that the percentage of special education  students spending at least 80 percent of their school day in general  education classrooms increased from 33 percent in 1990\u201391 to 61  percent in 2012\u201313. One Virginia district official we interviewed said  students with disabilities served in general education classrooms were  particularly affected by increased classroom sizes resulting from  reductions in general education spending."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Delayed Feedback and Evolving Policies Have Frustrated State Efforts to Facilitate Districts\u2019 MOE Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Education\u2019s delayed monitoring feedback and evolving policies over the  past decade (see fig. 10) have hindered states\u2019 efforts to facilitate  compliance with the MOE requirement, according to state officials.

Education began its latest round of IDEA  programmatic and fiscal monitoring in 2010, initiating the new monitoring  cycle with verification visits to 16 states. Then in 2011, Education  removed the fiscal component from its visits and merged the findings from  that component with the fiscal monitoring it was conducting for the  Recovery Act. From that point on, the merged fiscal monitoring effort was  conducted through desk audits rather than site visits, and as a result,  Education officials told us that they were able to complete the bulk of  these reviews of all 50 states by the end of 2012.", "In 2010, when Education began its latest round of monitoring, it had a  performance standard to provide feedback to states within 88 days of a  verification visit. However, Education did not set a performance  standard for the merged fiscal monitoring reviews. We found that  although the bulk of these reviews were completed by the end of 2012, as  of August 2015, 22 states were still waiting for Education to provide  results letters telling them whether their fiscal monitoring systems comply  with federal requirements. The delay of 3 years or more in providing  written feedback to states significantly exceeds the timeframes Education  had considered reasonable for its previous verification visits and is  inconsistent with federal government standards that call for the findings of  audits and other reviews to be promptly resolved.", "States reported that Education\u2019s delayed feedback has kept them from  taking corrective actions in a timely way. For example, an Oregon state  official we interviewed as part of our survey follow-up told us Education  conducted its fiscal monitoring of the state in 2010 but did not provide  feedback requiring corrective action until the fall of 2014. The state official  told us the state is in the process of taking corrective actions in response  to Education\u2019s findings but said it could have taken such steps earlier to  better facilitate district compliance had Education provided more timely  feedback. Similarly, state officials in Delaware told us they experienced  delays of more than a year while in discussions with Education on the  state\u2019s proposed changes to bring the state\u2019s MOE calculation  methodology into compliance. The state put its monitoring of MOE on  hold until Education approves its proposed changes because those  changes will require updates to the state\u2019s information technology system  which will take time and resources. In the meantime, state officials said  they are unable to determine whether districts are meeting the MOE  requirement.", "Education officials told us competing priorities and staffing issues  contributed to the delays in providing states feedback. For example, they  said they were implementing a new accountability system and finalizing  revised regulations for MOE that Education issued in April 2015. They  also said they were working to eliminate a backlog of independent audit  reviews that contained findings pertaining to IDEA programs. Education  officials also said that, while dealing with these competing priorities,  multiple staff involved in the monitoring process left Education and that it  took time to replace them.", "At the time of our review, Education officials said they would like to  release the findings for the remaining states by fall of 2015. However,  some fiscal monitoring letters were undergoing departmental review\u2014one  of the final steps before release\u2014while others were still in the drafting  stage. Also, because so much time had elapsed since its monitoring  reviews, Education was contacting some states again to ensure it had up- to-date information about those states\u2019 monitoring systems and to confirm  that the findings from its reviews were still relevant. As of August 2015\u2014 the most recent data Education provided\u201422 states were still waiting for  feedback.", "Education officials told us they are planning to begin piloting their next  cycle of IDEA monitoring during fiscal year 2016.

They identified two areas, in particular, as having caused  the most confusion and frustration: (1) the existence of two MOE  standards and (2) the level of spending required after failing to meet  MOE.", "Standards for eligibility and compliance. In two states, the state  officials we interviewed indicated uncertainty about the need to meet  MOE based on two different standards: eligibility (based on a district\u2019s  budgeted amounts) and compliance (based on a district\u2019s actual  expenditures). Apparently other states had also been confused about  this. Despite Education\u2019s policy letters that attempted to clarify the  existence of two standards, in the preamble to its 2013 NPRM,  Education acknowledged that some states had still not understood  that two different standards were in place based on the wording of the  2006 regulations. To address this issue, in its April 2015 final rule,  Education made revisions to clearly label and explain the differences  between the two standards. Officials in one state also told us that  implementing the eligibility standard would require them to modify  their data systems. \u201cSubsequent years\u201d rule. Some states and special education  stakeholders had generally understood MOE to require a district to  maintain the level of spending from the previous year, even if they had  failed to meet MOE in that year (referred to as the \u201csubsequent years\u201d  rule). The 2006 regulations did not specifically address this issue, but  in a 2011 policy letter, Education confirmed this general  understanding. In April 2012, however, Education reversed this policy  and instead said that a district\u2019s required level of spending after failing  to meet MOE is equal to the amount it should have expended in the  prior year had it met MOE. Congress included similar language in two  separate appropriations acts, and Education\u2019s April 2015 final rule  included a provision codifying this interpretation and examples of how  states should apply this rule. Officials in two states told us this  change in the guidance frustrated their efforts to monitor districts\u2019  compliance with MOE, and in one state, required them to change their  tracking systems.", "In its 2013 NPRM, Education acknowledged that the MOE requirement is  complex and that a significant lack of understanding of the requirement  had persisted. To help states navigate this complexity and to promote a  better understanding of MOE, the April 2015 final rule includes several  tables detailing how to comply with the requirement. In addition,  Education officials said they have provided a webinar, presentations at  Education\u2019s IDEA leadership conference, and a written question and  answer document to help explain the revised regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and School Districts Want More Technical Assistance, Information Sharing, and Training", "paragraphs": ["Education has provided various types of technical assistance regarding  compliance with MOE, as required under IDEA, but more may be  needed.

In our survey, many states commented that they  had relied on these centers for support related to the MOE requirement.  In 2014, Education moved away from a regional assistance model to a  more centralized approach and established two new national technical  assistance centers, the Center for IDEA Fiscal Reporting (CIFR) and the  National Center for Systemic Improvement (NCSI). Education officials told  us that NCSI will provide some general fiscal technical assistance to  states, but that any detailed technical assistance on the MOE requirement  will come from CIFR.", "CIFR is charged with providing technical assistance to states on  collecting and reporting special education fiscal data. It plans to work  collaboratively with states and other federally funded technical assistance  centers to (1) improve the capacity of states to collect and report accurate  fiscal data and (2) increase states\u2019 knowledge of the underlying fiscal  requirements and the calculations necessary to submit valid and reliable  data, according to its website. However, it is too early to assess how  effective CIFR will be in achieving these goals. Since opening its doors in  November 2014, CIFR has launched its website, conducted introductory  webinars targeted to states, and established a listserv that 45 of 60 states  and entities have joined. It is collecting data from the states to develop a  database about each state\u2019s fiscal reporting that will be used by CIFR to  plan its technical assistance activities and is holding regional meetings  and communities of practice for states to exchange information on various  fiscal and programmatic issues, including those related to the MOE  requirement. Education officials told us they anticipate that CIFR will be  able to provide technical assistance and facilitate information sharing  among states related to the MOE.", "The results of our surveys and interviews indicate that states value  Education\u2019s technical assistance (see fig. 11), and several states added  that they would like Education to provide additional technical assistance,  training, tools, and opportunities to share information across states.", "While Education is charged with providing technical assistance to the  states, the states, in turn, are charged with providing assistance and  support to their districts. In response to our state survey, states reported  providing technical assistance, training, and tools to school districts to  assist them in complying with the MOE requirement. Among the school  districts we surveyed, well over the majority indicated these resources  were useful.", "However, in our interviews and in our 2015 follow-up survey, school  districts reported that they would like additional training to help them  comply with the MOE requirement. For example, some districts officials  we interviewed specifically stressed the need to have training for special  education directors, finance or business managers, and superintendents  because each plays a role in decisions affecting MOE compliance. Some  districts we surveyed commented that they would like assistance in  managing and tracking their MOE status throughout the year. One district  specifically noted that they wanted to be more pro-active in ensuring  compliance, while others wanted more transparency in how their state  calculates MOE. In Virginia, though districts submit data to the state  annually, the state\u2019s system allows districts to enter their expenditures  throughout the year to track MOE. Officials in one district we interviewed  said this was extremely helpful, allowing them to track their compliance  with MOE on an ongoing basis. \u201cWe experienced cuts in state funding for  special education that dropped us below  the MOE required for state and local  expenditures combined, but our local  funding for special education increased  during the same period. We think we  could have met MOE if we had been able  to use one of the local only calculations.\u201d states said that they do not routinely use all four calculations to  determine MOE, in some cases because the data on state and  local funds that districts use for MOE calculations are pooled  together. This means that districts in their states do not have  ready access to the data needed for the two MOE calculations  based on local expenditures separately. For example, an Arizona  state education agency official we interviewed said the state does  not maintain separate records for state and local expenditures;  therefore, the state would have to redesign its system in order to  use the local-only calculation. Further, a Tennessee official  commented that it would be helpful if Education could assist in  identifying ways to track local funds when state and local funds  are separated. More information sharing across states could be  helpful, as well: In Texas, where the state system also does not  separate state and local expenditures, the state educational  agency had recently developed a way for districts to impute their  local only expenditures using a newly created state tool, which  could potentially benefit other states. \u201cWe would like to be able to claim as an  exception those teachers who leave the  special education program but remain in  the district in other positions. It is more  cost-effective for us to retain trained  special education teachers than to let  them go because a student who needed  that expertise is no longer served by the  district.\u201d", "Use of exceptions. Similarly, the ability to use exceptions could  also be important to districts facing challenges in meeting MOE,  because these provisions may enable districts to reduce their  expenditures and still meet the MOE requirement. However, we  found that some state officials had questions about how to  implement these provisions. For instance, a Rhode Island state  official commented to Education\u2019s 2013 NPRM that more  guidance for determining the dollar threshold for an \u201cexceptionally  costly\u201d program is needed. Another state official from Colorado  asked for additional guidance on the exception for \u201ctermination of  costly expenditures for long-term purchases.\u201d Also, an official from  Louisiana who responded to our state survey said examples of  allowable exceptions would be helpful. The lack of clarity of how  exceptions should be applied was further evidenced in the states  we visited, where we found states used different criteria for  applying certain exceptions (see table 3). In its 2013 NPRM,  Education acknowledged that some states were not applying the  exceptions correctly or were not applying them at all."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Across the federal government, MOE requirements are important  mechanisms for helping to ensure that federal spending achieves its  purpose. The local MOE requirement under IDEA is intended to  safeguard local financial support for educating the over 6 million children  in the United States who require special education services. Meeting  MOE generally is not a problem for districts when state and local  economies and tax revenues are strong and when districts experience  increases in the numbers of students with disabilities. But when state and  local economies falter as they did during the 2008 recession, or when  districts experience declines in numbers of students with disabilities, as  has been the trend recently, meeting the local MOE requirement can  become a challenge. Most states reported that at least some districts  faced challenges in meeting the requirement, despite exceptions intended  to help in such situations. Current exceptions do not address the key  challenges that districts face, including factors that are outside of their  control and that do not affect the level of services provided to students  with disabilities. In these situations, it is unclear whether funds spent on  special education to comply with MOE result in enhanced services for  students with disabilities.", "Further, the MOE requirement\u2019s lack of flexibility can lead to unintended  consequences that affect services for students with disabilities. IDEA\u2019s  100 percent MOE requirement is stricter than the 90 percent MOE  requirements mandated for other K-12 education programs. Our previous  work has shown that such rigidity can discourage program expansion and  innovation, and we found examples of this within the IDEA program. We  also found that such rigidity resulted in reductions in general education  services that benefit all students\u2014including students with disabilities, a  large and increasing number of whom are served for much of their day in  general education classrooms. A less rigid MOE requirement would allow  districts more latitude to adjust their spending at the margins\u2014focused on  providing the best services to address the most pressing needs of  students with disabilities\u2014while mitigating the effects of unintended  consequences.", "Education\u2019s lack of timely monitoring feedback has hampered some  states\u2019 efforts to facilitate school district compliance with MOE\u2014a key  requirement of the law. Although Education completed its fiscal  monitoring reviews in 2012, 3 years later nearly half the states are still  waiting for feedback on their monitoring results. In addition, some districts  may be failing to meet MOE because limitations to their state financial  systems do not allow them to use all four MOE calculations, as provided  for in Education\u2019s regulations. Because these various ways of calculating  MOE are intended to provide districts with the ability to calculate MOE  based on local circumstances, the ability to create workarounds to use  these calculations could be the difference between a district meeting  MOE or not. Providing more technical assistance and facilitating more  information-sharing among states and districts could help them navigate  the complexities of the local MOE requirement and avoid the detrimental  effects of noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To help districts address key challenges in meeting MOE and mitigate  unintended consequences that may affect services for students with  disabilities, while preserving the safeguard for funding for students with  disabilities, Congress should consider options for a more flexible MOE  requirement.

For example, current  exceptions could be changed to allow one-time increases in spending  without changing a district\u2019s MOE baseline in order to encourage pilot  innovations or to allow certain spending decreases (e.g., state caps on  teacher benefits), as long as a district can demonstrate the decrease  does not negatively affect services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen states\u2019 monitoring and facilitate local MOE compliance, the  Secretary of Education should establish and document set timeframes for providing prompt feedback  to states on findings from its next cycle of IDEA fiscal monitoring; and prioritize technical assistance and information sharing across states  on ways to facilitate local MOE compliance with respect to the use of  the four calculation methods and the exceptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to the Department of Education for  review and comment.

This data set is comprised  of fiscal and non-fiscal data collected annually about all public schools,  public school districts, and state educational agencies in the United  States. The CCD data elements and years we used for each part of our  analysis are summarized in table 5. To assess the reliability of the CCD  data elements used for our analysis, we reviewed existing documentation  about the data system from the National Center for Education Statistics  and conducted electronic testing. In a few cases where a district\u2019s  variable values were illogical, we changed the values or set them to  missing for purposes of our analysis.", "We linked the CCD data to three different sources of information on  district experiences with MOE. The methodology and results of each of  these analyses are described below.  1.   GAO\u2019s 2011 survey of school districts. To examine the  characteristics of districts facing challenges and not facing challenges  meeting MOE, we linked the CCD data to responses to the question  on GAO\u2019s 2011 survey of school districts that asked, \u201cDo you currently  anticipate your LEA  having trouble meeting  the IDEA Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement for 2011-12?\u201d This  survey was sent to a nationally generalizable sample of school  districts, which means that the results of our analysis are  generalizable to the total population of school districts in 2011. For  our characteristic analysis of 2011 survey respondents, we primarily  used CCD data from the 2010-11 school year, which described district  characteristics in the year of the survey. See table 6 below for the  findings of this analysis.  2.   GAO\u2019s 2015 follow-up survey of a subset of school districts. To  examine the characteristics of a subset of districts both meeting and  not meeting, as well as facing challenges and not facing challenges  meeting MOE, we linked the CCD data to responses to our 2015  follow-up survey of those school districts that anticipated having  trouble meeting MOE for 2011-12. For our characteristics analysis of  our follow-up survey respondents, we primarily used the most recent  CCD data available at the time.", "In comparing the districts responding to our survey that they met MOE  with those responding that they did not, we found some differences in  the average characteristics between these two groups but did not  report on these differences because the small size of the not-meeting  group (7 districts) made it unlikely that these differences were  meaningful. In comparing the districts responding to our survey that  meeting MOE had been a challenge with those responding that it had  not been a challenge, the largest differences were in total enrollment,  change in total enrollment and number of students with IEPs from the  prior year, and change in local revenue from the prior year. However,  the results of this analysis reflect only the characteristics of those  districts that responded to the follow-up survey and are not  generalizable to the total population of school districts in either 2011  or 2015.  3.   Five states\u2019 MOE data for all their districts. To examine the  characteristics of districts meeting and not meeting MOE in the five  states that provided us with detailed MOE data on all their districts  statewide (Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, Texas, and Virginia), we  linked the CCD data to information provided to us by these five states  on their school districts\u2019 MOE status for school years 2011-12 and  2012-13. For our characteristics analysis of the districts in our five  selected states, we primarily used CCD data from the years  corresponding to their MOE data. To assess the reliability of state  MOE data, we interviewed state officials and reviewed the data for  logical inconsistencies. In two cases, states submitted revised MOE  data based on our follow-up questions. Although we could not verify  that all state MOE data were completely accurate, we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, which were to  examine the general extent of districts meeting and not meeting MOE  and their use of the exceptions and funding adjustment.", "The results of this analysis reflect only the characteristics of the  districts in these five states and are not generalizable to the total  population of school districts. In addition, because so few districts did  not meet MOE in these states, we could not identify meaningful  differences between districts that did and did not meet, and patterns in  the characteristics of districts not meeting MOE were inconsistent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Shortfall Amounts in Districts Failing to Meet Local MOE Requirement", "paragraphs": ["When a school district fails to meet MOE, the state is liable to return to  the Department of Education\u2014using non-federal funds\u2014an amount equal  to the district\u2019s shortfall amount or its IDEA grant, whichever is lower.  According to Education officials, states return funds to Education\u2019s Office  of the Chief Financial Officer. These funds are identified by the grant  number, but there is no way to identify monies returned due to  noncompliance with MOE, specifically. Officials in the Office of Special  Education Programs said they were working with the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer to better track funds returned for this reason. We  followed up with the 14 states reporting in our survey that some of their  school districts failed to meet the local MOE requirement in the 2012-13  school year and requested information on the amount of the shortfall for  those districts that year. Based on the states\u2019 responses, we estimate  that, as of May 2015, the shortfall nationwide in the 2012-13 school year  amounted to at least $877,000 total. However, this amount is understated  because 2 of the 14 states were unable to provide the amounts of their  districts\u2019 shortfalls at the time.", "Of the 14 states reporting district shortfalls, 11 confirmed they had  returned at least a portion of the funds to Education, with 10 of the 11  confirming that they had recouped at least a portion of the shortfall  amounts from the districts. At the time we did our work, repayment of  funds was still pending in the remaining 3 states.", "Among the five states for which we analyzed MOE data, three had at  least one district that did not meet MOE in 2011-12 or 2012-13. According  to the data provided by these states, the shortfalls for their districts were  as follows:  In Virginia, while all districts met MOE in 2011-12, one district did not  meet MOE in 2012-13, and its shortfall, after accounting for allowable  exceptions, was about $320,000, which represented less than 1  percent of the district\u2019s expenditures of state and local funds for  special education in that year. Virginia officials reported that the state  had returned this amount to Education.", "In Arizona, six districts did not meet MOE in 2011-12, and five did not  meet in 2012-13. The shortfall amounts, after accounting for allowable  exceptions, ranged from less than $100 to about $220,000. The  average shortfall in these districts was about 6 percent of the districts\u2019  state and local expenditures in 2011-12, and about 4 percent in 2012- 13. At the time Arizona reported these data, the state noted it had  returned some but not all of these shortfall amounts to Education.", "In Texas, officials reported that one district did not meet MOE in 2011- 12, and four did not meet MOE in 2012-13. In three of these five  districts, the state reported that auditors had not found an actual  shortfall. State officials later clarified that in the district originally found  out of compliance with MOE for 2011-12, they had not sustained this  finding. For the two districts for which the state reported shortfalls, the  amounts were about $25,000 and about $40,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comparison of Education\u2019s 2006 and 2015 Regulations on MOE", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Jacqueline M.
