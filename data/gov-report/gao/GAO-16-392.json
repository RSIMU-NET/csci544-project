As of January 15, 2016, NIH owned or supported 561 chimpanzees in four facilities, including Chimp Haven, which was established as a federal chimpanzee retirement sanctuary in accordance with the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act. In late 2015, NIH announced that all NIH-owned chimpanzees were eligible for retirement to Chimp Haven.", "In 2013, Congress amended the Act authorizing appropriations for NIH's Chimpanzee Management Program through FY2018, with a provision for GAO to evaluate certain aspects of this program. In this report GAO examines: (1) the research and retirement status of chimpanzees owned or supported by NIH; (2) the costs for their care and transfers; and (3) potential cost savings associated with NIH's goal to transfer chimpanzees to Chimp Haven. GAO analyzed laws, regulations, and agency and facility policies, procedures, and data. GAO also visited the facilities, interviewed NIH and facility officials, and reviewed federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NIH-owned and NIH-supported chimpanzees are no longer used in invasive biomedical research, which is research that involves medical treatment outside of normal veterinary care. However, all NIH-owned and NIH-supported chimpanzees are eligible for use in non-invasive research, such as observational and behavioral research, even at the federal chimpanzee retirement sanctuary, Chimp Haven. Most of the 561 chimpanzees that NIH owned or supported as of January 15, 2016, had not been retired to Chimp Haven, which housed179 NIH-owned chimpanzees at that time.", "The costs NIH incurred to care for these chimpanzees varied among the facilities. For example, for the care provided from federal fiscal year 2013 through 2015, the average cost per-chimpanzee per-day incurred by NIH at the four facilities ranged from a low of $41 to a high of $61. The characteristics of each facility contributed to cost variations. For example, NIH's costs were lowest at Chimp Haven, which was likely attributable to matching fund requirements Chimp Haven must meet as defined in federal statute. Since FY2013, NIH has transferred 121 chimpanzees to Chimp Haven and incurred a total of $49,760 (or $411 per transferred chimpanzee) for those transfers.", "NIH's goal to consolidate chimpanzees to Chimp Haven should result in savings, but the lack of long-term planning could diminish savings potential. Savings should occur largely because NIH's costs are lowest at Chimp Haven. NIH has communicated short-term plans to transfer to Chimp Haven 19 of the 382 chimpanzees that continue to be housed at other facilities, but according to agency officials, it has not developed or communicated a clear implementation plan to transfer the remaining chimpanzees, in part because of uncertainties about the available space at Chimp Haven. However, NIH has information about Chimp Haven's current capacity and about anticipated space that will become available as a result of chimpanzee mortality. Absent a clear implementation plan, the four facilities that care for NIH-owned or NIH-supported chimpanzees may not have the information they need to care for the chimpanzees in the most cost-effective way that considers the timing of the transfers and the welfare needs of the chimpanzees. For example, if facility officials have estimates of the number of chimpanzees that are expected to be transferred into or out of their facility within a given timeframe, they can then plan for appropriate increases or decreases in staffing levels. Moreover, the absence of such a plan is inconsistent with federal internal control standards that call for effective communication of quality information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Health of Human Services direct NIH to develop a clear implementation plan to meet its goal for the transfer of chimpanzees to Chimp Haven that considers both costs and chimpanzee welfare.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH)  owned or provided ongoing financial support for many of the  chimpanzees used in this research. Over time, evolving research  methods and technologies provided alternatives to the use of  chimpanzees in these areas of research, and, since 2011, NIH has taken  a number of steps that have resulted in suspending the use of its owned  or supported chimpanzees in any new invasive biomedical research  projects.", "As of January 15, 2016, NIH\u2019s Chimpanzee Management Program  provided for the care and maintenance of 561 NIH-owned or NIH- supported chimpanzees located in four facilities in the United States.  One of the facilities, Chimp Haven, was established in 1995 and  designated in 2002 as a federal chimpanzee retirement sanctuary to  provide for the retirement care of chimpanzees that have been used in  federal research, in accordance with the Chimpanzee Health  Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act (CHIMP Act). NIH  provides funding to each of the four facilities for the care, maintenance,  and transfer of the chimpanzees. In 2013, NIH announced that the  majority of NIH-owned chimpanzees would be moved to the federally  funded sanctuary at Chimp Haven as space became available and  permanently retired from invasive biomedical research. At the same time,  it announced a strategy to select approximately 50 chimpanzees from  among those it owned or supported, which would be maintained for such  research studies. More recently, in the summer of 2015, the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service added captive chimpanzees to the Federal List of  Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, which added restrictions to the  potential use of chimpanzees in such research. After this decision, NIH  announced that all of the NIH-owned chimpanzees were now eligible for  retirement to the federal sanctuary as space permitted.

We chose this period because these were the years for which the  most recent complete data were available. The contract and grant award  years for each facility varied with each other and did not align with the  federal fiscal year (October 1 through September 30). To enable  comparisons across the four facilities, we calculated the costs per- chimpanzee per-day for each facility by federal fiscal year. Specifically,  we first allocated grant award amounts, contract award amounts, or  contract invoices associated with chimpanzee care over each year of the  respective grant or contract and recalculated these amounts to align with  federal fiscal years. We also determined the total number of days of care  provided to each chimpanzee within each federal fiscal year, taking into  account dates of chimpanzee deaths and transfers either into or out of the  facility, and calculated a total number of days of care within each federal  fiscal year across all chimpanzees at each facility. We then divided the  total dollar amount associated with each federal fiscal year by the total  number of days of chimpanzee care associated with each fiscal year. We  also obtained data on costs incurred for the transportation of  chimpanzees during this same period of time.

We interviewed the following: officials from NIH about the institute\u2019s cost  savings approaches and efforts undertaken or considered to consolidate  facilities to achieve savings from improved economies of scale; officials  from the four facilities to determine the extent that NIH has communicated  its cost savings goals to determine whether NIH\u2019s goals were consistently  reported; and an expert on the captive chimpanzee population to gain an  understanding of the life expectancy of captive chimpanzees and other  factors related to their care.

In December 2011, the IOM  issued a report that concluded that the use of chimpanzees in most  biomedical research of human diseases was unnecessary because other  experimental models have been developed and some studies can now be  done using humans. Subsequently, NIH issued an interim policy  suspending support of new research projects using chimpanzees while  the agency considered the IOM report.

See  table 3.", "Factors associated with the characteristics of each facility likely  contributed to the variation in the costs. For example, the generally lower  costs incurred by NIH for chimpanzee care at Chimp Haven compared to  the other three facilities were likely attributable to the requirement that  Chimp Haven match 1 dollar for every 3 dollars in federal funding for  operating expenses\u2014a 25 percent matching requirement that Chimp  Haven met throughout the time period we analyzed. Because of these  matching requirements, while the actual average cost of care per- chimpanzee per-day on average at Chimp Haven during the time period  we analyzed was about $55, the share of those costs incurred by NIH  was about $41 per-chimpanzee per-day. In contrast to Chimp Haven, NIH  fully funded the reported costs or grant awards for chimpanzee care at  the other three facilities. In addition, costs may have been lower at the  two large primate research facilities, Keeling and SNPRC, compared to  Alamogordo because they were likely able to realize economies of scale  associated with the sharing of staff and resources with their larger primate  programs\u2014officials from both facilities reported that they shared staff and  resources in this way. Alamogordo, which only houses chimpanzees,  does not have the ability to share resources in this way. However,  Alamogordo had notably reduced costs between federal fiscal years 2014  and 2015. Alamogordo officials reported that they were able to do this by  taking a number of cost-cutting measures. For example, they reduced  staff and associated overhead, made changes to payroll, accounting, and  information technology functions, and switched from brand name to  generic drugs whenever possible. Through these efforts, costs per- chimpanzee per-day were reduced by more than $6.00.", "At SNPRC costs incurred by NIH varied widely for the NIH-owned  compared to the NIH-supported chimpanzees. Of the 100 chimpanzees at  SNPRC as of the end of the first quarter of federal fiscal year 2016, NIH  owned only 19, and funding for the care of these chimpanzees was  provided through a cooperative agreement, which could only be used to  fund the care of its NIH-owned chimpanzees. The other 81 chimpanzees  were owned by SNPRC, not NIH, but NIH provided some financial  support for those chimpanzees through a different grant\u2014a grant which  provided funding for SNPRC\u2019s larger primate program and out of which a  portion was used to support some of the care of chimpanzees. Based on  an analysis of these two different funding sources, we found that the per- chimpanzee per-day costs incurred by NIH were significantly higher for  the NIH-owned chimpanzees at this facility compared to those that were  supported by NIH. For example, the average cost per-chimpanzee per- day during the time period covering federal fiscal years 2013 through  2015 was $78 for the NIH-owned chimpanzees and $42 for the NIH- supported chimpanzees. According to SNPRC officials, NIH-incurred  costs for the NIH-supported chimpanzees are lower at their facility  because the grant covering these chimpanzees is designed to be  supplemented by other research funds.

Further, economies of scale can be achieved by increasing the  number of chimpanzees at Chimp Haven and thereby presenting  opportunities for cost savings. According to Chimp Haven officials,  economies of scale can be achieved when some fixed costs\u2014such as the  costs for the upkeep of the facilities that house chimpanzees, staffing  experts to care for the chimpanzees, and other costs related to the care  and enrichment of the animals\u2014can be applied to large numbers of  chimpanzees. In addition, the chimpanzee housing at Chimp Haven\u2014 which includes large corral habitats and open-air habitats that require less  maintenance than caged facilities and can accommodate larger  chimpanzee social groups than the housing available at the other  facilities\u2014can facilitate cost efficiencies.

Based on the most recent per- chimpanzee per-day costs, on an annualized basis, NIH should save  about $270,000 within one year as a result of the transfer of these 19  chimpanzees to Chimp Haven. NIH will incur some costs associated  with transporting these 19 chimpanzees to Chimp Haven; however, the  savings associated with the lower costs per-chimpanzee per-day will  outweigh these transportation costs over time. For example, if the costs  NIH incurs for transporting these chimpanzees is similar to the costs it  incurred for recent transports ($411 per chimpanzee), then total NIH- incurred costs for the transport of the 19 chimpanzees would be about  $8,000. Even if the costs for transferring these 19 chimpanzees should  exceed the average of recent transfers, the transfer costs would be less  than the estimated annualized savings of $270,000.", "NIH officials reported that the relocation of chimpanzees to Chimp Haven  will occur when space becomes available and within a timeframe that  allows for the optimal transition of each individual chimpanzee. NIH\u2019s  general framework for longer-term plans will prioritize the transfer of NIH- owned chimpanzees ahead of the transfer of NIH-supported  chimpanzees. Of the 363 chimpanzees that would continue to be housed  outside of Chimp Haven after the transfer of the 19 chimpanzees from  SNPRC, there would be 282 NIH-owned chimpanzees, all housed at  Keeling and Alamogordo, and 81 NIH-supported chimpanzees, all housed  at SNPRC. Given this, longer-term plans would focus first on transfers of  those 282 chimpanzees and later on the 81 NIH-supported chimpanzees  that continue to be housed at SNPRC. NIH officials reported that among  the 282, it plans to first focus on transferring the 138 chimpanzees  currently housed at Keeling and then focus on transferring the 144 at  Alamogordo.

For example, staffing needs at each facility are influenced by  the number of chimpanzees for which care is provided. If facility officials  have an estimate of the number of chimpanzees that are expected to be  transferred into or out of their facility within a given timeframe, they can  then plan for appropriate increases or decreases in staffing levels.", "In addition, absent a more clear long-term implementation plan, NIH may  not have the information it needs to appropriately plan transfers and avoid  costs associated with poor planning. For example, over the past several  years, as directed by NIH, facilities have spent funds on preparations for  transfers of chimpanzees that were ultimately canceled. Specifically, in  2012 SNPRC spent funds to prepare its facility to receive 110  chimpanzees from the New Iberia Research Center, but NIH officials later  decided to cancel that transfer. Similarly, in 2015 Chimp Haven spent  funds to arrange for the transport of 6 chimpanzees from Alamogordo, but  NIH decided to cancel that transfer on the day the transfer was to take  place. NIH incurred costs associated with both of these canceled  transfers. Because NIH pays for the care of chimpanzees at these  facilities and for costs associated with transfers, the effectiveness of the  facilities\u2019 and NIH\u2019s planning will affect the costs incurred by NIH.  Moreover, the absence of this plan is inconsistent with federal internal  control standards that call for the effective internal and external  communication of the quality information necessary to help an entity  achieve its objectives.", "Important considerations in developing a long-term plan to consolidate  chimps at Chimp Haven include available space, costs, and chimpanzee  welfare considerations. Information is available on these considerations  from the four facilities and their staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consideration of Available Space at Chimp Haven", "paragraphs": ["NIH has information it can use to develop reasonable estimates for the  number of chimpanzees that can be transferred to Chimp Haven within  the next 5 years. Specifically, NIH officials told us that they are aware that  Chimp Haven does not yet have the space available to accommodate all  of NIH\u2019s owned or supported chimpanzees (561 as of January 15, 2016).  According to Chimp Haven officials, as of January 15, 2016, Chimp  Haven had capacity to house up to 50 chimpanzees in addition to the 179  NIH-owned or NIH-supported chimpanzees it was housing at that time.  This means that as of that date the number of NIH-owned or NIH- supported chimpanzees exceeded Chimp Haven\u2019s capacity by 332  chimpanzees. See table 5.", "Chimp Haven officials reported that, absent a facility expansion, they  anticipate that space to take in more chimpanzees will become available  only as Chimp Haven\u2019s chimpanzee population declines due to deaths.  These officials also reported that, based on anticipated mortality of NIH- owned and NIH-supported chimpanzees currently housed at other  facilities, they expect that some will never be transferred to Chimp Haven  because many of these chimpanzees are geriatric and may die before the  transfers can be accommodated. Based on the expected rate of death  among captive chimpanzees (five to ten percent each year), between  about 127 and 230 chimpanzee deaths out of the 561 chimpanzees  owned or supported by NIH as of January 15, 2016, could be anticipated  within the next five years. Taking into account Chimp Haven\u2019s current  capacity to house NIH-owned or NIH-supported chimpanzees (229) and  anticipated deaths among all NIH-owned or NIH-supported chimpanzees  (127 to 230), estimates could be developed for the number of  chimpanzees that could be accommodated there within the next five  years and updated as actual information on space availability becomes  known. For example, assuming no changes to Chimp Haven\u2019s capacity  and that all available space there could be used for NIH-owned or NIH- supported chimpanzees, within the next five years it could be anticipated  that between 177 and 280 of the 382 chimpanzees that were housed at  other facilities on January 15, 2016, would have either been transported  to Chimp Haven or no longer need to be accommodated at Chimp Haven,  and that between 102 and 205 chimpanzees would continue to be  awaiting space at Chimp Haven.", "In addition, Chimp Haven\u2019s capacity to house more chimpanzees may  increase during this time period. Specifically, in 2016, Chimp Haven plans  to launch a capital campaign to raise funds to build four new habitats  which\u2014assuming the fundraising goals are met\u2014would become  operational sometime after 2017. After the construction of these four  habitats, officials expect to accommodate between an additional 100 to  150 chimpanzees. NIH can monitor the progress on this planned  expansion and adjust its plans for future chimpanzee transfers  accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consideration of Costs", "paragraphs": ["Information about the costs incurred by NIH for the care of chimpanzees  at Alamogordo, Keeling, and SNPRC and the potential longer-term costs  associated with the care of chimpanzees at each of these facilities can  also inform NIH\u2019s longer-term planning regarding the transfer of  chimpanzees to Chimp Haven. For example, based on NIH\u2019s general plan  to focus first on the transfer of NIH-owned rather than NIH-supported  chimpanzees, and its plan to first transfer the 19 NIH-owned  chimpanzees that are housed at SNPRC, NIH can consider the  differences in the costs it has historically incurred to care for the  chimpanzees at the two facilities that will continue to house NIH-owned  chimpanzees\u2014Alamogordo and Keeling. NIH can also consider  information about the ability for each of the facilities to financially manage  the care for the declining numbers of chimpanzees it houses. For  example, as the chimpanzee populations decline, the facilities may incur  higher per-chimpanzee per-day costs due to a loss of economies of scale.  Keeling and SNPRC may be better able to manage the costs of a  declining chimpanzee population because they can allocate resources  across their larger primate programs in a way that Alamogordo cannot.  According to Keeling and SNPRC officials, they can reduce costs  associated with their chimpanzee programs as the facilities\u2019 chimpanzee  populations decline because they can reallocate staff, facilities, and other  overhead to other parts of their larger primate programs. In contrast, while  officials at Alamogordo reported that they took steps in recent years to  reduce costs at their facility, their ability to reduce costs even further as its  chimpanzee population continues to decline is limited. For example,  according to facility officials, they can make some staff reductions over  time as their chimpanzee population continues to decline. However,  regardless of the number of chimpanzees housed there, they will always  need at least two veterinarians on staff, even if this includes part-time  staff, because one veterinarian is required to be on call at all times. In  addition, Alamogordo officials reported that some costs associated with  the maintenance of the facility are relatively fixed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consideration of Chimpanzee Welfare", "paragraphs": ["Welfare considerations of the chimpanzees that are transported to Chimp  Haven, including the transfer of existing intact social groups and of  chimpanzees that would be expected to survive the relocation, might also  influence NIH\u2019s longer-term planning for the Chimpanzee Management  Program. Officials from NIH and each of the facilities reported that the  maintenance of chimpanzee social groups is important for their well- being, and all noted that transfers to Chimp Haven should be planned in  ways that try to maintain these social groups. In addition, experts note  that chimpanzees generally are better off in larger socials groups, and  NIH\u2019s guidelines on the standards of care for chimpanzees recommend  the development of larger social groups. Based on these considerations,  NIH\u2019s longer-term plans may take into consideration prioritizing the  transfer of chimpanzees that are well-suited for integration into these  larger social groups   Officials also reported that transporting any chimpanzee to a new facility  and a new social environment causes stress on the chimpanzee, and that  certain chimpanzees, such as those that are very old or very sick, may be  less able to survive a transfer. Because there are costs incurred in  transporting chimpanzees, in addition to animal welfare considerations,  transferring chimpanzees that ultimately may not survive for long after the  transfer could result in unnecessarily incurred costs. Therefore,  identifying and transferring groups of chimpanzees that would most likely  live for a number of years after their transitions could reduce transfer  costs overall. For example, NIH might ultimately reduce costs by focusing  first on transferring groups that include younger and healthier  chimpanzees. Facility officials may be in a good position to help NIH  identify ideal groups for transfer, as NIH already relies on facility staff to  make appropriate decisions about creating chimpanzee social groups  within their facilities. Moreover, facility officials told us that they consider  their chimpanzees\u2019 welfare when establishing these social groups, taking  into account factors such as health status and age. For example, all four  facilities segregate chimpanzees that are infected with either HIV or a  form of hepatitis from all other chimpanzees, and some take steps to  segregate older chimpanzees from younger chimpanzees. (See  appendixes II \u2013 V for statistics on age and health status of chimpanzees  at each facility.) In addition, some facility officials reported that they have  taken steps to make sure certain long-standing social groups remain  intact as they reconfigured their facilities to accommodate decreasing  chimpanzee populations.", "Despite the stresses associated with transferring chimpanzees, Chimp  Haven officials reported that the facility has successfully incorporated  hundreds of chimpanzees over the years, including older chimpanzees,  and they said they take steps to alleviate the stress of the moves on the  chimpanzees. For example, chimpanzees are not moved during extreme  cold or hot weather, chimpanzees are kept within existing social groups  and only introduced into larger social groups when conditions are ideal,  and Chimp Haven veterinarians consult with veterinarians from the  facilities of origin to discuss any issues related to the care and treatment  of ailments."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NIH needs to continue to identify ways to be cost effective in its  management of a declining chimpanzee population.

However, it has not developed an  implementation plan for achieving this goal that is sufficiently clear and  transparent enough to support decision making and has not  communicated its plans to the facilities that currently house those  chimpanzees, inconsistent with federal internal control standards. While  there are still uncertainties about the long-term space availability at  Chimp Haven, NIH can use the information currently available related to  space, chimpanzee welfare, and costs for care to develop a clear  implementation plan for the transfer of its remaining chimpanzees to  Chimp Haven, a plan it could update or revise as appropriate. Because  knowledge about the anticipated transfers of chimpanzees into and out of  the four facilities that currently house NIH-owned and NIH-supported  chimpanzees will affect the ability for each of these facilities to manage  their costs, and because those costs are paid for in full or in part by NIH,  it is important for NIH to clearly communicate its plans with the facilities to  ensure that the facilities can take actions that will maximize cost-effective  planning for the care of these chimpanzees in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help NIH manage its Chimpanzee Management Program in a cost- effective manner, we recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human  Services direct the Director of NIH to develop and communicate a clear  implementation plan for meeting its long-term goal that is informed by  both costs and chimpanzee welfare, and that should be updated as  needed.
