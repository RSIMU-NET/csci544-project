The majority of these children came from low-income families and received school meals free or at a reduced-price. Income eligibility and school reimbursement rates for school meals are federally set and do not consider geographic differences in the cost of living (except for Alaska and Hawaii). GAO was asked to explore the potential to account for such differences through a variety of measures and cost data.", "This report, therefore, looks at a variety of methods by which to identify geographic differences in living costs and the potential for using them to adjust (1) income eligibility thresholds, and (2) reimbursement rates for schools. It also examines the extent to which states and localities can make adjustments for geographic differences in costs by using existing program rules. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and literature; analyzed available data sources and methods; and interviewed knowledgeable experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of measures by which income thresholds for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) school meal programs could be adjusted to account for geographic differences in the cost of living; doing so would likely lead to shifts in eligibility and program costs. For example, the Supplemental Poverty Measure or Regional Price Parities could be used to adjust for geographic price differences; each could result in fewer children qualifying for assistance in the South and Midwest and more children qualifying in the Northeast (see figure below). In general, the effects of any such cost-of-living adjustment are difficult to predict and would vary depending on their implementation, such as whether they were applied state-wide or at the sub-state level, or whether children were kept from losing eligibility. Overall program costs could increase if more children participated.", "Although the cost of delivering school meals varies by geographic region, the usefulness of available cost data is unclear for making such adjustments. Neither the Regional Price Parities for food services and goods or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' wage data account for some drivers of variation in costs, such as economies of scale. In addition, they may not reflect the characteristics of the food and labor components of individual school districts.", "The national school lunch and breakfast program rules allow states to expand eligibility for free meals and increase reimbursements to schools using federal or state funds. Some schools have expanded eligibility by providing free meals to all students under federal program rules. At the same time, some states use state funds to provide additional per meal reimbursements to schools for meals served. However, no state has used these flexibilities to adjust for within state geographic differences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2013, about 30.7 million children participated in the  National School Lunch Program and more than 13.2 million participated in  the School Breakfast Program across every state, the District of  Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, as well as children  of the U.S. Department of Defense armed forces personnel attending  schools overseas. Both of these programs are administered by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)  through state agencies that oversee local entities that provide school  meals. The federal government provides cash reimbursements for each  meal that meets nutritional requirements that is served at schools that  participate in the lunch and breakfast programs. In fiscal year 2013,  USDA spent about $14.6 billion on these programs. Students who  participate in these programs may qualify for either paid, free, or reduced- price meals depending on their household income and household size. In  the 2013-2014 school year, for example, a child who was part of a three- person household qualified for free meals if the child\u2019s annual household  income did not exceed $25,389.

Similarly, except in Alaska and  Hawaii, USDA\u2019s reimbursement rates for meals served are the same for  all schools, regardless of where the schools are located. The standard  USDA reimbursement rate for the 2013-2014 school year was $2.93 for a  school lunch served free to a qualifying child.", "Because the cost of housing, transportation, food, and other necessities  can vary by region or locality, concerns have been raised that some  children who are in need of free or reduced-price school meals may not  qualify for them because the current income eligibility measure does not  recognize that households in high-cost areas may need higher incomes to  meet their basic needs. Questions have also been raised regarding  whether some school districts can afford the same quality of food as other  school districts because USDA reimbursement rates do not adjust for  geographic differences in food and labor costs. To better understand the  issues related to making geographic adjustments for the school meal  programs, you asked us to examine both eligibility determination and  meal reimbursements.", "This report addresses the following questions:  1.  What existing data and methods could be used to adjust USDA  income eligibility thresholds for school meals so that they account for  variations in the cost of living, and what are the implications of making  such adjustments?  2.

Does the index capture variation in costs of living at the  regional, state, or sub-state level?", "Time frame: Are the estimates regularly updated and if so, how often?

We identified Regional Price  Parities (RPP) and the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) as the two  data sources that could be used to adjust eligibility guidelines for school  meals programs based on these considerations. Our analysis is  consistent with the findings of an expert panel cited in a report to  Congress recently released by HHS.", "As a tool to adjust school meal eligibility, RPPs have strengths and  limitations. RPPs cover a comprehensive market basket of goods, are  based on reliable federal data sources, and are estimated using methods  that are transparent and well documented. Another advantage of the  RPPs is that they are available for states, as well as metropolitan  statistical areas (MSA), and non-metropolitan areas, which would allow  for cost-of-living adjustments to be made at either the state or sub-state  level.", "However, some estimates may be less accurate because the  Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) calculates RPPs using a complex  statistical aggregation procedure that uses some estimated (i.e., imputed)  values and some survey values for county level prices; in particular,  housing data are available at the county level, but county-level prices for  most goods and services have to be imputed from Consumer Price Index  (CPI) data. As a result, the RPPs may show differences in cost of living  between two areas when in fact the costs of living are similar.

While  the official poverty measure includes only  pretax money income, the supplemental  measure adds the value of in-kind benefits,  such as the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, school lunches, housing  assistance and refundable tax credits.  Additionally, the supplemental poverty  measure deducts necessary expenses for  critical goods and services from income.

SPM thresholds are available at the  MSA level; the recent HHS report also includes state-level adjustments  produced by the Urban Institute using Census Bureau methodology and  data. While housing costs represent a substantial portion of household  budgets, reliance on housing as the only source of geographic variation  introduces a potential source of bias because it may not account for other  significant living costs that vary geographically.

Figure 2 shows the change using state-level RPPs. The  RPP map assumes that in states where the cost of living is the same as  the national average, the eligibility threshold would remain unchanged;  the SPM map shows adjustments wherever median rents differ from the  national average. States with a relatively high cost of living, according to  the indexes, such as states in the Northeast and West would see their  eligibility thresholds increase, resulting in children at higher incomes  qualifying for free or reduced-price meals. At the same time, in states  where the cost of living is lower than average, according to the indexes,  such as the South and Midwest, eligibility thresholds would be lower and  fewer children would qualify for the program.", "If adjustments were made at the sub-state level, in general, more children  would become eligible in metropolitan and other densely populated areas,  as these areas tend to have a higher cost of living. Meanwhile, fewer  children would be eligible in areas with a lower cost of living, such as non- metropolitan areas and small cities. In some cases, the cost-of-living  differences within states are greater than the cost-of-living differences  between states.

For example, under  a hold harmless scenario using state-level adjustments, any state in  figure 1 or 2 with a negative change in eligibility would instead have zero  change. This would cause the total number of eligible children to  increase, and likely lead to increased participation and costs.", "If cost-of-living adjustments were made based on geographic differences,  which method is used would have an important effect on the total number  of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals. According to the  HHS study regarding geographic cost-of-living adjustments, using either  the state- or MSA-level SPM would lead to a slight increase in the  national level average poverty guidelines, while using the state- or MSA- level RPP would likely yield a slight decrease in the national level average  poverty guidelines. The study also presents results from a simulation of  geographic cost-of-living adjustments to SNAP eligibility. Although  SNAP and the school meal programs have different eligibility  requirements, they use the same poverty guidelines in determining  eligibility. Given this, the SNAP simulation may indicate how school meals  eligibility could be generally affected by geographic adjustments. The  study shows that total persons eligible for SNAP declined using both  RPPs and SPM, more so when adjustments were done at the level of  metropolitan area, rather than at the state level. The study indicates that  the range of changes at the state level would be quite large, leading to a  potentially significant change in the geographic distribution of benefits.  For example, the MSA SPM would reduce eligibility by 19.5 percent in  West Virginia and increase eligibility in California by 16 percent. The state  SPM also produces a wide range of SNAP eligibility effects and would  reduce eligibility by 17.5 percent in West Virginia and increase eligibility  by 17.9 percent in California. Additionally for a few states in the SNAP  simulation, RPPs and SPM produce quite different results\u2014one method  would produce increased eligibility while the other method would result in  decreased eligibility.", "Other details of the implementation could also affect who is eligible, the  number eligible, and the total cost of adjusting the eligibility guidelines.", "For example, one consideration is whether to make adjustments at the  state or sub-state level. There are states that include both areas that are  below the U.S. average cost of living as well as areas that are above the  average cost of living. A Census Bureau official pointed out to us that  using a state-level adjustment would result in high cost-of-living areas  (e.g., New York City) getting too little of an increase relative to the  measure for their specific area and lower cost-of-living areas getting too  much of an increase (e.g., Buffalo) relative to their area\u2019s actual cost of  living. Furthermore, USDA officials said that it may be administratively  complex to make geographic adjustments. For example, it may be  challenging to implement geographic differences by MSA because school  districts may not align with MSA boundaries and may instead cross the  boundaries of areas with different costs of living. Additionally, it may be  administratively complex to calculate and implement multiple thresholds\u2014 if different adjustments were made for each MSA, hundreds of eligibility  threshold tables would have to be computed and published. Further  implementation concerns that we identified that could affect the outcome  include whether adjustments would be implemented in such a way as to  decrease eligibility among some students (as opposed to a hold-harmless  implementation) and how these adjustments would interact with existing  policies affecting school meal eligibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications for Food Security", "paragraphs": ["However, children who no longer qualify for free or reduced-price school meals and  who cannot pay for school meals may be provided meals or partial meals at some  schools, but USDA does not reimburse schools for such meals.

In the 2012-2013 school year 14.7 million children were  identified as categorically eligible for free or reduced-price meals.

Because schools are most likely to find it in their  interest to participate in Provision 2 and Provision 3 if they serve high- poverty populations and typically serve a large portion of meals free of  charge, a change to eligibility guidelines could affect the decision of  schools to participate. In some cases, if the percentage of children in a  school that are eligible for free or reduced-price meals increases, a  school might choose to participate as a Provision 2 or 3 school.  Conversely, if the income eligibility amounts were lowered and some  children no longer qualified based on household income, this would  decrease the percentage of children in a school eligible for free or  reduced-price meals and it could cause a school to reconsider its  participation as a Provision 2 or 3 school. Meanwhile, participation in CEP  depends on the number of children in the schools that are directly  certified, meaning that they are both categorically eligible and certified  without the need to fill out a separate school meal application. In the  absence of a geographic adjustment to the eligibility criteria for programs  affecting categorical eligibility, a school participating in the CEP would be  unaffected by a geographic cost-of-living adjustment to school meal  eligibility criteria.

In addition, USDA requires  schools to choose items from specific food categories that may not be  included in the RPP index. The relative quantities of different food items  included in the index may also differ from the mix of foods used by a  school foodservice. USDA prescribes daily and/or weekly requirements  for serving sizes and number of servings of fruits and vegetables  (including vegetable subgroups), grains, milk, meat, and meat  alternatives. USDA also prescribes calorie ranges and limits on saturated  fats, sodium, and trans-fats. Further, RPPs use weights for food items  based on U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey data, which may not  correspond to the food bought by schools to satisfy USDA\u2019s  requirements.", "At the same time, because the ways in which schools are able to buy  food differs from the ways households do, the prices schools and  individual households pay are not comparable. First, because schools  buy greater volumes than an average household, the prices they pay are  likely lower. Second, schools may purchase food in a variety of ways,  including (1) directly from manufacturers, (2) through brokers, (3) from  distributors, or (4) through a foodservice management company that  procures food for them. Some schools even participate in multi-school  food buying cooperatives, which can also reduce food prices. Further,  states and schools use USDA entitlement dollars to purchase foods for  which USDA has contracted with manufacturers through a competitive  bidding process. Such USDA foods account for 15 to 20 percent of food  served in school meals. Schools may also use their USDA entitlement  dollars and other funds to purchase fresh produce through a program with  the Department of Defense. Despite differences in the composition of the  index and the composition of school lunch purchasing patterns, if the  prices of the foods in the index vary by geographic region in a way that is  similar to variations in the prices of foods purchased by school meals, the  index could be a reasonable proxy for school foodservice cost  differences. However, given our review of the various factors that affect  school meal costs and the differences in foodservice purchasing patterns,  it is unclear how well the RPP would reflect school foodservice costs.", "Similarly, available geographic foodservice wage data may not reflect  costs for school foodservice labor. For example, BLS data from its  Occupational Employment Statistics survey includes average hourly wage  data for Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations at state and  sub-state geographic areas. These data represent a broad labor pool  from which a school could draw for foodservice workers and therefore  include some types of foodservice establishments that differ from schools.  According to BLS, school foodservice workers may have more regular  hours than workers at other foodservice establishments and work only  during the school year, which is usually 9 to 10 months. Other foodservice  establishment workers may have work shifts that include late evenings,  weekends, and holidays. The BLS-defined labor pool also includes a  much larger proportion of workers aged 16 to 19 years\u2014persons who  might not be available to work during school hours\u2014compared with other  occupations. There may also be differences in part-time and full-time  employment opportunities for school foodservices and other foodservice  establishments, which could affect wages. For example, BLS reports that  about half of all foodservice workers were employed part-time and half  were employed full-time. On a national basis, BLS indicates that the  hourly mean wage for foodservice workers at elementary and secondary  schools is higher than for restaurants and other eating places, although it  points out that the best job opportunities are at upscale restaurants.", "In addition to the separate indexes for food and labor costs, geographic  food establishment price data can be used to measure the price of a  meal, but these data may not reflect meals provided in schools. The RPP  food service data are derived from prices from cafeterias (including  schools), restaurants, and vending. However, to the extent that  institutions other than schools provide food items, portions, and levels of  service that differ significantly from those in schools, the index may not  accurately reflect school foodservice costs. For example, unlike  restaurants, participating schools must adhere to federal school meal  nutritional standards and calorie limits and serve food items from specific  food categories. The RPP food service data may also be influenced by  the mix of types of foodservice establishments in a geographic area (e.g.,  number of fast food versus full-service restaurants), whereas the school  meal requirements for categories of foods and portions are the same  throughout the country.

While we  have determined that available data sources may not necessarily reflect  particular aspects of school foodservice programs, we believe it is  instructive to illustrate the potential effect of adjusting school meals for  geographic price differences, using available data. We compared two  different methodologies and computed the changes that would have  occurred to the $2.93 free lunch reimbursement rate in each state for the  2013-2014 school year. (See fig. 3.) Our analysis assumes that states  with costs equal to the national average would see no change in their  reimbursements, but those with above-average costs would experience  an increase in reimbursements and those with below-average costs  would experience a decrease. First, we used the RPP food service index,  which shows the geographic variation in the price of meals, such as those  served at restaurants. Applying the RPP food services index, the  adjustments would range from a $0.42 decrease in Kansas to a $0.38  increase in Maryland. Second, we created a state-level composite index  using RPP food goods data and BLS hourly wage data for Food  Preparation and Serving Related Occupations. The food and labor  components were weighted based on the average percentage of food and  labor costs of total foodservice costs that schools reported in USDA\u2019s  school lunch and breakfast cost study, which uses data from a national  sample of schools. (See app. I for additional detail on our methodology.)  Applying the composite food and wage index, states would see a change  in reimbursements ranging from a $0.22 decrease in South Dakota to a  $0.53 increase in the District of Columbia. Using either method,  reimbursement rates would go down in most states, particularly in the  South and Midwest, while reimbursement rates would go up for most  states in the Northeast and for California.", "For most states, the two indexes track in the same direction; that is, both  indexes go up for a state or both indexes go down for a state. However, in  eight states, one index showed an increase, while the other index showed  a decrease in the reimbursement rate. For example, in Washington State,  the composite food and wage index would increase the free lunch  reimbursement rate by $0.30, while the RPP food services index would  reduce the reimbursement rate by $0.05. Further analysis would be  needed to determine why the two indexes provided different results for  such states.", "Although the indexes show increases and decreases in reimbursement  rates compared to a national average, the effect on overall program costs  would depend on how the adjustments were implemented. For example,  even if reimbursements were adjusted up or down relative to a national  average of $2.93 for a free school lunch in our example, the overall  reimbursement costs would depend on how many meals are served by  each school in each local area and the change in reimbursement rates  that apply to that local area. If, on the other hand, the adjustments were  made under a hold-harmless scenario, where there would be no  adjustments for local areas where costs were below the national average  and only those local areas with higher than average costs would have  their rates adjusted, the overall cost of the program would increase.", "State-level adjustments may mask differences within states. BLS wage  data are not available for all areas within states. However, where BLS  wage data for the Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations are  available for some sub-state areas, the data show variation within states.

The RPP data  on food expenditures for goods and services are not reported for sub- state areas. However, the overall RPP cost of living index that includes  food, housing, and clothing, among other items, shows that there is  variation in prices within states, which suggests that the RPP food  expenditures within states could also vary.

These provisions are available  for both breakfast and lunch. USDA has encouraged the use of such  provisions to expand program participation as a way to eliminate the  possible financial burden for children, so that any child can participate  regardless of income. According to USDA, many schools find that using  Provision 2 or 3 at breakfast increases participation so drastically that  they do not actually realize a loss from otherwise paying students. In  addition, schools can save on administrative costs due to reduced  application burdens, as well as simplified meal counting and claiming  procedures. Because school districts are responsible for covering the cost  of providing free meals to all students not covered by federal  reimbursement, they must determine if it is in their financial interest to use  such provisions. USDA has found that schools most likely to find it in their  financial interest to use Provision 2 or Provision 3 are those schools that  serve high-poverty populations and typically serve a large proportion of  their meals free of charge. The CEP is intended for schools in high- poverty areas and requires a minimum percentage of students certified  for free meals in order for a school to participate. A recent evaluation of  the implementation of the CEP in its first 2 years found that participating  school districts had increased breakfast and lunch program participation  and federal reimbursements, as well as administrative cost savings.

While adjusting eligibility could help  increase access to free and reduced-price meals in areas where housing  and other costs are significantly higher than average, to the extent that  cost-of-living differences do not align with measures of need, such as  food insecurity, adjusting income eligibility may not achieve greater  equity. In addition, if adjustments are made in a way that reallocates  limited resources among geographic areas rather than adding to the cost  of the program, such changes would likely lead to some children living in  lower-cost areas no longer receiving free or reduced-price meals.  Likewise, making adjustments to meal reimbursement rates using  available data and methods for food price and wage differences may not  account for other considerations, such as size of schools, that affect  school costs.
