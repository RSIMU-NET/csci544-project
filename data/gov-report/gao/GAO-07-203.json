Concerns were raised that the new requirements could expose consumers to abusive practices by credit counseling agencies or become barriers to filing for bankruptcy. GAO was asked to examine (1) the process of approving counseling and education providers, (2) the content and results of the counseling and education sessions, (3) the fees charged, and (4) the availability of and challenges to accessing services. To address these issues, GAO reviewed Trustee Program data and application case files, and interviewed a wide range of individuals and groups involved in the bankruptcy process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Trustee Program's process for approving credit counseling and debtor education providers was designed to help ensure that providers met statutory and program requirements and demonstrated evidence of proficiency, experience, and reputability. The Bankruptcy Act set certain standards for providers, and the program's July 2006 rule clarified these standards and formalized the application review process. As of October 2006, the Trustee Program had approved 153 credit counseling and 268 debtor education providers. These providers have had few formal complaints lodged against them, and federal and state law enforcement authorities with whom we spoke did not identify any recent enforcement actions against them under consumer protection laws. No provider approved by the Trustee Program had had its federal tax-exempt status revoked, although four providers' tax-exempt status was being examined by the Internal Revenue Service. The content of the required credit counseling and debtor education sessions generally complied with statutory and program requirements. Participants in the bankruptcy process largely believed the education requirement--a general financial literacy course--to be beneficial. However, the value of the counseling requirement is not clear. The counseling was intended to help consumers make informed choices about bankruptcy and its alternatives. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that by the time most clients receive the counseling, their financial situations are dire, leaving them with no viable alternative to bankruptcy. As a result, the requirement may often serve more as an administrative obstacle than as a timely presentation of meaningful options. Because no mechanism currently exists to track the outcomes of the counseling, policymakers and program managers are unable to fully assess how well the requirement is serving its intended purpose. Providers typically charge about $50 per session and evidence suggests fees are being waived as appropriate for clients unable to pay, as the Bankruptcy Act requires. Neither the statute nor Trustee Program guidance defines what constitutes \"ability to pay,\" and policies vary among providers. Formal guidance on this issue would have several benefits, including ensuring compliance with a minimum benchmark for waiving fees. The number of counseling and education providers that have been approved appears sufficient to allow consumers to access these services in a timely manner. In-person sessions are available in most parts of the country, although the great majority of clients fulfill the requirements via telephone or Internet. The Trustee Program has efforts under way to help mitigate the challenges speakers of foreign languages can face in accessing services. Further, the bankruptcy courts have taken steps recently to help better ensure that filers are aware of the potential consequences of filing for bankruptcy without the required counseling certificate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005  (Bankruptcy Act) amended the federal bankruptcy code to require   (1) individuals to receive budget and credit counseling from an approved  provider before filing a petition in bankruptcy and (2) bankruptcy  petitioners to complete an instructional course on personal financial  management in order to have their debts discharged. According to the  legislative history of the act, one of the goals of the prefiling counseling  requirement, which became effective on October 17, 2005, is to ensure that  consumers understand the options available to them and the  consequences of filing for bankruptcy. However, the requirement raised a  number of concerns. In recent years, congressional committees and  federal agencies have investigated some credit counseling agencies for  alleged unfair and deceptive practices and were concerned that these  practices, which included steering clients into repayment plans that  benefited creditors and counseling agencies but not necessarily debtors,  would affect those filing for bankruptcy protection. In addition, some  members of Congress and other parties have been concerned that the cost  and availability of counseling and education services could serve as  barriers to those seeking to file for bankruptcy. In response to these  concerns, Congress included in the Bankruptcy Act requirements for  providers of both credit counseling and debtor education courses. The  providers must meet certain criteria and obtain approval from the  Department of Justice\u2019s U.S. Trustee Program (the Trustee Program),  which oversees the bankruptcy process for most federal judicial districts  and acts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and procedures.", "In light of these issues, the objectives of this report are to examine (1) the  actions taken by the Trustee Program to approve credit counseling and  debtor education providers; (2) the content and results of the counseling  and education sessions; (3) the fees providers charge for counseling and  education services, and the extent to which these services are provided  regardless of clients\u2019 ability to pay; and (4) the availability of approved  counseling and education services and the challenges consumers may face  in receiving these services.", "To meet these objectives, we reviewed relevant provisions of the federal  bankruptcy code as amended by the Bankruptcy Act and reviewed the  Trustee Program\u2019s written policies, rules, guidance, and procedures for  approving credit counseling and debtor education providers. We also  collected and analyzed data provided to us by the Trustee Program,  including data on the number, location, and characteristics of providers.  To determine whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had revoked the  section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code, or  taken other enforcement actions, against providers, we met with IRS  officials and reviewed the agency\u2019s publicly available information. We also  reviewed a nonprobability sample of the Trustee Program\u2019s application  case files for 43 providers that represented the majority of counseling and  education sessions conducted nationwide. We did not do a probability  sample because of the limited size of the sample we could review and  because we wanted to ensure that the small sample included all of the  largest providers and specific numbers of other types of providers. The  case files we reviewed included, among other things, the providers\u2019 initial  applications, protocols, curricula and other guidance used by counselors  and instructors, written materials and disclosures provided to consumers,  fee schedules, and correspondence between the providers and the Trustee  Program. To facilitate the case file review, we developed a data collection  instrument to record specific information for each case file reviewed. We  also reviewed relevant portions of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy  Procedure and the standardized forms required by the courts to file a  bankruptcy petition. Further, we reviewed Web sites of selected  bankruptcy courts. We also collected information related to the prefiling  requirement from seven judicial districts and analyzed a survey of  bankruptcy judges that was conducted by the Federal Judicial Center.  Finally, we interviewed representatives of the Trustee Program; Federal  Trade Commission (FTC); IRS; Administrative Office of the United States  Courts; National Association of Attorneys General; American Bankruptcy  Institute; National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys;  National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees; National Association of  Chapter 13 Trustees; trade organizations representing creditors, such as  the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable;  consumer organizations, such as the Consumer Federation of America and  the National Consumer Law Center; academic researchers; and 10  providers of credit counseling or debtor education that had been approved  by the Trustee Program.", "We conducted our review from February 2006 through March 2007 in  Washington, D.C., and Boston, Ma., in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

The filing of a bankruptcy petition in most cases operates as  an \u201cautomatic stay\u201d that essentially prohibits most creditors from taking  any action to attempt to collect a debt pending the resolution of the  bankruptcy proceeding. Consumers usually file for bankruptcy under one  of two chapters of the Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 7, the debtor\u2019s  eligible assets are liquidated (reduced to cash) and distributed to creditors  in accordance with the procedures mandated by the court. At the end of  the process, the debtor\u2019s eligible debts are discharged, which means that  creditors may take no further action against the individual to collect the  debt. Under Chapter 13, debtors file a repayment plan with the court  agreeing to pay their debts over time, usually 3 to 5 years. In these cases,  the debtor\u2019s discharge occurs upon completion of all payments under the  plan. Personal bankruptcy is designed to give debtors a \u201cfresh start\u201d but is  often considered a last resort, in large part because of the adverse effect it  has on an individual\u2019s credit record. Most debtors who file for bankruptcy  use an attorney, but some debtors represent themselves without the aid of  an attorney and are referred to as pro se debtors.", "Federal courts have jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases and petitions can  be filed in any one of the nation\u2019s 94 judicial districts. The Trustee  Program, a component of the Department of Justice, is responsible for  overseeing the administration of most bankruptcy cases.

The Trustee Program also  oversees private \u201cpanel trustees\u201d and \u201cstanding trustees\u201d who administer,  respectively, individual Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases.  Bankruptcy cases in Alabama and North Carolina are not under the  jurisdiction of the Trustee Program and are administered instead by  bankruptcy administrators in the judicial districts in those states.

To be a \u201cdebtor\u201d (that is, eligible to file for  bankruptcy), an individual, except in limited circumstances, must receive  from an approved provider, within 180 days preceding the date of filing a  bankruptcy petition, (1) a briefing outlining the opportunities available for  credit counseling and (2) assistance with performing a budget analysis.

Upon completing prefiling counseling or  predischarge education, consumers get a certificate from the provider that  is submitted to the bankruptcy court as evidence of having fulfilled the  requirement.", "The credit counseling industry has existed for about 40 years. Credit  counseling agencies generally work on behalf of their consumer clients,  who are typically deeply in debt, to help them manage their existing  financial problems and to teach them better financial management skills  for the future. These agencies have historically been community-based  nonprofit organizations that charge nothing or solicit modest fees from  clients to help defray expenses. In some cases, agencies may offer to put  clients in repayment programs, commonly termed debt management plans,  where consumers pay off their unsecured debts by making a single,  consolidated payment that the agency uses to disburse funds to creditors.  Under such plans, creditors often agree to reduce the debtor\u2019s interest  rates or waive certain fees and to contribute a small percentage of the  amount received to the counseling agency to help fund its expenses.", "The FTC and others have noted that many credit counseling agencies  operate honestly and fairly and that these agencies are professional  operations that provide valuable services to financially distressed  consumers. However, starting in the 1990s, consumer complaints about  selected segments of the credit counseling industry spurred congressional  hearings and federal and state investigations into the activities of many  credit counseling agencies. For example, over the past few years, the FTC  has settled enforcement actions against several of these agencies for  alleged abusive practices, including steering consumers into debt  management plans that provided financial benefits to the agency but not to  the consumer.

In reviewing applications, analysts in the Counseling and  Debtor Education Unit used a checklist to ensure that each applicant  satisfied the statutory and application requirements and had provided  documented evidence to show sufficient experience, qualifications, and  proficiency. In many cases, applicants had to provide additional  information. The Trustee Program also required some applicants to make  modifications to their programs or processes before approving the  application.

For example, Trustee Program officials told us that they consult publicly  available information, such as the Web site of the Better Business Bureau,  and conduct an Internet search on applicants for information on their  character and corroboration of information submitted. In addition, higher- risk applicants are evaluated more rigorously. For instance, agencies that  enter a high proportion of clients into debt management plans may be  asked to provide additional information on the number and nature of these  plans. As of October 2006, the Trustee Program had rejected 96  applications to provide credit counseling or debtor education services.

In general, the different providers  had similar curricula and materials, although some providers covered  certain topics more thoroughly than others. For example, some providers  included more detailed discussions of topics such as modifying spending  habits, avoiding identity theft, or negotiating with creditors. Credit  counseling sessions generally began with providers collecting data on the  client\u2019s finances, including sources and amount of income, debt, and  expenses. In some cases, providers received some of this information from  the client in advance via the Internet or from the client\u2019s credit report.  Individual counselors then typically analyzed the data with a software  program and provided the client with a personalized budget. They  discussed the client\u2019s financial goals and potential opportunities for  reducing spending and paying off debt. Counselors then described the  client\u2019s options\u2014for example, developing a budget, entering into a debt  management plan, or filing a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  Although counselors are prohibited from giving legal advice or  recommending whether or not clients should file for bankruptcy, some  providers describe the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative.

Similarly, a survey by  the National Foundation for Credit Counseling of its member agencies that  conduct prefiling counseling found that between October 17, 2005, and  August 31, 2006, 61 percent of their sessions were conducted by telephone,  24 percent via the Internet, and 15 percent in person.", "Academic researchers, counseling providers, and other experts we spoke  with said that although in-person counseling may have advantages,  telephone counseling can be an effective method of delivery. While some  providers noted that counseling conducted face-to-face can be beneficial  when addressing more complex financial situations, other providers and  industry participants noted that telephone counseling may allow clients  more convenience and flexibility and may be easier for people with  mobility problems, such as the elderly. A recent study by Georgetown  University\u2019s Credit Research Center found no significant difference in the  outcomes of credit counseling sessions conducted by telephone or in  person. Specifically, the study found that clients receiving in-person and  telephone counseling had similar risks of bankruptcy or credit problems   2 years later.

On the basis of these data, the client is typically provided information and  a financial analysis, including a description of the available alternatives.  Trustee Program officials told us all approved Internet-based credit  counseling sessions were required to include a separate component in  which the client communicated individually with a counselor. Providers  told us that after completing the Internet portion of the counseling session,  the client could speak with a counselor by telephone or, in some cases, via  Web chat. During these one-on-one communications, which one provider  told us typically last 10 to 20 minutes, counselors reviewed the budget  analysis with the client and answered any questions. The Trustee Program  also requires providers to have procedures to effectively verify their  clients\u2019 identity. We did not identify any significant research on the  effectiveness of credit counseling facilitated via the Internet.

Despite these  provisions, some consumer advocacy groups, policymakers, and others  expressed concerns that credit counseling provided under the Bankruptcy  Act might sometimes be biased and not in the clients\u2019 best interests.

While quality credit counseling can, in  general, be beneficial, a wide range of observers we spoke with\u2014including  representatives of federal agencies, bankruptcy attorneys, and panel  trustees; consumer advocates; and several counseling providers\u2014told us  that the timing of the counseling conducted to fulfill the requirement of  the Bankruptcy Act could mitigate its value. The federal Financial Literacy  and Education Commission noted in its national strategy that the use of  reputable credit counseling could have a significant positive impact,  making borrowers more creditworthy and decreasing their debt. But the  strategy also recommended that consumers seek credit counseling  services early, when financial problems start, to avoid potential  bankruptcy. In practice, however, by the time individuals obtain prefiling  credit counseling, they usually have already consulted with a bankruptcy  attorney and have serious financial problems, such as imminent  foreclosure of their homes. As such, anecdotal evidence indicates that the  great majority of clients receiving prefiling counseling have few viable  alternatives to bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Act\u2019s credit counseling  requirement therefore may not be serving its purpose of helping  consumers make informed choices about whether or not to file for  bankruptcy. Providers and others told us that many clients perceived the  counseling session as an administrative obstacle rather than a useful  exercise.", "Questions about the value of the prefiling requirement stem from a  widespread belief among observers that nearly all of the consumers that  receive the credit counseling subsequently file for bankruptcy. Yet the  evidence for this is largely anecdotal, as comprehensive data do not  currently exist on the outcomes of those consumers who receive prefiling  credit counseling. Neither the Trustee Program, credit counseling  providers, or any other party currently track how many consumers who  receive credit counseling subsequently file for bankruptcy within the 180  days during which the certificates may be used. Similarly, little is known  about the alternatives chosen by those consumers who do not file for  bankruptcy or how the credit counseling affects their decisions.", "During roughly the first half of 2006, some 381,005 counseling certificates  were issued and 263,408 bankruptcy petitions filed. However, this  information on its own does not provide a reliable estimate of how many  consumers who received counseling subsequently filed for bankruptcy, for  several reasons. First, in cases that involve a husband and wife filing a  joint bankruptcy petition, each must obtain counseling and be issued a  certificate. Second, a time lag may exist between the time the certificate is  issued and the time of the filing, because the certificate is good for 180  days. For this reason, reported bankruptcy filings during a given time  frame will not reflect all the bankruptcies that will be filed using the  certificates issued in that time frame. Third, certificates are sometimes  cancelled and reissued for administrative reasons (such as the misspelling  of the client\u2019s name), so that one person is issued two certificates. Finally,  occasionally a client may receive prefiling credit counseling but not be  issued a certificate\u2014for example, if the client decides not to file for  bankruptcy.", "When a provider completes a prefiling credit counseling session, it uses a  Web-based system operated by the Trustee Program to issue the client a  certificate, which includes a unique certificate number.

The Bankruptcy Act, he  noted, requires the Trustee Program to test and evaluate the effectiveness  of a pilot debtor education curriculum, but contains no analogous  provisions for monitoring or evaluating credit counseling. As we have  reported in the past, meaningful data on program outcomes and costs are  essential for appropriate oversight and decision making.

As of January 2007, the Web site allowed users to conduct a  search to identify providers offering services in any one of 29 languages.  A program official told us that he expected that eventually the Web site  will include a function that will allow consumers to search, by provider  and location, for all languages and translation services offered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individuals With Special Needs or Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["Apart from non-English speakers, certain other populations may have  experienced challenges in accessing counseling and education sessions.  For example, it may be difficult for individuals with limited literacy skills  to understand counseling and education sessions, which often rely heavily  on written materials. In such cases, some providers told us that during the  session they read aloud most of the written materials. Some consumer  advocates and representatives of bankruptcy attorneys have also  expressed concerns about the ability of disabled, elderly, or incarcerated  debtors to easily access credit counseling and debtor education in an  effective and timely manner. We could not find any data on the nature of  and extent to which such difficulties exist. Most participants in the  bankruptcy credit counseling process that we spoke with said that while  there may be individual examples in which debtors with special needs  faced challenges accessing needed services, it did not appear that this was  an issue for a large number of debtors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Debtors Without Attorneys Also Can Face Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Debtors filing for bankruptcy protection may use an attorney or may file  without one (pro se). The proportion of debtors filing pro se varies across  different judicial districts. For example, among seven bankruptcy courts  that the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts surveyed at our request,  as few as 4.5 percent and as many as 24.9 percent of debtors filed pro se.  At the initial meeting with a client, a bankruptcy attorney will typically tell  the client about the credit counseling requirement. The attorney will often  give the client contact information for approved counseling agencies and  may provide a room with a telephone so that clients can fulfill the  counseling requirement on the spot.", "Debtors who file without the aid of an attorney can learn of the prefiling  credit counseling requirement through other sources, such as instructional  information located on the form of the voluntary petition that must be  filed by the debtor, in other written materials provided by the bankruptcy  court, or on the Web sites of the bankruptcy courts or the Trustee  Program. Each of the 94 federal judicial districts has its own methods of  disseminating explanatory information. When we telephoned bankruptcy  courts in seven judicial districts to inquire about the process for filing for  bankruptcy, staff typically directed us to the court\u2019s Web site. A review of  nine courts\u2019 Web sites found that all but one highlighted the prefiling  counseling requirement in a relatively prominent fashion, such as noting it  on their home page. In one case, the requirement was not prominently  noted, but instead was included among a long list of public notices.", "The bankruptcy courts in all districts use a uniform set of Official  Bankruptcy Forms that individuals must complete to file and take action  in bankruptcy cases. In June 2006, at the suggestion of the Trustee  Program, the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules of the Judicial  Conference of the United States modified the main form for filing a  bankruptcy petition to make the prefiling counseling requirement more  clear and conspicuous. The form now requires that petitioners attach an  additional exhibit\u2014Individual Debtor\u2019s Statement of Compliance With  Credit Counseling Requirement\u2014to attest to compliance with the  requirement or claim an exigent circumstance.", "Debtors who file for bankruptcy without fulfilling the credit counseling  requirement can face a variety of consequences. A survey conducted by  the Federal Judicial Center asked U.S. bankruptcy judges what procedures  they follow when a debtor has not produced a prefiling credit counseling  certificate. When asked in the survey to select one or more, 44 percent of  judges said they had given such filers a specified period to produce the  certificate, 34 percent had issued an Order to Show Cause or otherwise set  a hearing on the deficiency, 20 percent had taken no action, and 13 percent  had dismissed the case. The survey also showed that 35 percent of the  judges said they treated imminent foreclosure or eviction, by itself, as an  exigent circumstance, while about 55 percent treated this as an exigent  circumstance only if the debtors could satisfactorily explain why they had  not yet received credit counseling. Another 10 percent said that imminent  foreclosure or eviction was never an exigent circumstance.", "Before the Bankruptcy Act went into effect, some policymakers, consumer  advocates, and others expressed concern that the credit counseling  requirement could create hardship for some debtors by delaying their  ability to file a bankruptcy petition and receive the automatic stay that  prohibits creditors from continuing to seek payment. This stay can be very  important to some debtors\u2014for example, those facing foreclosure on their  homes. However, we did not identify data on the extent to which failure to  receive credit counseling has created such hardships."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Within a limited time frame, the Trustee Program established policies and  procedures for selecting credit counseling and debtor education providers,  and thus far relatively few concerns have been raised about the  competence of approved providers. We found that the program\u2019s process  for reviewing credit counseling applicants was generally comprehensive  and included numerous steps designed to assess applicants\u2019 proficiency  and reputability. The Trustee Program said it is carefully monitoring the  circumstances of the IRS examinations of four approved providers and  will take appropriate actions based on the outcomes of these  examinations\u2014which we agree is essential given that IRS\u2019s past  examinations have often revealed abusive practices.", "We also found that the value of the prefiling credit counseling requirement  is not clear. The requirement was intended to provide consumers with  information about bankruptcy and its alternatives so they can make  informed decisions about their options. In practice, however, anecdotal  evidence strongly suggests that most consumers have no realistic  alternative to bankruptcy by the time they receive the counseling. As such,  a wide range of stakeholders view the prefiling counseling requirement as  an administrative obstacle rather than a useful exercise. It is therefore  uncertain whether the requirement is achieving its key goal of helping  consumers determine whether or not to file for bankruptcy. Better data on  the outcomes of prefiling credit counseling would help program managers  and policymakers determine its value. In particular, it would be useful to  confirm whether, as many believe, nearly all consumers who receive  prefiling counseling subsequently file for bankruptcy. The Trustee  Program does not currently collect this information because doing so is  not part of its explicit statutory responsibilities. In addition, there is  currently no mechanism in place to match individual counseling  certificates with bankruptcy filings. However, appropriate data on  outcomes are essential to understanding program benefits and costs and  to effective oversight and decision making. Data on how often counseling  sessions result in bankruptcy filings or other outcomes would help  determine how well the prefiling credit counseling requirement is serving  its intended purpose.", "There is less debate about the predischarge debtor education requirement,  which provides broad-based financial education to debtors near the end of  the bankruptcy process. This requirement is consistent with the increased  attention being paid by Congress and executive branch agencies in recent  years to improving Americans\u2019 financial literacy. As we have noted in  earlier reports, we believe that ensuring that Americans have the  knowledge and skills to manage their money wisely is a key element in  improving the economic health of our nation in current and future  generations. Financial education efforts that seek to achieve goals such  as reducing Americans\u2019 debt are key to helping improve our citizens\u2019  economic security and our country\u2019s economic growth.", "The fees charged for credit counseling and debtor education services  generally appear to be reasonable. However, the extent to which fees are  waived varies considerably among providers. The Trustee Program has not  issued rules or formal guidance for what constitutes a debtor\u2019s \u201cability to  pay\u201d because it wants to give providers flexibility to respond to market  conditions. While we understand the program\u2019s reluctance to be too  prescriptive, we also believe that clearer guidance on criteria for reducing  or waiving fees would have several benefits, including reducing  uncertainty among providers about appropriate criteria, providing greater  transparency on waiver policies, and ensuring compliance with minimum  standards for waiving fees among all providers. At the same time, this  guidance should give providers some flexibility, so as not to discourage  those who may wish to waive fees more liberally than required.", "The supply of credit counseling and debtor education providers appears to  be sufficient to allow consumers to access these services in a timely  manner. While in-person services are not always available in some  locations, this concern is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the great  majority of clients appear to prefer telephone or Internet counseling.  Accessing services in languages other than English or Spanish has been a  challenge for some consumers, however. The Trustee Program\u2019s recent  efforts to better communicate providers\u2019 language and translation services  represent positive actions in facilitating access by speakers of foreign  languages. Further, the courts\u2019 recent steps to better ensure that filers are  aware of the prefiling counseling requirement are beneficial given the  potential consequences of filing for bankruptcy without the required  counseling certificate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Attorney General direct the Director of the  Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to do the following:    To help assess the merit of the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s prefiling counseling  requirement, the Trustee Program should develop a mechanism that would  allow the program or other parties to track the outcomes of prefiling  credit counseling, including the number of individuals issued counseling  certificates who then file for bankruptcy. This may involve working in  conjunction with the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to ensure  that the unique certificate numbers issued by the Trustee Program can be  linked to bankruptcy petitions filed with the courts.", "To clarify the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s requirement that prefiling credit  counseling and predischarge debtor education be provided regardless of a  client\u2019s ability to pay, the Trustee Program should issue formal guidance  on what constitutes \u201cability to pay.\u201d In developing this guidance, the  program should examine the reasons behind the significant variation  among providers in waiving fees.

It said it plans to refine and expand its current tracking and data  collection methods and explore the feasibility of developing more  comprehensive outcome measures.

We also reviewed the July 2006 interim  final rule on application procedures and criteria for approval of credit  counseling and debtor education agencies, and we obtained and reviewed  the public comments on this rule received by the Department of Justice\u2019s   Trustee Program. We also interviewed representatives of, and obtained  relevant documentation from, the Trustee Program\u2019s Credit Counseling  and Debtor Education Unit, as well as the Federal Trade Commission,  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Administrative Office of the United States  Courts, and the National Association of Attorneys General, including  representatives from four states.

We also reviewed and analyzed data from  the Trustee Program on complaints received related to credit counseling  and debtor education providers, and the resolution of these complaints.", "Further, we conducted comprehensive interviews with representatives of  10 providers of credit counseling or debtor education that had been  approved by the Trustee Program. Seven of these providers had been  approved to offer both of these services, while one offered only credit  counseling and two offered only debtor education. These providers were  selected because they included the three largest providers of each service  and represented a range of different sizes, modes of delivery (in-person,  telephone, and Internet), geographic locations, trade association  affiliations, types of organizations, and years of experience. These 10  providers represented 62 percent and 53 percent of all prefiling credit  counseling and predischarge debtor education certificates, respectively,  that were issued from January 9, 2006, through October 17, 2006. We  obtained from nearly all of them materials used to facilitate sessions, such  as counselor training manuals, curricula, disclosures, workbooks, and  handouts. In addition, we interviewed representatives of two trade  organizations representing credit counseling agencies, the National  Foundation for Credit Counseling, and the Association of Independent  Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies.", "To address all of the objectives, we also reviewed a nonprobability sample  of the Trustee Program\u2019s case files for 32 provider applications that were  approved and 11 applications that were rejected. Among the approved  applications we reviewed, 15 were for credit counseling and 17 were for  debtor education; as of October 2006, the Trustee Program had approved  153 credit counseling providers and 268 debtor education providers.  Among the rejected applications we reviewed, 6 were for credit counseling  and 5 were for debtor education; as of October 2006, the Trustee Program  had rejected 96 applications. We did not do a probability sample because  of the limited size of the sample we could review and because we wanted  to ensure that the small sample included all of the largest providers and  specific numbers of other types of providers. The criteria we used to select  the provider application files included (1) size of the provider, as  measured by number of clients served 12 months prior to applying for  Trustee Program approval, (2) delivery mode (in-person, telephone, and  Internet), (3) type of organization (such as nonprofit agency, educational  institution, or Chapter 13 panel trustee), (4) length of time in business, (5)  trade association affiliation, and (6) geographic location.

To determine whether IRS had revoked the section 501(c)(3)  tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code, or taken other  enforcement actions against providers, we met with IRS officials and  reviewed their publicly available information. To determine if providers  had been subject to other enforcement actions, we met with  representatives of the Federal Trade Commission and selected state  investigative agencies. We also met with the Council of Better Business  Bureaus and obtained Better Business Bureau reports for a selection of  offices of the three largest providers.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed and analyzed the materials  used by our sample of providers to facilitate in-person, telephone, and  Internet counseling and debtor education. For context, we observed a  credit counseling session conducted in person (for which the provider  obtained the client\u2019s consent) and listened to a recording of a counseling  session conducted by telephone (which did not allow identification of the  client). We also observed two debtor education sessions conducted by  telephone\u2014one live and one recorded\u2014which did not include the clients\u2019  identities. We also participated, with the provider\u2019s consent, in three mock  credit counseling sessions conducted via the Internet.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed guidance provided by the  Trustee Program on its Web site related to fees and fee waivers. We  reviewed and analyzed data maintained by the Trustee Program related to  providers\u2019 fees, but we determined that these data were not reliable. As a  result, to learn providers\u2019 fees and waiver policies, we relied largely on  testimonial evidence from 10 providers we interviewed. In some cases, we  also reviewed fee information supplied by providers on their Web sites.  We also reviewed a study by the National Foundation for Credit  Counseling that included information on its members\u2019 fees for prefiling  counseling and debtor education sessions.", "To address the fourth objective, we reviewed available data from the  Trustee Program on the number and characteristics of providers and  analyzed the number and geographic distribution of providers.

However, administrators in  Alabama and North Carolina told us their approved credit counseling  sessions may be conducted entirely via the Internet without any direct  interaction between the debtor and a counselor.
