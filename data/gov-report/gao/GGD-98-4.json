The legislative history of the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984, while acknowledging the conflict, does not resolve it. In 1984, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) determined that certain provisions of the draft legislation to make NARA an independent agency would allow NARA to review management records that might contain tax returns or return information. Treasury expressed opposition to any overriding of the access restrictions of section 6103, stating that it would endanger taxpayer compliance if NARA were given access to tax returns that were filed with the expectation of confidentiality. Accordingly, the Senate bill was amended to provide that, notwithstanding any provision of the act, no tax returns or return information as defined in section 6103 may be disclosed, except as authorized by that title. The conference report stated that the concern for the confidentiality of tax returns and return information was a legitimate issue that deserved consideration as a separate matter. The report also noted that the conferees were sensitive to the need to protect (1) the confidentiality of tax returns and return information while also protecting the permanent historical records of our government\u2019s actions and (2) the public\u2019s right to know about those actions at some future time. Consequently, the conferees urged NARA, IRS, and other affected agencies to devise a cooperative means to address the issue.", "The inconsistencies between the laws have resulted in a number of controversies. For example, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which provides advice to resolve inconsistencies that arise within the executive branch from differing interpretations of federal statutes, has issued at least three memorandums addressing the section 6103 issue and the transfer of records containing tax returns or return information to NARA.", "OLC concluded in 1986\u2014its most recent memorandum\u2014that the statutory provisions generally empowering NARA to obtain and open 30-year-old records that are subject to statutory restrictions in 44 U.S.C. 2107 and 2108 do not apply to tax returns and return information, which are strictly protected by section 6103. Title 44 U.S.C. 2107(2) provides that when it appears to the Archivist to be in the public interest, he may direct the transfer to the National Archives federal agency records that (1) have been in existence for more than 30 years and (2) have been determined by the Archivist to have sufficient historical value to warrant their continued preservation. Title 44 U.S.C. 2108 in turn provides that the Archivist is responsible for the custody, use, and withdrawal of records transferred to him, and that such records are subject to the same statutory limitations and restrictions with respect to their examination and use as were applicable to the agency from which the records were transferred. Section 2108 provides further that statutory and other restrictions shall remain in force until the records have been in existence for 30 years, unless the Archivist, by order, having consulted with the head of the transferring agency, determines that for reasons consistent with standards established in relevant statutory laws, such restrictions shall remain in force for a longer period.", "Referring to its two previous memorandums, OLC advised that section 6103 and its legislative history indicated that such tax records are not to be transferred to NARA. OLC reasoned that the legislative history of section 6103 made it clear that Congress intended no disclosure of tax returns or return information, except in the carefully limited exceptions found in section 6103.", "Recent concerns raised about IRS\u2019 records management program, as well as allegations that IRS was using the access restrictions of section 6103 to avoid making public records that could be embarrassing to the agency, led Congress to reopen this access issue last year. The conference report accompanying IRS\u2019 1997 budget directed the two agencies to submit a report to the cognizant committees by March 1, 1997. The report was to include an analysis of outstanding issues and recommendations as to how the disposition of certain IRS records should proceed. NARA and IRS submitted a report on March 17, 1997; however, because of a pending lawsuit the agencies did not provide specific recommendations in their report. The two agencies remained unable to reach agreement on the long-standing issue of access. In an attempt to end the long-standing access to IRS records issue, identical bills were introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in July 1997 as part of the congressional effort to restructure IRS.

Accordingly, the head of each agency is to submit to NARA schedules of agency records proposing the time for disposal of those records that do not have sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant further preservation.

These backlogged headquarters records included the historical office files of the former IRS commissioners, criminal investigative case files, corporate tax returns for 1909 through 1919, and records of the Special Services Staff (created during the Watergate era to review certain tax returns). In early 1996, NARA and IRS formed an interagency working group to try to find a mutually acceptable way to allow NARA to appraise IRS records.", "IRS and NARA devised a test method for appraising some of the backlogged headquarters records, beginning in early 1996 with about 198 cubic feet of records from the former office of the executive secretariat and from former commissioners. The test method involved separating the records into two groups\u2014section 6103-protected and 6103-nonprotected records. IRS and NARA engaged in a blind review of the 6103-protected records, whereby an IRS disclosure officer described the records\u2019 contents to the NARA records appraiser who decided on the basis of this description whether the records had historical value. The 6103-nonprotected records were made available to NARA for appraisal.", "After the appraisal of the protected and nonprotected records was completed, IRS staff prepared a records control schedule for records disposition. The schedule separated the records into three categories\u2014those that had historical value and did not contain tax returns or return information; those that had historical value and contained tax returns or return information, and those that were temporary, nonhistorical records that could be destroyed.

As an alternative, IRS officials said that they offered to regroup the individual 6103-protected files into restricted and nonrestricted stacks and to redact (block out restricted material), where necessary, to expedite NARA\u2019s review. According to IRS officials, NARA officials declined, preferring to keep the files in the order they were filed so that the context of each record could be understood by a records appraiser.", "In a March 1997 report to the Congress, NARA officials indicated that the blind review process worked well for this group of records because their historical value was readily apparent.

Accordingly, we have deleted the discussion of the options from this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided drafts of this report to the heads of NARA and IRS for their comments. Both agencies provided written comments, which are discussed in the following sections, and technical corrections, which we incorporated in this report where appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NARA\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["NARA\u2019s comments centered on two major points. First, while the Archivist has the statutory responsibility to approve the disposition of records and to select records for permanent retention, NARA believes that it is currently unable to fulfill this responsibility for all IRS records because it lacks access to the records. NARA notes, as we do in this report, that the process by which it appraises and approves the disposition of agency records is, by law, the official procedure. In line with NARA\u2019s comments on this point, we sought to emphasize in this report the statutory basis for NARA\u2019s oversight of federal records management. At the same time, we continued to highlight the conflict between NARA\u2019s statutory responsibilities and the disclosure provisions of section 6103.", "Second, NARA discussed the legal interpretation of section 6103 and the policy questions it raises for both agencies. NARA stressed that although NARA employees in the FRCs are involved in the retrieval, refiling, and eventual destruction of individual tax returns on an ongoing basis, they do not have similar access to records containing tax returns or return information for appraisal and disposition purposes. IRS\u2019 comments, which we discuss in more detail below, noted that tax returns may be stored at FRCs for retrieval and use by the agency pursuant to section 6103. However, IRS does not believe that section 6103 would allow NARA access to tax returns or return information for appraisal purposes. IRS has interpreted section 6103 as allowing the disclosure of tax returns and return information for purposes of tax administration to the extent necessary in connection with the processing, storage, transmission, and reproduction of such information; the programming, maintenance, repair, testing, and procurement of equipment; and the providing of other services. The one court that has specifically examined this issue agreed with IRS\u2019 interpretation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019 Comments", "paragraphs": ["IRS explained that Congress has put very tight restrictions on access to tax returns and return information and that its interpretation of section 6103 precludes any access that has not been expressly granted by legislation. As previously mentioned, H.R. 2292 and S. 1096, introduced July 30 and 31, 1997, respectively, each include a section that would provide a statutory mechanism for NARA access to IRS records.", "IRS also commented that its relationship with NARA, except for the section 6103 issue, has been satisfactory over the years. IRS described, as examples of the agencies\u2019 satisfactory working relationship, the routine management and disposition of its huge volume of individual tax returns and its efforts in addressing the 58 recommendations made by NARA in its evaluation of IRS\u2019 records management program. We mentioned in this report that IRS and NARA had worked together on several occasions and accomplished various tasks.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Finance, other interested congressional committees, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other interested parties.
