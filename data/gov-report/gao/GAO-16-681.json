PKEMRA created within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the Office of Emergency Communications, which has taken a number of steps aimed at ensuring that state and local agencies have the plans, resources, and training they need to support reliable emergency communications. PKEMRA also directed DHS to develop the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP). The NECP includes goals for improving emergency communications and encourages states to align their plans with these emergency communications goals. PKEMRA further established the Emergency Communications Preparedness Center (ECPC), comprising 14 member agencies, to improve coordination and information sharing among federal emergency communications programs. GAO previously identified key features and issues to consider when implementing collaborative mechanisms, including interagency groups like the ECPC. GAO found that the ECPC's collaborative efforts were consistent with most of these features, such as those related to leadership and resources, but were not fully consistent with others. For example, one of the key features calls for interagency groups to clearly define goals and track progress, yet the ECPC has not done so. As a result, the ECPC's member agencies might not understand the ECPC's goals or have a chance to ensure that the goals align with their own agencies' purposes and goals. Furthermore, the ECPC puts forth recommendations that could improve emergency communications. But the recommendations are implemented at the discretion of the ECPC's member agencies and are not tracked. Without a mechanism to track the ECPC's recommendations, it is unclear the extent to which the recommendations are being implemented and the ECPC is missing an opportunity to monitor its progress.", "Almost all of the Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWIC) responding to GAO's survey reported that to better plan for emergency communications during disasters, their states have taken the following steps since PKEMRA: (1) developed comprehensive strategic plans for emergency communications that align with the NECP; (2) established SWIC positions to support state emergency communications initiatives, such as developing high-level policy and coordinating training and exercises; and (3) implemented governance structures to manage the systems of people, organizations, and technologies that need to collaborate to effectively plan for emergencies. GAO did not independently verify state responses. In responding to GAO's survey, most SWICs reported not having a comprehensive emergency communications plans in place prior to PKEMRA's 2006 enactment. In particular, prior to the enactment of PKEMRA, only a few states had comprehensive emergency communications plans in place, but now all but one have such a plan. Most of the SWICs also reported that their statewide plans cover key elements, such as governance, standard operating procedures, and training and exercises, which are considered by DHS as the essential foundation for achieving the NECP goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to DHS aimed at improving the ECPC's collaborative efforts, including defining its goals and tracking its recommendations.

In the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina in 2005, gaps were apparent in how federal, state, and  local entities responded to the catastrophic storm, including that  emergency communications were not operable, interoperable, and  continuous. In addition, many available communications assets were not  fully utilized because of insufficient planning and coordination. Congress  passed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006  (PKEMRA) to improve the federal government\u2019s preparation for and  response to natural and manmade disasters. Among the more than 300  PKEMRA reforms, 10 provisions specifically relate to improving  emergency communications during disasters. Three of the emergency  communications provisions focus on planning and federal coordination  issues that were evident following Hurricane Katrina. These provisions (1)  established the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (2) directed DHS to develop the  National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP), a national strategy to  enhance emergency communications response; and (3) establish the  Emergency Communications Preparedness Center (ECPC), an  interagency group responsible for coordinating federal emergency  communications programs. In 2008, we reported on actions taken by  DHS and others to implement the emergency communications provisions  and found that not all of the provisions had been fully implemented at that  time. Since our prior report, all of PKEMRA\u2019s emergency  communications provisions have been implemented, but natural  disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012; terrorist attacks, such as the  2013 Boston Marathon bombings; and active shooter incidents continue  to test the nation\u2019s emergency communications capabilities. These  incidences can stretch across jurisdictional borders, further highlighting  the need for operable, interoperable, and continuous emergency  communications. Given that localities are the first line of response  following a disaster, emergency communications planning at the state  and local level is very important, and such planning facilitates  coordination and decision making across all levels of government. DHS\u2019s  National Response Framework stresses that planning is an inherent  responsibility of every level of government.", "After Hurricane Sandy severely damaged local infrastructure, you asked  us to evaluate how the implementation of PKEMRA\u2019s many provisions  has affected disaster preparedness, response, and recovery in general. In  this report, we focus on three emergency communications provisions  related to planning and federal coordination. Specifically, we examined  (1) federal efforts to implement PKEMRA\u2019s emergency communications  provisions related to planning and federal coordination, and (2) how  states\u2019 emergency communications planning has changed since  PKEMRA and what challenges remain for the states. We plan to review  PKEMRA\u2019s other emergency communications provisions related to  disaster response and recovery in future work.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant reports, plans, and  other documentation from DHS and other federal agencies with  responsibilities related to emergency communications, such as the NECP  and progress reports on its implementation, biennial reports to Congress  on emergency communications, and Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) reports on 911 and Enhanced 911 (E911) services.  We interviewed officials from DHS, FCC, and the Department of  Commerce (Commerce) to determine their efforts to implement the  PKEMRA emergency communications provisions. We reviewed  documentation on the establishment of the ECPC, such as its charter and  plans to understand its mission and purpose, as well as the Annual  Strategic Assessments prepared for Congress to understand the steps  and progress the ECPC has taken to improve federal coordination. We  also interviewed 5 of 14 ECPC member agencies (DHS, FCC,  Commerce, the Department of Transportation, and the General Services  Administration) to understand their roles on the ECPC and how the ECPC  has supported the coordination of federal emergency communications  efforts. We selected agencies to interview with a range of emergency  communications experience, and the views we obtained do not  necessarily represent the views of all ECPC member agencies. We  assessed the ECPC\u2019s collaborative efforts against six of seven key  features and issues to consider when implementing collaborative  mechanisms that we identified in a September 2012 report. Additionally,  to understand how states\u2019 emergency communications planning has  changed since PKEMRA and what challenges remain for the states, we  surveyed the Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWIC) in 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and 5 territories. We surveyed SWICs from  February 2016 to April 2016 and received 52 responses for a 93 percent  response rate.

DHS developed the National  Response Framework that identified core capabilities necessary to  ensure national preparedness, such as operational planning at the federal  and state level and emergency communications capabilities that enable  emergency responders to effectively communicate with each other.  States and localities provide the first response to any disaster and thus  must plan and coordinate, across state lines, and with federal entities as  well. States have developed plans and made efforts to coordinate in  support of emergency communications. For example, state plans, called  Statewide Communication Interoperability Plans, are intended to define  the current and future direction for interoperable and emergency  communications within the state.", "In addition to DHS, other federal agencies play a role in supporting  emergency communications during disasters. Specifically, FCC manages  the use of spectrum by non-federal entities, including commercial  enterprises and state and local governments, and administers policies  related to 911 and E911 services. The Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is  responsible for managing spectrum used by the federal government and  can temporarily assign spectrum during an emergency to aid the  response. Along with FCC, NTIA deploys personnel to support disasters  in response to a mission assignment from DHS. Furthermore, the First  Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), an independent authority within  NTIA, is in the process of planning for the deployment of a high-speed,  interoperable nationwide wireless broadband network for use by federal,  state, tribal, and local public safety personnel.", "Congress passed PKEMRA in 2006 to address issues that arose during  Hurricane Katrina, including emergency communications issues.

The NECP, first issued by DHS in 2008,  served as the first national strategy aimed at improving emergency  communications interoperability and provided a road map to improve  emergency communications capabilities. For example, the 2008 NECP  encouraged states to have standard operating procedures for specified  events. To assist the states in this effort, OEC developed a toolkit that  provides general guidance and tools for state communications planners in  developing a plan for special events and made a variety of templates  available online for states to use in developing standard operating  procedures.", "In 2014, DHS released its second NECP, which contains the following  five goals:", "Governance and leadership: Enhance decision making, coordination,  and planning for emergency communications through strong  governance structures and leadership.", "Planning and procedures: Update plans and procedures to improve  emergency responder communications and readiness in a dynamic- operating environment.", "Training and exercises: Improve responders\u2019 ability to coordinate and  communicate through training and exercise programs that use all  available technologies and target gaps in emergency  communications.", "Operational coordination: Ensure operational effectiveness through  the coordination of communications capabilities, resources, and  personnel from across the whole community.", "Research and development: Coordinate research, development,  testing, and evaluation activities to develop innovative emergency  communications capabilities that support the needs of emergency  responders.", "DHS has taken various actions to support states\u2019 efforts to address these  goals.

There are 14  member agencies of the ECPC that have staff on an Executive  Committee responsible for setting the ECPC\u2019s priorities. In addition, the  ECPC has a Steering Committee and focus groups that develop plans to  address the priorities.

We  previously reported that establishing shared outcomes and goals that  resonate with, and are agreed upon by all participants, is essential to  achieving outcomes in interagency groups, but can also be challenging.  Participants each bring different views, organizational cultures, missions,  and ways of operating. Participants may even disagree on the nature of  the problem or issue being addressed. Furthermore, agency officials  involved in several of the interagency groups we previously reviewed  cautioned that if agencies do not have a vested interest in the outcomes,  and if outcomes are not aligned with agency objectives, participant  agencies would not invest their limited time and resources. However, by  establishing outcomes and strategic goals based on the group\u2019s shared  interests, a collaborative group can shape its vision and define its own  purpose, and when articulated and understood by the group, this shared  purpose provides a reason to participate. Although DHS identified four  long-term goals for the ECPC in response to our questions, these goals  do not appear in the ECPC charter, program plan, or Annual Strategic  Assessment. In May 2016, DHS officials told us the ECPC\u2019s Executive  Committee agreed to develop a strategic plan to highlight the ECPC\u2019s  goals and provide additional guidance for the focus groups. However, the  DHS officials could not specify a time frame for completion. Without  clearly defined strategic goals, the member agencies might not  understand the ECPC\u2019s goals or have a chance to ensure that the goals  align with their own agencies\u2019 purposes and goals. Furthermore, it  remains unclear whether all member agencies have agreed on the  ECPC\u2019s goals and outcomes. In fact, ECPC member agencies we spoke  with were able to provide a general idea about the ECPC\u2019s purpose but  could not articulate its specific goals.", "Also with respect to outcomes and accountability, the ECPC does not  track or monitor its recommendations. The ECPC uses its Annual  Strategic Assessment to: (1) provide information on federal coordination  efforts, (2) define opportunities for improving federal emergency  communications, and (3) report on progress implementing some of the  focus groups\u2019 recommendations. For example, the ECPC grants focus  group made nine recommendations for federal grant program managers,  including that the managers should use the ECPC Financial Assistance  Reference Guide when planning and developing grant documents, and  should invest in standards-based equipment. According to DHS, the  grants focus group conducts annual surveys of member agencies to  assess whether the agencies had implemented any of these  recommendations. However, recommendations made by the other ECPC  focus groups are not tracked, and therefore it is unclear the extent to  which the recommendations have been implemented by ECPC\u2019s member  agencies. For example, the research and development focus group  identified five recommendations in 2015 that were aimed at improving  collaboration and information sharing around research and development  for emergency communications. Specifically, one recommendation was  for agencies to share technology profiles to prevent duplicative research.  However, it is voluntary for member agencies to implement the focus  group\u2019s recommendations, and it is unknown whether agencies are  sharing their technology profiles or if duplicative research is being  conducted. According to DHS officials, the ECPC does not have a  mechanism to determine whether the focus groups\u2019 recommendations are  implemented because it is up to the member agencies to decide if they  will implement recommendations and if so, to track them on an individual  basis. We have previously reported about the importance of federal  agencies engaged in collaborative efforts to publicly report performance  information as a tool for accountability.

For example, the Department of  Labor is a member of the ECPC, but according to DHS, it might not be  clear to all members why the Department of Labor is a participating  member. Similarly, officials from the General Services Administration told  us they do not know the roles of the other ECPC members and could only  speak to us about their own agency\u2019s role. DHS officials told us it would  be beneficial to have member agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities clearly  defined but expressed concern that some members, who participate  voluntarily, might not want defined responsibilities if such responsibilities  would require additional staff time and resources.

As a  collaborative entity, we found that while the ECPC\u2019s efforts were  consistent with most of the key features for effective collaboration, its  efforts were not completely consistent with key features related to  outcomes and accountability and clarity of roles and responsibilities.  Regarding outcomes and accountability, the ECPC has not documented  its strategic goals or established a mechanism to track the outcomes of  the focus group\u2019s recommendations. DHS officials told us the ECPC has  agreed to develop a strategic plan that would contain goals for the ECPC,  but there is no firm timetable for such a plan to be completed. Lacking  clearly defined strategic goals, the ECPC\u2019s member agencies might not  understand the ECPC\u2019s goals or have a chance to ensure that the goals  align with their own agencies\u2019 purposes and goals. Furthermore, the  ECPC\u2019s focus groups have spent time and resources to make  recommendations for improving emergency communications, but we  found the focus groups\u2019 recommendations, such as those related to  federal grant programs and research and development efforts, are  implemented at the discretion of the member agencies. Without a  mechanism to track the recommendations, it is unclear the extent to  which the recommendations are being implemented by the member  agencies, and the ECPC is missing an opportunity to monitor its efforts.  Regarding clarity of roles and responsibilities, the ECPC has not defined  the member agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities, and some member  agencies do not know the roles and responsibilities of other members, a  situation that may create barriers to working together effectively. Clearly  defining the members\u2019 respective roles and responsibilities would help to  provide an understanding of who will do what to support the ECPC\u2019s  efforts and facilitate decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of the  ECPC\u2019s efforts, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security,  as the administrative leader of the ECPC, take the following actions:  clearly document the ECPC\u2019s strategic goals; establish a mechanism to track progress by the ECPC\u2019s member  agencies in implementing the ECPC\u2019s recommendations; and  clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the ECPC\u2019s member  agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS, Commerce, and FCC for their  review and comment.

Specifically, we examined (1) federal efforts to implement these  PKEMRA emergency communications provisions and (2) how states\u2019  emergency communications planning has changed since PKEMRA and  what challenges remain for the states.", "To determine federal efforts to implement the three PKEMRA emergency  communications provisions, we reviewed our 2008 report and other  relevant reports and documentation from the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), such as DHS\u2019s biennial reports to Congress on  emergency communications, and reports from other agencies, such as  the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) 911 and Enhanced  911 services report. We also reviewed the NECP from 2008 and the  subsequent reports on the progress meeting its goals, as well as the 2014  NECP. We interviewed officials from DHS, FCC, and the Department of  Commerce (Commerce) to determine their roles and the progress  implementing the provisions. We compiled information from the reports  and interviews to assess how the provisions were implemented and if  they were fully implemented. To understand the ECPC\u2019s collaborative  practices, we reviewed the ECPC charter, program plan, and Annual  Strategic Assessments prepared for Congress, and interviewed ECPC  member agencies. Specifically, we interviewed 5 of 14 ECPC member  agencies (DHS, FCC, Commerce, the Department of Transportation, and  the General Services Administration) to determine their roles on the  ECPC, their understanding of the ECPC goals, and the member  agencies\u2019 responsibilities. We selected agencies to interview with a range  of emergency communications experience, and the views we obtained do  not necessarily represent the views of all ECPC member agencies. We  assessed the ECPC\u2019s collaborative efforts against six of seven key  considerations for implementing collaborative mechanisms that we  identified in a September 2012 report.", "To understand how state emergency communications planning has  changed since PKEMRA and the challenges states still face, we surveyed  Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWIC) in 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and 5 territories. The list of SWICs was obtained from DHS  and confirmed via email. We conducted a web-based survey that  addressed issues pertaining to state planning, governance, and  challenges, specifically asking about the Statewide Communications  Interoperability Plan (SCIP) and other emergency communications plans,  and the role of the SWIC. To ensure the survey questions were clear and  logical, we pretested the survey with three states: North Dakota, Texas,  and Wyoming. These states were selected based on the types of  disasters facing the states, the number of recent disasters, and  geographic diversity. We administered our survey from February 2016 to  April 2016 and received 52 responses for a 93 percent response rate.  American Samoa, Massachusetts, the Northern Mariana Islands, and  Puerto Rico did not respond to our survey. In addition, we interviewed  selected SWICs from Kentucky and Wyoming to understand how the  SCIPs and other emergency communications plans are used in preparing  for emergencies. We selected these SWICs to interview based on  geographic region, an occurrence of a recent disaster in the state, and  because the Wyoming SWIC was the chair of the National Council of  Statewide Interoperability Coordinators. We conducted semi-structured  interviews with each SWIC to understand if they had a SCIP, how they  used the SCIP, the governance structures the state uses to manage  emergency communications, and the challenges their states encounter  with emergency communications during disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Survey of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators", "paragraphs": ["The questions we asked in our survey of Statewide Interoperability  Coordinators and the aggregate results of responses to the closed-ended  questions are shown below.
