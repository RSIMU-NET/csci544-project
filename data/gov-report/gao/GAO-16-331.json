While most benefits are paid correctly, beneficiary or SSA error can result in overpayments\u2014that is, payments made in excess of what is owed. In fiscal year 2015, SSA detected $1.2 billion in new overpayments, adding to growing cumulative debt. Further, when individuals inappropriately obtain benefits in certain situations, SSA can levy penalties or withhold benefits for a period of time. GAO was asked to study the use of these actions, and SSA efforts to recover overpayments.", "This report examined how and to what extent SSA recovers overpayments, and imposes penalties and sanctions. GAO analyzed data on existing DI overpayments and repayment amounts at the end of fiscal year 2015 to determine the effect of potential improvements in recovery methods on collection amounts; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, policies, and studies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2015, the Social Security Administration (SSA) recovered $857 million in Disability Insurance (DI) overpayments that it erroneously made to beneficiaries; however, SSA is missing opportunities to recover more. More than three-fourths of the recovered overpayments in fiscal year 2015 were collected by withholding all or a portion of a beneficiary's monthly benefits. SSA's policy is to set withholding repayment amounts based on a beneficiary's income, expenses, and assets, but its policy regarding which expenses are reasonable is not clear. Moreover, SSA cannot know if repayment periods and amounts are consistently determined due to a lack of oversight, such as supervisory review or targeted quality reviews. Further, SSA lacks concrete plans for pursuing other debt recovery options, while GAO's analysis suggests that some options could potentially increase collections from individuals having their benefits withheld. For example, about half of withholding plans at the end of fiscal year 2015 extended beyond SSA's standard 36-month time frame, and could be shortened. Making the minimum monthly repayment 10 percent of a beneficiary's monthly benefit, instead of the current $10 minimum, would shorten the median length of all scheduled withholding plans by almost a third (from 3.4 years to 2.3 years) and result in an additional $276 million collected over the next 5 years.", "While SSA officials reported an increase in recent years in the amount of civil monetary penalties imposed, SSA currently lacks reliable data to effectively track the disposition of penalties and administrative sanctions. For example, SSA cannot readily track the amounts ultimately collected from penalties, which are fines imposed by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and collected by SSA. Further, SSA currently has only two paths for collecting on penalties\u2014withholding benefits and voluntary payment. A recent OIG audit found that the majority of uncollected penalty amounts it reviewed were from individuals who were not receiving SSA benefits and with whom SSA had no ongoing collection actions. SSA determined it is able to use certain alternative collection tools, such as wage garnishment, but only recently began drafting regulations to use them, and the regulations are still undergoing internal review. In addition, SSA lacks and had not explored obtaining authority to use other tools for collecting penalties that it uses for collecting overpayments\u2014such as credit bureau reporting. Related to administrative sanctions, SSA could not provide reliable data on how often it imposes sanctions, a punishment in which benefit payments are temporarily stopped. SSA's process of manually entering sanctions information into a database may be subject to errors or omissions. Regional officials said this can result in incomplete information and staff not taking appropriate action on cases. SSA changed its procedure in 2013 to direct that all potential sanctions first be reviewed for potential prosecution or civil monetary penalties, but SSA's lack of reliable data prevents it from determining whether this new procedure achieved the intended effect of more consistent application of sanctions. In an internal evaluation of its procedures, SSA identified weaknesses with how sanctions decisions are tracked and communicated, but it is in the early stages of deciding how to address them. The shortcomings in SSA's use of penalties and sanctions potentially diminish the deterrent value of these actions against individuals who may fraudulently obtain benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to SSA, including: clarify its policy and improve oversight related to debt repayment plans, pursue additional recovery options for overpayments and penalties, and improve its ability to track penalties and sanctions.

That same year, SSA reported  detecting $1.2 billion in new DI overpayments\u2014payments made in excess  of what individuals are owed. Past GAO work has highlighted the  importance of preventing overpayments to DI beneficiaries given the  financial burden it places on recipients and the difficulty this population  may have in repaying these debts. Nevertheless, recovering erroneous  payments once they are made is also an important part of maintaining the  integrity of the program. While SSA has a number of tools to recover  overpaid benefits, previous GAO reviews found shortcomings in the  agency\u2019s recovery efforts, and the total amount of DI overpayment debt  that has accumulated increased by 70 percent over the past 10 years.  SSA can also take actions against individuals who mislead the agency to  fraudulently obtain benefits by imposing civil monetary penalties, or  imposing administrative sanctions that involve halting benefit payments.

We also obtained data on existing DI overpayments and  repayment plan amounts as of September 30, 2015. We used these data  to determine the number and amount of overpayments owed to SSA, and  to estimate the length of benefit withholding plans to repay these debts,  which were in effect as of that date. We also used these data to calculate  the effect on scheduled repayments if SSA were to implement additional  debt collection methods. We assessed the reliability of these data by  checking for implausible values and by comparing the data to figures  publicly reported by SSA. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. To provide additional insight on how SSA documents  and determines how much beneficiaries can repay on overpayment  debts, we reviewed a non-representative sample of 16 overpayment  cases. We selected cases to reflect a range of amounts based on the  amount of the original overpayment and the percentage of beneficiaries\u2019  monthly benefits withheld to repay debts.

Specifically, when SSA detects an overpayment, it  requests a full immediate refund, unless the overpayment can be withheld  from the beneficiary\u2019s next monthly benefit. SSA also notifies the overpaid  person that they may request reconsideration, a waiver, or both. A  beneficiary requests reconsideration when he or she disputes that an  overpayment occurred or the amount of the overpayment, and requests a  waiver when asserting that he or she is neither responsible for the  overpayment nor capable of repaying it. SSA may grant a waiver request  if it finds that the beneficiary was not at fault for the overpayment and that  recovering the overpayment would defeat the purpose of the program or  be against good conscience and equity. A waiver permanently  terminates collection of a debt.", "If SSA denies a reconsideration, a waiver, or both, the agency will request  full repayment. SSA will attempt to withhold SSA benefits from the  beneficiary to immediately recoup the full amount. If the individual is not  receiving SSA benefits at the time or is unable to immediately pay the full  amount owed, the agency generally requests a repayment plan. This may  take the form of voluntary remittances or withholding from monthly SSA  benefits. These withholdings may be taken from DI or other SSA benefits  being received, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.  Withholding from other SSA benefits is known as cross-program  recovery. SSA policy is to obtain repayment within 36 months, but it may  approve longer repayment periods after reviewing an individual\u2019s income,  expenses, and assets. SSA regulations require a minimum monthly DI  withholding of $10, an amount that has not changed since 1960 according  to SSA.", "SSA\u2019s policy is to stop its collection activities and temporarily write off a  debt if it meets at least one of these criteria: the debtor cannot or will not  repay the debt, the debtor cannot be located after a diligent search, the  cost of collection actions is likely to exceed the amount recovered, or  the debt is at least two years delinquent. (SSA may refer to such debt  write-offs as terminating or conditionally writing off debts.) Temporarily  writing off debts conditionally removes them from SSA\u2019s accounts  receivable balance, although SSA will refer debts to Treasury for  collection through external tools. Prior to referring debts to Treasury, SSA  notifies debtors and informs them of the appeal rights. SSA will re- establish these debts and its own collection efforts if it receives payment  through these external collection tools or if the individual becomes re- entitled to Social Security benefits. External debt collection tools include  tax refund offset, which withholds or reduces federal tax refunds to the  individual;  federal salary offset, which withholds or reduces wages and payments  to federal employees; administrative offset, which withholds or reduces other federal  payments (other than tax refunds or salary) to the individual; administrative wage garnishment, which garnishes wages and  payments from private employers or state and local governments; and  credit bureau referral, which reports delinquent debt to credit bureaus  and may adversely affect an individual\u2019s credit scores.", "Conditionally written-off debts remain subject to collections through any  available tools until the debt is paid in full or the case is otherwise  resolved.

According to SSA policy,  staff are to obtain an SSA form 632 documenting financial information,  including income and expenses, from a beneficiary to determine his or  her ability to repay an overpayment when the beneficiary requests a  repayment period exceeding 36 months. In these cases, SSA policy  generally directs staff to withhold the amount by which an individual\u2019s  income exceeds expenses, or the rate permitted by income or assets if  there are excess assets, and notes that this amount should generally not  be less than $10 per month. However, a recent report prepared for SSA  by an external auditor found that the agency has contradictory policies for  determining what reasonable expenses are for beneficiaries.

Further, collection  activities shall be undertaken promptly with follow-up action taken as  necessary.", "Our analysis of the options we examined show that they hold promise for  increasing SSA\u2019s recovery of DI overpayments. We reviewed  overpayments as of September 30, 2015 that were being repaid through  benefits withholding, and determined how existing scheduled benefit  withholding amounts would be affected by: (1) making the minimum  withholding amount 10 percent of monthly DI benefits, (2) adjusting  withholding amounts according to annual COLAs, and (3) charging  interest on debts being collected through withholding. We took  outstanding debts and withholding levels and computed the repayment  schedule under the status quo and each alternative option. By definition,  repayment schedules do not account for future changes such as  individuals who gain or lose eligibility for benefits or whose ability to repay  changes. Changes such as those mean that actual collections differ from  scheduled collections. Options that increase withholding will speed  recovery and reduce the effects of attrition, while charging interest will  delay the completion of repayment and magnify the effects of attrition.  Nonetheless, these options\u2014implemented alone or in combination\u2014have  the potential to significantly increase collections of overpayment debt.", "Of the options we examined, setting a minimum withholding amount equal  to 10 percent of an individual\u2019s monthly DI benefit has the greatest  potential to increase scheduled collections and reduce the amount of time  to fully recover overpayments. We estimate this option would increase  scheduled collections by $276 million over 5 years and reduce the  median scheduled time to fully recover all beneficiary overpayments from  3.4 years to 2.3 years. Further, those beneficiaries scheduled to take over  20 years to complete repayment would decrease from 17 percent to 4  percent. Figure 6 below provides additional information on the effect of  this scenario on scheduled repayment times. The increase in collections  under this scenario comes entirely from individuals currently having less  than 10 percent of their benefits withheld, and as such, the changes  within this portion of the population are more pronounced when examined  separately. Among those beneficiaries, the median scheduled repayment  time would decrease by over half, from 5.9 to 2.5 years.", "Increasing the minimum withholding rate to 10 percent of monthly benefits  could also be implemented in a way that improves collections while  sparing or minimizing the effect on beneficiaries receiving the lowest  monthly benefits. We estimate that only about 5 percent of the increase in  collections would come from the quartile of beneficiaries receiving the  lowest monthly benefits, in part because they already have a  disproportionately larger amount of benefits withheld, and in part because  increasing the withholding rate recovers much less dollar-wise from those  receiving lower monthly benefit levels than those with higher benefits.", "We estimate that adjusting monthly withholding amounts according to  COLAs or charging interest on overpayment debt would have a smaller  effect than changing the minimum withholding rate to 10 percent of  monthly benefits (see table 1), but could help protect the DI trust fund  from the effects of inflation. For example, if SSA overpaid a dollar in 1985  and the beneficiary repaid that dollar 30 years later in 2015, the  recovered dollar would have only 45 percent of the buying power of the  1985 dollar. Similarly, if SSA overpaid a dollar in 2010 and recovered it in  2015, the repaid dollar would have only about 92 percent of the buying  power of the dollar SSA overpaid. Given that many withholding plans  extend for decades, the effect of inflation can be significant. Charging  interest on outstanding overpayment balances at the rate of inflation  would counteract the effect of inflation and give repaid dollars the same  buying power they had when erroneously paid years earlier. Other  agencies already charge debtors interest. For instance, the Internal  Revenue Service charges individuals with delinquent tax debt interest at a  rate that is adjusted quarterly and is based on the federal short-term  interest rate. Similarly, adjusting monthly withholding amounts according  to COLA increases could help accelerate repayments and thus help  negate the effect of inflation on amounts repaid to the DI Trust Fund.", "Implementing any combinations of the options we examined could result  in even higher scheduled collections. For instance, setting a minimum  withholding rate of 10 percent of monthly DI benefits and charging an  interest rate of 1 percent would increase scheduled collections by $287  million over the next 5 years, while these options implemented individually  would be scheduled to bring in $276 million and $7 million respectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA Lacks Reliable Data and Oversight to Know Whether Penalties and Sanctions Are Used Effectively", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Lacks Reliable Data to Track and Tools to Collect Penalties", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s OIG has in recent years increased its use of penalties against  individuals who knowingly mislead the agency, according to SSA\u2019s Office  of Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG), which is responsible for  imposing penalties. According to SSA officials, in fiscal year 2010, OCIG  successfully resolved 89 cases and imposed penalties totaling  approximately $3.9 million. That increased to 313 cases and more than  $17.6 million in fiscal year 2015. OCIG officials attribute this increase to  improving its evaluations process and more management focus on the  use of penalties as a deterrent.", "Increased penalties notwithstanding, officials told us SSA lacks reliable  data on the status of penalties, how much of penalty amounts have been  collected, and how much is delinquent. While OCIG imposes penalties on  individuals, SSA\u2019s Office of Operations is ultimately responsible for  collecting these amounts. SSA officials said they could not provide us  with comprehensive data on the number and amount of penalties paid  because of limitations in their computer systems, and added that they  would need to review each individual case to determine its repayment  status. Federal Internal Control Standards indicate that program  managers need appropriate data to monitor the performance of their  program and help ensure accountability. Without valid data on the  disposition of penalties, SSA cannot determine whether penalties are  being used effectively across the agency and if individuals who mislead  the agency are paying as appropriate. SSA reports that it is planning a  number of steps to better track imposed penalties, and ultimately the  amounts collected as part of a larger effort to improve its processing of  overpayments and other debts. According to its plans, SSA hopes to: by  fiscal year 2018, assign penalties a unique transaction code to be able to  track them through the collection process; and by fiscal year 2020  unbundle penalties from other debts owed by an individual in its ROAR  database\u2014which is used to track debts and collections\u2014in order to allow  remittances to be directly applied to penalties as opposed to an  individual\u2019s cumulative debt. While such improvements could help  address the limitations we identified, they are a number of years away.  Further, SSA notes in its plans that they may be subject to delays related  to resource constraints. Moreover, SSA is still in the process of analyzing  and planning potential fixes. As such, it is uncertain whether SSA will  meet its intended time frames or whether its currently planned efforts may  change and ultimately address the shortcomings it identified.", "SSA has met with limited success collecting on imposed penalties, and is  not using some tools to better ensure that individuals who knowingly  mislead the agency pay their penalties. Officials said SSA currently only  collects penalties by either withholding DI or other SSA benefits, or  relying on individuals to voluntarily remit penalty amounts. A recent OIG  audit highlighted the difficulty that SSA has in collecting delinquent  penalties. In a sample of 50 penalties imposed between calendar years  2010 and 2012 totaling $1.9 million, OIG found that about $1.7 million of  that amount remained uncollected as of July 2014. The majority of that  amount (approximately $920,000) was associated with individuals not  receiving benefits and with whom SSA had no ongoing collection  actions\u2014the same category of individuals who could be targeted with  external collection tools. While officials noted the agency determined it  can refer penalties for collection through some external collection tools,  such as wage garnishment, tax refund offsets, and administrative offsets,  the agency has not utilized them. According to officials, SSA drafted a  regulation for implementing these options; however, the regulation is still  undergoing internal review and SSA does not yet have time frames for  implementing these options. Moreover, the agency determined it is  prohibited by statute from referring delinquent penalties for collection  through other tools, such as federal salary offset, credit bureau reporting,  and assessing interest. Nevertheless, SSA has not explored pursuing  legislative authorities to use these tools. By not collecting some  delinquent penalties and not considering additional tools to do so, SSA  may be undermining the deterrent value of penalties against potential  fraud.

SSA officials told us that some offices were more  aggressive in pursuing sanctions and that an offense that could result in  sanctions in one office might not do so in another office. The new  procedures direct that potential sanctions cases first be evaluated for  prosecution or civil action by DOJ and then by OIG for the imposition of  civil monetary penalties. Ultimately, SSA is responsible for determining  whether to impose sanctions based on the circumstances of the case,  such as whether evidence exists to show that the individual knowingly  misled the agency. The relevant SSA field office is responsible for  developing the documentation to support the sanction, which is then  reviewed by a sanctions coordinator in the SSA regional office.", "Despite changes in decision-making for sanction cases, unreliable data  and shortcomings in how SSA tracks sanctions prevent the agency from  reasonably ensuring that sanctions are imposed as appropriate, and  ultimately prevent SSA from assessing whether its recent procedural  changes had their desired effect.", "SSA cannot reasonably ensure sanctions are imposed as appropriate:  SSA officials told us that they could not provide us with reliable data  on the disposition of sanction cases. SSA currently tracks the  disposition of sanctions in a database, which includes whether  sanctions were imposed and the sanction period (i.e., the period of  time during which beneficiaries will not receive benefits). However,  this database requires SSA staff receiving information on sanctions to  manually enter information about the sanction into the database,  which lacks data checks or related oversight and may lead to errors  and omissions. For instance, officials in three regional offices with  oversight responsibilities told us that decisions on sanctions cases are  generally communicated between OIG and the relevant field office. If  these officials are inadvertently not included on the communications,  they cannot ensure that the sanctions database is properly updated.  One regional official said this has resulted in instances in which SSA  headquarters wanted to know why sanctions were not imposed in  particular cases, but this official did not have the information to  respond correctly. Furthermore, officials in two regions noted that  SSA\u2019s database does not generate alerts when field offices fail to take  action on potential sanctions cases, thus making it incumbent on  regional coordinators to manually track and follow up on the status of  cases. One regional official noted that the lack of tracking resulted in  several instances in which SSA was pursuing sanctions years after  the alleged wrongdoing.", "SSA cannot evaluate procedural changes: Beyond the disposition of  specific sanctions, officials told us that they also lacked reliable data  on the number of sanctions imposed and whether this number has  changed since the current procedures were instituted in 2013. This is  likely a result of the limitations in how sanctions data are captured as  described earlier. Moreover, SSA conducted an internal assessment  to determine whether field offices followed correct procedures for  implementing sanctions. Specifically, SSA selected a sample of cases  that were originally referred to OIG, and were subsequently returned  by OCIG to field offices. SSA determined that sanctions were not  imposed in the majority of cases in which sanctions were likely  warranted, often because field offices did not take action on cases in  a timely manner. The study did not determine why the agency failed to  act on these cases in a timely manner. SSA officials speculated that it  may be due to the difficulty of imposing harsh punishment on  beneficiaries and because sanctions are labor intensive for SSA staff.", "Federal Internal Control Standards indicate that managers need to  compare actual performance to planned or expected results and analyze  significant differences, and that operational data is needed to determine  whether they are meeting their goals for accountability.

Absent clear policies and oversight  procedures for establishing and reviewing withholding plans, which are  heavily relied on by SSA to recover the bulk of overpayments, SSA  cannot be sure that beneficiaries are repaying debts in appropriate  amounts within appropriate time frames. Further, SSA could be collecting  too little or too much money each month from beneficiaries by not  leveraging available tools to verify beneficiaries\u2019 ability to pay. By not  implementing additional debt collection tools that would speed up lengthy  withholding plans or ensure that the value of collections is not diminished  by inflation, SSA is missing opportunities to restore debt to the DI trust  fund.

For each month,  we then computed the recipient\u2019s remaining balance assuming that the  recipient repaid either their normal monthly repayment amount or the  remaining balance, whichever was less. We included the 0 percent  inflation scenario because it isolates the effects of factors other than  inflation. Social Security estimated long-range inflation scenarios of 2.0,  2.7, and 3.4 percent in its 2015 Trustee\u2019s Report.", "We computed total repayments in each scenario as the sum of monthly  payments. We assumed that people make monthly payments until they  have paid off their entire balance and then stop paying. If their balance  was less than their usual monthly payment, we assumed they paid  exactly the outstanding balance in their final month. We estimated  scheduled repayments for the following scenarios:  1.  Baseline collections (no change): We examined beneficiaries\u2019  outstanding overpayment balances as of September 30, 2015, as well  as their current monthly repayment rates. We used that information to  estimate, at current withholding rates, when beneficiaries are  scheduled to complete repaying their overpayment debts, age at  scheduled repayment, as well as how much they are scheduled to  repay over the next five fiscal years.  2.  Setting the minimum withholding rate to 10 percent of monthly DI  benefits: We computed the standing repayment amount as the greater  of 10 percent of the recipient\u2019s post-COLA benefits in each month or  the recipient\u2019s actual repayment amount in the ROAR system as of  September 30, 2015.  3.  Adjusting monthly withholding amounts by the cost of living  adjustment (COLA): These scenarios increased the withholding  amounts that SSA reported by 0, 2.0, 2.7, or 3.4 percent effective in  January of each year. The 2.0, 2.7, and 3.4 percent estimated COLAs  are based on SSA\u2019s long-range inflation estimates in the 2015 Social  Security Trustee\u2019s report. This scenario adjusts both benefit and  withholding amounts.  4.  Charging interest: This scenario increases the remaining balance at  the beginning of year by 1 percent in the 0 percent COLA scenario,  and an interest rate equal to the rate of inflation in the other scenarios.  We chose the 1 percent interest rate in the no inflation scenario  because it is the rate of interest the US government is allowed to  charge in calendar year 2016 on delinquent debts.  5.  Combined scenarios: We report the results of a few policy options in  combination. It is important to note that our combination of interest  and COLA effectively undo the effects of inflation on both monthly  repayment amounts and on total debt owed.", "We assessed the reliability of the data we used by checking for extreme  and implausible values and by comparing the totals in them to published  sources and found them to be sufficiently reliable for our use.", "In estimating scheduled repayments for the above scenarios, we made a  number of decisions and assumptions about overpayments and  withholdings in the custom file provided by SSA. The data provided by  SSA listed all overpayments that SSA is either actively trying to collect or  has conditionally written off, referred to Treasury, and will collect if the  beneficiary becomes eligible for disability or retirement benefits. These  data lists both a claimant\u2014the person whose disability creates eligibility  for DI benefits\u2014and a beneficiary\u2014who may be the claimant, the  claimant\u2019s spouse, or a dependent of the claimant. SSA officials told us  that the agency can seek repayment from the claimant, beneficiary, or  anyone else receiving benefits on the claimant\u2019s earnings record. We  aggregated this overpayment level data to the beneficiary level, taking the  maximum withholding amount per beneficiary if the beneficiary\u2019s account  showed more than one overpayment, and adding together withholding in  rare instances when one person benefited from overpayments to multiple  claimants.", "If a beneficiary had withholding on any one of the overpayments on his or  her record, we treated all overpayments on the account as subject to  recovery through withholding.

When the beneficiary\u2019s SSN was not available, we  developed a replacement unique identifier, first under the assumption that  there was only one person with a given name and date of birth, for each  claimant SSN; and if the name was missing, then the assumption that  each combination of a claimant SSN and the beneficiary identification  code variable identifies a unique person. The beneficiary identification  code indicates whether the beneficiary is, for example, the claimant\u2019s first  child, second child, or spouse. This methodology may slightly overstate  the total number of beneficiaries in the data, since it will miss cases  where the same person is the beneficiary of two different claimants.", "In order to count the number of recipients in withholding, voluntary  repayment, conditionally written off, and neither paying nor in written off  status, we developed categorization rules to resolve ambiguities arising  from the small percentage of beneficiaries who had debts in more than  one status. Specifically, we considered people to be in withholding status  if any of their overpayments indicated that they were in \u201ccurrent pay\u201d  status and had a withholding amount. We considered people to be  making voluntary remittances if they had no withholding on any  overpayment and had a monthly voluntary remittance amount listed on at  least one account. We considered beneficiaries to be conditionally written  off if all of their overpayments were flagged as conditionally written off.  We categorized the remaining beneficiaries as active, but not currently  repaying.

This assumes  that all of the year\u2019s inflation takes place on January 1, and will tend to  overstate inflation early in the year. This stylized assumption means that  our COLA plus interest scenario can precisely undo the effects of inflation  when, in fact, appropriately set annual COLA and interest charges would  typically overcorrect for inflation during some months and under-correct  for it during others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Civil Monetary Penalties and Administrative Sanctions", "paragraphs": ["To determine how SSA imposes penalties and sanctions, we reviewed  applicable federal laws, regulations, and guidance. We also reviewed  SSA plans for improving its administration of penalties and sanctions,  internal studies of its use of sanctions, as well as past OIG reviews of  penalties and sanctions. We interviewed officials in SSA headquarters  who oversee their use, OIG (which investigates potential fraud), and  OIG\u2019s Office of Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG) which has  responsibility for imposing penalties and considering whether sanctions  may be warranted. We requested available data from SSA on its use and  the disposition of penalties and sanctions. However, after discussions  with SSA officials regarding the agency\u2019s procedures for collecting and  tracking penalties and sanctions, we determined that these data were not  sufficiently reliable for our use and did not include them in our report.", "To gain further insight on how sanctions are tracked and imposed, we  interviewed regional sanctions coordinators\u2014individuals responsible for  reviewing sanctions determinations\u2014in three of SSA\u2019s regions: Atlanta,  Chicago, and San Francisco. We chose these regions based on variation  in terms of sanctions workload and error rates according to past SSA  internal evaluations.

Figure 7 shows, for each decile, the median percentage of  benefits being withheld. Figure 8 shows the median dollars withheld for  each decile. When we compared individuals with lower monthly benefit  amounts to those receiving larger benefits amounts, we found that those  with the smallest benefits had a higher percentage of their benefits  withheld to repay overpayments. The figures also show that the majority  of individuals with a larger monthly benefit amount have less than 10  percent of their DI benefits withheld. Figure 8 shows that the difference  between withholding 10 percent of the median DI benefit and actual  median withholding is more than $86 per month in the top decile, which  consists of more than 31,000 beneficiaries.", "Tables 2 to 5 below provide additional information on the relationship  between withholding and benefit amounts. For each table, we report not  only the median (the 50th percentile) of the distribution, which offers a  sense of the \u201ctypical\u201d outcome, but also:  the 25th and 75th percentiles which give a sense of the experience of  beneficiaries somewhat below and above the median, respectively;  the 5th and 95th percentiles to offer a sense of the experiences of  people experiencing fairly extreme outcomes;  the number of beneficiaries from which we computed each number;  and  the standard deviation.", "The withholding and repayment time averages are often significantly  above the median because these distributions are not symmetric; rather  people with the largest withholding levels are much further above the  median than the people with the smallest withholding levels are below the  median. For example, table 3 reports that the 95th percentile withholding  level for all beneficiaries ($517) is $460 higher than the median of $57,  while the 5th percentile ($10) is $47 below the median. This asymmetric  distribution of withholding levels at higher amounts produces an average  of $133, which is more than twice the median and more than the 75th  percentile of the withholding distribution ($101)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michele Grgich (Assistant  Director), Daniel R.
