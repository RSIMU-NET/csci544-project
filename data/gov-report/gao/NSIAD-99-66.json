This  review, known as the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), was intended to  examine America\u2019s defense needs and provide a blueprint for a strategy- based, balanced, and affordable defense program.  The QDR noted that  DOD had reduced active duty personnel by 32 percent between 1989 and  1997 while reducing personnel performing infrastructure functions by only  28 percent.  The report called for additional reductions in both military and  civilian personnel.  Our July 1998 report on the 1999-2003 FYDP noted that  the services planned to reduce military and civilian personnel by 175,000  and save $3.7 billion by 2003.  Our recent reviews of planned Defense  personnel reductions resulting from the QDR and the 1999-2003 FYDP  raised questions about DOD\u2019s ability to achieve some of these reductions  and savings.", "The changes in military strategy and capabilities enunciated in the QDR  and other reports have often been referred to as a revolution in military  affairs.  However, the QDR also recognized that DOD must undergo a  similar revolution in its business affairs.  To that end, the Secretary of  Defense chartered a study effort that resulted in the November 1997 DRI  report.  The report emphasized the need to reduce excess Cold War  infrastructure to free up resources for modernization.  The report identified  numerous initiatives to reengineer business practices, consolidate  organizations, eliminate unneeded infrastructure through additional base  closures, and conduct public/private competitive sourcing studies for  commercial activities.  Most of the potential savings identified in the report  were expected to result from BRACs and competitive sourcing studies.   Future BRAC actions were contingent on the Congress enacting legislation  authorizing additional closures, while competitive sourcing studies were to  be completed under the policy guidance of OMB.", "The concept of competitive sourcing is not new.  Through the 1980s, DOD  encouraged the services and Defense agencies to conduct competitions  between the public and private sectors to determine who would be  responsible for performing selected functions that were being provided by  in-house staff.  These competitions were to be done under OMB Circular A-76.  Although DOD\u2019s use of Circular A-76 was limited from the early to  mid-1990s, in 1995 DOD reestablished the competition program in the hope  of obtaining significant savings that could be used to fund modernization  and other priority needs.", "Circular A-76 and its supplemental handbook specify a process to develop a  statement that defines the work to be done and a comparison of in-house  costs with contractor costs to determine who should perform the work.   Circular A-76 is limited to competitions for the conversion of recurring  commercial activities.  The handbook identifies circumstances under  which detailed cost studies may not be required, such as for the conversion  from performance by military personnel to contractor performance or if  the number of affected civilian positions is below a specific threshold.  It  also indicates instances in which Circular A-76 may not apply, such as for  restructured or reengineered functions.  Appendix I contains a more  detailed description of the A-76 process.", "In addition, several laws affect competitive sourcing.  Some, such as 10 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462, affect the process of transferring work currently  being performed by civilian government employees to the private sector.   Section 2461, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261), requires an analysis of the activity and a  comparison of the costs of having the activity performed by DOD civilian  employees and by a contractor to determine whether changing to  contractor performance will save money.  It also requires that DOD notify  the Congress of this analysis and provide other information before making   a change in performance.  Section 2462 requires the Secretary of Defense  to obtain needed supplies or services from the private sector, if a private-sector source can provide the supply or service at less cost, and  establishes criteria for conducting the cost comparison."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FYDP Shows Partial Costs and Savings Estimates From BRAC and Competitive Sourcing", "paragraphs": ["DOD expects savings from individual DRIs but has not incorporated  specific savings from these initiatives in the FYDP, except in the areas of  potential BRAC and competitive sourcing.

While  personnel reductions are programmed in the 1999-2003 FYDP and are  expected to represent a portion of savings from DRIs, DOD has not  required the services to link specific personnel reductions to individual  initiatives.

DOD showed these net costs in the FYDP as a Department-level  contingency account but did not allocate them to individual services.   Beyond the FYDP period, DOD expects the two additional rounds of base  closures to result in about $3.4 billion in annual savings after the closures  are completed and implementation costs have been offset.", "We reported in November that DOD\u2019s method of estimating costs and  savings for future BRAC rounds was limited, principally because it  assumed that savings from future base closures would closely resemble  savings from the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, adjusted for inflation.  While  DOD\u2019s estimate may be appropriate for planning purposes, its precision is  limited because the costs of future BRAC rounds might not parallel those of  the prior two rounds.  Previous base closures frequently involved facilities  that were of low military value and were the least costly to implement.   Often those closures required the shortest time for savings to offset  implementation costs.  Generally, DOD did not choose to close facilities  that required higher implementation costs or longer periods to recover  savings.  More precise cost estimates will probably not be available until  DOD actually studies implementation scenarios for specific BRAC actions  and puts in place more reliable cost accounting systems.  However, BRAC  history suggests that future implementation costs could be greater than  those in previous rounds and the closures could thus take longer to  produce net recurring savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Projected Competitive Sourcing Savings Are Significant but Do Not Fully Account for Investment Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s 1999-2003 FYDP projected $6.2 billion in savings from competitive  sourcing between fiscal year 1997 and 2003.

We further noted that DOD  had not fully identified the resources associated with the studies or the  personnel separation costs likely to be needed for implementation.

The Army  programmed the 20-percent reduction based on the assumption that the 20-percent savings would result whether the government or a contractor  won the A-76 competitions.  Army officials said they made this assumption  because they did not want to be seen as preselecting the winner.  The Army  recognizes, however, that it will likely separate more personnel based on  the historical trends of contractors winning about 50 percent of the  competitions.  The Army did not program any reductions in military  positions as a result of competitive sourcing and planned to make up for  military personnel shortages elsewhere by transferring the military  personnel from positions competed to other military duties.", "The Navy and the Marine Corps did not program any potential military or  civilian personnel cuts as a result of competitive sourcing.  According to  Navy officials, the Navy\u2019s overall objective is to achieve savings through  competition, and personnel savings are a consequence and not a goal of the  program.  Further, Navy officials said they believed that establishing a goal  for personnel reductions would send a negative message to staff and would  affect morale.", "The Air Force was more aggressive in identifying personnel reductions  from competitive sourcing and programmed about 26,000 military and  19,300 civilian position reductions between fiscal year 1997 and 2003,  according to its final budget submission.  The Air Force\u2019s programmed  reduction of all military positions to be competed was based on the belief  that if a position could be competed, it did not have to be staffed by military  personnel.  Generally, the Air Force programmed reductions in civilian  positions on the assumption that private contractors would win 60 percent  of the competitions and that the competitions would last 2 years.", "Officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) were aware that  the services used different methods to show the effects of competitive  sourcing on personnel and funding and that the fiscal year 1999 FYDP  reflects these different approaches.

Subsequently, the Acting  Director of the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Program Analysis and  Evaluation Office issued guidance incorporating the task force\u2019s  recommendations, which required Defense components to program both  dollar savings and personnel reductions for the 2000-2005 FYDP.

DOD officials reiterated their previously stated position that  they have developed an aggressive competitive sourcing program by  planning to compete nearly 229,000 positions by fiscal year 2005.  They  acknowledged that their program has met a number of challenges;  however, they believe none of these challenges are insurmountable.  They  stated that through the program and budget review process, the  Department reviews the competitive sourcing study targets, milestones,  and objectives of the program to measure advancement toward its goals  and that adjustments are made to the program as necessary.  Further, they  stated that several important improvement and oversight tools are being  worked into the competitive sourcing program during calendar year 1999  that will address our concerns.  More specifically, according to these  officials, the DOD Competitive Sourcing Master Plan will, among other  things, identify by fiscal year the functions and number of component  positions to be competed by fiscal year 2005.  Also, they stated each  component is undertaking a series of program improvement initiatives that  includes (1) identifying best practices, (2) assisting installation/activity  execution, (3) developing internal communications and training, and (4) improving management information systems.  DOD officials also stated  that the components have not completed enough studies, thus far, to  establish a baseline that would necessitate the reevaluation of their  milestones and objectives and that as more studies are conducted, they will  be able to better refine and adjust their study savings objectives.", "While we support DOD\u2019s efforts to institute more comprehensive oversight  tools and program improvement initiatives, we did not review any of these  efforts because they have not yet been fully implemented, and we are  therefore not in a position to comment on them.  However, as we  previously reported, we continue to believe that DOD needs to reassess the  competitive sourcing study targets, milestones, expected short-term  savings, and planned operating budget reductions now.  The issues involve  more than the number of competitions completed; they also involve the  extent the planned announcements of competitions have been made and  whether there are sufficient resources to complete them.  This is of  concern especially because of the large number of studies planned for  announcement in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and the delays encountered in  getting the fiscal year 1998 studies under way.  If similar delays are  encountered in fiscal year 1999, they could seriously affect future program  execution and DOD\u2019s ability to achieve results in a timely manner.", "In addition, officials reiterated the Department\u2019s disagreement with our  statement that the precision of its future base closure costs was limited and  that average net costs of future BRAC rounds will be higher than DOD  estimated by using the cost experience of previous rounds.  As we  previously reported, our intent was to suggest that there are reasons to  expect greater costs to close bases during any future implementation  period than during the previous BRAC rounds because many bases with  lower implementation costs and quicker offsets of closure costs have  already been realigned or closed.  Thus, the higher costs likely to be  incurred in the future could reduce the net savings achieved during the  implementation period.

This statement, which is incorporated into either the Invitation  for Bids or Request for Proposals, serves as the basis for both government  estimates and private sector offers.  If the Invitation for Bids process is  used, each private sector company develops and submits a bid, giving its  firm price for performing the commercial activity.  While this process is  taking place, the government activity performs a management study to  determine the most efficient and effective way of performing the activity  with in-house staff.  Based on this \"most efficient organization,\" the  government develops a cost estimate and submits it to the selecting  authority.  The selecting authority concurrently opens the government's  estimate along with the bids of all private sector firms.", "According to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) A-76 guidance,  the government's in-house estimate wins the competition unless the private  sector's offer meets a threshold of savings that is at least 10 percent of  direct personnel costs or $10 million over the performance period.  This  minimum cost differential was established by OMB to ensure that the  government would not contract out for marginal estimated savings.", "If the Request for Proposals--best value process--is used, the Federal  Procurement Regulation and the A-76 supplemental handbook require  several additional steps.  The private sector offerors submit proposals that  often include a technical performance proposal and a price.  The  government prepares an in-house management plan and cost estimate  based strictly on the performance work statement.  On the other hand,  private sector proposals can offer a higher level of performance or service.", "The government's selection authority reviews the private sector proposals  to determine which one represents the best overall value to the government  based on such considerations as (1) higher performance levels, (2) lower  proposal risk, (3) better past performance, and (4) cost to do the work.   After the completion of this analysis, the selection authority prepares a  written justification supporting its decision.  This includes the basis for  selecting a contractor other than the one that offered the lowest price to  the government.  Next, the authority evaluates the government's offer and  determines whether it can achieve the same level of performance and  quality as the selected private sector proposal.  If not, the government must  then make changes to meet the performance standards accepted by the  authority.
