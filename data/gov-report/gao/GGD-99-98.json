Abatements reduce assessments and can occur for a variety of reasons, such as to correct errors made by IRS and taxpayers and to provide relief from penalties when taxpayers have reasonable cause for failing to comply with tax requirements. The process for making abatements is important for ensuring the equitable treatment of taxpayers across IRS\u2019 10 service centers and 33 district offices.", "In a letter dated February 2, 1999, you asked us to describe IRS\u2019 abatement process in order to help the Committee fulfill a requirement in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 to report on the administration of penalty and interest assessments by July 22, 1999. On the basis of discussions with your office, our objectives were to describe (1) IRS\u2019 process for making abatements from initiation through final review in selected IRS locations and (2) IRS\u2019 efforts to improve the abatement process. As agreed with your office, the selected locations were the Kansas City Service Center, Fresno Service Center, Kansas City District Office, and Northern California District Office."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to IRS records from its master files on individual and business returns, IRS annually abated, on average, about 10 million tax, penalty, and interest assessments, totaling nearly $30 billion, in fiscal years 1995 through 1998. In fiscal year 1998, IRS abated 11.3 million assessments\u20143.1 million tax, 4.7 million penalty, and 3.5 million interest assessments. These abatements totaled about $22.2 billion in tax, $4.8 billion in penalty, and $2.1 billion in interest assessments.", "An assessment is a formal bookkeeping entry that IRS makes to record the amount of tax, penalty, or interest charged to a taxpayer\u2019s account. An assessment establishes not only the taxpayer\u2019s liability for amounts due and unpaid, but also IRS\u2019 right to collect. Taxpayers essentially assess their taxes owed when they file their tax returns. IRS may assess additional taxes owed, as well as penalty and interest amounts, through an enforcement program. Taxpayers also may file an amended return or otherwise notify IRS of an error, which may lead to additional assessments.", "Section 6404 of the Internal Revenue Code (as well as various other sections) authorizes IRS to abate an assessment under certain conditions. For example, IRS abates an erroneous assessment, which can be caused by either IRS or the taxpayer. A taxpayer may make an error on the original tax return, such as not claiming deductions. Or, IRS may assess incorrect tax amounts as a result of errors made when matching income reported by taxpayers with income reported by third parties (such as employers) on payments made to the taxpayers.", "IRS abates a tax assessment of the correct amount for various reasons. For example, as a result of an audit, IRS may correctly assess an additional tax amount for one tax year, but a taxpayer can carry back net operating losses incurred in other tax years to reduce the additional tax liability in that prior tax year. Also, IRS abates an unpaid assessment that involved the correct amount of tax owed but that was made after the time period allowed for assessing additional tax liabilities. Further, IRS abates multiple assessments of the correct amount after that amount is paid. In these cases, IRS assesses multiple taxpayers (such as partners or officers in a business) for the amount owed by the business, knowing that the extra assessments are to be abated after full payment is received.", "Whenever IRS abates a tax assessment, any related penalty or interest assessments are also abated. Further, IRS abates certain penalties when a taxpayer provides a reasonable cause for failing to meet a responsibility, such as not paying a tax assessment or not filing a return on time. Reasonable causes can include illness or other nonfinancial hardships and reliance on incorrect written advice from IRS on technical issues. IRS also abates certain interest assessments that accrue, for example, because of an unreasonable error or delay by IRS in assigning staff to the case, sending notices to taxpayers, transferring a case to another IRS office, or performing other procedural or managerial actions and delays in filing income tax returns and paying taxes because of a natural disaster for those living in a presidentially-declared disaster area.", "IRS\u2019 interactions with taxpayers on abatements and other types of adjustments to taxpayers\u2019 accounts usually occur through IRS\u2019 10 service centers or 33 district offices. Major activities at the service centers include processing tax returns and related tax schedules from taxpayers and information returns from third parties that report payments, such as wages and interest. In addition, service centers provide services to taxpayers, such as responding to taxpayer inquiries, as well as perform enforcement functions, such as audits and collection, usually through correspondence or the telephone. District offices also offer services to taxpayers as well as perform enforcement functions. IRS staff at the district offices are more likely to interact with taxpayers through face-to-face meetings because the issues tend to be more complex or otherwise require more explanation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To describe IRS\u2019 process for making abatements from initiation through final review in selected IRS locations, we talked to IRS National Office work groups that could make abatements and the IRS office that administers penalties. We reviewed the Internal Revenue Manual sections and other IRS documents that govern the abatement process. Our visits to two service centers and two district offices, as discussed below, also helped us describe the process.", "Specifically, we visited an IRS service center and district office in the Kansas-Missouri area and a service center and district office in California. We chose these four locations in consultation with your office. We were able to do more work in some of the four locations, depending on which ones we visited first, the availability of data, and the responsiveness of IRS staff within the time frame of our review.", "Given time constraints, we did not visit more service centers or district offices. As a result, we do not know how similar or different the process was at the other 8 service centers and 31 district offices. Nor did we attempt to determine whether (1) any differences in the abatement process at the two service centers and two district offices produced significant effects, particularly for similarly situated taxpayers; (2) IRS staff followed the process and related criteria in making abatement decisions; (3) the process was appropriate and adequately controlled; or (4) IRS should be collecting more quantitative data on its abatement process.", "During each visit, we interviewed officials from IRS work groups that made abatements. We identified these groups from information provided by IRS\u2019 National Office and the four locations we visited. To confirm our understanding of the abatement process, we wrote summaries for each location and received comments on these summaries from officials at each location as well as IRS\u2019 National Office. The summaries incorporating IRS\u2019 comments can be found in appendixes I-IV.", "To describe IRS\u2019 efforts to improve the abatement process, we interviewed officials in IRS\u2019 National Office as well as selected staff in field offices who had worked on a task force or study that addressed abatements in some way. We also collected any available studies. As with our work on the abatement process, we asked the responsible IRS officials to comment on our summary of these efforts.", "We performed our audit at IRS headquarters offices in Washington, D.C.; the Kansas City Service Center in Kansas City, MO; the Fresno Service Center in Fresno, CA; the Kansas-Missouri District Office in St. Louis, MO; and the Northern California District Office in Oakland, CA. Our work was done between February and June 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "On June 22, 1999, we met with representatives of the IRS Commissioner from the Customer Service and Examination Divisions as well as the Taxpayer Advocate and Legislative Affairs Offices to obtain their comments on a draft of this report, which are discussed near the end of this letter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019 Abatement Process Varied", "paragraphs": ["At the two service centers and two district offices we visited, IRS\u2019 abatement process depended on the type, complexity, and source of the assessment being abated. The process varied in terms of (1) how abatements are initiated, (2) which IRS work groups make abatement decisions, (3) what level of staff makes the decisions, (4) what tools guide the decisions, and (5) how IRS reviews quality. We did not attempt to evaluate whether any variations in the process affected abatement decisions. Nor do we know how similar or different the process is at the other 8 service centers and 31 district offices.", "IRS did not have quantitative data on the details of the abatement process, even though IRS\u2019 master files have data on the overall number and amount of abatements. An abatement is just one type of adjustment made to taxpayer accounts. IRS staff also adjust accounts to reflect the dates and amounts of various types of assessments, payments, and refunds. IRS cannot extract quantitative data about the abatement process from data on all types of adjustments. For example, IRS did not have data on the number of abatements made by type of IRS group and staff or reviewed by IRS supervisors. Determining the costs and benefits of collecting such data on the abatement process was beyond the scope of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Taxpayers and IRS Staff May Initiate Abatements", "paragraphs": ["The two service centers and two district offices we visited did not track how the abatements were initiated. IRS officials, however, identified three basic ways of initiating abatements.", "First, taxpayers can initiate a request (also known as claim) for an abatement by filing an amended tax return (e.g., Form 1040-X for individuals and Form 1120-X for corporations); by filing an IRS Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement; by writing a letter; or by making a phone call. Taxpayers would generally initiate these requests to correct errors on the original return they filed or to seek relief from penalties when they have reasonable cause for failing to comply with tax requirements.", "Second, taxpayers can request an abatement of an additional assessment generated by an IRS enforcement program. In these cases, the taxpayer would be responding to a notice about the assessment, such as a collection notice. These taxes might have been assessed because the taxpayer had not responded adequately to notices about the recommended assessment of additional tax amounts. For example, an audit may recommend additional assessments that the taxpayer did not challenge when the audit closed. The taxpayer might later decide to challenge the assessment and ask IRS for an abatement. Similarly, after receiving a notice of additional assessments, taxpayers may claim a reasonable cause for not timely paying the correct tax amount and ask IRS to abate certain types of penalties.", "Third, in some cases, IRS staff can initiate the abatement. For example, an IRS auditor might find evidence that a taxpayer overstated the tax liability on the original tax return. This evidence could lead to an abatement, depending on the results from the rest of the audit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various IRS Work Groups Make Abatement Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Various IRS work groups at the two service centers and two district offices we visited had the authority to abate assessments. According to IRS officials, the type, complexity, and source of the assessment being abated determine which IRS work group makes the abatement decision. Using these factors as well as IRS routing criteria, a work group that initially receives a requested abatement is to determine whether it should make the abatement decision. If the determination is to route the abatement to another work group, the abatement process to be followed is to be guided by the general IRS criteria for the type of abatement being reviewed and the specific review process of that group.", "Each work group can abate different types of tax, penalty, and interest issues. Table 1 shows examples of the most common types or sources of abatements made by work groups at the two service centers, as identified by IRS officials.", "As table 1 shows, each service center organized itself somewhat differently. As a result, each service center had branches that the other center did not have. For example, Fresno had a Joint Compliance Branch that did not exist in Kansas City. This branch dealt with, among other things, abatement requests (known as category A claims) that were complex, sensitive, or involved types of taxpayers prone to noncompliance. Kansas City usually handled category A requests in its Examination Branch. Also, Kansas City allowed clerical staff in its Document Perfection Branch to abate simple requests made on amended returns. Fresno usually handled this type of request in its Adjustments Branch.", "The two district offices generally relied on three divisions to abate assessments. Table 2 shows examples of the types or sources of abatements made by the divisions, as identified by officials at the district offices.", "As table 2 shows, each of the three divisions at both districts made similar types of abatements. Although none of the divisions tracked the number of abatements, IRS officials indicated that the Collection and Customer Service Divisions made the most abatement decisions, many of which involved penalties. The officials said that in the Examination Division, the abatements usually involved tax assessments related to a prior audit, which could also involve penalties, or some form of taxpayer claim.", "In addition, at the two service centers and two district offices, the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate had authority to make certain types of abatements. However, officials at most locations we visited said that the Advocate\u2019s Office usually referred requests for abatements to other work groups (such as the Collection Division) and then tracked actions taken to help ensure the proper and timely resolution of a taxpayer\u2019s problem. Because these work groups usually made any related abatements, the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate would make few abatements compared to the other work groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both Lower and Higher Graded Staff Can Make Abatement Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Various types and grades of IRS staff, ranging from clerks to mid-level staff, can make abatement decisions, depending on the type, complexity, and source of the assessment being abated. Along with other duties, these IRS staff handled many types of adjustments to taxpayers\u2019 accounts other than abatements. None of the work groups tracked how many of these adjustments involved abatements.", "Both service centers had a wide range of graded staff who made abatement decisions. The staff ranged from federal pay grades GS-3 to GS- 9 in one service center and GS-4 to GS-12 in the other. According to officials at the two service centers, staff known as customer service representatives and tax examiner assistants made most abatement decisions. In one service center, grades of customer service representatives ranged from GS-5 to GS-8 and tax examiner assistants ranged from GS-4 to GS-8. In the other service center, the grades were GS- 6 to GS-9 and GS-6 to GS-7, respectively.", "The two district offices also had various staff make abatement decisions in the three divisions. These staff ranged from federal pay grades GS-5 to GS- 13. According to officials at the two district offices, staff known as customer service representatives (GS-5 to GS-9) and revenue officers (GS- 7 to GS-12) made the majority of the abatements.

Descriptions of these four tools follow.", "IRS is to provide training on the various duties, including abatements, assigned to staff. The training can include such things as basic tax laws, IRS forms, adjustments in general, amended returns, and other generic tax issues. Training also can cover specific types of adjustments, including abatements to be made to taxpayer accounts. The training is to include classroom and on-the-job instruction.", "Staff can use various types of information provided by taxpayers or through IRS computers to help make abatement decisions. For example, taxpayers can provide additional information that they did not provide during an audit when they ask IRS to abate assessments made in that audit. Or, staff can use information in taxpayers\u2019 accounts to confirm taxpayer actions, such as the date a return was filed or a payment was made. To the extent that the computerized information is sufficient, IRS staff could use it to verify oral justifications from taxpayers for making the abatement. If the information is not sufficient, IRS may need to request additional support from the taxpayer.", "Criteria for making abatement decisions vary with the type and amount of the abatement and complexity of the issues. For example, the criteria for decisions about whether to abate a tax assessment would depend on the tax laws and regulations governing the specific tax issue (such as a dependency exemption) and the justification provided by the taxpayer in requesting the abatement. Also, for each type of penalty, IRS has various dollar tolerances that dictate the type of justification needed from the taxpayer to grant the abatement and whether that justification needs to be documented by the taxpayer rather than be provided orally. Because IRS labels the criteria and dollar tolerances as \u201cofficial use only,\u201d which means the information is sensitive, we cannot disclose the specific criteria or tolerances.", "Dollar tolerances also can affect whether supervisors are to review proposed decisions by staff to abate assessments. IRS did not have data on how many of the 11.3 million abatements in fiscal year 1998 had been reviewed by supervisors before the decision was finalized. However, supervisors are only required to review a few types of abatement decisions before they are finalized, such as those on certain types of penalty and interest abatements as well as on large-dollar abatements. Also, officials at some of the locations we visited said that few abatement decisions would be reviewed by supervisors before being finalized because of the large number of adjustments, including abatements, to be processed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Review Programs Do Not Track the Quality of Abatement Decisions", "paragraphs": ["The two service centers and two district offices each have a separate staff to review the quality of decisions, including those on abatements, after they are made. None of the locations we visited tracked the number of abatement decisions reviewed for quality as either a percentage of all adjustments reviewed or of all abatement decisions made. The officials we interviewed at all locations could not say what percentage of abatements might be subjected to such quality reviews.", "IRS had multiple review programs because each work group has a different set of quality standards. Each program is to use the quality standards established for the types of adjustments made in a specific work group. For example, standards for a collection work group would differ from standards for an examination group. As a result, in both service centers, the Service Center Collection Quality System is to be used to review the quality of the work in the Collection Branch. Across the two district offices, IRS also had a review program for each division (such as the Examination Division).", "Officials at both service centers and both district offices also told us that these programs usually are to select cases for review on the basis of random sampling, and the results are to be used to identify systemic quality problems in an IRS work group. Due to our time constraints, we did not evaluate these IRS quality review programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019 Efforts to Improve the Abatement Process", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 efforts to improve the abatement process have involved task force studies that IRS initiated in response to specific concerns. For example, since 1997, task forces have studied issues, such as penalty administration and taxpayer treatment, because of concerns about taxpayer burden and equity. Although they did not focus on abatements, the studies have produced some proposals that would affect the abatement process, such as the documentation required to support abatements.", "IRS officials said they initiated these task forces because a 1997 report on reinventing service at IRS called for IRS to, among other things, promote fair and consistent treatment of taxpayers in penalty administration. The report also called for IRS to comprehensively review all penalties and report to Congress on its findings as well as needed legislative changes. The report further recommended that the overall process for handling penalties be streamlined. For example, the report mentioned that one way to streamline would be for IRS employees to have expanded authority to abate certain types of penalties on the basis of oral requests from taxpayers. If done, this action could reduce the burden on taxpayers by requiring less documentation or supervisory approval.", "In September 1998, IRS released a study by its penalty task force, as recommended in the 1997 report. IRS reported that for fiscal year 1996, 34 million penalties totaling $13.2 billion were assessed, of which 12 percent and 43 percent, respectively, were abated. Several recommendations focused on the need for (1) consistent treatment of taxpayers; (2) viable management of information systems; (3) clearer penalty policy; and (4) improved penalty administration to allow, among other things, IRS telephone assistors to make abatements for larger amounts on the basis of oral testimony from taxpayers. IRS officials said that legislative changes would be necessary to implement some of the recommendations. These officials also said they are considering the first three recommendations and are planning to expand authority for abating certain penalties for reasonable cause on the basis of oral testimony from taxpayers.", "Another task force on taxpayer equity has been studying various IRS programs and issues and had finished several reports as of June 1999. These programs and issues, for example, address taxpayers that do not file required tax returns, make estimated tax payments on a quarterly basis, or make required federal tax deposits. Also included are studies of taxpayers that ask IRS to reconsider an assessment made in a previous audit.", "At least three of this task force\u2019s reports have made proposals that could affect abatements. These proposals involve (1) easing interest abatement criteria through legislative change, (2) encouraging oral agreements on abatements between IRS and taxpayers over the phone to minimize documentation, and (3) clarifying a penalty abatement policy statement.", "As for other efforts, an IRS study of an automated program to create substitute returns for apparent nonfilers has suggested several steps to deal with unproductive or erroneous assessments that create additional work later, including abating these assessments. Further, IRS is testing an automated system to help make abatement decisions related to reasonable cause. IRS is also developing ways to help small business taxpayers meet their federal tax deposit requirements, which could reduce the need for abatements that are associated with these deposits. Finally, IRS\u2019 Collection Division officials said they had a team working on redesigning the collection process, but the team was not focusing on abatements.", "Before initiating these task forces and efforts, IRS undertook a major study during 1993-94 of the causes of abatements. According to the director of the study, IRS used about 150 employees across its 10 service centers. IRS did this study because of concerns about the inventory of tax debts\u2014about 25 percent of IRS\u2019 accounts receivable were being abated.", "The study identified problems in various IRS processes that resulted in IRS and taxpayer errors that had to be corrected through abatements. Some examples of IRS errors included miscalculated interest, incorrect posting to accounts, and overlooked support for taxpayers\u2019 reasonable cause claims. Examples of taxpayer errors included using the wrong form or coupon, omitting or misstating taxpayer identification numbers, and making math mistakes.", "The study identified 259 potential problems, of which 158 were referred to the responsible IRS functions for further analysis and implementation of changes, if necessary, to solve a problem.
