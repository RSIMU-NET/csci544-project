To improve the validity of these test results, most states offer accommodations, such as a bilingual dictionary. However, our experts reported that research is lacking on what accommodations are effective in mitigating language barriers. Several states used native language or alternate assessments for students with limited English proficiency, but these tests are costly to develop and are not appropriate for all students. Many states implemented new English language proficiency assessments in 2006 to meet NCLBA requirements, and, as a result, complete information on their validity and reliability is not yet available. In 2006, 22 states used tests developed by one of four state consortia. Officials in our study states reported taking steps to ensure the validity of these tests.

An  estimated 5 million children with limited English proficiency were enrolled  in U.S. public schools during the 2003-2004 school year, representing about  10 percent of the total school population. They speak over 400 languages,  with almost 80 percent of students with limited English proficiency  speaking Spanish. These students often have language difficulties that  interfere with their ability to succeed in school and, prior to NCLBA, were  often excluded from statewide assessments. NCLBA\u2019s requirements have  brought to the surface a number of challenges to assessing the academic  performance of these students in a valid and reliable manner (that is, the  assessment measures what it is designed to measure in a consistent  manner).", "Congress passed NCLBA with the goal of increasing academic  achievement and closing achievement gaps. NCLBA required states to  demonstrate that all students have reached the \u201cproficient\u201d level on a  state\u2019s language arts and mathematics assessments by 2014, and states  must demonstrate \u201cadequate yearly progress\u201d toward this goal each year.  In addition, students from groups that traditionally underperform,  including students with limited English proficiency, must meet the same  academic progress goals as other students. For the first time, NCLBA also  required states to annually assess the English proficiency of these students  and to demonstrate that they are making progress toward becoming  proficient in English.", "My testimony today will focus on (1) the extent to which students with  limited English proficiency are meeting adequate yearly progress goals,   (2) what states have done to ensure that results from language arts and  mathematics assessments are valid and reliable for students with limited  English proficiency, (3) how states are assessing English proficiency and  what they are doing to address the validity and reliability of these  assessment results, and (4) how the Department of Education (Education)  is supporting states\u2019 efforts to meet NCLBA\u2019s assessment requirements for  these students. The information being presented today is from our July  2006 report.", "In summary, students with limited English proficiency did not meet state  proficiency goals on language arts and mathematics tests in nearly two- thirds of 48 states for which we obtained data in the 2003-2004 school year.  Officials in 5 states we studied reported taking steps to follow generally  accepted test development procedures to ensure the validity and reliability  of their academic tests for students with limited English proficiency.  However, a group of experts we consulted expressed concerns about  whether all states were assessing these students in a valid manner. These  experts noted that some states lack the technical expertise needed to  ensure the validity of tests for these students. As evidence of the  challenges states face, Education\u2019s completed peer reviews of 38 states  found that 25 did not provide adequate evidence on the validity or  reliability of test results for these students. We also found that, as allowed  under law, most states offer accommodations, such as a bilingual  dictionary, to these students in order to improve the validity of language  arts and mathematics test results. However, our experts reported that  research is lacking on what accommodations are effective for these  students. With respect to English language proficiency assessments, many  states were implementing new tests in 2006 to meet NCLBA requirements,  and as a result, complete information on their validity and reliability was  not available at the time of our review.

Specifically, Education has  initiated a partnership with the states and other organizations to support  the development of valid assessment options for students with limited  English proficiency.", "To determine the extent to which students with limited English  proficiency were meeting adequate yearly progress goals, we collected  school year 2003-2004 state-level data for 48 states, including the District  of Columbia. With regard to assessments, we studied the testing practices  of 5 states in depth (California, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, and  Texas). We also directly contacted officials in 28 states to discuss their  English language proficiency assessments and Education\u2019s guidance  regarding these assessments. Further, we convened a group of experts to  discuss states\u2019 efforts to implement valid and reliable academic  assessments for students with limited English proficiency. These experts  had significant technical and research expertise in assessment issues, and  some had conducted research focused on students with limited English  proficiency. We also interviewed Education officials and reviewed relevant  Education documents. Finally, we interviewed officials from major test  development companies and state consortia that are developing English  language proficiency assessments and used a short e-mail survey to obtain  information from the 50 states and the District of Columbia on their use of  native language assessments.

If a  student responds incorrectly to a test item, it may not be clear if the  student did not know the answer or misunderstood the question because  of language barriers.", "Title I of NCLBA requires states to administer tests in language arts and  mathematics to all students in certain grades and to use these tests as the  primary means of determining the annual performance of states, districts,  and schools. These assessments must be aligned with the state\u2019s academic  standards\u2014that is, they must measure how well a student has  demonstrated his or her knowledge of the academic content represented  in these standards. States are to show that increasing percentages of  students are reaching the proficient level on these state tests over time.  NCLBA also requires that students with limited English proficiency receive  reasonable accommodations and be assessed, to the extent practicable, in  the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on their academic  knowledge. In addition, for language arts, students with limited English  proficiency who have been in U.S. schools for 3 years or more must  generally be assessed in English. Finally, NCLBA also created a new  requirement for states to annually assess the English language proficiency  of students identified as having limited English proficiency.", "Accurately assessing the academic knowledge of students with limited  English proficiency has become more critical because NCLBA designated  specific groups of students for particular focus. These four groups are  students who (1) are economically disadvantaged, (2) represent major  racial and ethnic groups, (3) have disabilities, and (4) are limited in  English proficiency. These groups are not mutually exclusive, so that the  results for a student who is economically disadvantaged, Hispanic, and has  limited English proficiency could be counted in three groups. States and  school districts are required to measure the progress of all students in  meeting academic proficiency goals, as well as to measure separately the  progress of these designated groups. To make adequate yearly progress,  each district and school must generally show that each of these groups  met the state proficiency goal and that at least 95 percent of students in  each group participated in these assessments. Students with limited  English proficiency are a unique group under NCLBA because once they  attain English proficiency they are no longer counted as part this group,  although Education has given states some flexibility in this area.", "Recognizing that language barriers can hinder the assessment of students  who have been in the country for a short time, Education has provided  some testing flexibility. Specifically, Education does not require students  with limited English proficiency to participate in a state\u2019s language arts  assessment during their first year in U.S. schools. In addition, while these  students must take a state\u2019s mathematics assessment during their first  year, a state may exclude their scores in determining whether it met its  progress goals.", "Title III of NCLBA focuses specifically on students with limited English  proficiency, with the purpose of ensuring that these students attain  English proficiency and meet the same academic standards as other  students. This title holds states and districts accountable for student  progress in attaining English proficiency by requiring states to establish  goals to demonstrate annual increases in both the number of students  attaining English proficiency and the number making progress in learning  English. States must establish English language proficiency standards that  are aligned with a state\u2019s academic standards in order to ensure that  students are acquiring the academic language they need to successfully  participate in the classroom. Education also requires that a state\u2019s English  language proficiency assessment be aligned to its English language  proficiency standards.

This is done by ensuring that instructions, forms, and questions are clear  and not more linguistically complex than necessary. In addition, officials  in some states reported assembling committees to review test items for  bias. For example, when developing mathematics items, these states try to  make language as clear as possible to ensure that the item is measuring  primarily mathematical concepts and to minimize the extent to which it is  measuring language proficiency.

These experts noted that no state has implemented an  assessment program for students with limited English proficiency that is  consistent with technical standards. They noted that students with limited  English proficiency are not defined consistently within and across states,  which is a crucial first step to ensuring reliability. If the language  proficiency levels of these students are classified inconsistently, an  assessment may produce results that appear inconsistent because of the  variable classifications rather than actual differences in skills. Further, it  appears that many states do not conduct separate analyses for different  groups of limited English proficient students. Our group of experts  indicated that the reliability of a test may be different for heterogeneous  groups of students, such as students who are literate in their native  language and those who are not. Further, these experts noted that states  are not always explicit about whether an assessment is attempting to  measure skills only (such as mathematics) or mathematics skills as  expressed in English. According to the group, a fundamental issue  affecting the validity of a test is the definition of what is being measured.", "The expert group emphasized that determining the validity and reliability  of academic assessments for students with limited English proficiency is  complicated and requires a comprehensive collection of evidence rather  than a single analysis. In addition, the appropriate combination of analyses  will vary from state to state, depending on the characteristics of the  student population and the type of assessment. The group indicated that  states are not universally using all the appropriate analyses to evaluate the  validity and reliability of test results for students with limited English  proficiency. These experts indicated that some states may need assistance  to conduct appropriate analyses.
