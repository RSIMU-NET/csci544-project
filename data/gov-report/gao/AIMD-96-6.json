Agency plans cover employees of executive, legislative, and judicial organizations that are generally recognized as agencies and are generally funded by annual appropriations. Nonappropriated fund activity plans cover employees of organizations, such as post exchanges and commissaries, that provide morale, welfare, and recreation services to military components.

The primary purpose of the trust funds is not to provide a source of cash for the government to pay benefits, but to provide budget authority to allow the Treasury to disburse monthly annuity checks without annual appropriations. Because these securities represent assets of the trust funds and offsetting liabilities of the Treasury, under accounting procedures, the trust fund assets are eliminated in the governmentwide financial statements. Accordingly, these trust fund assets are not included in the governmentwide financial statements, which include the federal government\u2019s $1.2 trillion liability for the benefit obligations of the 15 agency plans.", "The defined benefit plans of the nonappropriated fund activities and federal reserve and farm credit entities, as well as TVA, use trust funds to set aside money or marketable assets during employees\u2019 working years for the accruing cost of their retirement benefits.", "A defined benefit pension plan\u2019s status as fully funded or underfunded is determined by comparing its net assets to the actuarial present value of its benefit obligations.

As discussed more fully in the retirement system financing section below, statutory provisions are in place for the future elimination of the unfunded benefit obligations of CSRS and the Military Retirement System.", "A principal effect of not fully funding most agency pension plans is that agencies\u2019 budgets have not included the full cost of the pensions.

The unfunded obligation of an agency plan is that portion of estimated future benefit obligations that has no paper backing in the form of special issue Treasury securities. Therefore, because special issue Treasury securities are used, whether the obligation is funded or unfunded has no effect on current budget outlays. Also, the obligation is not a measure of the government\u2019s ability to pay retirement benefits in the future.

In addition, we contacted the plan administrators to obtain additional plan data pertaining to Social Security coverage, investment restrictions, and financial statement audits. Under Public Law 95-595, the plan filings are not due until 210 days after the plan\u2019s fiscal year-end. Therefore, the most recent plan filing available for most plans was the plan year ending in 1993. Accordingly, legislative initiatives or other subsequent events not included in the information received through July 21, 1995, are not reflected in this report or accompanying appendixes.", "Also, we consulted with OMB to verify that it had not received filings for additional federal government pension plans. Finally, certain federal benefit programs are excluded from this report because they are not subject to the disclosure requirements of Public Law 95-595. The Central Intelligence Agency pension plan, as well as Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits, are excluded from the requirements of Public Law 95-595. In addition, the monetary allowance provided to former Presidents is not covered.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs does not file reports under Public Law 95-595 for its Veterans Compensation and Pension Programs. Veterans and their dependents receive compensation benefits for service connected disabilities or death and pension benefits for nonservice connected disabilities or death. Neither the entitlement to nor the amount of compensation and pension benefits is based on age and length of service. Rather, compensation and pension benefits are based on the occurrence of specified events. In addition, benefits for nonservice connected disabilities or death are subject to specific income limitations. Thus, the Compensation and Pension Programs differ significantly from the defined benefit plans for which reports are filed under Public Law 95-595.", "Several limitations exist in the summary information presented in the report. The summary of pension plan data is a compilation we prepared from the plan reports and additional plan data provided by the plan administrators. We did not independently verify the information in the plan reports and additional data that the plan administrators provided to us and we do not assure their accuracy on matters of fact or law. Except where indicated in the pension plan profiles in appendixes I and II, the plan financial reports were not audited by independent auditors. In addition, where plans had multiple retirement provisions for certain specialized employees, we listed the retirement benefits provided to the majority of the plan participants.", "The projections in the plan profiles and tables are highly dependent on the actuarial cost method and the actuarial assumptions used. Several acceptable actuarial cost methods exist. The actuarial assumptions vary by plan because they are based on the best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan made by each plan actuary. These assumptions can have a significant impact on estimates of future costs.", "In addition, we found that the information provided by plan administrators often varied in the extent of details presented. For example, some plan filings described all significant economic assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, but others provided fewer details about the assumptions. In some cases, because some plans provided more extensive information than others, it might appear that such information was not applicable to the plans which provided less information. That is not always the case. For example, the provisions of the Military Retirement System are substantially the same as those of the separate Coast Guard Military Retirement System, Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Retirement System, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Corps Retirement System. Because the administrators of each plan described some provisions of the plan differently, the fact that the provisions are actually the same may not always be apparent.", "Similarly, the extent of financial and cost information provided by the plans varied. For example, the Retirement Annuity Plan for Employees of the Army and Air Force Exchange (Exchange Service plan) provides substantially the same benefits as the Civil Service Retirement System, except that Exchange Service plan benefits are reduced by a \u201cSocial Security offset.\u201d The normal cost reported for the CSRS is 25.14 percent of salary, whereas the Exchange Service plan reported normal cost of 9.81 percent of salary. Part of the difference in normal cost may be caused by differing economic assumptions used by the plans\u2019 actuaries, but the primary reason for the difference is that employees in the Exchange Service plan are also covered by Social Security while CSRS employees are not. Thus, the offset provision cuts plan benefits and reduces plan costs accordingly. However, in order to compare the total costs of all benefits provided to participants covered by these two programs, additional details would be needed. For example, an erroneous conclusion might result unless the costs of providing Social Security benefits to Exchange Service employees were added to the reported plan costs; similarly, detailed information about the Social Security benefits to Exchange Service employees would be required in order to compare the benefits under these programs.", "The scope of this report did not include analyzing and comparing the provisions of the various plans.

The actuarial data include two presentations of the benefit obligation and the related funding status for each federal government defined benefit plan. (1) Accumulated Benefit Obligation\u2014Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 35, Accounting and Reporting by Defined Benefit Plans, prescribes the measure by which private sector defined benefit pension plans calculate the net present value of future benefit payments. Under this actuarial measure, the obligation for future benefits is primarily based on employees\u2019 history of pay and service up to the date that the obligation information is reported. The benefit obligation determined in accordance with SFAS 35 is referred to as the Accumulated Benefit Obligation. Comparing the assets available for plan benefits to the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits, less assets available for benefits) yields one measure of plan funding. In appendix I, a zero or negative total (that is, net assets available for benefits equal or exceed the Accumulated Benefit Obligation) indicates that the plan is fully funded, and, as such, the assets of the plan would satisfy the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits if the entity were to cease operations. (2) Actuarial Accrued Liability\u2014Because it is assumed that the federal government will not cease as a going concern, a second actuarial measure of the obligation for future benefits is presented. It is referred to as the Actuarial Accrued Liability. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), issued an exposure draft, Accounting for Liabilities for the Federal Government, which would require the use of the Actuarial Accrued Liability for those federal government pension plans subject to FASAB standards. The Actuarial Accrued Liability represents the present value of benefits expected to be paid in the future to current employees and annuitants, net of the present value of future normal cost contributions expected to be made for and by current employees. It includes the projected future salary increases that reflect an estimate of the compensation levels of the individual employees involved (including future changes attributable to general price level, seniority, promotion, and other factors). Comparing the plan assets to the Actuarial Accrued Liability yields a second measure of plan funding. In appendix I, a zero or negative total (that is, plan assets equal or exceed the Actuarial Accrued Liability) indicates that the plan is fully funded, and, as such, assets in the fund plus the present value of future normal cost contributions would satisfy the actuarial present value of projected benefits to current employees and annuitants, including estimated future salary increases.", "For both measures described above, plan asset amounts generally are based on fair value. For the Accumulated Benefit Obligation measure, the plan assets generally are valued at the amount that the plan could reasonably expect to receive in a current exchange for those assets. Most plans used the same asset amount for the Actuarial Accrued Liability measure. However, a few plans determined the actuarial value of their assets in a different manner for the Actuarial Accrued Liability measure. For example, for its Actuarial Accrued Liability measure, the Military Retirement System stated the actuarial value of its assets at amortized cost (book value)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Defined Contribution Pension Plan Profiles", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contents", "paragraphs": ["Thrift Savings Plan (CSRS and FERS)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data on Federal Pension Plans", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contents", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dallas Regional Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accrued Benefit (Unit Credit) Cost Method", "paragraphs": ["An actuarial cost method in which future service benefits are funded as they accrue.
