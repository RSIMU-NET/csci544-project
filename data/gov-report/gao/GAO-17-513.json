GAO's review of contract actions used to procure ACPVs for selected DOD components between 2011 and 2015 showed that in-progress inspections were conducted, with the exception of the Army, which conducted such inspections for only a single contract action. Without in-progress inspections, the Army is accepting risk in the safety of its vehicles. Further, with the exception of the Army, all the DOD components have a central office and mechanisms for reporting ACPV information. This decentralized approach leaves the Army with an incomplete picture of various ACPV-related matters, including procurement and inspection methods. Federal standards for internal control call for mechanisms that allow for oversight intended to help an organization, such as the Army, ensure compliance with armoring and inspection standards.

First of all, traditional military armored vehicles are designed with  military applications in mind, and typically the armor is integral to the  design and construction. That is not the case with ACPVs, which are  initially built for commercial markets and later disassembled, armored,  and reassembled. Secondly, military armored vehicles are acquired  through major defense acquisition programs while ACPVs are not. The  guidance and regulation associated with major defense acquisition  programs is generally not applicable to ACPVs. Moreover, an ACPV is  considered a modified commercial item in that it is an item customarily  used by the general public, except for modifications (armoring) made to  meet the government\u2019s requirements.

Both DIA and State  determined that in-progress inspections of ACPVs are warranted, as the  intended use of these vehicles is to transport American citizens and  service members through dangerous areas, and failures stemming from  armoring deficiencies could endanger passengers. In addition, officials  from both DIA and State consider in-progress inspections imperative and  a best practice towards ensuring their ACPVs are armored in a manner  that improves the likelihood that vehicles meet contractual specifications.  DIA in-progress inspections discovered vehicle deficiencies that required  corrective actions. These inspections are above and beyond the quality  control procedures provided by the vendors.

The armoring process involves disassembling  the commercial vehicles, integrating the armor, and then rebuilding the  vehicles, which essentially conceals evidence of the armoring techniques.

This  decentralized approach for ACPV management leaves the Army with an  incomplete picture of various ACPV-related matters, including  consistency of procurement and inspection methods. For example, since  the Army does not have ACPV information in a centralized manner, it may  be difficult for the Army to provide information on the types of contracts  used for procuring these vehicles and whether in-progress inspections  are being conducted, to DIA for oversight.

Such inspections provide greater assurances that vendors  are adhering to established quality assurance procedures and delivering  vehicles that satisfy the armoring standards for protecting passengers. By  DIA\u2019s own admission, overseeing the implementation of revised armoring  and inspection standards in DOD contracts will be a challenge. A focal  point within each of the DOD components that can collect and report  ACPV-related contracting information to DIA could help ease that burden.

We  researched the State Foreign Affairs Manual and Foreign Affairs  Handbook for specific sections dealing with various aspects of ACPV  procurement and inspection and verified their applicability during  meetings with State officials. We summarized the contents of DOD and  State policies for comparative purposes. We also analyzed armoring  standards that were referenced in contract file documents\u2014which  included State standards, North Atlantic Treaty Organization standards,  and European standards\u2014and compared them with the minimum  armoring standards outlined in DOD Instruction C-4500.51, the relevant  instruction for the timeframe we assessed.
