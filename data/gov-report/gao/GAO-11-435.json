Specifically, HHS and DOD have funded two alternative production technologies--cell-based and recombinant technologies, which produce vaccine in cells instead of eggs--and adjuvants, which can reduce the amount of vaccine needed to stimulate an immune response. HHS's funding supports the development of a new influenza vaccine using alternative technologies with the goal of manufacturers submitting licensing applications to FDA. DOD's funding supports the research and development of a technology that can make various vaccines, including influenza vaccines. HHS awarded $1 billion in contracts to manufacturers to develop cell-based technology, with manufacturers making progress toward licensure. HHS and DOD funded $296.5 million in contracts and $86.9 million in technology investment agreements, respectively, for the development of recombinant technology. HHS also awarded about $152 million in contracts for the development of adjuvanted influenza vaccines. Two manufacturers receiving HHS funds plan to submit licensing applications for their adjuvanted vaccines to FDA within the next 2 years. Some stakeholders said low demand, high research and development costs, and regulatory challenges can hinder the development and licensure of new vaccines using alternative technologies. For example, despite the United States using more seasonal vaccine than any other country, some stakeholders told us that low vaccination rates can decrease incentives for manufacturers to develop new influenza vaccines using alternative technologies because there is not sufficient demand for new products. Some stakeholders said high research and development costs can also decrease manufacturers' incentives; however, HHS noted that increased investments in this area have generated a significant interest in this type of research and development. Some stakeholders also told us that some of FDA's guidance documents are not sufficiently comprehensive. FDA officials told us that their guidance documents cannot cover all possible scenarios; thus, they regularly meet with manufacturers to discuss issues and provide advice. HHS is addressing challenges in the development and licensure of new influenza vaccines using alternative technologies. For example, HHS intends to fund the establishment of specialized facilities that will provide support and expertise to manufacturers. Additionally, through FDA, HHS plans to facilitate the review of licensing applications for new influenza vaccines using alternative technologies and to enhance FDA's staff expertise. HHS, DOD, and the Department of State reviewed a draft of this report. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS and DOD agreed with GAO on its findings. The Department of State did not provide comments. HHS provided suggestions to clarify the discussion."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Influenza, in both its seasonal and pandemic forms, is an ongoing public  health concern. Seasonal influenza may begin as early as August and  generally diminishes by April in the northern hemisphere. It has been  associated with 3,000 to nearly 50,000 deaths each year in the United  States in recent decades, according to the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019s (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Pandemic influenza, which periodically causes a global outbreak  of serious illness with the potential for many more deaths than seasonal  influenza, has occurred four times in the past 100 years. In the late 1990s  and early 2000s, detection of the H5N1 avian influenza (also known as  \u201cbird flu\u201d) virus in animals raised concerns among experts that it or  another influenza virus might mutate into a strain that could lead to a  human influenza pandemic. The recent 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic  reinforced the need to be prepared for future influenza pandemics.", "The federal government, specifically HHS and the Department of Defense  (DOD), funds the research and development of alternative technologies  that can be used in producing human influenza vaccines as a part of its  pandemic influenza preparedness efforts. According to HHS, HHS\u2019s and  DOD\u2019s funding represents virtually all of the federal government\u2019s  investment in this type of research and development. Vaccines are  considered the first line of defense against seasonal and pandemic  influenza, as they can prevent infection and control the spread of the  disease. Furthermore, influenza vaccines are\u2014along with diagnostic tools  and treatments such as antiviral drugs\u2014a type of medical countermeasure  that can be used to protect the population during public health  emergencies. In 2005, HHS issued the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan  (Plan) for responding to an influenza pandemic. One of the goals stated in  the Plan is to have sufficient domestic capacity to produce enough  pandemic vaccine to cover the United States\u2019 population within 6 months  of a pandemic declaration. These global declarations are made by the  United Nations\u2019 World Health Organization, to which the Department of  State is the United States\u2019 diplomatic liaison. HHS also laid out its intent  to support the development of new influenza vaccines using alternative  technologies that could help achieve this goal. DOD plays an active role in  pandemic influenza preparedness in order to maintain the military\u2019s  readiness and ongoing military operations abroad, such as stockpiling  antiviral drugs for use during a pandemic and developing other  countermeasures. In addition to ensuring the military\u2019s readiness, DOD\u2019s  pandemic preparedness goals include being able to support U.S.  government efforts to save lives, reduce human suffering, and slow the  spread of infection.", "Challenges in the production of 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccines caused  fewer doses of vaccine to be available early in the pandemic than  manufacturers had initially estimated; this heightened interest in the status  of vaccine technologies that provide alternatives to egg-based technology.  Egg-based technology is used to make all influenza vaccine currently  licensed for the U.S. market by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  the agency within HHS responsible for licensing and regulating influenza  vaccines for the U.S. market. It is a well-established technology that has  been in use for decades; however, it has demonstrated certain limitations  in speed and efficiency in producing influenza vaccine as evidenced in the  delay in producing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine supply. Given the  limitations of egg-based technology and the vulnerability of chicken flocks  to infectious diseases, the federal government has funded the development  of alternative technologies that can be used to produce new influenza  vaccines. Vaccines produced using these alternative technologies may be  used during the annual influenza season or during a pandemic in order to  respond faster or to create a greater supply than is possible with the  current technology and production capacity. New influenza vaccines using  alternative technologies are being pursued by influenza vaccine  manufacturers that have egg-based influenza vaccines currently licensed  for marketing and distribution in the United States or internationally, as  well as by manufacturers that currently only have products in  development. No influenza vaccines using alternative technologies have  yet been licensed in the United States.", "You asked us to review the federal government\u2019s actions regarding the  research and development of alternative technologies that can be used in  producing new influenza vaccines. In this report, we examine (1) federal  funding from fiscal year 2005 through March 2011 in alternative  technologies that can be used in producing influenza vaccines and the  status of manufacturers\u2019 efforts, (2) the challenges identified by  stakeholders to the development and licensure of influenza vaccines using  alternative technologies, and (3) how HHS is addressing challenges to the  development and licensure of influenza vaccines using alternative  technologies.", "To examine federal funding from fiscal year 2005 through March 2011 in  alternative technologies that can be used in producing influenza vaccines  and the status of manufacturers\u2019 efforts, we reviewed documents  pertaining to HHS\u2019s and DOD\u2019s funding for this purpose. According to  HHS, HHS\u2019s and DOD\u2019s funding represents virtually all of the federal  government\u2019s investment in this type of research and development. We  reviewed documents from HHS on its funding from fiscal year 2005  through March 2011. These documents included semiannual reports  prepared by HHS that were submitted to Congress on the department\u2019s  contracts to develop influenza vaccines using alternative technologies. We  also interviewed HHS officials who oversee contracts with manufacturers  to assist with the research and development of influenza vaccine for the  federal government. We reviewed HHS\u2019s proposals for funding the  research and development of these technologies and interviewed HHS  budget officials to discuss and clarify the department\u2019s efforts.  Additionally, we reviewed information from DOD on its technology  investment agreements from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2010. We  interviewed DOD officials on the department\u2019s support of alternative  technologies and the status of these development efforts. To assess the  reliability of HHS\u2019s contracting data, we reviewed published data across  multiple years to ensure relative consistency and interviewed  knowledgeable officials to clarify questions regarding the department\u2019s  funding. For DOD, we compared data on its funding provided by different  sources within the department. We also asked officials about its data  sources and how the department validates its data. Although we did not  independently verify the information provided by HHS or DOD, based on  our reviews of the data and interviews with federal officials, we concluded  that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our work.  Additionally, to better understand these technologies we conducted site  visits to three influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities, each utilizing a  different production technology, and attended national conferences on  influenza vaccine research and development.", "To examine challenges to the development and licensure of influenza  vaccines using alternative technologies, we interviewed a judgmental  sample of stakeholders, which included representatives from industry  associations and manufacturers and other experts. Specifically, we  interviewed 15 representatives of the vaccine industry, including those  from three associations that represent pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2014the  Biotechnology Industry Organization, the International Federation of  Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, and the Pharmaceutical  Research and Manufacturers of America. We also interviewed officials  representing 12 vaccine manufacturers\u2014which included those  manufacturers pursuing the research and development of influenza  vaccines using alternative technologies, as well as those that have chosen  to forgo such research and development\u2014about the factors influencing  their decisions. Of these 12 manufacturers, 8 have received funding from  HHS to pursue the research and development of influenza vaccines using  alternative technologies, and 1 received funds from DOD. Additionally, we  interviewed a judgmental sample of 12 other experts in vaccine technology  on challenges to research and development and licensure. We selected  these other experts, in part, based on recommendations from an initial  round of interviews with members of associations representing  researchers and scientists, such as the American Society for Microbiology  and the Infectious Disease Society of America. Other experts we  interviewed included those from provider groups\u2014specifically the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists, and the American Medical Association. We interviewed  representatives from these provider groups about the public\u2019s and  providers\u2019 concerns about influenza vaccine safety and their  understanding of alternative technologies. We also reviewed peer- reviewed journal articles and federal reports on challenges to the  development and licensure of influenza vaccines using alternative  technologies, including HHS\u2019s medical countermeasure review and the  President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\u2019s (PCAST)  report on influenza vaccine production.

Symptoms can include cough, muscle or body aches, and fatigue.  Vaccination is the primary method for preventing infection with strains of  the influenza virus and controlling the disease. In order for a vaccine to  be most effective, it needs enough well-matched antigen to stimulate a  protective immune response, antigen being the active substance in a  vaccine that provides immunity by causing the body to produce protective  antibodies to fight off a particular influenza strain. The vaccine\u2019s antigen  needs to be derived from a strain that is well-matched to a specific  influenza strain\u2014in wide circulation in humans\u2014so that the antibodies  formed in response to the vaccine protect against infection from that  strain. Because multiple influenza strains are in constant circulation,  seasonal vaccine is produced and administered annually to protect against  the three influenza strains expected to be most prevalent that year (i.e., a  trivalent vaccine). In contrast, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine was  formulated to match the single pandemic-causing strain (i.e., a monovalent  vaccine)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government\u2019s Role in the Research and Development of Alternative Technologies and the Licensure and Regulation of Influenza Vaccines", "paragraphs": ["Within the federal government, HHS is the department responsible for  leading and coordinating preparedness and medical response activities to  public health emergencies, per the 2006 Pandemic and All-Hazards  Preparedness Act. Additionally, as the principal department for  protecting the public\u2019s health, HHS is the primary department funding the  research and development of influenza vaccines. HHS enters into  contracts with manufacturers for the development of new influenza  vaccines using alternative technologies. DOD also makes some  investments through its technology investment agreements for the  research and development of alternative technologies that can be used in  producing influenza vaccine as part of its preparedness efforts in order to  maintain the military\u2019s readiness. Manufacturers with which these  agencies have entered into contracts or technology investment agreements  include large-scale influenza vaccine manufacturers that have vaccines  licensed for use in the United States and internationally as well as  manufacturers that currently only have vaccines in research and  development. Influenza vaccines\u2014both seasonal and pandemic\u2014are  biological products. Within HHS, FDA is the federal agency responsible for  the licensure and regulation of biological products for use in the U.S.  market (see app. I for additional information on the research and  development and review of licensing applications for new influenza  vaccines in the United States). These responsibilities include issuing  guidance for existing and new vaccines and consulting with manufacturers  on the development of their new vaccines, such as on how manufacturers  conduct clinical trials required for licensure of new vaccines. Until FDA  has approved its licensing application, no manufacturer can market its  biological product in the United States. Table 1 summarizes the federal  government\u2019s role in the research and development of alternative  technologies and the licensure and regulation of influenza vaccines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Efforts to Enhance Domestic Production Capacity to Expand the Supply or Accelerate the Availability of Influenza Vaccine", "paragraphs": ["Given its responsibilities for national seasonal influenza and pandemic  preparedness and response, HHS has an interest in enhancing domestic  production capacity\u2014that is, enhancing the nation\u2019s overall infrastructure  for influenza vaccine production\u2014and expanding the supply or  accelerating the availability of influenza vaccine. HHS began awarding  contracts to enhance domestic production capacity for the current egg- based technology as early as fiscal year 2005. Since fiscal year 2005, HHS  has supported a program to ensure a year-round, secure, domestic egg  supply; prior to this funding, manufacturers maintained a 9-month supply  of eggs\u2014enough for production only during the influenza season without  any additional capacity for emergencies, such as an influenza pandemic.", "Despite HHS\u2019s initial efforts to maintain a year-round egg supply, other  events have occurred that highlighted the need for HHS to increase  domestic production capacity for influenza vaccine and to support the  introduction of influenza vaccines produced using alternative  technologies. First was the unexpected loss of almost half of the influenza  vaccine supply because of potential contamination during the 2004\u201305  season and the reliance on two domestic influenza vaccine manufacturers  to supply enough vaccine for that year. Second was the recognition by  HHS that one of the greatest challenges to preparing for an influenza  pandemic and implementing its strategy for using vaccines was the lack of  production capacity within the United States. As we noted in prior work,  the lack of U.S. production capacity is cause for concern among experts  because it is possible that countries without domestic production capacity  will not have access to influenza vaccine in the event of a pandemic if  countries where vaccine is produced prohibit the export of the pandemic  vaccine until their own needs are met. As a result, HHS continued its  funding of egg-based technology for the production of influenza vaccine to  enhance domestic production capacity using this technology. For  example, in fiscal year 2007, HHS entered into contracts with two  manufacturers for the retrofitting of existing domestic egg-based  production facilities for the production of pandemic influenza vaccine.  Some of the completed facilities were used in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,  and according to HHS, when all the retrofitting is complete, one of these  facility\u2019s production capacity will double and the other will triple. Third,  concerns about strains of the H5N1 virus that had reemerged in the early  2000s, and continues to cause severe infection in humans, further  prompted interest in alternative technologies to egg-based technology for  producing influenza vaccine. Strains of the H5N1 virus have infected  chicken flocks and other poultry, resulting in the culling of these flocks,  raising concern that the egg supply for influenza vaccine was at risk. Thus,  HHS began a more concerted effort to fund the research and development  of influenza vaccines using three alternative technologies. Specifically,  HHS has funded the development of vaccines using two alternative  production technologies\u2014cell-based and recombinant technologies\u2014and  vaccines using a third alternative technology\u2014antigen-sparing technology  (adjuvants).", "Each of these three alternative technologies has the potential to expand  the supply or accelerate the availability of both seasonal and pandemic  influenza vaccines (see app. II for a description of the production process  for influenza vaccine using the current, egg-based technology). Expanding  the supply or accelerating the availability of influenza vaccine is  particularly important when there is a perceived shortage of seasonal  vaccine\u2014when vaccine is not available and demand is highest\u2014or during  a pandemic when demand increases because of increased risk of disease  and death. Expanding the supply or accelerating the availability of  influenza vaccine can be done in two ways. The first is to increase the  overall amount of vaccine available at the end of the production process;  the second is to speed up the production process itself by, for example,  reducing or eliminating step(s) in the process. Table 2 describes these  three alternative technologies and their potential to expand the supply or  accelerate the availability of influenza vaccines (see app. III for more  information on these alternative technologies)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Funding for the Development of Influenza Vaccines Using Alternative Technologies", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, with funds available from that year\u2019s appropriation,  HHS funded the research and development of an influenza vaccine  produced using cell-based technology.

HHS has since used these funds, as well as funds available from previous  appropriations, for multiyear contracts for the development of influenza  vaccine using cell-based technology, recombinant technology, and  adjuvants. In response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Congress provided  HHS with a supplemental appropriation to prepare for and respond to an  influenza pandemic. In addition to making $1.85 billion immediately  available to HHS, the 2009 supplemental appropriation made $5.8 billion  available contingent upon one or more presidential notifications to  Congress. In August 2010, after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic had ended, HHS  notified Congress of its plan to direct some of the remaining funds toward  pandemic and related preparedness activities.

Researchers have also found  that patients and providers have concerns about influenza vaccine. One  manufacturer representative also noted that the current influenza vaccine  is less effective for certain populations, such as the elderly, which also  decreases demand. We have previously reported that according to CDC, a  recommendation from a physician or other health care provider is the  most important factor in an individual\u2019s decision to get vaccinated.  Additionally, a recent review of survey data found that health care  professionals were cited as one of three most important sources of  information in making decisions about children\u2019s vaccines by 85 percent of  parents surveyed. CDC has made efforts to encourage providers to  recommend vaccination to their patients. However, despite these efforts,  available data suggest that getting providers to recommend vaccination for  their patients has been difficult. CDC told us that it is working closely  with numerous partners to implement an influenza vaccine  communication plan utilizing multiple forms of media to reach the general  public as well as specific target populations.", "HHS officials acknowledged the challenge of low demand for seasonal  influenza vaccine; however, they said manufacturers remain interested in  pursuing the development of new influenza vaccines using alternative  technologies.

For  example, a representative for one manufacturer we spoke with noted the  significant costs associated with the research and development of its  currently licensed egg-based influenza vaccine, estimating that his  company has spent $400 million alone on clinical trials. One small-scale  manufacturer conducting clinical trials for a new influenza vaccine using  an alternative technology estimated that it spends $150,000 per day on  these trials and other expenses as it moves toward applying for licensure.  In addition, PCAST\u2014a presidential advisory council\u2014found in a recent  report on influenza vaccine research and development that constructing a  cell-based influenza vaccine production facility could cost more than   $1 billion and it could take over 30 years to recover the investment.", "Access to capital is important to manufacturers because of these high  research and development costs.

One manufacturer  representative told us that in the current economic market it has been  challenging for his firm to find investors. Three other manufacturer  representatives noted that their decision making is also influenced by  perceptions of whether the benefits of a new influenza vaccine will offset  these high research and development costs by increasing production  efficiency or supporting higher prices for the new product compared to  the current vaccine. HHS told us that it has worked to address this issue  through its funding for influenza vaccines using alternative technologies  and that its support of manufacturers\u2019 efforts has helped to change the  return on investment such that manufacturers have more incentive to  pursue the development of new influenza vaccines using alternative  technologies.

First,  some stakeholders and recent federal reports identified weaknesses in  FDA\u2019s \u201cregulatory science\u201d capacity\u2014that is, its ability to utilize resources,  such as staff expertise, to develop new tests and measures to assess the  safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA-regulated products, such  as influenza vaccines. Three manufacturer representatives, one industry  association representative, and three experts told us that regulatory  science weaknesses at FDA create challenges in the review of new  product licensing applications, including those for new influenza vaccines.  In particular, stakeholders told us that FDA\u2019s staff expertise in alternative  technologies affects its ability to work with manufacturers developing new  influenza vaccines using these technologies, and that limited staff  expertise is a challenge to efficient communication. A manufacturer  representative told us that FDA\u2019s ability to conduct its own research is  important in understanding the science manufacturers present in licensing  applications, but noted that some of FDA\u2019s research programs have been  cut in recent years thereby hindering its ability to gain needed experience.  An industry association representative told us that manufacturers pursuing  the development of some influenza vaccines using alternative technologies  sometimes find it difficult to find FDA staff who can answer their  questions. One expert said that many experienced senior leaders in FDA\u2019s  biologics division\u2014where licensing applications for new vaccines are  reviewed\u2014have left the agency in recent years; therefore, reviewers are  less familiar with these alternative technologies. This expert said this lack  of familiarity can make it more difficult for manufacturers to work with  reviewers to explain the technology to them.", "Some recent federal reports have echoed stakeholders\u2019 concerns about  FDA\u2019s regulatory science capacity. According to a recent HHS report, FDA  needs to be able to conduct applied research in order to better incorporate  advances in life sciences research and knowledge into the regulatory  process. In order to make that possible, the report states that FDA needs  greater staff expertise and infrastructure. In addition, a 2007 report  prepared for the FDA Science Board\u2014an FDA advisory group\u2014found that  the development of products based on new science cannot be adequately  regulated by FDA because of a lack of capacity to review new  technologies. However, FDA officials told us that they are not aware of  actual examples of lack of expertise within the agency and that their staff  consists of highly qualified scientists. Furthermore, FDA officials noted  the continuing education that staff members engage in to maintain their  proficiency in technological advances as well as the quality of FDA\u2019s  research programs. The agency said it has the scientific and regulatory  experience to adequately assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccines  for use in the United States, but as noted later in this report, it continues to  fund improvements in regulatory science capacity and staff expertise.", "Some stakeholders also identified a second challenge, namely that FDA\u2019s  written guidance and consultation with manufacturers on some of the  requirements for licensure of new influenza vaccines using alternative  technologies is not sufficiently comprehensive. They noted that FDA\u2019s  guidance documents do not include all of the various scenarios  manufacturers may encounter. Additionally, one manufacturer  representative said it can take months to arrange a formal meeting with  FDA officials. Another manufacturer representative noted that FDA often  conducts its discussions with manufacturers in stages, which can limit  their ability to plan for long-term issues. According to stakeholders, this  lack of detail and incremental approach can hinder manufacturers\u2019  abilities to plan their research and development efforts, including those for  new influenza vaccines, because they are uncertain as to what  requirements they must meet in order to obtain licensure. For example,  two manufacturer representatives said that it is unclear what size clinical  trials will be required for influenza vaccines using alternative technologies  because the guidance documents available are not specific enough in  laying out these requirements. In addition, PCAST found in a recent report  on influenza vaccine research and development that there is currently  uncertainty about the regulatory pathway for recombinant influenza  vaccines and recommended that guidance be developed on areas including  criteria for formulation, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Also, one  manufacturer representative told us that his company was repeating  clinical trials for an adjuvanted vaccine that had already been performed  in Europe because the company had been unaware of certain FDA  requirements for data that are not typically required for similar vaccines or  by regulatory authorities in other countries. The manufacturer  representative noted that this situation could have been avoided if FDA  had provided a more complete explanation of the requirements in this  regard.", "FDA officials acknowledged that its guidance documents are high level,  explaining that specific instructions are unique to the product as guidance  documents cannot cover all possible scenarios. In its comments, HHS  officials noted that FDA\u2019s guidance is intended to provide a regulatory  framework, adding that guidance cannot be specific to individual  manufacturing processes because these processes are trade secrets.  Because of their inability to be very specific in guidance documents, FDA  officials told us that they regularly meet with manufacturers developing  vaccines using alternative technologies to discuss various issues and  provide advice. They also noted that the agency has a good record of  achieving its goals on meeting with manufacturers within a specific time  frame, adding that officials often consult with manufacturers in other  ways, such as participating in teleconferences. Additionally, FDA officials  said that it is necessary to consult with manufacturers in stages because  their review is an iterative process. They explained that it is not always  apparent what requirements may be necessary for a late phase of clinical  trials because such decisions are based, in part, on results from earlier  trials the manufacturer has completed. Furthermore, FDA noted that it has  approved many vaccines for other diseases that used alterative  technologies, such as adjuvants, and these manufacturers were able to  successfully develop and license their products using FDA\u2019s guidance.  Finally, FDA has published guidance on criteria for the formulation, safety,  immunogenicity, and efficacy for vaccines using recombinant technology,  and one manufacturer has submitted a licensing application for its  influenza vaccine using this technology.

In August 2010, HHS  announced that it was expanding its vaccination recommendations for the  2010\u201311 influenza season from specific target groups based on personal  risk from the disease to all persons aged 6 months and older. According to  HHS, its expanded recommendations simplify the public health message to  providers and to the public on who should be vaccinated against seasonal  influenza. Because the 2010\u201311 influenza season is the first for which the  recommendations are in place and the first influenza season after the 2009  H1N1 pandemic, HHS is also evaluating vaccination rates from this season  for changes from previous years. For example, preliminary data from CDC  suggest an increase in vaccination rates against seasonal influenza among  children aged 6 months to 17 years. According to CDC, vaccination rates  for this population increased by 6.7 percentage points, or from   42.3 percent during the 2009\u201310 influenza season to 49 percent, as of  February 2011. Officials noted that currently, only about 40 percent of  Americans are vaccinated against seasonal influenza. HHS added that  eventually demand for seasonal vaccine could increase by approximately  32 percent\u2014or 100 million people\u2014as a result of the expanded  recommendations. Additionally, a rise in immunization rates for seasonal  influenza vaccine could result in an increase in the market for this vaccine  of approximately $3 billion annually, according to HHS.", "In February 2011, HHS released its updated national immunization  strategy, which outlines, in part, the department\u2019s efforts to address low  vaccination rates for influenza. This strategy, called the National Vaccine  Plan, lays out HHS\u2019s efforts to enhance aspects of vaccines and  vaccination rates against infectious diseases and provides a  comprehensive plan for U.S. vaccine and immunization efforts from  childhood to adulthood. As we have noted above, several stakeholders  we spoke with cited a lack of provider and public education and concerns  regarding the safety of vaccines as factors affecting the demand for  influenza vaccine. The National Vaccine Plan has been updated to reflect  experiences from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and describes various goals,  such as enhancing provider and public education on vaccines and vaccine  safety and assisting providers and the public with making informed  decisions regarding vaccination. HHS also plans to develop a  corresponding implementation plan that will include measurable  indicators so the department can assess its progress in achieving the goals  of the National Vaccine Plan; HHS anticipates releasing this  implementation plan later in 2011.

HHS indicated that it intends to enter into contracts to partially fund the  construction of new facilities or the retrofitting of existing facilities using  approximately $478 million available from various appropriations.  Although not the primary purpose of these facilities, according to HHS,  one benefit of these specialized facilities is that they could reduce smaller,  less-experienced manufacturers\u2019 research and development costs by  providing needed resources and knowledge about manufacturing, and  reduce the technical risks of researching and developing medical  countermeasures, such as influenza vaccine produced using alternative  technologies. These facilities are primarily intended to provide, on a  routine basis, core services that include the advanced development and  manufacturing of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear medical  countermeasures. These specialized facilities may also be used in an  emergency to make pandemic influenza vaccine produced using  alternative technologies, such as recombinant technology. HHS noted  that smaller, less-experienced manufacturers often lack the staff and other  resources to address technical issues\u2014such as those related to  production, quality control, and licensure\u2014resulting in delays and higher  costs, which could cause an effort to fail. These specialized facilities  would have the resources to provide manufacturers with the necessary  staff, technical resources, and expertise to address these delays that can  result in higher costs or effort failures.", "According to HHS, these facilities might also reduce the total cost of the  federal government\u2019s contracts with manufacturers. By using these  specialized facilities for vaccine production, the costs associated with  producing these initial vaccine doses, such as those for use in clinical  trials, could be included in the facilities\u2019 operating budgets rather than in  manufacturers\u2019 research and development contracts, thereby reducing the  total amount of these contracts. According to HHS, the enhanced  production capacity from these facilities could also help manufacturers  with which HHS has contracts avoid production delays.
