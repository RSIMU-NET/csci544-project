However, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) estimated in 2000 and 2001 that as many as 136,600 families needed assistance, and these projects face implementation obstacles, such as difficulty marketing licit products and operating in conflictive areas. U.S. assistance to Colombia's vulnerable groups has provided support to many internally displaced persons, but these program beneficiaries do not receive all of the assistance they need, and there is no systematic way for beneficiaries to transition from emergency aid to longer-term development assistance. The U.S. government has made some progress toward facilitating democratic reform in Colombia, but projects face certain obstacles, such as limited funding and security constraints. Despite the progress made by the three nonmilitary assistance programs, Colombia and the United States continue to face long-standing management and financial challenges. The Colombian government's ability to contribute funds for nonmilitary assistance programs is limited by a number of domestic and foreign factors, and Colombia's longstanding conflict poses additional challenges to implementing and sustaining nonmilitary assistance efforts. The U.S. government has not maximized the mutual benefits of its nonmilitary assistance programs and has not established a mechanism for vulnerable groups to transition from emergency aid to longer-term assistance.

These groups, which include the Revolutionary  Armed Forces of Colombia, the National Liberation Army, and paramilitary  forces such as the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia, are involved in  every facet of narcotics trafficking and are on the State Department\u2019s list of  terrorist organizations. Recognizing that the insurgents and illicit drug  activities are inextricably linked, the Congress provided \u201cexpanded  authority\u201d in 2002 for the use of U.S. assistance to Colombia. This authority  enables the government of Colombia to use U.S.-provided equipment to  fight groups designated as terrorist organizations as well as to fight drug  trafficking.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the United States substantially increased  counternarcotics assistance to Colombia. For fiscal years 2000 through  2004, the United States provided a total of approximately $3.3 billion,  making Colombia the fifth largest recipient of U.S. assistance since fiscal  year 2002. (See table 1.) Most of this funding was provided through the  Andean Counterdrug Initiative, an appropriation provided annually that  supports counternarcotics programs throughout the Andean region. Much  of this assistance was provided to the Colombian Army to conduct  interdiction missions and to the Colombian National Police to conduct the  aerial eradication of coca and poppy.

In August 2001, we reported that international organizations  generally met the emergency food and shelter needs of internally displaced  persons in Colombia, but were less effective in meeting their longer-term  needs, and that the U.S. government lacked an overall policy to coordinate  its efforts for dealing with the displaced.

According to the agency\u2019s strategy, the objective of the alternative  development program is to provide economic and social alternatives to  illicit crop production through short- and long-term projects involving crop  substitution, infrastructure development, and income generation projects  in rural parts of the country, as well as in secondary cities affected by illicit  crop cultivation. The alternative development program has had some  success promoting economic and social alternatives to illicit crop  production, but individual projects are relatively localized and small in  scale.", "USAID\u2019s original alternative development strategy from 2000 focused  primarily on encouraging farmers to manually eradicate illicit crops, and  those who did received assistance in licit, short-term, income-producing  opportunities. This assistance was intended to complement the eradication  and interdiction components of Colombia\u2019s effort to eliminate coca  cultivation in southern Colombia. USAID primarily supported initiatives in  the departments of Caquet\u00e1 and Putumayo, where, at the time, much of  Colombia\u2019s coca was cultivated. USAID (and its implementing partners)  found it difficult to implement projects in the largely undeveloped south,  where the Colombian government exercised minimal control. In addition,  poor soil made growing licit crops a challenge, and farmers found it more  lucrative to continue growing coca. Furthermore, the USAID/Colombia  mission estimated that implementing such a comprehensive alternative  development program could involve assisting as many as 136,600 families  and cost up to $4 billion over 3 years.", "As a result, USAID revised its approach in February 2002 to support long- term income-generating activities, focus more attention and resources  outside southern Colombia, and encourage private sector participation.  The agency\u2019s revised strategy is to promote and leverage significant private  sector investment in longer-term, economically viable agro-business and  forestry initiatives, as well as linkages to small- and medium-sized  enterprises. Unlike the initial alternative development efforts, the program  is no longer based on an explicit mandate to assist illicit crop growers  whose crops had been eradicated or who agreed to manually eradicate  their illegal crops. Some current program participants were not directly  involved in cultivating coca or poppy.", "USAID has alternative development projects in 25 of Colombia\u2019s 32  departments. To assess its progress, USAID uses four measures: the  number of hectares of illicit crops eradicated, the number of hectares of  licit crops cultivated, the number of families benefited, and the number of  small infrastructure projects established. Table 3 illustrates USAID\u2019s  reported accomplishments.", "Based on these four measures, the alternative development program has  started to produce results. However, USAID officials acknowledge that  these indicators do not measure the agency\u2019s progress in reaching its  primary objective of promoting economic and social alternatives to illicit  crop production. Individual alternative development projects may employ  only a small number of people for a short period of time or benefit a  relatively small number of families. Without broader participation and  financial support, such projects may not be sustainable if U.S. support is  reduced. Furthermore, as we reported in 2002, the lack of security in the  project areas continues to seriously hamper the Colombian government\u2019s  ability to develop infrastructure where illicit crop cultivation takes place,  establish viable and reliable markets for licit products, and attract the  private investment needed for long-term, income-generating  development. For example:  In 2002, a contractor received about $1.4 million from USAID to build a  water treatment plant in Villa Garz\u00f3n in the department of Putumayo.  The plant is designed to provide clean water for the town and to create  employment opportunities for local residents. Construction began in  December 2002, and when we visited the site in January 2004, it was  nearing completion. Although the project provided jobs for some local  residents, these jobs will end shortly.", "Another contractor received funding for a hearts of palm canning plant  in Puerto As\u00eds, Putumayo, which is intended to provide long-term  employment opportunities for the workers and income to farmers who  grow palm fronds. The United Nations Drug Control Program built the  plant with the government of Colombia in the late 1990s, but it was  dormant for several years. USAID took over the plant in 2002. When we  visited the site in January 2004, it was operating at 30 percent capacity.  Although the plant had secured a buyer for its product, USAID support  will end in September 2004, and the plant manager told us he did not  know if the plant could maintain or increase its operating capacity when  U.S. funding stops.", "The same contractor overseeing the hearts of palm plant also receives  USAID funding to operate a woodworking center in Puerto As\u00eds, where  program participants make furniture parts. According to the project\u2019s  annual work plan, the woodworking center will directly employ 25  people. The contractor plans to sell the furniture parts for assembly  elsewhere, targeting the North American market. However, when we  toured the center, we learned that the contractor has not been able to  market the wood products outside Putumayo because when the  products are shipped to less humid regions, the wood cracks.", "An alternative development project outside Putumayo is designed to  encourage families to cultivate specialty coffee rather than coca or  opium poppy. To participate, farmers must commit to eradicate or not  enter into illicit crop cultivation. However, the contractor has been able  to market only a very limited amount of the product because before a  specialty coffee can be marketed, measures must be taken to ensure  that the coffee meets industry standards\u2014a process that can take 1 to 5  years due, in part, to the need to renovate coffee farms and implement  more stringent quality control procedures. Moreover, according to the  contractor, before February 2004, security concerns prevented U.S.  buyers from traveling to Colombia\u2019s coffee-growing regions to evaluate  the product.", "As we reported in February 2002, alternative development progress in  Bolivia and Peru took 20 years of sustained U.S. assistance, and the host  government agencies involved in the efforts continued to be heavily  dependent on U.S. support. The situation in Colombia is similar. As noted  earlier, the USAID/Colombia mission once estimated that a comprehensive  alternative development program could involve assisting as many as  136,600 families and cost up to $4 billion over 3 years. The agency has  requested about $56 million for the program in fiscal year 2005, and for  fiscal years 2006 through 2008, USAID planning documents call for a total  of $234 million.

For example, Justice has supported  satellite human rights units to investigate and prosecute human rights  cases in Colombia. Investigations increased significantly in fiscal years  2002 and 2003; arrest warrants increased by 35 percent, accusations by 73  percent, and guilty pleas by more than 200 percent. However, Justice has  reduced its original target to establish 32 satellite units to as few as 15  units; as of January 2004, 11 had been created. Justice officials expect  funding for this program to decrease. Although Justice has budgeted  $4 million for fiscal year 2004 and requested $3 million for fiscal year 2005,  the department plans to reduce the funding level to less than $2 million in  later years.", "Justice has also assisted the Colombian government in developing a new  criminal procedure code. As we noted in a prior report, Colombia enacted  constitutional reform in 1991 that called for criminal justice reform, but  little progress had been made. According to Justice, the new code  provides the framework for an accusatory criminal justice system and oral  trials. In order to prepare for and support the code\u2019s implementation,  Justice trained 122 prosecutors in criminal trial techniques in fiscal year  2003 and plans to train 10,000 judicial police investigators by 2005 for their  new roles as witnesses in oral trials. The department also plans to train an  additional 3,000 prosecutors in the new procedural code and their changed  roles in an accusatory system. Justice uses a \u201ctrain-the-trainer\u201d approach to  encourage and facilitate the transition of program responsibility to  Colombian personnel."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Management and Financial Challenges Continue to Complicate Project Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Although the U.S. nonmilitary assistance programs are beginning to  achieve some of the results originally envisioned, Colombia and the United  States must address management and financial challenges.

USAID was not maximizing the  interrelationships among its programs for alternative development,  vulnerable groups, or democracy, and its implementing partners expressed  concern that they were often not aware of one another\u2019s projects even  when they were nearby. Moreover, State and USAID were not coordinating  their programs for internally displaced persons.", "The three nonmilitary assistance programs are interrelated. Alternative  development can provide legitimate income generation for coca and opium  poppy farmers. An increased state presence and strengthened judicial  system can provide greater protection and a safer environment for those  who want to grow licit crops and participate in other licit income- generating alternatives. A more secure situation can lead to fewer people  leaving their homes and depending on assistance for internally displaced  persons.", "The USAID/Colombia mission recognizes this interrelationship among its  programs. Its recently amended strategy for fiscal years 2006 through 2008  recognizes the need to explore opportunities for program synergies and  efficiencies.", "However, coordination among USAID\u2019s implementing partners is not  always occurring. A February 2004 evaluation of USAID\u2019s alternative  development projects in Putumayo concluded that the successful  continuation of these projects depended, in part, on greater coordination  among USAID\u2019s contractors and grantees. Many of the grantees and  contractors implementing USAID\u2019s three nonmilitary assistance programs  told us they had never met as a group to discuss and coordinate their  efforts. In our meetings with grantees working with vulnerable groups, the  representatives also suggested that specific barriers limit coordination. For  instance, if grantees from two different programs implement a joint project,  only one of them can claim an achievement for having served the project  beneficiaries. According to one grantee, this is a disincentive to cooperate  with other grantees. Another barrier cited was general confusion among  grantees about how to account for money taken from different programs\u2014 according to some grantees, USAID\u2019s rules and regulations about using  funding from different strategic objectives are prohibitively complex.", "USAID officials and representatives of many of its implementing partners  told us that while USAID holds monthly meetings to ensure that alternative  development grantees and contractors coordinate with one another, no  mechanisms exist for ensuring that similar coordination occurs among  grantees and contractors working in USAID\u2019s other assistance programs,  even in areas of the country where several projects are taking place near  one another. For example, in January 2004 we met with local USAID  democracy grantees in Antioquia. All told us they had never met each other  and did not know about one another\u2019s projects, even when they dealt with  similar issues. They reported that as a result of their meeting with us, they  would make a better effort to coordinate with one another.", "In addition to coordination problems among the nonmilitary assistance  programs, coordination is weak within the vulnerable groups program.", "Although State and USAID have agreed to split responsibilities for  providing emergency aid and longer-term development assistance to  internally displaced persons, respectively, they do not have any procedures  for coordinating or transitioning from one to the other. USAID\u2019s and State\u2019s  Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2004 through 2009 does not include any  specifics for joint program implementation. We found that   during a site visit to a USAID-funded project outside of Bogot\u00e1, an  agency official was surprised to learn that State also funded a project in  the same location; and   half of the grantees involved in USAID\u2019s program were unaware of  State\u2019s program to assist the displaced and did not know whether their  project beneficiaries had first received emergency humanitarian  assistance from State.", "While State and USAID are not explicitly required to assist the same  beneficiaries, agency officials and program documents indicate that their  goal is to ensure that internally displaced persons who receive emergency  aid are then provided longer-term assistance, if needed.

International donations not directly related to Plan Colombia  have also been limited. For example:   The United Nation\u2019s Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for $62 million in  humanitarian assistance to Colombia is underfunded. Donations as of  November 2003 amounted to approximately $14 million, of which the  United States contributed about 42 percent.", "As we reported in August 2001, scarce or declining budgetary resources  provided by the international donor community inhibit agencies from  expanding their internally displaced person protection and assistance  activities.", "The Colombian government has dedicated some of its own resources for  nonmilitary assistance programs, although they are not sufficient to sustain  ongoing programs. For example, according to a United Nations agency,  Colombia is providing resources to support internally displaced persons,  and Colombian law exempts internally displaced persons from paying fees  for education, health, and other basic services. However, the report (dated  May 2003) goes on to note that only 43 percent of the total number of  internally displaced persons registered with the Colombian government  received relief items. Furthermore, the government\u2019s response to  displacement does not reach remote areas and is inadequate in urban  areas. Similarly for democracy programs, the Colombia Human Rights  Ombudsman\u2019s office agreed to produce a sustainability plan outlining its  financial and technical responsibilities on a long-term basis by January  2004. As of May 2004, the plan had not been completed. Specifically within  the rule of law program, Colombian nondefense budget reductions have  prevented the government from taking control of the human rights  investigative units as originally planned and funds for maintaining the  justice houses may be in jeopardy.", "A number of domestic and foreign factors have limited the Colombian  government\u2019s ability to contribute more resources. In August 2003,  President Uribe promoted a referendum designed to produce fiscal reform.  However, voter turnout was short of the threshold required, and the  referendum failed. To mitigate the effects of these failed cost-cutting  measures, State said that the Uribe administration introduced new  economic austerity legislation in the Colombian Congress. According to  State officials, these measures included taxes on wealth, personal income,  and financial transactions; creation of anti-evasion policies; and an  expansion of the tax base. However, these measures will not entirely  eliminate the fiscal shortfall. According to State, the tax bill that passed the  Colombian Congress in December 2003 provided $817 million in added  revenues, leaving a $286 million gap to be bridged by spending cuts.", "Fiscal constraints due to revenue shortfalls and an International Monetary  Fund requirement to reduce the combined sector deficit to 2.5 percent of  gross domestic product will preclude the government from increasing both  defense and nondefense spending in 2004. Because the success of  President Uribe\u2019s democratic security policy depends in part on increasing  the size of Colombia\u2019s security forces, President Uribe has announced that  nondefense spending will be cut to enable the Colombian government to  meet its fiscal targets. This strategy should enable the government to meet  its short-term fiscal targets. However, without significant cuts in  expenditures for pensions and other earmarks, U.S. embassy officials  stated that the Colombian government may also need to reduce defense  spending to meet its long-term goal of significantly reducing public debt.

According to USAID officials, the agency is still prohibited from operating  in certain parts of the country because of security concerns. Within the  alternative development program, for example, it makes the process of  verifying that communities are adhering to voluntary eradication  agreements highly risky. Moreover, while many human rights indicators  improved last year due to the Colombian government\u2019s efforts to improve  security, both armed forces and insurgents continue to commit serious  human rights abuses, according to human rights organizations, as well as  State\u2019s 2003 Human Rights Report.

We also found that while U.S. embassy officials conduct oversight to assess  the accuracy of program data submitted by grantees and contractors, not  all do. For example, according to State, it does not independently verify  estimates of the number of beneficiaries assisted by the international  organizations it funds. In addition, any data collected by the agencies is  subject to some limitations. For example, the November 2003 Inspector  General report stated that the alternative development program might be  overstating the number of families benefited due to the way program data  are collected. In addition, the vulnerable groups program may double count  project beneficiaries, and the statistics collected through the justice houses  are generally not reliable because they are not equipped to collect data  regularly on their own.", "However, USAID has taken measures to address these limitations. For  example, in response to its Inspector General\u2019s concerns, USAID agreed to  separate the alternative development program data between crop  substitution and infrastructure projects to avoid double counting. Similarly,  to avoid the double counting in the vulnerable groups program, the agency  asks grantees to jointly report on individuals assisted in areas where more  than one grantee was present. Finally, to correct data collection difficulties  associated with the justice houses, the USAID contractor plans to have a  national automated information system by 2005.", "Nevertheless, based on our discussions with State, Justice, and USAID  officials, we concluded that the performance data we obtained were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State letter, dated  June 28, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

Any informal coordination  that already occurs is an important step toward implementing this  recommendation. 2. While some of State\u2019s implementing partners may track some  individuals after they receive assistance, not all do. Further, it should be  noted that while the Colombian Government\u2019s Social Solidarity  Network works to avoid duplication of assistance and to attend to  registered internally displaced persons, both State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s  implementing partners provide services to persons who are not  registered with the Colombian government. 3.
