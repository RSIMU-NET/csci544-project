When services are unavailable from IHS, IHS's CHS program may pay for care from external providers. GAO previously reported on challenges regarding the timeliness of CHS payments and the number of American Indians and Alaska Natives who may gain new health care coverage as a result of PPACA. PPACA mandated GAO to review the CHS program. This report examines (1) the length of time it takes external providers to receive payment from IHS after delivering CHS services; (2) the performance measures IHS has established for processing CHS provider payments; (3) the factors that affect the length of time it takes IHS to pay CHS providers; and (4) how new PPACA health care coverage options could affect the program. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed fiscal year 2011 CHS claims data, interviewed IHS officials, including officials in four IHS areas, and reviewed agency documents and statutes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For Indian Health Service (IHS) contract health services (CHS) delivered in fiscal year 2011, a majority of claims were paid within 6 months of the service delivery date, but some took much longer. Specifically, about 73 percent of claims were paid within 6 months of service delivery, while about 8 percent took more than 1 year. The CHS payment process consists of three main steps: (1) the local CHS program issues a purchase order to the provider authorizing payment (either before service delivery, or after, such as in emergency situations), (2) the provider submits a claim for payment, and (3) IHS pays the provider. GAO found that the first step took the longest--often taking more than 2 months.", "IHS uses three measures to assess the time it takes to approve and then process payments to CHS providers. Two of the measures concern the first step in the payment process (purchase order issuance) and the third concerns the final step (making the payment). One of the measures IHS uses to assess the timeliness of the first step is the average time it takes to issue a purchase order after a service has been delivered; IHS's current target for this measure is 74 days. However, the measure does not provide a clear picture of timeliness for this activity as it combines data for two different types of CHS services--those for which payment eligibility was determined prior to service delivery and those for which eligibility was determined after service delivery. IHS officials told GAO that when eligibility is determined prior to service delivery, it may take only one day from the date of service to issue the purchase order. Including this type of service in the calculation, therefore, lowers the overall average.", "The complexity of the CHS program affects the timeliness of provider payments. IHS program officials make decisions on what care will be funded on a case-by-case basis, evaluating each case against a number of eligibility requirements involving multiple steps. This process can lead to payment delays. Officials noted that delays also can occur when processing payments and that staffing shortages can affect the timeliness of payments. Some program officials noted that their staffing levels were below standards established by IHS.", "New coverage options in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) may provide an opportunity to simplify CHS eligibility requirements. PPACA made significant changes to the Medicaid program and included new health care coverage options that may benefit many American Indians and Alaska Natives beginning in 2014. IHS officials reported the agency developed the current CHS program eligibility requirements to manage CHS program funding constraints. In particular, some of the complexities of the program were designed to allow the program to operate within the constrained levels of program funding. With the availability of new coverage options under PPACA, some constraints on CHS program funds could be alleviated, providing IHS an opportunity to streamline service eligibility requirements and expand the range of services it pays for with CHS funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IHS revise an agency measure of the timeliness with which purchase orders are issued, use available funds as appropriate to improve the alignment between CHS staffing levels and workloads, and proactively develop potential options to streamline CHS eligibility requirements.

Many users of IHS services are also eligible for other sources of  payment for care, including Medicaid, Medicare, and private  insurance. The CHS program is typically the payer of last resort.  Therefore, before a service is approved for CHS payment, the patient  must apply for and use all alternate resources that are available and  accessible. Services from an IHS facility are also considered a  resource, so CHS funds cannot be used for services reasonably  accessible and available at IHS facilities.", "Did the CHS program receive timely notification of services  provided from a non-IHS facility? In non-emergency cases, the  local CHS program should be notified and the service approved for  payment prior to the patient receiving care. In cases where the patient  was not referred for care by an IHS provider, such as with emergency  room services, the CHS program must be notified within 72 hours of  when the service was delivered.

To be  eligible for payment under the CHS program, the service must be  considered medically necessary and listed as one of the established  IHS area\u2019s medical or dental priorities. A program committee that is  part of the local CHS program evaluates the medical necessity of the  service, for example, at a weekly meeting. IHS has established four  broad medical priority levels of health care services eligible for  payment and a fifth for excluded services that cannot be paid for with  CHS program funds. Each area is required to establish priorities that  are consistent with IHS\u2019s medical priority levels and are adapted to  the specific needs of the CHS programs in its area. CHS programs  that are affiliated with IHS-operated facilities must assign a priority  level to services based on the priority system established by their area  offices. Funds permitting, these CHS programs first pay for the  highest priority services and then for all or some of the lower priority  services they fund.

After the services are delivered, the  provider seeks approval from the CHS program for payment for the  services. With self-referrals, the steps taken by the CHS program to  evaluate the referral against the program\u2019s eligibility requirements to  determine whether the service is eligible for CHS payment do not begin  until after the service is provided. In these cases, the local CHS program  may have to communicate with the external provider, for example,  requesting information about the services provided. Similar to IHS  referrals, once the CHS program receives the needed information to  make an eligibility determination, it will approve the service for payment  and issue a purchase order to obligate the funds; defer funding the  service; or deny the service. For approved self-referral services, once the  FI receives the claim and purchase order from the external provider, it  follows the same procedures for processing the payment as for IHS  referrals.

The first of two  measures that IHS uses to assess the timeliness of the first step in the  provider payment process is the average time it takes for IHS to issue a  purchase order after a service has been provided. IHS established this  measure in fiscal year 2009 in response to GPRA, and has set annual  targets for the measure since then. GPRA requires federal agencies to  develop performance plans with annual goals and measures. (Hereafter,  we refer to this as the GPRA measure.)", "For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, IHS set the target for the GPRA measure  at 82 days and 78 days, respectively. IHS missed the target by 28 days in  2009 and by 4 days in 2010. IHS kept the target at 78 days in fiscal year  2011, then lowered it to 74 days in 2012 and met these targets in both  years. For fiscal year 2013, IHS kept the target at 74 days, and an IHS  official said it would remain there for fiscal year 2014. According to IHS  officials, the basis for the GPRA measure\u2019s target was a health care  industry consultant\u2019s report showing average times that other health  insurers, including private insurers and Medicaid, took to pay claims.", "Although clear targets have been established for the GPRA measure, the  way the measure is calculated does not result in a clear picture of  whether the goal of the measure is being achieved. In our previous work,  we found that successful performance metrics should demonstrate the  degree to which desired results are achieved.goal of the GPRA measure is to decrease the average number of days  from the provision of services to purchase order issuance. However, the  GPRA measure does not provide a clear picture of the timeliness of  purchase order issuance because it combines self-referrals with some  IHS referrals when calculating the average time it takes for IHS to issue a  purchase order, even though the timing of when purchase orders are  issued relative to service delivery can be very different for the two referral  types. The GPRA measure calculates the average time it takes to issue  purchase orders for services for which the purchase order was issued  after the service was provided. This includes all self-referrals, where none  of the work to determine whether the service is eligible for CHS payment  can be started before the service is delivered because IHS does not know  about it until after the service has been delivered. However, it also  includes some IHS referrals\u2014referrals for which all of the work to  determine whether the service is eligible for CHS payment generally is  completed before the service is delivered. Some local CHS programs said  they wait to issue purchase orders for IHS referrals until shortly after they  confirm that the services were actually delivered. Officials from one local  CHS program told us that for these referrals, it may take only one day  from the date of service to issue the purchase order. Including these IHS  referrals in the calculation of the GPRA measure gives an unclear picture  of performance because the inclusion of IHS referrals lowers the overall  GPRA average. IHS officials agreed that the calculation of the GPRA  measure mixes IHS referrals with self-referrals, and CHS officials at one  area office said the measure would be more useful if IHS and self- referrals were analyzed separately. However, IHS officials told us that  because the agency\u2019s claims data system does not include a data field  that tracks referral type, it does not have a way to separate the two  different types of referrals that would allow the agency to systematically  determine the average time it takes to issue purchase orders by referral  type.", "According to IHS, the  IHS officials expressed varying opinions about the utility and quality of the  GPRA measure. Some officials noted that before the measure was  established, there was no timeliness performance measure for the CHS  program. These officials told us that the measure has helped to identify  local CHS programs that have implemented practices that help improve  timeliness of payments. But officials also criticized the GPRA measure,  noting that many of the factors that help to determine whether an area or  local CHS program meets the target are not within the area\u2019s or the  program\u2019s control, such as how quickly a program receives information  from providers.", "The time it takes to make a decision about a claim. The other measure  that IHS uses to assess the timeliness of the first step in the provider  payment process is how long it takes from the time IHS is notified of a  claim to when the agency makes a decision about it. Under a statutory  provision, IHS must approve or deny the claim within 5 days of receiving  \u201cnotification\u201d of a provider\u2019s claim for a service or accept the claim as  valid. (Hereafter, we refer to this provision as the 5-day rule.) According  to IHS officials, the agency has interpreted the rule\u2019s clock as beginning  once a claim is \u201cclean,\u201d or \u201ccompleted,\u201d meaning that all information  necessary to determine whether the claim should be approved, deferred,  or denied has been obtained. IHS officials told us, however, that it is in  obtaining this information\u2014including medical records to determine  medical priority and the availability of alternate resources\u2014that delays  most typically occur. Thus, the 5-day rule\u2019s clock does not begin until after  completion of the part of the process in which IHS officials believe delays  most typically occur. Although IHS officials said the agency\u2019s  interpretation of the 5-day rule currently is not included in any official  written guidance, they said the agency plans to include an explanation of  its interpretation of the rule in revisions to the CHS chapter of the Indian  Health Manual, which officials said is expected to be completed by early  2014.", "The time it takes the FI to pay the claim. The third measure that IHS uses  to assess the timeliness of the payment process focuses on the last step  in the process\u2014the length of time that the FI should take to process  payments to providers once it receives claims from them. IHS\u2019s contract  with its FI specifies that at least 97 percent of clean claims are to be paid  within 30 days of receiving the claim from the provider. Similar to the   5-day rule, the FI defines clean claims as those containing all required  information, including the purchase order; passing all IHS and FI agreed- upon internal checks; and not requiring additional investigation by the FI.  The FI issues monthly reports to IHS documenting its compliance with  this provision.

Evaluating  a service against each of the service eligibility requirements involves  multiple steps, some of which depend on the CHS program receiving  information from providers, patients, and others, and delays can occur  during the evaluation of some of these eligibility requirements, according  to CHS officials. In some cases, making these eligibility determinations  can be fairly involved, and can ultimately affect the amount of time it takes  for a provider to receive payment after the service is delivered. The  effects of this process on payment times is greater for self-referrals\u2014 situations in which the service was provided before it was approved for  payment\u2014because the entire process for determining whether the  service was eligible for CHS payment does not begin until after the  service was delivered. According to IHS officials, the agency developed  the CHS program eligibility regulations in order to carefully manage and  stretch limited CHS funding to provide the most critical services to the  most patients.", "Two aspects of the process for determining eligibility for CHS program  funding were frequently reported as resulting in payment delays:   (1) determining whether a service meets the area\u2019s medical priorities and  (2) identifying all available alternate resources. Officials from 8 of 12 local  CHS programs we interviewed reported payment delays related to  determining whether a service met the area\u2019s medical priorities, and  officials from 8 of 12 local CHS programs reported payment delays  related to identifying all available alternate resources.", "Determining medical priority can result in delays because local CHS  programs must obtain from the provider medical records with sufficient  detail to assess whether a service is medically necessary and falls within  the established medical priorities. Officials reported that, while in some  cases the necessary records have been provided relatively quickly   (e.g., within a week) in other cases it has taken much longer. For  example, some local CHS programs reported situations when it has taken  weeks or months to obtain necessary medical documentation, and one  program reported situations when it has taken as long as 1 to 2 years to  receive this documentation. Program officials noted different reasons for  these delays. For example, officials reported situations where providers  have sent documentation to the wrong CHS program when the providers  were unaware in which CHSDAs the patients resided. Another reason  cited by local CHS program officials for delays in receipt of medical  documentation included situations in which incomplete documentation  was provided and the program needed to follow up with the provider.", "Officials reported a number of situations in which determining whether the  patient has alternate resources to pay for the service, has resulted in  delays. For example, some local CHS program officials told us that when  they believe a patient is eligible for alternate resources\u2014such as  Medicaid\u2014they have the patient apply for those resources, and will hold  off on approving a service for CHS funding until the determination is  made on the application. Officials from one local CHS program said that  Medicaid determinations in their state can sometimes take months. In  another example, officials from one local CHS program stated that for  situations involving car accidents or a fall on private property, determining  liability can take a long time, and availability of alternate resources cannot  be determined until decisions on liability have been determined. In  another example, officials from one CHS program said delays can occur  when patients do not inform the CHS program of the alternate resources  available to them, necessitating the CHS program doing the research  itself.", "Program officials also reported some delays related to the other three  aspects of the process for determining eligibility for CHS payment. For  example, officials from one CHS program said determining whether a  patient is a member of a federally recognized tribe can result in a delay if  they have never seen the patient before, and must obtain documentation  of that patient\u2019s tribal affiliation. Similarly, officials from one CHS program  said determining whether a patient resides in its CHSDA can result in a  delay when the program needs to wait on documentation from patients  confirming their addresses. Finally, one local CHS program reported that  determining whether the program has been notified within required  timeframes can result in a delay when an incorrect decision is made to  deny the service, which is later overturned.", "The complexity of determining whether services delivered to American  Indians and Alaska Natives are eligible for CHS funding can also result in  misunderstandings in which providers think payments have been delayed,  when in fact the services provided were not eligible for payment. For  example, IHS officials told us that sometimes patients do not understand  CHS rules and seek emergency care from external providers, expecting  the CHS program to cover it, when they are in fact not eligible for CHS.  The officials also said that providers will send claims to the CHS program,  assuming the patient and service are eligible, and expect to be paid. IHS  does not issue eligibility cards to beneficiaries that would indicate to  external providers their eligibility for CHS services or information about  which local CHS program is responsible for payment. In a previous GAO  review of the CHS program, several providers noted that, in the absence  of a process they can use prior to providing service to determine patient  eligibility for the CHS program, they submit claims for payment to the  CHS program for all patients who self-identify as American Indian or  Alaska Native or as eligible for the CHS program. IHS officials said that  they believe situations such as these\u2014in which the provider will never be  paid because the patient or service was not eligible, as opposed to  situations in which the service is eligible but the payment process is  prolonged\u2014accounted for the majority of provider complaints about the  timeliness of CHS payments.", "Local CHS program officials noted that providers\u2019 lack of understanding of  the complex CHS approval process was due in part to provider staff  turnover or was exacerbated when the provider\u2019s billing functions were  located out of state, which could result in delays in providing information  needed to determine eligibility. These officials noted that education of  provider staff was an ongoing necessity for CHS programs. Some IHS  officials also noted that providing such training took staff time away from  processing referrals. Officials from a number of CHS programs noted that  they meet regularly with some of their high-volume providers to reconcile  specific outstanding cases, and that over time these meetings have  helped improve providers\u2019 understanding of the unique rules and  procedures of the CHS program. However, officials also mentioned that  turnover among provider staff often necessitated starting the process of  educating providers again."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complexities Associated with the CHS Processes for Paying Providers Also Can Affect Timeliness", "paragraphs": ["Even after a service has been approved for CHS funding and a purchase  order has been issued, delays can occur because of complexities in the  last step in the payment process, which is managed by IHS\u2019s FI. Officials  said this can occur because the providers do not understand the CHS  process used by the FI. For example, officials said some providers do not  understand that after receiving a purchase order, they also need to  submit the claim to the FI to be paid.", "Officials from local CHS programs and from the FI also reported  examples where delays occurred because claims submitted by providers  to the FI could not be matched to a corresponding purchase order in the  FI\u2019s system. According to FI officials, it will issue only one payment for  each purchase order. However, some purchase orders are intended to  cover multiple services, such as for a series of physical therapy  treatments. FI officials reported that providers sometimes submit claims  for services that pertain to only a portion of the services authorized on the  purchase order. In these cases, the FI pays for those services and closes  out the purchase order. When providers submit subsequent claims  related to other services that were authorized on the original purchase  order, the FI is unable to pay the provider because the purchase order  was closed. The provider then must go back to the CHS program to  request a new purchase order and payment to the provider is delayed  until the new purchase order is issued and submitted to the FI.", "In addition to delays in payments to providers from issues matching  claims and purchase orders, claims may be put on hold by the FI for other  payment processing issues. One of the most common causes for claims  being put on hold by the FI is when alternate resources have been  confirmed, but the FI is waiting for information from the provider showing  the amount paid by the other resources and the remaining amount that  the provider is claiming from IHS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CHS Staffing and Funding Availability Also Can Affect Timeliness of Payments to Providers", "paragraphs": ["Local CHS program officials said insufficient CHS program staffing levels  have affected their ability to issue timely purchase orders. IHS\u2019s staffing  standards model established a staffing ratio based on the annual number  of purchase orders authorized for health care services by a facility.  Some CHS program officials noted that their number of staff was below  these standards. Further, local CHS program officials in programs that  had a very small number of CHS staff (e.g., two or three) said that a  vacancy or extended leave for even one staff person could affect the  timeliness of issuing purchase orders\u2014and one of these programs  reported that related delays could be significant. Furthermore, IHS  officials noted that, pursuant to agency practice, CHS funding has been  used only to pay for services and not to increase staffing levels. As a  result, recent increases in CHS funds have resulted in increased  workloads, but staffing levels to manage the workloads have not  increased. Staffing levels can affect the timeliness of payment for  services, particularly for self-referrals where the entire process for  determining eligibility for CHS payment does not begin until after the  service is provided.", "Officials from a few CHS programs also noted that funding issues could  result in delays issuing a purchase order authorizing CHS funding, which  would delay payments. In our prior work, some providers told us that  delays in receiving payment from CHS of several months, or in some  cases years, tended to occur when the CHS program\u2019s funding for the  fiscal year had been depleted.noted, funding shortages affect the amount of time it takes to pay  providers for self-referrals more than IHS referrals because the self- referral service is already provided before the program determines if  funds are available while for an IHS referral, the service can be  postponed until funds become available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local CHS Program Practices for Implementing CHS Eligibility Regulations Vary, which May Contribute to Variations in Timeliness for Aspects of the Provider Payment Process", "paragraphs": ["We found variation in local CHS program practices for implementing CHS  eligibility rules, which may contribute to the variation in timeliness of the  provider payment process across IHS areas. IHS officials said they allow  flexibility in local CHS program practices because each has a different set  of circumstances to consider. These circumstances include challenges  regarding CHS funding levels among areas, state Medicaid program  procedures for verifying eligibility, providers\u2019 familiarity with the CHS  program, and the number of staff available to determine CHS eligibility for  services.", "During our interviews, IHS area and local CHS program officials reported  differences in practices that could contribute to variation in the amount of  time overall it takes to pay providers. Examples of these differences  include:  Consideration of alternate resources. Local CHS programs varied  in the actions they took while they were determining the extent of  patients\u2019 alternate resources. One practice IHS area office officials  said some local CHS program staff used, in certain  circumstances, was to issue purchase orders to providers before  patients\u2019 alternate resources were confirmed. In these cases, if the  FI paid the claim before alternate resources were confirmed, the  FI would seek to recover from the provider any overpayments for  services covered by these alternate resources.", "In contrast, some IHS area and local CHS program officials told us  they do not issue purchase orders authorizing CHS payment for  services until the availability of all possible alternate resources has  been determined. Officials in one IHS area noted that they do this  to preserve their limited CHS funds and provide access to care to  as many patients as possible. Officials in this area reported that  they were not able to fund all Priority 1 cases and that issuing  purchase orders and obligating CHS funds before alternate  resources were confirmed could cause them to exhaust their CHS  funds even earlier.", "Requests for information from providers. Officials from some local  CHS programs reported that they set time limits for providers to  submit medical documents and deny CHS funding if providers do  not submit the documents within that time. These limits ranged  from a week to 45 days, and some of these programs  automatically issued a denial if the medical documentation was  not provided either at the same time the program was notified that  services had been provided or by the specified time limit. CHS  officials said these denials could be reconsidered if sufficient  medical documentation were subsequently provided. In contrast,  officials from another CHS program reported that it does not have  established time limits within which providers must submit medical  documentation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New Coverage Options in PPACA May Provide IHS an Opportunity to Simplify CHS Eligibility Rules", "paragraphs": ["New health care coverage options available to many IHS beneficiaries as  a result of provisions in PPACA could provide IHS with an opportunity to  simplify the complex eligibility rules of the CHS program. IHS has stated  that its overall service goal is to elevate the health status of American  Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest possible level. However, as we  and others have reported, limits on available resources have affected the  services available to American Indians and Alaska Natives through the  CHS program. For example, although funding for the CHS program  significantly increased in recent years, IHS has reported that at current  funding levels, most programs are approving only medically emergent  referrals (Priority 1) and less urgent, routine or preventive care is deferred  or denied pending additional appropriations. According to IHS, limits on  available funding for the CHS program have caused the agency to  establish its complex requirements for determining eligibility for CHS  funds\u2014including reliance on a medical priority rating system and limiting  eligibility to individuals who reside in CHSDAs. These mechanisms are  intended to enhance IHS\u2019s ability to stretch limited CHS dollars and  extend services to more American Indians and Alaska Natives. As we  previously reported, however, many American Indians and Alaska Natives  may gain new health care coverage beginning in 2014 as a result of  PPACA, which could alleviate some constraints on CHS program funds.", "If a better match is achieved between available funding and overall CHS  program demand, IHS could have the opportunity to streamline eligibility  requirements for the CHS program and to expand the services it pays for  with CHS funds, assuming appropriation levels for the CHS program are  maintained. Because the CHS program is generally the payer of last  resort, if more American Indians and Alaska Natives gain new coverage,  services that would have previously been paid for by the CHS program  will be paid for by other payers. In addition, because some American  Indians and Alaska Natives will have access to benefits packages through  these other coverage options\u2014benefits packages that may be more  comprehensive than the IHS benefits available to them now\u2014more may  choose to obtain care outside of the IHS system entirely. This could help  free up some CHS program funds, potentially creating a better match  between available funding and overall program demand.", "Some uncertainty remains, however, about the extent to which American  Indians and Alaska Natives will obtain new health care coverage when  PPACA is fully implemented. For example, not all states may choose to  expand their Medicaid programs. In addition, we have reported previously  on the challenges American Indians and Alaska Natives may face  enrolling in Medicaid and other public insurance programs. Some  barriers are unique to the American Indian and Alaska Native  population\u2014such as individuals believing they should not have to apply  for other public insurance programs because the federal government has  a duty to provide them with health care as a result of treaties with Indian  tribes. In our prior work, we recommended that IHS increase its direct  outreach to American Indians and Alaska Natives who may be eligible for  new coverage options to help ensure significant new enrollment in these  options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The current CHS program\u2019s eligibility requirements reflect the method that  IHS has chosen to stretch its funding to ensure that the most critical  health services can be provided to the maximum number of beneficiaries.  However, determining eligibility for CHS funding\u2014including the need to  ascertain each time a referral is received whether the patient met  residency requirements and the service met medical priorities\u2014is  inherently complex. As currently structured, it is highly unlikely that the  CHS program will be as quick a payer as some other payers because of  the cumbersome steps involved in determining eligibility for each service.", "PPACA will expand existing sources of health coverage and create new  ones for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and this could affect the  CHS program in a number of ways. In particular, if these changes  significantly reduce the demand placed on CHS program funds, IHS may  have the opportunity to not only pay for a greater range of services but  also restructure the CHS program to include less stringent eligibility  requirements. For example, increased availability of CHS funding due to  increased access among American Indians and Alaska Natives to other  sources of health care coverage options under PPACA could give IHS the  opportunity to establish a set of defined benefits for IHS beneficiaries,  which would alleviate the need for CHS programs and providers to carry  out time-consuming medical priority determinations. The opportunity also  may arise for IHS to make other changes, such as issuing a form of  eligibility card to CHS-eligible patients to help providers understand when  to send claims to IHS, and to which local CHS program a claim should be  sent, helping improve the timeliness of provider payments.", "In the interim, while the changes from PPACA are taking effect, IHS has  the opportunity to continue to make improvements to the CHS program,  including how it assesses the timeliness of provider payments and how it  aligns CHS program staffing levels with workloads, and to proactively  consider ways to streamline CHS eligibility requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to ensure that IHS has meaningful information on the  timeliness with which it issues purchase orders authorizing payment  under the CHS program and to improve the timeliness of payments to  providers, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS direct the Director of  IHS to: modify IHS\u2019s claims data system to separately track IHS referrals and  self-referrals, revise the GPRA measure for the CHS program so that  it distinguishes between these two types of referrals, and establish  separate timeframe targets for these referral types; and  improve the alignment between CHS staffing levels and workloads by  revising its current practices, where appropriate, to allow available  funds to be used to pay for CHS program staff.", "In addition, as HHS and IHS monitor the effect that new coverage options  available to IHS beneficiaries through PPACA have on CHS program  funds, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS direct the Director of  IHS to proactively develop potential options to streamline program  eligibility requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and received written  comments, which are reprinted in appendix I.

We acknowledge the difficult challenges and choices faced by  CHS programs when program funds are not sufficient to pay for all  needed services.
