To determine the reliability of  these data, we manually checked the data for missing values and also  reviewed information about the data\u2019s collection. In addition, we  interviewed Advocacy Center staff about the data. Advocacy Center  staff told us that data from before 2010, when the center began using  a new database, may be incomplete because data for some contracts  that were closed before 2010 may not have been transferred to the  new database. Overall, we found the Advocacy Center data to be  reliable for reporting on competition between U.S. and other firms,  including Chinese firms, in Indonesia and Vietnam.", "The World Bank publishes data on the value, sector, and suppliers of  its contracts in Indonesia and Vietnam. We used the World Bank\u2019s  classification of contracts into procurement categories (goods, civil  works, consultant services, and nonconsultant services) to compare  the value and types of contracts that U.S. and Chinese firms won from  2001 through 2014.

ADB only publishes data for  consulting contracts over $0.1 million in value and other contracts  over $1.0 million, so our analysis of ADB contracts does not include  some smaller ADB contracts. In addition, a portion of the ADB data  did not have the contracts classified according to the nature of the  contract (construction, consulting services, goods, turnkey, and  others). Therefore, we classified contracts won by U.S. and Chinese  firms that were missing these categories according to those used in  the rest of the data. To determine the reliability of these data, we  checked the data for missing values and other types of discrepancies.

Reasons for the differences include differences in the  valuation of goods, differences in data quality, and the omission of  some ASEAN trading partners from UN Comtrade data.
