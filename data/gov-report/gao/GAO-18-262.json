This report addresses, among other things, the extent to which (1) NASA's Inspector General investigated contractor and grantee whistleblower reprisal complaints; (2) NASA's Administrator reviewed reprisal complaints in a timely manner; and (3) NASA communicated the applicable whistleblower reprisal protections to contractors. GAO reviewed NASA and its Inspector General's policies and guidance; reviewed a generalizable sample of 100 contracts from all NASA centers with contracts in fiscal year 2016; and interviewed relevant officials and contractors, grantees, and advocacy groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 2008 through June 2017, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contractor and grantee employees submitted 48 reprisal complaints such as alleged firing or demotion for reporting fraud, waste, or abuse within the government. NASA's Inspector General addressed all 48 complaints, completed investigations for 6 of those complaints, and forwarded investigation reports to the NASA Administrator, who is responsible for making a final determination of whether reprisal occurred. The Administrator determined that none of the complaints qualified for protection under the law.", "Further, in 5 of the 6 cases forwarded by the OIG, the Administrator was required by statute to make a final determination of reprisal within 30 days. GAO found that the Administrator did not meet this required time frame for all 5 cases and had no documented response for one of them (see figure for all 5 cases). According to officials from NASA's Office of General Counsel, each case must be handled on a case by case basis to ensure due process and 30 days is insufficient time to issue an order of final determination of reprisal. However, in order to ensure that whistleblower reprisal complaints are handled within required timeframes, NASA would have to monitor and evaluate its processes for making final determinations of reprisal, but it has not yet taken this step. Consequently, NASA does not know what changes may be needed to ensure that it is meeting the statutory 30-day requirement.", "NASA communicates whistleblower protections to contractors through inclusion of a required contract clause. For example, GAO found that almost all\u201498 percent\u2014of contracts would be expected to include a whistleblower clause as required by statute. However, certain elements of NASA whistleblower protection guidance have contributed to a different understanding of reprisal protections among officials at headquarters, a NASA center, and the Inspector General. For example, a July 2014 procurement notice and contract clause language resulted in different interpretations about when the protections apply. Federal internal control standards require that an entity should communicate necessary quality information internally to meet the objectives of its mission. Without additional clarity in its guidance on when the protections apply, NASA centers and procurement officials will be at risk of inconsistent implementation of the law."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to NASA, including evaluating the process for reviewing reprisal complaints to ensure it is meeting the required timeframe and clarifying guidance on when protections apply to contractor employees.

Agencies also need to make a formal determination on  whether reprisal occurred. Employees of contractors and grantees  conduct a significant amount of work for the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA). Given the sometimes enormous safety  risks involved in space exploration, having an established process in  place to investigate reprisal claims helps ensure NASA is able to act  quickly whenever a whistleblower reports experiencing reprisal. In fiscal  year 2016, NASA obligated over $18 billion in contracts to support  acquisitions such as satellites and the construction of a solar plant; and  more than $1 billion in grants for things such as science, technology,  engineering, and math education initiatives and a student stipend for  space-related research.", "Although some protections for contractor employee whistleblowers have  existed for years, section 2409 of Title 10, U.S. code (the statute), was  amended in 2008, 2013, and 2014 to give contractor and grantee  employee whistleblowers at NASA enhanced protection from reprisal. The  statute establishes that an employee of a contractor, subcontractor,  grantee, subgrantee, or personal services contractor may not be subject  to reprisal for disclosing certain whistleblower complaints to certain  authorities.", "You asked us to evaluate NASA\u2019s implementation of whistleblower  reprisal protections. This report addresses the extent to which (1) NASA\u2019s  Inspector General has investigated contractor and grantee whistleblower  reprisal complaints, including meeting statutory timeliness requirements,  and developed guidance for the investigations; (2) NASA\u2019s Administrator  meets statutory timeliness requirements to review reprisal complaints; (3)  NASA communicated externally and internally about the applicable  contractor whistleblower reprisal protections; and (4) NASA  communicated with grantees the applicable whistleblower reprisal  protections.", "To assess the extent to which NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG)  investigated reprisal complaints and developed guidance for the  investigations, and the NASA Administrator met timeliness requirements,  we obtained NASA guidance and relevant documentation. We conducted  interviews with agency officials, including officials from the OIG and the  Office of General Counsel on behalf of the Administrator about their  processes and practices to conduct duties outlined in the statute. We  reviewed data provided by the NASA OIG on the total number of  whistleblower allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, misconduct, or  mismanagement and reprisal complaints; the number of contractor and  grantee employee whistleblower allegations and reprisal complaints; and  the outcomes or decisions reached by the OIG of a reprisal complaint  from fiscal years 2008, the year the enhanced protections were put in  place, through 2017. We assessed the reliability of these data by asking  the NASA OIG to describe the source(s) of information used and steps  taken to identify the numbers provided, and limitations and caveats that  would affect our use of these data\u2014such as the data being self-reported  by the OIG and Administrator. Based on these steps, we determined the  data to be sufficient for our purposes of determining the extent to which  the complaints were addressed.", "To assess the extent to which NASA communicates whistleblower  protections externally, to contractors and grantees, we identified new  fiscal year 2016 contract awards over $300,000 as reported in the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). We  selected contracts that were not only over the simplified acquisition  threshold (generally $150,000), but were over $300,000 to account for  possible exceptions and to ensure that we were sampling contracts that  would be required to include a whistleblower reprisal clause. To  determine whether the required NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) Supplement clause 1852.203-71 (NFS clause) or other potentially  applicable clauses were included in NASA contracts, we selected for  review a generalizable random sample of 100 contracts from a total of  270 contracts. The sample is projectable to NASA fiscal year 2016  contracts; however, making a legal determination of compliance would  require a case by case review, which we did not do for contracts not in  our sample. The 100 contracts consist of a random selection of 10  contracts from each NASA center that awarded new contracts in fiscal  year 2016; for those centers that did not have 10 contracts, we selected  all contracts. The remaining contracts were pulled from NASA Shared  Services Center (NSSC), because that center does the most contracting.  We estimated the percent of NASA contracts expected to include  whistleblower clause(s) as the weighted average of results from the 10  contracting centers. Additionally, we selected a non-generalizable random  sample of 10 grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 for review to  determine whether NASA grants included a mechanism notifying grantee  employees of their whistleblower rights and reprisal protections. For both  the sample of contracts and grants, we conducted data reliability checks  by comparing the data to the documentation and concluded the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes to determine if relevant whistleblower  reprisal protections information was communicated externally.", "To assess internal communication about whistleblower protections, we  reviewed relevant documentation, including guidance, and conducted  interviews with procurement officials, NASA Headquarters, NASA\u2019s Office  of General Counsel, and Chief Counsels at Johnson Space Center (JSC),  NSSC, and Marshall Space Flight Center.

Officials said that if a clause were included in the templates, it is unlikely  that it would be removed because doing so would require supervisory  approval.", "NASA procurement officials told us that the agency launched a new  contract writing system in June 2017. They said that under the new  contract writing system, contracting officers use a logic system that  prepopulates each contract with required clauses.

Later, the  attorney from the center Chief Counsel\u2019s office revised his understanding  of the statute and concluded the procurement notice was not accurate as  written.", "Second, NASA personnel have different understandings about whether  the NFS clause is sufficient for contractor employees to be covered by the  statute. The NFS clause instructs contractors to inform their employees in  writing of contractor whistleblower employee rights; but, unlike the FAR  clause that is used to implement similar legislation for other agencies, the  NFS clause does not state that employees working on the contract are  subject to the whistleblower rights and remedies. The attorney from a  NASA center said that the NFS clause is enough to ensure contractor  employees are given rights under the statute. However, OIG officials have  said that without including that element of the clause, employees working  under NASA contracts awarded prior to the effective date of the 2013  amendments may not be covered by those amendments. See table 2 for  description of the clauses and their differences.", "Third, the lack of agency-wide guidance for when to include the clause in  major modifications leads to different implementation of the requirement.  The 2013 amendments require that NASA makes best efforts to include a  whistleblower clause in contracts undergoing a major modification.

Procurement officials and the contracting officers we  spoke with told us that there is no definition of major modifications in the  law, regulation, or NASA Headquarters or Center policies or guidance.  NASA procurement officials said this is because it could be different for  each contract and the contracting officer makes the determination based  upon the facts related to the situation.

We  also reviewed the number of contractor and grantee employee  whistleblower allegations and reprisal complaints provided by the OIG  and the outcomes or decisions reached by the OIG of a reprisal complaint  from fiscal years 2008 through 2017. We assessed the reliability of these  data by asking the NASA OIG to describe the source(s) of information  used and steps taken to identify the numbers provided, and limitations  and caveats that would affect GAO\u2019s use of the data\u2014such as the data  being self-reported by the OIG and Office of General Counsel. Based on  these steps, we determined the data to be sufficient for our purposes of  determining how the complaints were addressed. Additionally, we  reviewed relevant documentation to assess the extent to which the NASA  OIG was conducting investigations and communicating findings to the  NASA Administrator within required time frames. To determine the extent  NASA OIG developed guidance, we interviewed or obtained written  answers from OIG officials about their processes and practices for  investigating whistleblower reprisal complaints. We reviewed the  guidance and training and other materials that NASA OIG uses to  implement whistleblower protection investigations. We also visited  Johnson Space Center (JSC)\u2014selected because it had the highest  number of reprisal cases from 2008 through 2017\u2014to discuss policies  and procedures specific to that center with OIG investigators and the OIG  program manager for whistleblower protections. Because they are also a  part of the Investigators\u2019 Central Field Office, we also spoke with  investigators at Marshall Space Flight Center and Kennedy Space  Center.", "To assess the extent to which NASA\u2019s Administrator meets the statutory  timeliness requirements to review reprisal complaints, we reviewed the  timeliness of the Administrator\u2019s final determination to ensure that NASA  was meeting statutory requirements. Specifically, we reviewed relevant  documentation to assess the extent to which the Administrator was  making final determination of reprisal in 30 days\u2014the required review  period specified by statute. We reviewed the Administrator\u2019s  documentation on the final disposition of reprisal investigations and  compared the date of the Administrator\u2019s final decision to the date of  receipt of the reprisal investigations from the NASA OIG. We also  conducted interviews with the Office of General Counsel, who spoke on  behalf of the Administrator.", "To assess the extent to which NASA communicated the applicable  whistleblower reprisal protections externally with contractors, we reviewed  a generalizable sample of NASA contracts to determine the extent a  required whistleblower clause was included. We used the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to generate a  sample of contract actions over $300,000 that were awarded by NASA in  fiscal year 2016. We selected contracts that were not only over the  simplified acquisition threshold (generally $150,000), but were over  $300,000 to account for possible exceptions and to ensure that we were  sampling contracts that would be required to include a whistleblower  reprisal clause. From the 270 contracts identified, for purposes of  examining the inclusion of NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement (NFS) clause 1852.203-71 (or other potentially applicable  clauses) in NASA contracts, a legal requirement, we selected a  generalizable random sample of 100 contracts. The sample is projectable  to NASA fiscal year 2016 contracts; however, we did not make a case by  case legal determination for contracts not in our sample. We randomly  selected 10 contracts from each center that awarded new contracts in  2016, and for those centers that did not have 10 contracts, we selected all  contracts. The remaining contracts were then pulled from the NASA  Shared Services Center (NSSC) because that center does a majority of  NASA\u2019s contracting. We asked for contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016  to ensure we were sampling contracts that are required to have the  clause and would be reasonably accessible by NASA. We excluded  interagency contracts and task or delivery orders awarded using blanket  purchase agreements to ensure we sampled base contracts awarded by  NASA, not other agencies.", "We estimated the percentage of NASA contracts expected to include  whistleblower clause(s) as the weighted average of results from the 10  contracting centers. Because we followed a probability procedure based  on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of  samples that could have been drawn. Because each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express the uncertainty associated with  any particular estimate as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the  interval that, with repeated sampling, would be expected to contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that this confidence  interval contains the true percentage of contracts expected to include  whistleblower clause(s); however, to assess legal compliance we would  have to make a case by case determination, which we did not do. We  conducted data reliability checks on the FPDS-NG dataset by comparing  it to contract documentation obtained from contract files and determined it  was sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Additionally, we conducted  interviews with NASA procurement officials and contracting officers at  multiple locations including NASA Headquarters, NSSC and JSC to  discuss any additional measures NASA takes to communicate  whistleblower protections to its contractors and their contractor  employees. To further assess internal communication, we reviewed  relevant documentation, including guidance, and conducted interviews  with procurement officials, NASA\u2019s Office of General Counsel, and Chief  Counsels at JSC, NSSC, and Marshall Space Flight Center.", "To assess the extent to which NASA communicated the applicable  whistleblower reprisal protections with grantees, we reviewed a non- generalizable sample of grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 to  determine whether NASA grants included a mechanism notifying  grantees of their employees\u2019 whistleblower rights and reprisal protections.  We used FPDS-NG to identify a non-generalizable random sample of 10  grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 for review to determine  whether any of the selected grants included a mechanism to  communicate whistleblower reprisal protections to grantee employees.  We conducted data reliability checks on the FPDS-NG data by comparing  it to grant documentation obtained from grant awards and determined it  was sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Additionally, we conducted  interviews with NASA grant making officials to discuss any additional  measures NASA takes to communicate whistleblower reprisal protections  to its grantees and their grantee employees.", "Finally, in order to learn about contractor and grantee experiences during  NASA\u2019s implementation of enhanced whistleblower protections, we  conducted interviews with or received written answers to questions from a  selected group of NASA contractors and grantees. Using FPDS-NG data,  we selected institutions with the highest and lowest contracts (including  small business contracts) and grants by obligations in 2016. Using these  selection criteria, we selected three contractors and three grantees to  meet with based on the amount of funds obligated in 2016. We ultimately  interviewed or obtained written answers from all selected contractors and  grantees. Additionally, we spoke with two advocacy groups, one about  grants and one about contracts.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 to March 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
