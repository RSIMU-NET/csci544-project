Ex-Im uses a screening process to identify projects with the most potential to have an adverse economic impact, and then subjects the identified projects to detailed analysis. A negative finding could result in a denial of Ex-Im support. The screens--either explicitly required by Ex-Im's charter or introduced under the bank's statutory authority--include whether (1) the financed project will increase foreign production, (2) there are trade measures against the resulting product, (3) the resulting product is \"undersupplied,\" (4) the requested financing is over $10 million, and (5) the financed project will increase foreign production by 1 percent or more of U.S. production. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2005, this screening process identified 20 projects (out of 771 applicable) that required a detailed economic impact analysis. In the detailed analysis, Ex-Im assesses whether the resulting product would be in surplus on world markets or in competition with U.S. production. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2005, Ex-Im approved most projects applicable for economic impact analysis, totaling approximately $6.1 billion in approved financing. GAO found challenges and areas for improvement in the screening and detailed analysis of projects for economic impact. The effectiveness of the $10 million screen, introduced under Ex-Im's statutory authority, is uncertain. Ex-Im has not determined whether it removes from review those projects that could meet the statutory definition of substantial injury (producing 1 percent or more of U.S. production in an industry). For example, a $9.9 million financing request that would allow a foreign company to produce an estimated 3.5 percent of U.S. production was screened out of the analysis. GAO also found that Ex-Im could improve some methods it uses in its detailed analyses, such as how it estimates displaced production. In addition, GAO found that Ex-Im could clarify how it characterizes the effect of its financing on the U.S. trade balance. Finally, GAO found that Ex-Im could strengthen the internal controls it uses to ensure that the screening process and detailed analysis are conducted consistently and accurately. GAO also found limitations in the transparency of Ex-Im's economic impact process. While Ex-Im publicly posts its procedures, they contain areas of ambiguity. For example, the procedures do not define the term \"oversupply.\" Also, Ex-Im has not provided all public comments to the board of directors.

Over time,  Congress has recognized that Ex-Im\u2019s support of exports by U.S. firms in  certain sectors could potentially adversely impact U.S. firms in other  sectors. Congress requires Ex-Im to assess whether its financial support  for a project would likely cause substantial injury to U.S. industry or  would result in the production of a good that is subject to a relevant trade  measure. A finding that would lead to either of these outcomes could  result in a denial of Ex-Im support. In reauthorizing Ex-Im in 2002,  Congress reiterated its concerns about potential adverse economic  impacts on U.S. producers by increasing the bank\u2019s economic impact  assessment requirements. Although Ex-Im created a multistep process to  determine what impact the projects it finances could have on the U.S.  economy, Congress continued to be concerned that these procedures did  not ensure that projects were adequately identified, analyzed, or disclosed.  In December 2006, Congress again revised the economic impact  assessment to require more information disclosure. Congress remains  interested in how Ex-Im assesses the impact that its services have on the  competitiveness of U.S. producers.", "In this context, we reviewed (1) Ex-Im\u2019s overall policies and procedures  for determining economic impact; (2) the extent to which Ex-Im\u2019s  procedures provide for the identification and appropriate analysis of  projects that could potentially cause adverse economic impact; and (3) the  extent to which its policies, procedures, and decisions are transparent to  interested and affected parties.", "To assess Ex-Im\u2019s policies and procedures for identifying applications for  a detailed economic impact analysis, we obtained and analyzed data on  applications that were applicable for economic impact analysis from fiscal  years 2003 through 2005, and discussed these data and Ex-Im\u2019s screening  process with Ex-Im officials. To describe Ex-Im\u2019s process for conducting  detailed economic analyses, we reviewed the 17 economic impact analyses  that Ex-Im completed between fiscal years 2002 and 2006 in light of their  procedures as they were written in response to the 2002 reauthorization.  We chose 5 detailed analyses to review in greater depth, reflecting a range  of countries, industries, and economic issues. We discussed those analyses  with officials from Ex-Im and other U.S. government agencies. We also  reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s updated procedures, created in April 2007 in response to  the 2006 reauthorization. To assess the transparency of Ex-Im\u2019s economic  impact assessment process, we reviewed relevant documentation and  interviewed officials from agencies that provide comments on Ex-Im\u2019s  draft economic impact analyses and representatives from affected  industries.

It operates as an independent agency of the U.S. government  with a staff of approximately 370 full-time permanent employees. Ex-Im\u2019s  core mission is to support U.S. exports and jobs by providing export  financing that is competitive with the official export financing support  offered by other governments. To accomplish its mission, Ex-Im offers a  variety of financing instruments, including loan guarantees, export credit  insurance, and working capital guarantees for preexport financing.  Between fiscal years 2003 and 2005, Ex-Im processed a yearly average of  3,055 requests for loans, guarantees, and insurance. Of the processed  applications, Ex-Im approved an average of 2,981 applications   (or 98 percent) per year.", "In general, Ex-Im\u2019s charter prohibits the bank from extending financing for  a project if doing so will adversely affect U.S. industry. Ex-Im tests for  adverse effects by (1) reviewing projects for applicable trade sanctions  and (2) conducting its own economic impact analysis. For this economic  impact analysis, the charter provides that, if a commodity for export  resulting from Ex-Im financing will compete with U.S. production of the  same, similar, or competing commodity, or will be in surplus on world  markets at the time of first production, Ex-Im must determine whether  extending the financing will cause substantial injury to U.S. producers.  (The charter defines \u201csubstantial injury\u201d as the establishment or expansion  of foreign production capacity equal to or exceeding 1 percent of U.S.  production.) However, under its charter, Ex-Im may fund a project if, in  the judgment of the board of directors, the short- and long-term benefits to  industry and employment in the United States are likely to outweigh the  injury to U.S. producers and employment of the same, similar, or  competing commodity. This can put Ex-Im in the challenging position of  balancing the interests of two different industries\u2014the industry of the U.S.  exporter it is financing and the industry that may face additional  competition as a result of the initial export (see fig. 1).", "Economic impact is one of many factors Ex-Im considers when  determining whether to finance a project.

However, unlike Ex-Im, these export credit agencies  are not required to weigh the potential economic costs to domestic  industries against the benefits associated with a specific financed export.  Furthermore, these agencies do not consider the relevance of trade  measures to a project, as Ex-Im is required to do. In its 2005  competitiveness report, Ex-Im states that having to consider these  additional elements, such as the economic impact, when deciding whether  to finance a project puts Ex-Im at a disadvantage compared with other  export credit agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Impact Analysis Screening Process Identifies Projects for Detailed Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im\u2019s economic impact analysis screening process is designed to  identify projects with the most potential to adversely impact U.S. industry;  Ex-Im then conducts a detailed analysis of those projects.

According to a senior Ex-Im official, Ex-Im  selected $10 million as the threshold because that figure is used for a  variety of other bank purposes, including whether applications should be  reviewed by the board of directors or should receive an environmental  assessment. The official also stated that the use of this threshold is  reasonable for the economic impact process because $10 million financing  is likely to result in little foreign production and, therefore, is not likely to  adversely impact the U.S. economy.

Ex-Im officials stated  that requests for financing $10 million or less would generally be too small  to increase foreign production by 1 percent or more of U.S. production.  However, Ex-Im has not conducted an analysis to support that the   $10 million threshold captures the appropriate projects. In theory, even a  relatively small export of capital goods or services could be used to  produce 1 percent or more of production in a small U.S. industry. More  generally, the dollar value of a capital good project can be an imperfect  signal of the size of the project in terms of its production as a percentage  of the corresponding U.S. industry. For example, Ex-Im estimated that a  $14 million export of equipment to Russia would allow production of  polystyrene to expand by 1.4 percent of U.S. polystyrene production. In  contrast, Ex-Im estimated that a $16.25 million export of mining equipment  to Japan would allow a foreign company to produce roughly 14.6 percent  of annual titanium production in the United States.", "We learned of or identified two requests for financing less than $10 million  whose projects were associated with estimated foreign production of over  1 percent of U.S. production in an industry; data limitations did not allow  us to do a thorough review of projects with a financed value of $10 million  or less. First, an export of $9.9 million of ethanol dehydration equipment  to Trinidad would allow a foreign company to produce an estimated   3.5 percent of U.S. production of anhydrous ethanol. We learned of the  ethanol project because Congress required Ex-Im to conduct a  postapproval detailed analysis in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2004. Second, we identified a $9.8 million export of mining equipment that  would allow a foreign company to produce an estimated 1.73 percent of  production in a U.S. industry. We identified the mining project when we  attempted to sample 10 applications requesting financing for $10 million or  less, from a universe of 80 applications between $5 and $10 million, to  examine whether they resulted in foreign production equal to or greater  than 1 percent of U.S. production in an industry. Of the 10 capital good  exports in our sample, Ex-Im could provide information on the amount of  production for 2\u20141 of which was the $9.8 million mining project that we  have previously described. Thus, we were largely unable to determine the  extent to which Ex-Im\u2019s $10 million threshold screened out applications  that would have met the 1 percent substantial injury test. The mining  project and the ethanol project, while treated in accordance with Ex-Im\u2019s  procedure to exclude requests for financing $10 million or less from  detailed economic impact analysis, indicate that requests of $10 million or  less can be associated with production of over 1 percent of a  corresponding U.S. industry.

To calculate displaced  production, Ex-Im must define the relevant industry, determine the  regional or global markets in which there could be competition with   U.S. producers, and collect trade and consumption data that are based on  those markets. One case where Ex-Im officials noted challenges in  obtaining the appropriate product data concerned a project supporting a  denim plant in Turkey. To estimate potential displacement of U.S. denim  exports, Ex-Im used data on U.S. exports of high-cotton-content denim (to  reflect the Turkish manufacturer\u2019s plan to produce \u201chigh-end\u201d jeans).  However, Ex-Im stated there was a lack of data on broader supply-and- demand factors for this denim\u2014such as global capacity utilization for  denim plants\u2014and, thus, Ex-Im relied on projections for the price of jeans  because 85 percent of all denim is used to produce jeans. In addition, an  analysis of a semiconductor production facility in Singapore also  illustrates market definition challenges. Ex-Im identified a type of \u201cleading  edge\u201d semiconductor as the relevant product market, but also noted that  because of the on-demand nature of production in the facility, it was  difficult to conduct a trade flow analysis or determine potential  displacement of semiconductors made in the United States. Defining the  industry appropriately and collecting data to match that definition is an  inherent challenge in conducting an analysis of this kind.", "More broadly, the full economic impact on U.S. industries of projects  financed by Ex-Im depends on determinations or assumptions regarding  what would happen in the absence of the financing. For Ex-Im, predicting  these effects can involve determining or making assumptions regarding   (1) what would happen to U.S. productive resources if Ex-Im\u2019s financing  for a project did not exist or (2) how global prices would evolve if new  capacity were not added. Foreign competition for financing could also  have implications for what would happen in the absence of Ex-Im  financing. For example, if Ex-Im denied financing, the borrower might  seek financing from another country\u2019s export credit agency, resulting in  similar capacity being added abroad without the use of U.S. goods or  services. However, because foreign competition for financing can exist for  many projects, a senior Ex-Im official noted that the application of this  rationale would risk undercutting other economic impact provisions. In  contrast, if a particular U.S. exporter would supply a foreign producer  whether Ex-Im financed the project or not, then those exports would not  be in addition to what would happen without Ex-Im support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculation and Presentation of Some Potential Costs Could Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["There are limitations in certain assumptions that Ex-Im has made to  estimate potential costs to U.S. producers related to displaced production  that is spread over time or lower prices for U.S. competitors, which are  important elements of the detailed economic impact analyses.", "Calculation of Displaced U.S. Production  There are limitations and inconsistencies in how Ex-Im has calculated  displaced U.S. production that is spread out over time. In measuring the  potential cost of Ex-Im financing to U.S. industries, Ex-Im staff generally  begin by estimating the annual level of displaced production in specific  countries where U.S. production is expected to compete with the  production supported by the Ex-Im loan or guarantee. This estimate is  based on how much of the increased foreign production will be sold to  countries that U.S. producers also supply, and on the current U.S. market  share in those countries. While Ex-Im rightly considers both the present  and future costs and benefits of its projects, we identified limitations and  inconsistencies in its estimates\u2014including its assumptions regarding   (1) whether displacement, when it occurs, will happen every year or every  other year and (2) how Ex-Im accounts for expected growth in global  demand for a product in its estimates of displaced production\u2014that can  reduce or eliminate the amount of displaced production as initially  estimated. These assumptions can, in some cases, significantly affect  estimates of displaced production and, hence, net economic impact.  Importantly, OMB notes that in cost-benefit analyses, major assumptions  should be varied to determine how sensitive outcomes are to changes in  the assumptions.", "Ex-Im has sometimes used an every-other-year method of calculating  displaced production that occurs over time. Assuming that U.S. production  would be displaced only every other year can significantly reduce  estimates of displaced production as compared with an annual approach;  it can reduce the estimated displaced production by close to half. In one  2005 case where Ex-Im used this approach, it estimated a net-positive  trade impact with increased exports of $14.9 million and displaced  production of $9.8 million over 8.5 years. Assuming every year  displacement would have yielded a net negative impact. In a 2006 analysis,  estimated costs were reduced from $221,000 to $123,000 by assuming that  displacement would occur every other year, although in that case the  estimated value of exports was substantially higher than the estimated  displacement, so the assumption did not change the net trade effect  estimate. Ex-Im has explained the use of every-other-year discounting on  varying grounds, including normal supply-and-demand cycles and regular  cyclical fluctuations in the industry. However, such cyclical fluctuations  are not likely to reduce the level of displaced production relative to what  would occur without Ex-Im\u2019s financing, because the cyclical variation is  not induced by the additional capacity supported by Ex-Im. In contrast,  Ex-Im did not use an every-other-year approach to displaced production in  a case where it characterized the industry as cyclical.", "Ex-Im has assumed in some analyses that growing demand for the  commodities it is analyzing would eliminate the initial amount of displaced  production it estimated. For example, in an analysis of a potential facility  to increase foreign production of polypropylene, Ex-Im assumed that an  estimated $83 million in displaced U.S. production over 8 years would not  actually be displaced because of growing global demand for  polypropylene. However, this implicitly assumes that, in the absence of  Ex-Im support for the larger facility, U.S. production would not have  expanded on its own to take advantage of that growing demand.  Therefore, Ex-Im\u2019s estimate of displaced production will be highly  sensitive to assumptions regarding how U.S. producers would meet  growing world demand if new Ex-Im-supported capacity did not exist.   Ex-Im made similar assumptions\u2014that growing demand would offset  potential displaced production\u2014in an analysis of flat glass production in  Mexico. Officials at one agency from which Ex-Im solicits comments  stated that these assumptions were very optimistic, and that a sensitivity  analysis would be appropriate.", "Potential Costs Related to Lower Prices  Ex-Im\u2019s method of estimating displaced production does not adequately  acknowledge the potential costs to U.S. producers in some cases as a  result of lower global prices. Ex-Im\u2019s methodology for estimating the  economic losses to U.S. competitors does not capture indirect costs that  are transmitted through changes in global market prices. As we have  previously noted, the estimate of displaced production is focused on  specific countries in which U.S. firms are expected to directly compete  with the new foreign production. However, some costs to U.S. firms may  come in the form of lower prices for homogeneous globally traded  commodities, instead of directly displaced production. These price  changes could occur even in markets where there is no direct competition  with the Ex-Im-supported foreign production, and should be  acknowledged even if they cannot be calculated precisely. An official from  one of the agencies that Ex-Im consults on economic impact also stated  that one cannot necessarily assume that an increase in production in a  single region will not affect global prices.", "For example, in a detailed analysis of the economic impact of a plant in  Egypt that would produce ammonia, Ex-Im\u2019s estimate of the costs to  domestic producers may not have captured the potential effect of lower  global prices on those producers. Ex-Im stated that output from this plant  was not expected to directly compete with U.S. ammonia exports.  However, the United States procures ammonia globally and, therefore, is  not insulated from even distant changes in market conditions. In  comments provided to Ex-Im, industry officials also noted that because  ammonia is a commodity, any increase in global supply would drive down  prices. Similarly, in a detailed analysis of the economic impact of a plant in  Israel that would produce polypropylene, Ex-Im focused on potential  losses to U.S. producers in specific export markets. However, Ex-Im also  noted in the analysis that polypropylene is a \u201cbulk commodity that is  widely traded and can easily be transported worldwide.\u201d This suggests that  additional polypropylene capacity abroad could reduce the polypropylene  prices faced by U.S. producers, even if they are not in direct regional  competition with the new production.", "There are a number of potential techniques, which vary in complexity, to  estimate or characterize the potential impact of certain types of Ex-Im  financing on global prices. The United States International Trade  Commission often uses sophisticated and resource-intensive economic  models to estimate an array of effects of changes in U.S. trade policies on,  among other things, the prices faced by U.S. producers. However, other  less complicated and less resource-intensive techniques could be used to  approximate the impact of global supply changes on prices. According to  OMB guidance, an enumeration of the different types of costs and benefits  can be helpful in identifying the full range of potential effects, and, in  addition, analyses should include a statement of the strengths and  weaknesses of assumptions. Ex-Im officials stated that the separate  assessment of oversupply should address some of these price effects.  However, while the oversupply analysis may indicate the overall direction  of global prices, it is not intended to measure the impact of Ex-Im- supported production on global prices or the potential effect of relatively  lower prices on U.S. producers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characterization of Financing Effect on Trade Balance Can Be Clarified", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im\u2019s characterization of its net trade flow analysis as reflecting impacts  on the overall U.S. trade balance is misleading and can be clarified.

In its economic impact memorandums concerning  its detailed analyses, Ex-Im generally presents the amount of this  estimated net impact as a change in the U.S. trade balance, stating that the  trade balance will \u201cimprove\u201d by the full dollar value of the exports it  finances, less lost production. This characterization is misleading because  the incremental impact of Ex-Im financing is likely to be less than the total  value of those exports. Economists generally agree that the aggregate  trade balance is largely determined by macroeconomic factors, especially  the domestic balance between savings and investment. Thus, the  incremental impact of Ex-Im financing is likely to be much smaller than  the total value of U.S. exports supported by Ex-Im or the total value of  displaced production.

However, Ex-Im applied proportionality and found that its  share of the project financing equaled only 4.5 percent of project costs\u2014 therefore, Ex-Im financing was associated with about $34 million in  potential indirect lost opportunity costs. This use of proportionality  yielded a net positive impact of $134 million.

Using standard calculations, foreign production would have  increased by 3.5 percent of U.S. production.

The  additional steps could include, for example, selectively reviewing  transactions that would affect relatively small U.S. industries or sensitive  sectors.", "Create specific methodological guidelines for staff analyzing applications  for economic impact, bearing in mind relevant OMB guidance where  appropriate.", "Review and strengthen internal controls concerning the economic impact  analysis to ensure, for example, that staff members conducting the  analyses have sufficient training and guidance in Ex-Im\u2019s economic impact  methodology, that relevant Ex-Im staff verify and approve the analyses,  and that sufficient documentation is maintained to record key information.", "To improve the public transparency of the economic impact process for  interested and affected parties, we also recommend that the Chairman of  the Export-Import Bank of the United States take the following three  steps:    Clarify publicly available procedures by including more information  regarding Ex-Im\u2019s methodology for analyzing applications, such as  defining how it incorporates \u201coversupply\u201d determinations in its analysis  and what measures it uses and specifying under what conditions  \u201cproportionality\u201d would be used.", "Inform interested parties about the sensitive sector list by including a  reference to the list in the economic impact procedures.", "Publish either individually, or in the publicly available board minutes, the  final determinations regarding whether a project would have a positive or  negative impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Export-Import Bank of the United  States. Ex-Im generally concurred with our recommendations and stated  that it will continue to explore feasible ways to improve the economic  impact procedures and make the process more consistent and user- friendly. Ex-Im stated that it will (1) review the $10 million threshold to  ensure that it satisfies its intended function; (2) enhance existing quality  assurance measures by attempting to standardize staff training and to  expand document maintenance; and (3) clarify the basis for an assessment  of \u201coversupply,\u201d and create criteria for using \u201cproportionality.\u201d In addition,  Ex-Im agreed to seek to incorporate our suggestions as it refines its  analytic methodology, but the bank noted that a single approach would  not address the diversity of transactions it considers. We acknowledge  that a single approach is not necessarily appropriate for all analyses, but  we believe that a consistent set of methodological principles, such as  those embodied in OMB guidance, would nevertheless enhance the  economic impact analysis process. Lastly, Ex-Im agreed that increased  transparency and predictability will improve the economic impact process  and notes that it has amended its economic impact procedures to reflect  increased transparency requirements laid out in the Export-Import Bank  Reauthorization Act of 2006. We believe that the process\u2019s transparency  and predictability can be further improved by several practices, such as  referring to the sensitive sector list in the procedures and publishing the  bank\u2019s determination regarding whether a project will have a positive or  negative net impact. Ex-Im also provided technical comments, which we  have incorporated where appropriate.

In addition, Ex-Im did not have complete data for  fiscal year 2006 projects at the time of our review.

To determine the effectiveness of the   $10 million threshold, we attempted to judgmentally sample 10  applications that requested financing for capital good exports between   $5 and $10 million. However, our ability to do so was limited because Ex- Im could provide the relevant information for only 2 of the 10 projects. We  reviewed 17 detailed economic impact analyses and documentation  related to some applications that had not received a detailed analysis, and  conducted interviews with Ex-Im officials on the 5 analyses that we chose  as case studies.
