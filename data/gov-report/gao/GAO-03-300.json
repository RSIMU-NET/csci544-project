The levels of mission capability varied by military service and type of aircraft, and the levels at which the goals were set also varied widely, even among the same type of aircraft. However, the MC and FMC goals for each model changed little over time. Since 1998, only 11 of 49 aircraft models (22 percent) experienced a change to their goals. Seven of the changes were to raise the goals to higher levels. Difficulties in meeting the goals are caused by a complex combination of logistical and operational factors. Despite their importance, DOD does not have a clear and defined process for setting aircraft availability goals. The goal-setting process is largely undefined and undocumented, and there is widespread uncertainty among the military services over how the goals were established, who is responsible for setting them, and the continuing adequacy of MC and FMC goals as measures of aircraft availability. Uncertainty and the lack of documentation in setting the goals ultimately obscures basic perceptions of readiness and operational effectiveness, undermines congressional confidence in the basis for DOD's funding requests, and brings into question the appropriateness of those goals to the new defense strategy. DOD guidance does not define the availability goals that the services must establish or require any objective methodology for setting them. Nor does it require the services to identify one office as the coordinating agent for goal setting or to document the basis for the goals chosen. DOD officials told GAO that the guidance has not been updated since 1990 to reflect the new security environment of increased deployments and other changes since the end of the Cold War."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, clearly demonstrated that the  U.S. security landscape has changed.

Attacks on U.S. security  can now come from any number of terrorist groups such as al Qaeda, in  any number of locations, and in wholly unexpected ways. As a result of the  changed security environment, the Department of Defense (DOD) has  rethought defense strategy and is shifting to a \u201ccapabilities-based\u201d  approach focused on contending with uncertainty by enhancing its ability  to act quickly and decisively across a wide range of combat conditions and  locations.", "One key ingredient of the new strategy is the availability of aircraft to  carry out their assigned missions.

MC and FMC goals and rates  are fundamental indicators of readiness expectations. They are also used  by DOD as indicators of maintenance and supply effectiveness and are  made available to the Congress for its general oversight of DOD.  Moreover, the level at which the goals are set also influences large  amounts of military spending for aircraft procurements, spare parts  inventories, and other resources needed to meet the goals. However, our  recent reports have identified problems in meeting MC goals among  certain aircraft.

However,  for the purpose of this report, we have grouped them into five basic  categories: (1) various models of fighter/attack aircraft, such as the F/A-18  Hornet, provide air superiority or close air support of ground forces; (2)  bombers, such as the B-1 Lancer, provide long- and short-range delivery of  heavy munitions; (3) electronic command and control aircraft, such as the  E-3 Sentry, provide airspace and battlefield reconnaissance, command,  and control services; (4) tankers and cargo aircraft, such as the KC-135  Stratotanker and the C-5 Galaxy, respectively, provide air refueling  services and the ability to carry troops and equipment anywhere in the  world; and (5) helicopters, with their ability to hover as well as conduct  long- and short-range operations, are used for a variety of missions,  including transportation of troops and equipment, air assault and  reconnaissance, and search and rescue operations. Our review included a  total of 49 different aircraft models (over 5,600 individual aircraft in 2002)  in these five categories. These aircraft were considered by the services to  be their key active-duty operational aircraft. Table 1 lists these aircraft  models, along with the military service using them, and their MC and FMC  goals for fiscal year 2002.", "DOD Instruction 3110.5, dated September 1990, requires all military  services to establish quantitative availability goals and corresponding  condition status measurements for these aircraft and other mission- essential systems and equipment. The goals established must estimate the  maximum aircraft performance that is achievable on the basis of the  aircraft\u2019s design characteristics and planned peacetime usage, and  assuming full funding and optimal operation of the peacetime manpower  and logistic support systems. Military personnel, civilian contractors, or  both may perform the required maintenance under these systems. The  instruction prescribes a basic set of condition status measures, including  FMC, partial MC, and MC, that each service must use to describe the  capability of systems or equipment. FMC indicates that an aircraft has all  of the mission-essential systems and equipment it needs to perform all of  its missions installed and operating safely. Mission-essential systems are  those required to perform primary functions such as fire control, bombing,  communications, electronic countermeasures, or radar. Partial MC  indicates that an aircraft has the operable mission-essential equipment it  needs to perform at least one of its missions, but not all. For example, an  aircraft expected to be able to carry troops into combat during wartime in  all weather conditions, as well as to be able to fly humanitarian missions  during peacetime, would be considered partial MC if some of its  equipment were broken and it could fly only humanitarian missions in  clear weather. MC consists of the sum of the partial MC and FMC  measures; that is, the number of MC aircraft is equivalent to the sum of the  aircraft rated partial MC and the aircraft rated FMC.

One model\u2019s MC goal was changed but  then returned to its initial level. Ten of the 11 changes were for aircraft  operated by the Air Force. The remaining change was for a Marine Corps  aircraft.

According to officials, the E-8 is a relatively new (3-year-old)  aircraft that is slowly increasing its performance level as it matures and  Air Force maintenance personnel understand the aircraft better. The  increase in the MC rate was based on an analysis of actual E-8 MC rates  that were showing an upward trend in performance. The Air Force is the  only service that routinely conducts formal reviews of its goals. Air Force  officials told us that they generally try to keep the goals high because it is  difficult to stop the goals from dropping further once they begin to be  lowered. Moreover, officials believed that contractors need to be held to  high standards to keep spare parts inventories and other aspects of  maintenance at high levels. In another case, the MC goal for the Marine  Corps\u2019 F/A-18D Hornet fighter was raised from 60 to 75 percent, and its  FMC goal, from 46 to 58 percent at the beginning of fiscal year 2000.

These interim goals were  lower than its official MC goals. In 1999, the Command determined that  problems with suppliers and manpower shortages were undercutting its  ability to meet MC goals and lowering unit morale. To combat this  problem, the Command developed the interim goals listed in table 2. In  2002, the Command returned to using the pre-2000 goals for all but six  aircraft (A-10, E-3, F-15 C/D, F-15 E, RC-135, and U-2).

Military aircraft are  designed to handle a specific set of missions and provide a specific set of  capabilities over a projected useful lifespan. According to officials, each  aircraft can be inherently complex and maintenance intensive, or,  depending upon the missions and capabilities it was designed to provide,  simple and easy to maintain. For example, the B-2 bomber had the lowest  MC rates (32-44 percent) of any aircraft we reviewed. However, according  to Air Combat Command officials, one reason for these low rates is the  complex design of the aircraft. The B-2 is a very advanced aircraft with  low observable (stealthy) characteristics using new composite materials,  and Air Force personnel are still learning how to maintain the aircraft. In  contrast, the B-52 bomber had some of the highest MC rates (76-84  percent) of all the aircraft we reviewed.

Navy officials told us that the growing sophistication of  their aircraft in general requires maintenance personnel to take longer to  learn the complex computer and electronic skills needed to handle the  aircraft. However, high demand for these skills in the private sector makes  it difficult to retain personnel with these maintenance skills, leading to  turnover and increasing the difficulty in meeting the MC goals. Similarly, a  recent study published in the Air Force Journal of Logistics found that  the number and experience level of maintenance personnel correlated  highly with the MC rates of F-16 aircraft. As the number of experienced  personnel assigned to an aircraft increased, the MC rates increased as  well. Army officials also cited shortages of experienced maintenance  personnel as a cause of lower MC and FMC rates. However, they also  stated that it may be possible to raise the rates by maximizing the time that  maintenance personnel actually spend maintaining the aircraft. For  example, one Army Audit Agency study in 1998 found that maintenance  personnel at one unit were spending about 70 percent of their time on  nonmaintenance activities such as administrative duties, training, and time  attending to personal duties.", "Personnel management is an area that we have cited as a major  management challenge and program risk for DOD. For years, DOD has  been wrestling with shortages of key personnel because of retention  problems. In 1999 we reported that the majority of factors cited as sources  of dissatisfaction and reasons to leave the military were related to work  circumstances, such as the lack of spare parts and materials needed to  perform daily job requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Age and Usage Patterns Also Believed to Influence Availability", "paragraphs": ["The advancing age and usage patterns of aircraft were other factors often  cited by service officials as reasons why aircraft did not meet MC goals.  DOD\u2019s inventory of aircraft is getting older. The Congressional Budget  Office recently reported that from 1980 to 2000, the average age of active- duty Navy aircraft rose from 11 years to more than 16 years; Air Force  aircraft, from 13 to more than 20 years; and Army helicopters, from 10 to  over 17 years. Logistics officials told us that aging influences on MC rates  typically follow a cyclical pattern over the life of an aircraft. When aircraft  are initially introduced, they go through a \u201cshake down\u201d period and have  low MC rates as new equipment and supply systems stabilize and  maintenance personnel learn to understand the aircraft. Eventually, MC  rates begin to rise and then stabilize at a higher working level. However, as  more and more flying time is accrued over the passing years, problems due  to materials and parts fatigue, corrosion, and obsolescence increase, and  MC rates begin to fall again. Modernization programs are then instituted to  replace worn and obsolete equipment, and the pattern begins again.", "Although age may affect MC rates, we found no statistical evidence that  age alone explains difficulties in meeting MC goals. For example, our  analysis of average aircraft ages and 2002 MC rates found no indication  that older aircraft have the lowest MC rates. (See table 3.) With an  average age of 40 years, the B-52 is the second oldest aircraft in DOD\u2019s  inventory. However, its MC rate of 81 for 2002 and historical MC rates  consistently in the upper 70s and low 80s rank it among the highest  performers we reviewed. According to Air Force officials at the Air  Combat Command, in addition to their simplicity, B-52s have a relatively  low number of actual flight hours, averaging about 16,000 hours each  despite their age. These officials believed that accrued flight hours are a  more appropriate measure of wear and tear than chronological age.", "Moreover, according to these officials, the B-52 was originally scheduled  to retire in the mid-1990s. However, because of its durability and  flexibility, the Air Force decided to retain the aircraft until the average age  reaches 32,000 hours, projected at about 2040.", "Logistics officials also believe that MC rates are affected by usage patterns  and whether the aircraft is operated under the conditions for which it was  designed. Officials told us that the large increase in deployments in recent  years has caused many DOD aircraft to be operated at rates higher than  expected during their design, thus accelerating aging problems. For  example, according to the Air Force Journal of Logistics study, F-15  fighters sent to Saudi Arabia in 1997 were flown at over three times their  normal rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spare Parts Inventories Critical", "paragraphs": ["Shortages of spare parts have been recognized by us and others for years  as a major contributor to lower-than-expected MC rates. As a result, we  have also cited DOD inventory management as a major management  challenge and program risk since 1990. Service officials continued to cite  spare parts shortages as a frequent cause of difficulties in meeting MC  goals. Spare parts shortages are caused by a number of problems,  including underestimates of demand, and contracting and other problems  associated with aging aircraft or small aircraft fleets.", "We have reported on DOD\u2019s problems in estimating aircraft spare parts  requirements for years. For example, in 1999 and again in 2001, we  reported that shortages of spare parts caused by inaccurate forecasting of  inventory requirements was degrading MC rates for key Air Force aircraft  such as the B-1B bomber, C-5 cargo planes, and F-16 fighters. In 2001 we  reported that key Navy aircraft were also having readiness problems  because of spare parts shortages resulting from underestimates of  demand. Officials continued to raise this issue as an underlying factor in  spare parts shortages. In addition, some officials also believed that the  higher operating tempos associated with increased deployments have  caused parts to fail quicker than expected, exacerbating weaknesses in  forecasting inventory requirements.", "Air Force officials told us that aging aircraft, in particular, may experience  parts shortages and delays in repairs because original manufacturers may  no longer make required parts. To obtain a new part, officials must wait  for it to be manufactured. However, this may not be a high priority for the  commercial supplier because of the relatively low profit potential.  Alternatively, another company could make the part if the original  manufacturer were willing to give up its proprietary rights. However, this  can take longer and be more expensive than simply waiting for the original  manufacturer. Moreover, officials also told us that spare parts inventories  are sometimes reduced when aircraft are nearing the end of their  projected life. For example, Air Force officials said that in the mid-1990s  they began to shut down the spare parts supply for the B-52 because of its  anticipated retirement. This resulted in a depletion of inventories, the  canceling of contracts, and ultimately a drop in MC rates from 1997 to  2000. As a result of the decision to retain the B-52, the supply system is  recovering and MC rates are moving up.", "Similarly, the size of the aircraft fleet can also influence spare parts  inventories and MC rates. According to officials, manufacturers may see  little profit in stocking large inventories of spare parts for a small fleet of  specialized military aircraft. Small fleets of aircraft can also suffer from  having their MC rates strongly influenced by the MC failures of just a few  aircraft. Large fleets of aircraft also have an advantage in having more  opportunities to remove serviceable parts from one aircraft and install  them in another\u2014termed \u201ccannibalizing\u201d\u2014thus helping to insulate their  MC rates from the impact of parts shortages. However, we recently  reported that while cannibalization is a widespread practice among the  services, it increases maintenance personnel workloads and lowers morale  and retention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintenance Approach and Other Operational Factors May Affect MC Rates", "paragraphs": ["Air Force and Navy officials cited changes to their maintenance  approaches as a significant cause of slower repair times and lowered MC  rates. In the mid-1990s the Air Force changed from a three-level  maintenance approach to a two-level approach. This change moved much  of the intermediate maintenance functions, such as the replacement or  emergency manufacture of parts, away from the air base level to  centralized maintenance depots. According to officials at both the Air  Combat Command and Air Mobility Command, these changes slowed the  pace of repairs significantly. Repair expertise was taken away from the  base level, and aircraft were shipped away from home base more often for  repairs. Moreover, officials believed that many experienced maintenance  people were lost as they refused to move to other locations associated  with the reorganizations. In this regard, our 1996 review of depot closures  noted that DOD\u2019s outplacement program helped limit the number of  involuntary separations and that jobs were often available for employees  willing to relocate.", "The Army continues to use a three-level maintenance system, as does the  Navy. However, Navy officials said they also changed their system in the  mid-1990s by introducing the integrated maintenance concept. This  approach, in contrast to the Air Force approach, increased the amount of  aircraft modernization and other work performed at the base level during  a time when funding for depot-level work was being reduced. However,  officials believed this change overloaded the base-level maintenance  systems and ultimately lowered reported MC rates.", "From fiscal year 1988 to fiscal 2001, DOD reduced the number of major  depots from 38 to 19. During this same period, the maintenance workforce  was reduced by about 60 percent (from 156,000 to 64,500). These  reductions were the result of overall force structure reductions since the  end of the Cold War, as well as DOD\u2019s desire to reduce costs by relying  more on the private sector for the performance of depot maintenance. We  have raised concerns that DOD\u2019s downsizing of its depot infrastructure  and workforce was done without sound strategic planning and that  investments in facilities, equipment, and personnel in recent years have  not been sufficient to ensure the long-term viability of the depots.", "Other operational factors can also affect MC rates. For example, from 1997  to 2000, the Air Force\u2019s B-1 bomber had a major power system problem  that lowered MC rates by 12 points. To address the problem, the Air  Combat Command instituted a system of frequent video teleconferences  between the offices involved in the maintenance response to provide more  intensive management of the response. This approach worked, as the MC  rate climbed by 9 points by 2002. Management integration between the  operations and logistics sides of the organization was also viewed as key.  Good coordination between these two groups is essential because of the  complex and multifaceted causes of MC problems. Finally, Air Force  officials noted that some of the problems with Air Force MC rates could be  explained by a change in reporting procedures. During the mid-1990s, the  Air Force returned an aircraft to MC status after it was repaired but prior  to the actual check flight to ensure that it was operating correctly. Now,  the aircraft must pass the check flight before being classified as MC.  Officials believe that this change would tend to lower MC rates slightly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Levels Raise Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all services cited underfunding of spare parts inventories,  maintenance depots, and other aspects of the maintenance and supply  systems as a key problem.

The System requires  commanders to rate their unit\u2019s readiness at levels 1 (highest) through 5 on  the basis of a combination of their professional judgment and the  readiness ratings in four specific areas: personnel, training, equipment on  hand, and equipment condition. MC and FMC measures are used to  determine the ratings for equipment condition. For example, the Army  measures equipment condition (termed \u201cserviceability\u201d by the Army) for  aircraft by using the FMC rate. An FMC rate of 75 percent or more is  required for a level-1 readiness rating, the highest available. Congress also  requires DOD to include Status of Resources and Training System  information on the condition of equipment as well as specific information  on equipment that is not mission capable in its quarterly readiness reports  to Congress. These reports assist Congress in its general responsibilities  for overseeing DOD readiness and operations.", "Similarly, according to DOD and service officials, MC and FMC goals are  used as management tools within DOD units to diagnose problems and  motivate personnel. For example, officials in the Air Combat Command  told us that their use of lower interim goals beginning in fiscal year 2000  was an attempt to raise unit morale that had suffered as a result of their  inability to meet the actual goals owing to shortages of personnel and  spare parts. In this regard, DOD\u2019s instruction specifically calls for the  services to use the goals and condition status measurements, such as MC  and FMC, to review maintenance and supply effectiveness and to have  programs to identify and correct problems with systems and equipment.", "Service officials told us that the goals also affect DOD\u2019s funding levels  because the goals are used to help determine the size of spare parts  inventories and other logistical resources needed. Higher goals require  more money to maintain parts inventories and other resources needed to  achieve the goals. For example, officials told us that in the early 1990s, a  $100 million contract for logistics support for one Air Force aircraft  contained an MC goal of 90 percent. During this period, the contractor  kept supply bins full of parts and MC goals were met. However, in the mid- 1990s a new contractor was brought in, and the MC goal was dropped to  85 percent. According to Air Force officials, their decision to lower the MC  goal by 5 percentage points allowed the contractor to lower spare parts  inventories and reduced the price of the maintenance contract by $10  million. However, MC rates also dropped and eventually fell below the  new goal. The services have developed mathematical models to determine  the size and cost of the spare parts inventories needed to support various  levels of MC and FMC goals and other measures of aircraft availability. For  example, the Navy uses a model called \u201cReadiness Based Sparing\u201d that  takes a given FMC goal and determines the level of funding and spare  parts inventories needed to reach that goal. Such models are useful in the  case of spare parts inventories. However, we were not able to identify any  models in widespread operational use that integrated the other influences  on MC rates, such as maintenance personnel assigned, into an overall  model able to predict the impact of changes in those resources on MC and  FMC rates. Army and Air Force officials told us that they had recently  developed such integrated models, and they are currently in limited use to  test their validity. Navy officials told us that they did not yet have an  integrated model.", "The potential amount of funds affected by the level at which MC and FMC  goals are set is large. Military service estimates of the spending of  operations and maintenance funds for aircraft spares and repair parts  were over $7 billion in fiscal year 2001. This figure does not include  spending from other sources such as procurement and working capital  funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods Used to Set Goals Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Precisely how MC and FMC goals are established is unknown. DOD  officials said that a combined DOD and military service team establishes  operational requirements and MC goals during the acquisition process.  After approval, these requirements are recorded in the Operational  Requirements Document or other documents associated with the process.  According to officials, part of this process involves an engineering analysis  of the expected operational availability of the aircraft and the underlying  level of maintenance support elements needed. \u201cOperational availability\u201d  is an engineering term referring to the probability that equipment is not  down owing to failure. In comparison, MC and FMC goals represent the  expected percentage of time that an aircraft will be able to perform at  least one or all of its missions, respectively.", "Service officials reviewed the acquisition documents for many of the  aircraft in our review, but were unable to explain and document how the  actual MC and FMC goals were chosen. According to officials, many of  these aircraft were acquired 20 to 30 years ago, under processes that have  changed over the years, and with no clear documentation of the basis for  the specific goal chosen. Moreover, there was often confusion over which  organizations were responsible for setting the goals.", "For example, Navy officials pointed to a 1996 Center for Naval Analyses  study that attempted to determine how the MC and FMC goals for Navy  aircraft were originally computed. According to the study, however, \u201cno  one knows the origin of the numbers or the method used to compute  them. Now, the numbers are routed to knowledgeable people for revision,  which are made without documenting the rationale for the changes.\u201d In a  July 17, 2002, letter to us, the Navy further explained that it believed that  the MC goals were established in the early 1980s \u201cto be in line with the  reported status quo for the day\u201d with \u201cno analytical rigor applied at the  time of their birth.\u201d We requested a written explanation of how the goals  were set because, despite repeated referrals to various offices over several  months, no Navy official could explain how the goals were established or  identify the responsible office. According to Navy officials, there was  uncertainty between the program and policy offices as to who is  responsible for establishing the goals and who should answer our  questions.", "Similarly, Army officials could not explain how their goals were set, and  two separate Army organizations believed the other was responsible for  setting the goals. The Army\u2019s written response to our request for an  explanation of how the goals were set (dated July 31, 2002) was prepared  by officials from the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command and  forwarded to us by a letter from the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Logistics. The Deputy Chief of Staff\u2019s letter states that MC goals for Army  aircraft are extracted from the System Readiness Objective contained in  the Operational Requirements Document established during an aircraft\u2019s  acquisition, and that the Training and Doctrine Command is responsible  for establishing the System Readiness Objectives. However, the Training  and Doctrine Command\u2019s letter states that it does not set System  Readiness Objectives and that the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics is  responsible for establishing readiness goals. Nonetheless, the Training and  Doctrine Command researched the operational requirements documents  for the Army aircraft in our review in an attempt to answer our question  about how the MC and FMC goals were set. The Command\u2019s letter  identified the operational availability requirements for most of the aircraft  but did not explain how these requirements were set or make any  reference to the MC or FMC goals. Officials from the Office of the Deputy  Chief of Staff for Logistics told us that the Army is considering changing  the FMC goals for all its aircraft to 75 percent to match the requirement for  the highest-level readiness rating for equipment serviceability under the  Global Status of Resources and Training System\u2019s criterion. They did not  know how the 75-percent-readiness-rating criterion was chosen.", "Air Force officials also could not explain how the initial MC and FMC  goals for their aircraft were established. Officials from the Air Combat  Command\u2014responsible for Air Force fighters, bombers, and electronic  command/control aircraft in our review\u2014told us that they could find no  historical record of the process used to establish most of the goals.  Similarly, officials from the Air Mobility Command\u2014responsible for the  cargo and tanker aircraft\u2014stated that the Command was formed in 1992  out of elements from the Military Airlift and Strategic Air Commands and  did not know how the previous Commands had established the goals.  According to these officials, each of the major Commands that operate  aircraft and other major weapon systems in the Air Force is responsible  for establishing its own MC goals, and no one has published a standardized  methodology to use. Moreover, some of the documentation related to the  goals was lost when the Military Airlift and Strategic Air Commands were  deactivated. Similar to the Navy, however, officials from both Commands  believed that the goals were set on the basis of the historical performance  of similar aircraft and/or subjective Command judgments.", "While Air Force officials could not explain how the initial goals were  established, they told us that their annual reviews of the goals are based  on a mix of historical trend analysis and requirements reviews. The Air  Force is the only service that conducts formal reviews of its goals each  year. According to officials from the Air Mobility and Air Combat  Commands, until 1997-98, reviews of the goals in both Commands were  based on an analysis of actual historical MC and FMC rates. For example,  analysts at the Air Mobility Command compared the goals with the actual  rates for the previous 2 years. Depending upon actual performance, the  goal could then be changed, sometimes on the basis of subjective  judgments. According to Air Combat Command officials, the MC goal for  the B-2 bomber was set in fiscal year 2000 using an analysis of historical  rates and command judgment. The first B-2 was delivered in 1993.", "In 1997-98, the two Air Force Commands began to develop so-called  \u201crequirements-based analyses\u201d to review the standards. According to  officials at the Air Combat Command, for example, it was recognized that  the historical approach to reviewing the standards can perpetuate  relatively low standards because it simply accepts the low funding levels  and other problems that may lower MC rates without focusing on actual  mission needs. The new approach attempts to factor in wartime  operational requirements, peacetime flying hour requirements for pilot  training, and other such requirements. A mix of both approaches is  currently used by the commands to review the goals.", "The services also differed in their treatment of other important aspects of  managing the goals, such as whether to vary the goals on the basis of an  aircraft\u2019s deployment posture. The Navy was the only service to tier its  goals on the basis of its traditional practice of cyclical deployment  schedules on board its ships and aircraft carriers. Operational aircraft in  the Navy follow a cyclical pattern of deploying to sea on aircraft carriers  and other vessels for a set period of time, such as 6 months. Once the  deployed units are replaced, they experience a stand-down period during  which they recover from the rigors of deployment until it is time to begin  preparing for the next movement. The Navy varies the intensity of its  maintenance and its MC and FMC goals according to this pattern. Navy  aircraft more than 90 days away from a deployment have goals that are 5  percentage points lower than aircraft within 90 days of a deployment, and  aircraft actually deployed have goals that are 5 percentage points higher  than those within 90 days of deploying. In comparison, aircraft in the  Marine Corps and other services have a level approach to maintenance  where the goals do not vary, and maintenance is kept at a relatively  constant level. Navy officials believed that the cyclical approach to  maintenance could lower overall MC rates over time compared with the  level approach. This is because of the reduced maintenance attention  when the aircraft are not deployed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adequacy of MC and FMC Goals Questioned", "paragraphs": ["Some officials questioned whether the MC and FMC goals are adequate  measures of an aircraft\u2019s availability. For example, officials from the Air  Force\u2019s Air Mobility Command stated that they focused on the MC goal  and not the FMC goal because their primary readiness objective is the  specific mission currently assigned, not every possible mission the aircraft  was designed for. Moreover, the Air Combat Command did not even  establish FMC goals. This Command was the only one we reviewed that  did not set FMC goals for its aircraft. Air Combat Command officials told  us that they could find no documentation to explain why the Command  did not establish FMC goals.", "In contrast, Army officials stated that their units focus primarily on the  FMC goal because it is directly connected to readiness ratings under the  Status of Resources and Training System. Furthermore, Navy officials  stated that the military is moving away from the MC and FMC goals in  newer aircraft, such as the Joint Strike Fighter. This is because the MC and  FMC goals provide only a limited historical perspective and do not address  issues that are important to war-fighting commanders such as how often  an aircraft can fly missions over the course of a day and the probability  that the aircraft will complete its mission. The Joint Strike Fighter, for  example, is using a concept called \u201cmission reliability\u201d instead of MC and  FMC goals. Mission reliability is the probability that the Joint Strike  Fighter will complete its required operational mission without a failure.  According to Navy officials, the predictive value and information on flight  frequency and reliability provided by this new measure is very valuable to  war-fighting commanders and is better for mission-planning purposes than  the MC and FMC measures. Officials said that the mission-reliability  concept could be used throughout DOD\u2019s inventory of aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Instruction Provides Little or No Guidance on Key Issues", "paragraphs": ["DOD Instruction 3110.5 provides only vague or no guidance on many of  the key issues raised in this report. For example, the instruction requires  each military service to establish availability goals for its mission-essential  systems and equipment, and a corresponding set of condition status  measures relative to those goals. The instruction specifically identifies MC,  FMC, and other specific capabilities as measures that the services must  maintain. However, it does not identify the specific goals that must be  established\u2014MC, FMC, or any other\u2014or the primary readiness objective  to be served. In this regard, the instruction states that the services should  assume planned peacetime usage in setting the goals. According to Air  Force officials, peacetime usage can be more taxing than wartime usage  because of the extra training and other requirements. Air Combat  Command officials told us that they believed that the instruction regarding  what goals\u2014including the FMC goal\u2014were required to be established was  unclear.", "The instruction also provides little guidance on the methodology to be  used in setting the goals. It states that the services should provide  estimates of the maximum performance that is achievable, given the  design characteristics of the aircraft, and that full funding and optimal  operation of the logistics support system should be assumed. Service  officials said they believe that actual levels of funding, personnel, spare  parts inventories, and other key resources should be factored into the  process of setting the goals, since full funding has not been provided for  years. The instruction is silent on the issue of whether it is appropriate to  use historical trends of similar aircraft in determining the goals, as  opposed to a more analytical approach using actual requirements, for  example. The instruction is also silent on whether the aircraft availability  goals should vary on the basis of the aircraft\u2019s deployment posture.  Moreover, it includes no requirement for the services to identify the  readiness and cost implications of setting the goals at different levels, to  help clarify the pros and cons of available choices and the guiding  principles used to decide on those choices.", "Similarly, the instruction provides little organizational structure for the  goal-setting process in DOD. For example, it does not require the services  to identify one office as the coordinating organization for goal-setting and  other related activities. Furthermore, it does not require the services to  document the basis for the goals chosen or outline any of the basic  historical documentation that should be maintained for goal-setting and  other key activities during the process.", "According to DOD officials from the office responsible for the instruction,  DOD Instruction 3110.5 dates back to the 1970s when readiness concerns  had reached a high point. The focus was on getting the services to set  benchmark readiness goals, and the instruction gave them latitude to  choose those goals, the methods for setting them, and the processes for  managing them. The instruction was revised in 1990. However, officials  told us that it has not been updated to reflect the current environment of  frequent deployments and other changes since the end of the Cold War,  and some now consider it a relic.", "We performed our work from February through November 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Without the perspective provided by  clear, consistent, and up-to-date goals, the perceptions of actual  performance are subject to continuing uncertainty and disagreement, and  confidence in the funding requests based on those perceptions is  undermined. Moreover, the lack of a standard methodology for the  services to use in setting the goals removes a safeguard for objectivity  from the process, risking the possibility that the methods used do not  realistically reflect actual requirements. This risk is increased when there  is uncertainty or disagreement over basic questions such as whether it is  appropriate to base the goals on a historical analysis or an analysis of  actual requirements, and whether full funding of logistical support systems  should be assumed in an era of reduced funding. Furthermore, the absence  of information on the readiness and cost implications of setting the goals  at different levels results in a lack of understanding of the pros and cons of  available choices and the guiding principles used to make those decisions.  Ultimately, inappropriately set goals can unnecessarily raise or lower the  cost of spare parts inventories and other logistical resources by millions of  dollars.", "Also, DOD\u2019s instruction requires the services neither to designate one  office to coordinate the establishment and maintenance of aircraft  availability goals, nor to document the basis for the goals chosen or other  key issues in the process.

In addition, DOD indicated that it would explore alternative  methodologies for setting goals, such as one based on unit deployment  cycles currently in use by the Navy.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation for a series of  revisions to DOD Instruction 3110.5. It agreed with our recommendation  that the instruction be revised to require each service to designate a focal  point for the development and historical documentation of the goal-setting  process. However, DOD did not agree with the part of our  recommendation calling for it to include the performance measures  associated with the aircraft availability goals in the instruction. DOD  believed that that requirement implied that those performance measures  should be the sole or primary measure of the overall state of materiel  readiness. That was not our intent. Our recommendation is meant to  ensure that the goals and accompanying performance/status measures  selected are clearly defined in the instruction. As pointed out in the report,  this is not currently the case. We agree that determinations of overall  materiel readiness require the consideration of a variety of factors, such as  maintenance manning and supply fill rates, as well as metrics such as an  aircraft\u2019s availability. However, we believe that the instruction should  continue its current requirement to include performance/condition status  measures relative to those goals. Clearly identifying the goals that are  sought and their performance measures in the instruction will help avoid  further uncertainty and disagreement over the level of basic aircraft  performance, and does not preclude the consideration of other metrics in  broader assessments of overall readiness.  For these reasons, we believe  no change to our recommendation is needed.", "DOD also disagreed with the part of our recommendation calling for the  Secretary of Defense to revise the instruction to establish a standard  methodology identifying objective principles of analysis to be used in  setting the goals. It believed that the services should establish the detailed  analytical methodology because the types of goals and their basis may  vary by service, and the services have a better understanding of the  differences and complexities of their individual environments. We agree  with the need for some leeway at the service level to handle individual  differences between them. However, we continue to believe that all  services should adhere to a standardized set of overarching principles of  analysis in order to safeguard objectivity and transparency in the goal  setting process. Such principles could be identified in coordination with  the services during the department\u2019s planned evaluation of the basis for  the current goals and alternative methodologies.
