To better understand the use of contractors in this role, GAO initiated a case study, under the authority of the Comptroller General, at the Army Contracting Agency's (ACA) Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE). GAO determined (1) the extent to which and why CCE relies on contractor contract specialists, (2) how risks of contractor use are mitigated, (3) how the cost of the contractors compares to that for CCE's government employees, and (4) whether the contract vehicles were appropriate. GAO reviewed a random sample of contract files to understand the contractors' duties and responsibilities, compared compensation costs, and reviewed documents from the General Services Administration (GSA), under whose contracts CCE ordered the contract specialists."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CCE has relied on contractor contract specialists since it began hiring them in 2003. In August 2007, contractors--who work side by side and perform the same functions as their government counterparts--comprised 42 percent of CCE's contract specialists. CCE officials cited difficulties hiring and retaining government personnel in light of the competition from government and the private sector for this competency. While CCE officials said that they prefer to use government employees, they have not considered the appropriate balance of contractor versus government contract specialists. Furthermore, CCE has not addressed the need for more training of its government employees to strengthen their skills in conducting CCE's increasingly more complex procurements. Methods to mitigate the risks of using contractors have been mixed in effect. First, the line separating contractor from government employee is blurry, and contractors did not always clearly identify themselves as such when dealing with the public. Second, the potential for the work being done under a personal services contract, which the Federal Acquisition Regulation generally prohibits because of the government-contractor relationship it creates, was clearly present. While contractor managers retained control over matters such as approving leave requests, CCE took steps to further strengthen the management distinction between government and contractor employees based on GAO's findings. Finally, risks of organizational and personal conflicts of interest were mitigated to some extent, but in practice the government relies on individual contractor employees to identify potential conflicts. These types of risks must be mitigated to ensure that the government does not lose accountability over policy and program decisions. CCE is paying up to almost 27 percent more for its contractor-provided contract specialists than for similarly graded government employees. This comparison took into account government salary, benefits, and overhead and the loaded hourly labor rates paid to contractors. Our review of available r?sum?s showed that six contractor employees supporting CCE in fiscal year 2007 had on average more contracting experience than CCE's five recent government hires. Despite CCE's legal counsel's concerns, CCE has been inappropriately ordering contract specialists under a GSA contract because the services were out of scope of those contracts. GAO found additional problems, such as a contractor advertising contract specialist services on GSA's Web site that it was not authorized to provide. Due to what it characterizes as the growing demand by federal agencies for contractor contract specialists, GSA recently posted a revised contract category, under which government agencies can procure contract specialists to provide acquisition management services, such as cost estimating and proposal evaluation support. In response to GAO's findings, GSA contacted each of the contractors involved in our review about their out-of-scope services and plans further follow-ups with them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 10 years, Department of Defense (DOD) spending on  services has increased 76 percent\u2014to $158.3 billion in fiscal year 2007\u2014 and now outpaces its spending on supplies and equipment, including  major weapon systems. One effect of the escalation in service spending  has been to place greater demands on a shrinking acquisition workforce,  which is increasingly faced with the need to manage more complex  contracting approaches. Agencies have dealt with these trends by relying  more heavily on contractors, particularly those that provide professional,  administrative, and management support services, an area where DOD\u2019s  spending more than tripled from fiscal years 1998 through 2007. One  example of a function DOD is acquiring through contracts is contract  specialists, who perform a range of acquisition services in support of  government contracting officers.", "The decision to turn to contractors can, in some cases, create risks that  the government needs to consider and manage. Of key concern is the risk  of loss of government control over and accountability for mission-related  policy and program decisions when contractors provide services that  closely support inherently governmental functions. Contract specialist  services are an example of such a service, whereas the contracting officer,  who obligates the government\u2019s money, is performing an inherently  governmental function that cannot be obtained through a contract. Other  concerns include an increased potential for conflicts of interest, both  organizational and personal; the potential for improper use of personal  services contracts, which the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  generally prohibits because of the employer-employee relationship they  create between the government and contractor personnel; and the cost to  the government of hiring contractors rather than government personnel.", "To learn more about the use and roles of contractors providing contract  specialist services, we conducted a case study, under the authority of the  Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, of the  Army\u2019s Contracting Center of Excellence\u2019s (CCE) use of contractors in this  role. Organizationally, CCE falls under the Army Contracting Agency  (ACA), a field operating agency reporting to the Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. We determined (1) the  extent to which and the reasons CCE is relying on contractors, (2) what  actions have been taken to mitigate the risks associated with using  contractors in contract specialist roles, (3) how the costs of CCE\u2019s  contract specialists compared to that of its government contract  specialists, and (4) whether the contract vehicles used to acquire the  specialists were appropriate. This report presents our findings at CCE as  an example of the challenges faced by agencies in an environment of  increased reliance on contractors to help meet the contracting mission.", "We identified CCE as a government agency using contractors as contract  specialists through a bid protest that involved CCE\u2019s predecessor  organization awarding a contract for contract specialists. In fiscal year  2007, CCE obligated almost $1.8 billion in contract actions. To conduct our  work, we interviewed CCE and ACA officials and contractor  representatives. We obtained information on CCE\u2019s contract specialist  staffing levels in fiscal year 2007, and we reviewed CCE\u2019s orders issued  under blanket purchase agreements (BPA) established in 2006 for  contract specialist services, as well as billing information. To identify the  roles and responsibilities of contractor contract specialists, we  interviewed government and contractor contract specialists and  government contracting officers, and we reviewed 42 randomly selected  CCE contract files for work performed by the contractor contract  specialists in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to understand the contractors\u2019  day-to-day duties. We also reviewed contractor policies and procedures  regarding organizational and personal conflicts of interest. In addition, we  reviewed FAR provisions pertaining to conflicts of interest, as well as  those relating to personal services contracts. To compare costs, we  calculated an average loaded hourly rate (including benefits, overhead,  and other costs) for CCE\u2019s government contract specialists who perform  the same tasks and have similar qualifications as the contractor-provided  contract specialists, and compared it to the weighted average labor hour  rate that two contractors charged CCE for contract specialists in August  2007. The contractors\u2019 labor hour rates include wages, benefits, overhead,  general and administrative expenses, and profit. We also reviewed  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to compare experience levels of contractor and government  contract specialists. R\u00e9sum\u00e9s were available for six contractor contract  specialists who had supported the agency for at least 6 months; we also  reviewed the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the five contract specialists CCE had recently  hired. We reviewed CCE\u2019s contracting strategies to determine whether  new contracts were awarded to obtain contract specialists or whether  interagency contracts through other federal agencies, such as the General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) schedule program, were used. We  analyzed contract documents, including CCE\u2019s BPAs with four  contractors, related task orders, and underlying GSA schedule contracts.  We spoke with GSA officials responsible for overseeing the Mission  Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) schedule and with CCE  officials. We also examined the FAR section on the use of GSA schedules.", "While CCE has established BPAs with four contractors to provide contract  specialist services, nearly all of the contractor-provided contract  specialists at CCE during our review were employees of CACI  International, Inc.

During fiscal  year 2007, the agency awarded about 5,800 contract actions and obligated  almost $1.8 billion. CCE is one of many government agencies that have  turned to contractors to support their contracting functions.", "While use of contractors provides the government certain benefits, such as  increased flexibility in fulfilling immediate needs, we and others have  raised concerns about the federal government\u2019s services contracting, in  particular for professional and management support services. A major  concern is the risk of loss of government control over and accountability  for mission-related policy and program decisions when contractors  provide services that closely support inherently governmental functions.  Inherently governmental functions require discretion in applying  government authority or value judgments in making decisions for the  government, such as approving contractual requirements; as such, they  must be performed by government employees, not private contractors.  The closer contractor services come to supporting inherently  governmental functions, the greater the risk of their influencing the  government\u2019s control over and accountability for decisions that may be  based, in part, on contractor work.

Among other things, contract specialists  perform market research, assist in preparing statements of work, develop  and manage acquisition plans, and prepare the documents the contracting  officer signs, such as contracts, solicitations, and contract modifications.", "In its 2007 report to Congress, DOD\u2019s Panel on Contracting Integrity noted  that the practice of using contractors to support the contracting mission  merits further study because it gives rise to questions regarding potential  conflicts of interest and appropriate designation of governmental versus  nongovernmental functions. The panel concluded that potential  vulnerabilities may exist that could result in fraud, waste, and abuse.", "A November 2005 DAU study cited four top reasons that federal agencies  are contracting out for procurement services: (1) to meet workload surge  requirements, (2) inability to hire adequate resources to meet workload,  (3) relative speed of contracting versus hiring to meet workload, and   (4) ability to select specific required expertise. The DAU data showed that  contractors performed duties across the spectrum of contracting  functions, from acquisition planning to contract closeout. The study\u2019s  authors noted that as DOD\u2019s personnel levels have dropped, activity rates  for procurement organizations have increased, driving a gap between the  requirements and government capability in many DOD contracting offices.

Contractor personnel attending meetings, answering government  telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status  is not obvious to third parties should identify themselves as such to avoid  creating the impression that they are government officials. In addition,  the FAR states that agencies must ensure that all documents or reports  contractors produce are suitably marked as contractor products or that  contractor participation is appropriately disclosed. Further, in December  2005, the Assistant Secretary of the Army issued a memorandum,  \u201cContractors in the Government Workplace,\u201d stating that \u201cwhile it is  preferred that contractor personnel work in company office space, if  Government and contractor personnel must be co-located in the same  office space, then, to the maximum extent possible, the contractor  personnel should have separate, and separated, space.\u201d", "At CCE, we found the line separating government from contractor  personnel to be blurry. There is no physical separation; the two work side  by side in identical office space, and contractor employees are not  identified as such on their cubicles.

We reviewed 23 contract modifications  prepared by contractor employees and found that their status as  contractors was not indicated on the documents. Further, on 16 of these  modifications, the contractor was identified as administering the contract,  and on four, the contractor was listed as the point of contact without  identification as a contractor\u2014for example, as the \u201cCCE contact\u201d or  \u201cgovernment point of contact.\u201d Instances such as these, where the  contractor is not identified as such or is misidentified, can cause  confusion about the contractor\u2019s status and create an impression that the  contractor is speaking or acting for the government. For example, we  found a situation in which a vendor, in submitting a proposal to the  government, listed the contractor contract specialist as the contracting  officer, who has the contract source selection authority for the  government.

The government is  normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under competitive  appointment or other procedures required by the civil service laws.  Section 37.104 of the FAR lists six descriptive elements to be used as a  guide in assessing the existence of a personal services contract.

Such a finding can only be  established based on a case-by-case analysis of the totality of the  circumstances of each case. The FAR elements are shown in table 1 along  with the working environment of the contract employees at CCE. We  found that the actual working environment for the contractor contract  specialists at CCE touched on all six elements.", "The FAR provides that each contract arrangement be judged in the light of  its own facts and circumstances, with the key question always being  whether the government will exercise relatively continuous supervision  and control over the contractor personnel performing the contract. For  example, GAO bid protest decisions have considered, along with the  existence of other factors, the fact that government \u201cmanagers interviewed  and selected contractor personnel for assignment to positions, and  routinely requested pay increases and promotions for contractor  personnel\u201d to be contributing factors in the existence of a personal  services contract.

Although the  distinction between a personal services contract and a non-personal  services contract is somewhat murky and requires a case-by-case analysis  based on the facts of each circumstance, we found no additional DOD  guidance that elaborated on the factors contracting officers or program  officials should consider in determining whether a personal services  contract exists and how to mitigate against this risk when contractors are  working side by side with their government counterparts, perhaps even  receiving their daily task assignments from a government supervisor.  Because of the type of contract and nature of the contract services  provided along with the presence of the FAR\u2019s descriptive elements, the  CACI contract runs the risk of becoming a personal services contract if the  government does not carefully monitor the manner in which services are  provided.", "When we brought these issues to the attention of CCE, the agency began  to take actions to strengthen the management distinction between  government and contractor personnel. Before, the contractor personnel  were assigned to a team consisting of government and contractor  employees, and they generally worked for one contracting officer most of  the time. Now, all of the contractor personnel are on a separate team, and  the contractors\u2019 managers on-site are responsible for assigning work to the  contractor employees\u2014unlike the previous situation where the  government contracting officer assigned the work.

The FAR and GAO bid protest decisions  provide guidance for contracting officers to mitigate three types of OCIs:  unequal access to nonpublic information as part of its performance under  a government contract that might provide the contractor firm unfair  competitive advantage in a future competition; biased ground rules, such  as the firm being in a position to write a statement of work that might  provide it an unfair advantage in a future competition; and impaired  objectivity when the contractor firm\u2019s work under a contract entails  evaluating its own work or that of a competitor either through an  assessment of performance under another contract or through an  evaluation of proposals.", "As required under its BPA with CCE, CACI submitted an OCI risk  mitigation plan, which lays out the elements of its plan to mitigate the risk  of an OCI.

As a part of the firewall, the  business unit\u2019s employees are physically separated from the company\u2019s  other operating groups, proposal databases are separated, and the  business unit\u2019s employee financial incentives do not depend on the  performance of the company\u2019s other operating organizations. Also, the  business unit providing contract specialists is precluded from submitting  proposals in response to solicitations issued by CCE, except for those  related to the BPA for contract specialists. In addition, the company  provides its employees with OCI training and instructions to immediately  notify the contracting officer of a potential OCI; requires them to sign  conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements to protect proprietary or  sensitive information belonging to the government or other contractors\u2014 for example, cost and pricing data, government spend plan data, and  contractor technical proposal data\u2014and not use this information to  violate procurement integrity rules; and limits where employees can work  within CACI for 2 years after leaving CCE. The nondisclosure agreement  also addresses personal conflicts of interest, as the contractor employee  must agree not to engage in any conduct prohibited by the Procurement  Integrity Act as implemented in FAR 3.104. Finally, a group internal to the  company conducts annual reviews of the effectiveness of and adherence  to the OCI risk mitigation plan.", "Although CCE and the contractor have taken steps to mitigate OCI risks,  in practice, identifying and mitigating the risks necessarily relies, to a large  extent, on individual contractor personnel. Contractor officials indicated  that it is the responsibility of the contractor contract specialists to  immediately notify the company supervisor and contracting officer of  potential OCIs. CACI officials and employees told us of cases where  contractor contract specialists had been exposed to potential conflicts of  interest, that is, they were assigned to procurements that the company  planned to bid on. We were told these employees were subsequently  removed from working on the procurements after notifying contractor  management and government officials of a potential conflict. Despite these  instances, CCE officials told us that they are careful about what  procurements they assign to the contractors. For example, the CCE  contracting officer\u2019s representative told us that she screens requirements  packages to determine which ones would present a potential conflict if  assigned to a contractor. However, she does not have visibility to the  subcontract level, where the contractor could be a subcontractor to a  potential bidder.", "For purposes of this report, we define a personal conflict of interest as a  situation when an individual, employed by an organization in a position to  materially influence research findings, recommendations, or both, may  lack objectivity or be perceived to potentially lack objectivity because of  his or her personal activities, relationships, or financial interests. For  example, a conflict can occur when a government employee contacts an  offeror during the conduct of an acquisition since this could be construed  as seeking employment. Defense contractor employees are not subject to  the same laws and regulations that are designed to prevent federal  employee conflicts of interests. Moreover, although a new FAR subpart  states that contractors should have a written code of business ethics and  conduct, neither the FAR nor DOD contracting policy requires that  contractor employees be free from conflicts of interest or that they deploy  other safeguards to help ensure that the advice and assistance the  employees provide is not tainted by personal conflicts of interest.  Therefore, mitigating the risks associated with personal conflicts of  interest depends on the integrity of the contractors and their employees.", "For example, one of the contractors providing contract specialists to CCE  has an internal policy for standards of employee ethics and business  conduct that addresses personal conflicts of interest. In addition, the  company provides mandatory ethics training that covers personal conflicts  of interest. According to a company official, rather than having a formal  financial disclosure process, its employees are equipped with knowledge  of what constitutes a personal conflict of interest, and it is the employees\u2019  responsibility to self-report if they have a personal conflict of interest. The  company also has a moonlighting policy that requires employees to obtain  company approval prior to forming any relationship with a for-profit  company."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CCE Is Paying More for Contractor Contract Specialists Than Its Government Employees", "paragraphs": ["CCE is paying more on average for contractor-provided contract  specialists than for its government specialists. We reviewed the hours of  contractor services CCE purchased under orders pursuant to the four  BPAs it established at the end of fiscal year 2006. By the end of fiscal year  2007, CCE had purchased contract support services only from CACI and  The Ravens Group, with the vast majority being from CACI. Agency  officials informed us that CCE has purchased services of two types of  contract specialists: (1) contract specialists II, which are Defense  Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) II-certified/GS-12  equivalents, and (2) contract specialists III, which are DAWIA III- certified/GS-13 equivalents. Because the orders issued pursuant to the  BPAs are time-and-materials contracts, payments to contractors are based  on the number of labor hours billed at a fixed hourly rate\u2014which includes  wages, benefits, and the company\u2019s overhead; general and administrative  expenses; and profit. Because agency officials stated that CCE has  government contract specialists with the same certifications and GS levels  as the contractor contract specialists, we determined that these specialists  were comparable. Therefore, we compared the costs and experience of  the government and contractor employees within these two categories. We  found that the average hourly cost of a contract employee is higher than a  government specialist performing the same duties, as shown in table 2.", "Key elements of our analysis were as follows:    The loaded hourly cost of a government employee includes salary,  costs of the government\u2019s contributions to the employee\u2019s benefits, the  costs to train the employee, the employee\u2019s travel expenses, and the  costs of operations overhead\u2014which are the costs of government  employees who provide support services, such as budget analysts or  human capital staff.", "Government employee salaries and benefits were based on actual data  from one pay period. These data were then compared to hourly cost of  contractor employees ordered during that same pay period. The cost of  a contractor employee is the fully loaded hourly rate the government  pays for these services. We reported the weighted average of those  hourly rates because the agency used two contractors at two different  rates during that pay period.", "We excluded the costs that the government incurs for both government  and contractor-provided specialists. These include the costs of  supplies, facilities, utilities, information technology, and  communications.", "Based on a limited number of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s we reviewed, the contractors  generally had more contracting experience than their government  counterparts. R\u00e9sum\u00e9s were available for six CACI employees supporting  CCE as contract specialists for at least 6 months during fiscal year 2007;  they had from 5 to 32 years, or an average of about 18 years, of  contracting-related experience. In contrast, the five CCE government  contract specialists hired during fiscal year 2007 had from 6 to 17 years, or  an average of about 12 years, of contracting-related experience prior to  joining the agency.

In all, CCE had established blanket purchase agreements  (BPA) with four contractors in September 2006, under General Services  Administration (GSA) schedule contracts, to provide contract specialist  services.", "To determine the extent to which and the reasons CCE is relying on  contractors, we obtained contract specialist staffing levels in fiscal year  2007.

We also interviewed CCE\u2019s commander and  contracting, training, and human capital officials and spoke with officials  from the Army Contracting Agency (ACA), which is CCE\u2019s parent  organization.

To identify the  roles and responsibilities of the contractor contract specialists, we  randomly selected 42 contract actions worked on by contractor contract  specialists during fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007 through June 13 to  determine what work they perform on a daily basis. The intent of this file  review was to understand the contractors\u2019 day-to-day duties; we selected  the files randomly to avoid selection bias. We interviewed management  officials from CACI and The Ravens Group. We also interviewed CACI\u2019s  contract specialists at CCE, but The Ravens Group management would not  allow us to interview their employees. We did not consider this to be a  scope limitation because of the small number (2 to 3) of The Ravens  Group\u2019s contract specialists at CCE during the time of our review. For  comparison, we interviewed government contract specialists at CCE  regarding their roles and responsibilities. We also interviewed government  contracting officers about the roles and responsibilities of the government  and contractor-provided contract specialists.

We identified the number of  hours purchased from each contractor during August 2007 and calculated  the weighted average hourly cost for contract specialist II and III  positions. We reported the weighted average hourly cost because the  agency used two contractors at two different rates in August 2007. To  compare these costs to those for a government contract specialist, we  identified two groups of CCE employees that perform the same tasks and  share similar qualifications, those who were GS-12s with Defense  Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) II certification\u2014which  are equivalent to contractor-provided contract specialist II positions\u2014and  those who were GS-13s with DAWIA III certification\u2014which are  equivalent to contractor-provided contract specialist III positions. We  obtained the actual salaries and the government\u2019s contributions to the  benefits of those contract specialists during the pay period ending on  August 18, 2007. We used data from one pay period to capture the costs of  government contract specialists because CCE has had turnover in these  positions, making it difficult to capture costs throughout the year. From  those data, we determined the average hourly rate and costs of benefits for  these two groups based on 68.3 productive hours during the pay period.  To determine the government\u2019s overhead costs, we used the actual costs  of support services\u2014salaries and government contributions to the benefits  of human capital personnel, manpower personnel, and other support staff  as identified by ACA during the pay period ending on August 18, 2007. CCE  also provided the agency\u2019s expenditures on travel and training during  fiscal year 2007. We then determined the average travel and training costs  per person per hour for only those government employees who were  directly associated with these costs. This average travel and training cost  estimate was applied to all government contract specialists supporting  CCE and may be higher than the agency\u2019s actual cost per person. We  excluded from our analysis the costs for supplies, information technology,  and communication services because the government pays these costs for  contractors as well. We also excluded the costs of facilities and utilities  because the Director of Resource Management told us that ACA could not  specifically identify these costs (which the government also covers for  contractor employees). We compared the average hourly cost\u2014actual  salary, government\u2019s contribution to benefits, and overhead\u2014of the two  groups of CCE contract specialists to the weighted average hourly rate  paid for the respective contractor positions. To determine how CACI and  CCE employee contracting experience differs, we reviewed available  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of contractor and government contract specialists. R\u00e9sum\u00e9s were  available for six CACI contract specialists who have supported CCE for at  least 6 months and were identified by CCE officials as doing the same  work as government contract specialists. Five r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were available for  CCE contract specialists hired in fiscal year 2007, who were identified by  agency officials as doing the same work as the contractors. In reviewing  these r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, we considered previous contracting experience to be the  time spent in jobs related to the field of contracting.", "To determine whether the contract vehicles used to acquire the specialists  were appropriate, we reviewed CCE\u2019s contracting strategies to determine  whether new contracts were awarded to obtain contract specialists or  whether interagency contracts through other federal agencies, such as  GSA\u2019s schedule program, were used. We analyzed CCE\u2019s BPAs with four  contractors\u2014CACI, The Ravens Group, Tai Pedro & Associates, and  Government Contracts Consultants\u2014and their underlying GSA Mission  Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) schedule contracts to  which the BPAs were tied. We also reviewed CCE\u2019s performance work  statements and analyzed the task orders that have been issued for contract  specialists. We reviewed the contract files to obtain documentation, such  as legal reviews and compliance with DOD policies on interagency  contracting. We interviewed CCE officials and GSA officials, including the  Director of GSA\u2019s Management Services Center, Region 10, who is  responsible for the MOBIS schedule. We reviewed reports by GAO and  others concerning the use of interagency contracts. We also reviewed FAR  Subpart 8.4, which sets forth the regulations pertaining to GSA\u2019s schedule  program.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 through March 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
