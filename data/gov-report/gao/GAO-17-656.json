This report: (1) examines the types, use, and sharing of data collected by connected vehicles; (2) determines the extent to which selected automakers' privacy policies for these data align with leading practices; and (3) evaluates related federal roles and efforts, among other objectives. GAO interviewed relevant industry associations, organizations that work on consumer privacy issues, and a non-generalizable sample of 16 automakers selected based on their U.S. passenger vehicle sales. In addition, GAO analyzed selected automakers' privacy policies (written notices and reported practices) against a set of leading privacy practices determined to be relevant to connected vehicles. To identify these practices, GAO reviewed a variety of privacy frameworks developed by federal agencies and others. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and reports, and interviewed agency officials, including those from DOT, the Department of Commerce, and FTC."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Thirteen of the 16 selected automakers in GAO's review offer connected vehicles, and those 13 reported collecting, using, and sharing data from connected vehicles, such as data on a car's location and its operations (e.g., tire pressure).

None of the 13 reported sharing or selling data that could be linked to a consumer for unaffiliated third parties' use. However, as connected vehicles become more commonplace, the extent of data collection, use, and sharing will likely grow.", "Automakers have taken steps, including signing onto a set of privacy principles, to address privacy issues.

FTC has the authority to protect consumer privacy and has issued reports and guidance and conducted workshops on the topic generally as well as on connected vehicles specifically. NHTSA has broad authority over the safety of passenger vehicles and considers the privacy effects and implications of its regulations and guidance. FTC and NHTSA have coordinated on privacy issues related to connected vehicles. However, NHTSA has not clearly defined its roles and responsibilities as they relate to the privacy of vehicle data. In response to emerging vehicle technologies, NHTSA included privacy requirements in a related rulemaking and included privacy expectations in voluntary guidance. Because of these actions, selected automakers and others said NHTSA's role in data privacy was unclear. NHTSA officials acknowledged that some stakeholders may be uncertain about its authority to address privacy issues. Federal standards for internal control require, among other things, that agencies define and communicate key roles and responsibilities. By clearly defining, documenting, and communicating NHTSA's roles and responsibilities in vehicle data privacy, NHTSA would be better positioned to coordinate with other federal agencies and to effectively oversee emerging vehicle technologies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NHTSA define, document, and externally communicate its roles and responsibilities related to the privacy of data generated by and collected from vehicles.

For example, these vehicles can  collect and share data about where drivers go and how they drive,  information that used to be impossible or very difficult to collect. As the  number of connected vehicles grows, private companies, including  automakers, are considering how to use this data to generate revenue.  According to a 2016 industry report, the estimated worldwide revenue  from connected vehicle data could add up to between $450 billion and  $750 billion by 2030. As vehicles generate, collect, and transmit more  data, members of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and  others have recognized the potential for risks to consumers\u2019 privacy. For  example, in 2015, FTC staff reported that information collected by  connected devices, such as vehicles, pose risks to consumers\u2019 privacy  due to the volume of data collected and the lack of consumers\u2019 control  over the practice.", "You asked us to examine privacy issues related to data collected by and  transmitted from vehicles sold domestically.

For  example, automakers may contract with:  telecommunication companies to connect a vehicle to the internet or a  wireless network,  telematics service providers to provide connected vehicle services by  staffing calling centers and processing data, and  content providers to provide optional applications, similar to those  available on a smartphone, that consumers can access through their  vehicle\u2019s console.", "Connected vehicles can offer consumers a range of safety, security, and  convenience services. For example, roadside assistance and automatic  crash notification services allow for voice and data communication  between a vehicle and a person at a call center. In providing these  services, connected vehicles generate, transmit, and receive various  types of data, such as a car\u2019s location. In this report, we categorized data  that are collected or that could be collected by connected vehicles into six  categories as defined and described in figure 2.", "Personal information includes identifying information such as a  consumer\u2019s name, address, e-mail or other information that directly links  back to an individual as well as other information that can be reasonably  linked to a specific consumer, computer, or device. For example, in the  connected vehicle context, data (e.g., GPS coordinates or airbag status)  that can be linked to a vehicle owner is often treated as personal  information. Personal information collected from vehicles varies in its  sensitivity. As reported by FTC staff, some personal information, such as  data on precise geolocation, is considered sensitive due to what it can  reveal about someone (e.g., routines).", "There is no federal comprehensive privacy law governing the collection,  use, and sale of personal information by private sector companies.  Rather, federal statutes and regulations addressing privacy issues in the  private sector are generally tailored to specific purposes, situations, types  of information, or sectors or entities. For example, the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act governs the use and disclosure of an  individual\u2019s health information by certain entities. Federal law also does  not require all companies to have a privacy policy or to notify consumers  of their privacy practices. While no single federal agency oversees data  privacy issues, FTC is a law enforcement agency with a mission to  promote consumer protection and prevent business practices that are  anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair to consumers. The National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) within DOT is responsible for  vehicle safety.", "Many organizations and governments have used the Fair Information  Practice Principles (FIPPs) to guide their privacy practices.

However, none of the automakers\u2019  written notices were in plain language, and their reported data collection,  use, and sharing practices generally were more limited than suggested in  their notices. Automakers reported obtaining consent before collecting  data from vehicles, but they offered few options besides opting in and  opting out of sharing data.", "Transparency: All 13 selected automakers\u2019 written privacy notices were  readily accessible from their public websites, but based on our analysis,  none of the notices was clearly written. As we have previously reported,  FTC and others have recommended that privacy notices should be  readily accessible, clearly written, and describe all the purposes for which  personal data are collected and shared. All of the automakers\u2019 notices  discussed the types of data collected; the potential purposes for collecting  the data, such as to provide the connected services; and some conditions  when data might be shared with third parties. However, none of the  notices was written in plain language, a lack that could make them difficult  for consumers to understand. In addition, most notices did not describe all  of the types and purposes of the connected vehicle data that were being  collected, but instead used broad language to describe this process. For  example, of the 15 notices, only 2 included a list with all of the actual  purposes for which the automaker collects data, and only 1 included a list  with all of the types of personal data collected. Two notices clearly  stated that the purposes identified for data collection were not exhaustive.  Although the use of broad language is common for privacy notices and is  not specific to the auto industry, it does not promote transparency.  Several automakers discussed their other efforts to increase  transparency. For example, one automaker reported revising its website  to offer a consumer-friendly privacy portal after signing onto the  Consumer Protection Privacy Principles. Three other automakers told us  that they display their privacy policies on in-vehicle displays. Two  automakers told us that a recently issued consumer guide could help  promote understanding about this issue. In January 2017, the National  Automobile Dealers Association and Future of Privacy Forum issued a  consumer guide outlining types of vehicle data, practices governing their  collection and use, and potential consumer options; the guide is to be  available at auto dealerships.", "Focused Data Use: Most selected automakers reported limiting their data  collection, use, retention and sharing, but their policies varied. Most  written notices did not clearly identify data sharing and use practices. In  interviews, all 13 selected automakers reported limiting the data collected  from connected vehicles, with some (4 of 13) noting that they only collect  the specific data they need to provide the consumer with services. With  regard to data use, as discussed previously, all 13 automakers reported  they use collected data to provide direct consumer services, such as  roadside assistance, but some automakers (5 of 13) reported they use  such data for marketing other services. Also, all 13 automakers told us  that they use de-identified data when possible, such as when the data are  being used for research and development purposes. Most automakers  (12 of 13) also told us that they limit data retention, but policies varied.  For example, of the 12 automakers that limit retention, 8 told us that their  retention time frames depend on the type of data, while one of them  specified that it retains all connected vehicle data for 6 years regardless  of data type. Two automakers also told us that they are still developing  their policies, so their retention time frames may change. With regard to  data sharing, as mentioned previously, all 13 automakers told us that they  do not typically share collected data with unaffiliated third parties.  However, most automakers\u2019 written privacy notices used vague language  and did not consistently reflect their relatively limited data collection, use,  retention, and sharing. For example, none of the notices stated that the  automaker would not use data for reasons other than those listed in the  policy, and only one notice specified the automaker\u2019s data retention time  frame. In another example, less than half of the notices (6 of 15) stated  that data would not be shared with or sold to non-affiliated third parties,  such as data brokers. Similarly, less than half of the notices (7 of 15)  stated that location and driving behavior data would not be shared with  any parties besides service providers without first obtaining the  consumer\u2019s consent. Only 2 notices included both of these statements  about sharing.", "Data Security: Selected automakers reported using various methods to  safeguard data, including methods that we have reported could be  applied to increase vehicle data security. As we reported in 2016,  automakers can identify and mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities by  using practices such as conducting risk assessments and by employing  technological measures. In interviews, all 13 automakers reported using  policy and technological measures to protect data, such as limiting data  access to certain company staff, using firewalls and encryption, and  using \u201cpenetration testing\u201d and \u201ccode reviews.\u201d In addition, 12  automakers told us that they participate in the Auto-Information Sharing  and Analysis Center, an industry-operated forum that includes  automakers and parts suppliers. The center seeks to heighten awareness  and increase security by allowing industry stakeholders to share threat  information and potential mitigation strategies. Most automakers (9 of 13)  also reported conducting privacy risk assessments, which would involve  determining, among other things, the sensitivity of the collected data and  the potential risks if the data were improperly lost, accessed, or  disclosed.

For example, 5 of these automakers noted  that such subscriber information can be accessed through websites or  mobile applications. One other automaker told us that consumers can  access information on the website or mobile application but must e-mail  or call the automaker to correct it. For other types of vehicle data\u2014such  as location, vehicle health, and driver behavior\u2014consumers\u2019 access  varied among automakers. For example, some (4 of 13) automakers  reported that consumers can access their vehicle health data\u2014such as  tire pressure information\u2014through websites or mobile applications. On  the other hand, 2 automakers told us it is not possible for consumers to  access any data other than subscription-related data. With regard to data  accuracy, the majority (9 of 13) of automakers told us they take steps,  such as validation tests and other quality control measures, to ensure the  accuracy of data collected from connected vehicles.

Also, the majority of  automakers (8 of 13) seek consent again in certain circumstances (e.g.,  when updating a service subscription or if the company\u2019s data use  practices will change significantly). In addition, most of the notices (13 of  15) discussed consumer choices, including how to opt out of sharing data  with the automaker.

A majority of the experts generally agreed  that these general data privacy issues, as described in table 2, apply to  connected vehicle data.", "All selected experts agreed that tracking, loss of consumer control over  personal information, and potentially insecure data were relevant privacy  concerns. They emphasized that using location data to track individuals is  particularly relevant in the context of vehicles. For example, one expert  said location data could paint a picture of an individual\u2019s life, revealing  with whom they associate, the doctors they see, and the places they  frequent. Experts also raised concerns about potentially inappropriate or  illegal uses of location data, such as stalking. All experts expressed  concern about potential data access through a security breach; however,  no one we interviewed, including automakers, selected experts, industry  groups, or government officials was aware of an incident where a database storing connected vehicle data had been compromised  maliciously. Regarding loss of consumer control over personal  information, one expert explained that it is not possible for a consumer to  know exactly what is collected, when, and how the data are used.  Another expert noted that other technologies face this same challenge;  however, consumers may be less aware of what their vehicle is doing  than their computer or smartphone. In addition, vehicles may be used by  multiple individuals, and one expert expressed concern about how  multiple drivers of a car would be informed about data collection. Some  experts thought data sharing and third-party use could become a greater  issue as the auto industry evolves. These issues mirror concerns we  reported on in 2013 and 2015 about the collection, use, and sharing of  personal data by commercial entities.", "The majority of experts we interviewed also agreed that the lack of  sufficiently informed consent (due to low consumer awareness and lack of  company transparency), disparate treatment, and little or no consumer  choice were relevant privacy concerns. Several experts said that, as in  other industries, informed, meaningful consent is difficult to obtain, as  consumers may not read notices and automakers may not present  privacy information clearly. Regarding disparate treatment, two experts  raised the example that data from connected vehicles could potentially be  used to treat consumers differently, and unfairly, in the provision of auto  insurance. Finally, experts raised concerns about consumer choice. For  example, as described above, several experts noted that consumers must  provide consent to all data collection and use or not receive any services.  Another expert said that consumers have limited choice because vehicles  are essential to people\u2019s lives.

However, the majority of  experts we interviewed (13 of 16) did not think that these principles  provide sufficient guidance to inform automakers\u2019 actions or protect  consumers\u2019 privacy. Some experts noted that other industries, such as  the credit card industry, have developed more specific self-regulatory  guidelines that include enforcement measures and better protect  consumers.", "Most selected experts said the Consumer Privacy Protection Principles  lacked specificity about, for example, data use and consumers\u2019 right to  protection. For example, they said the principles used \u201cvague language\u201d  and allowed for data use without consumers\u2019 affirmative consent for  \u201clegitimate business purposes,\u201d which are not clearly defined. To  remedy these issues, six experts said the Consumer Privacy Protection  Principles should be more specific, and four said the principles should  define restrictions on data use. Most experts we interviewed agreed  automakers should limit data retention (13 of 16) and limit data collection  (12 of 16). While the majority of experts thought that automakers should  de-identify data (11 of 15) for focused data use, four experts expressed  skepticism about this practice, including whether it is possible to  completely de-identify data. In 2013, we reported concerns about de- identifying location data. Specifically, we found that some methods of de- identification can allow for an individual to be re-identified, and that  different de-identification methods and data retention practices may lead  to varying levels of consumer protection.", "Other suggestions to improve the Consumer Privacy Protection Principles  included making the principles enforceable, making privacy information  accessible and transparent, explaining the rationale or risks and benefits  of data use, and laying out the trade-offs for consumers. All selected  experts agreed that automakers should be required to obtain explicit  consent for the use of sensitive data or data used in a manner beyond a  consumer\u2019s expectations. In addition, the majority of experts we  interviewed (13 of 16) agreed that automakers should obtain consumer  consent at the time and in the context in which consumers are making a  decision about their data.

According to FTC officials, the FTC  Act applies to privacy and data security issues for connected vehicles.  For example, FTC officials said they could use this authority to bring an  action against an automaker that uses a consumer\u2019s data without his or  her consent or in a way that violates the manufacturer\u2019s stated privacy  policy. To date, FTC has not brought such a public enforcement action  against a connected vehicle manufacturer or its affiliates, but it has  brought such actions against other companies offering services in the  Internet of Things. For example, in 2016, FTC settled a case alleging that  critical security flaws in a company\u2019s routers put the home networks of  hundreds of thousands of consumers at risk. In addition, as the primary  agency with authority over consumer privacy, FTC has ongoing efforts  related to protecting the privacy of consumers that use connected devices  in the Internet of Things, which includes connected vehicles. FTC and  FTC staff have issued guidance, including two reports\u2014Protecting  Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for  Businesses and Policymakers and Internet of Things: Privacy and  Security in a Connected World\u2014both of which outline best practices for  companies. Prior to issuing these reports, FTC held outreach forums to  gather views from a variety of stakeholders on these issues.

However, according to NHTSA officials,  the agency is required to consider the privacy impacts of its regulatory  activities. Specifically, NHTSA is required to conduct privacy impact  assessments and inform the public about any consumer privacy impacts  that may stem from its activities and the motor vehicle safety standards  issued by the agency. Also as part of the rulemaking process, NHTSA  examines privacy as a component of public acceptance (i.e., will the  public accept and use the mandated technology). According to NHTSA  officials, this is an aspect of \u201cpracticability\u201d the agency is required to  consider when it proposes a motor vehicle safety standard under the  Motor Vehicle Safety Act. NHTSA may also address privacy in voluntary  guidance it issues for technologies that it expects will have safety benefits  and that it may regulate in the future.", "Recent efforts by NHTSA to address emerging safety technologies align  with NHTSA\u2019s goals of ensuring safety on the roadways and keeping  pace with trends impacting consumers. These efforts also illustrate how  NHTSA has addressed privacy issues related to emerging technologies.  For example, in December 2016, NHTSA proposed a rulemaking on  vehicle-to-vehicle technology that, according to NHTSA, is expected to  provide safety benefits. The proposed vehicle-to-vehicle rule involves the  broadcast, collection, and storage of data that includes location and other  information about passenger vehicles. As described in the Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking, consumer acceptance of vehicle-to-vehicle  technologies\u2014which will depend on addressing consumer privacy  concerns, among other concerns\u2014is crucial to achieving the expected  safety benefits of this technology. As a result, NHTSA expects  manufacturers to take steps to minimize consumer privacy risks by  providing a clear and transparent vehicle-to-vehicle privacy notice to  consumers.", "Similarly, in September 2016, NHTSA issued the Federal Automated  Vehicles Policy, to speed the delivery of an initial regulatory framework  and best practices to guide manufacturers and other entities in the safe  design, development, testing, and deployment of highly automated  vehicles (e.g., vehicles systems capable of monitoring the driving  environment). As described in this voluntary guidance, NHTSA views  automated vehicle technology as capable of bringing significant safety  benefits. The guidance, among other things, outlined a set of privacy  principles and recommended that automakers manufacturing automated  vehicle technologies adopt these or similar principles. In addition,  manufacturers and other entities are asked to voluntarily provide  information on how the guidance is being followed, including how they are  addressing privacy.", "According to officials from FTC and NHTSA, in recent years the agencies  have collaborated on vehicle data privacy and coordinated their  respective efforts in this area. For example, recently, FTC and NHTSA  staff has met monthly to discuss cybersecurity and privacy issues related  to passenger vehicles. FTC and NHTSA also hosted a workshop in June  2017 on consumer privacy and security issues posed by automated and  connected vehicles. Specifically, the workshop aimed to bring together  multiple industry stakeholders, consumer advocates, academics, and  government regulators to discuss various issues, including potential  benefits and challenges posed by the collection of connected and  automated vehicle data.", "In addition to FTC and NHTSA, other federal agencies doing work on  privacy issues include the National Institute of Standards and Technology  and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  within the Department of Commerce. For example, in January 2017, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology issued a report  recommending practices for including privacy risk assessments when  designing federal systems, and that according to agency officials, could  also serve as guidance for private companies, including automakers. In  addition, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  has convened multistakeholder processes with industry and other  stakeholders that focused on developing voluntary codes of conduct for  the commercial use of emerging technologies, such as facial recognition  technology.

However, NHTSA has not  clearly defined and communicated its roles and responsibilities related to  the privacy of connected vehicle data to stakeholders. Specifically,  according to some automakers and all industry associations we spoke  with, NHTSA\u2019s recent actions on emerging vehicle technologies have left  stakeholders without a clear understanding of the agency\u2019s role with  respect to privacy. For example, three automakers noted that NHTSA  appears to be more involved in data privacy as reflected by the Federal  Automated Vehicles Policy. One automaker also questioned whether  NHTSA was coordinating on data privacy issues with other relevant  federal agencies. Five industry associations told us that NHTSA appears  to have an interest in the area of privacy. Four of these associations also  told us that NHTSA might have a role in monitoring its members\u2019 use of  connected vehicle data, but the four were not sure. In addition, in public  comments filed on the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, one auto  industry trade group questioned whether considering privacy issues is  consistent with NHTSA\u2019s safety mission and suggested that certain  privacy provisions in the policy exceeds NHTSA\u2019s current statutory  authority. In contrast, all 11 automakers that discussed this topic and all  industry associations in our review told us that FTC\u2019s role in this area is  clear. For example, representatives of both auto industry associations  told us that they had chosen to notify the FTC about their members\u2019  implementation of the Consumer Privacy Protection Principles because  FTC would be the federal agency to enforce and hold automakers  accountable to these principles. NHTSA officials acknowledged that some  stakeholders may be uncertain whether and, if so, to what extent it has  authority to address any privacy issues with respect to motor vehicles.", "The Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for  agencies to identify, analyze, and respond to significant changes, and in  response to such changes, to periodically reevaluate and further define  key agency roles and responsibilities.

These standards are intended, among other things, to  help agencies manage change associated with shifting environments and  evolving demands and priorities. We have also previously found that  interagency collaboration is enhanced when agencies, among other  things, ensure that their roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. By  agreeing on and clearly defining roles and responsibilities, agencies can  clarify which agency will do what, organize their joint and individual  efforts, and facilitate better decision making. As previously described,  NHTSA and FTC have collaborated on the potential privacy risks posed  by new vehicle technologies; clarifying NHTSA\u2019s role could therefore  further enhance collaboration with FTC and other federal counterparts.  Furthermore, if NHTSA more clearly defined its roles and responsibilities  for protecting the privacy of connected vehicle data, industry stakeholders  would have a better understanding of how the agency intends to oversee  the privacy of data generated by emerging vehicle safety technologies  and which agency is responsible for privacy as the connected vehicle  landscape continues to evolve."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, connected vehicles have become more common, offering  consumers a number of benefits but also increasing the potential for  privacy risks.

However,  experts and others have raised a number of consumer privacy concerns,  including whether such data\u2014including sensitive information such as a  driver\u2019s location and behavior\u2014are being adequately protected. No single  federal agency oversees data privacy issues. However, FTC has the  primary role\u2014one that is clearly defined and reinforced through its  enforcement actions against companies that have engaged in unfair and  deceptive practices, such as violating their own privacy practices or failing  to implement reasonable security practices. Although NHTSA has a clear  role in overseeing the safety of the estimated 265 million passenger  vehicles on U.S. roads today, industry stakeholders are unclear about  NHTSA\u2019s role with respect to vehicle data privacy, due to recent agency  actions on automated vehicles and vehicle-to-vehicle technology.", "With the anticipated increase in the number of connected vehicles on  U.S. roads in the near future\u2014and with it, the financial incentives for  automakers and others to more widely collect, use, and share vehicle and  driver data\u2014it is important for NHTSA to define and communicate its  privacy roles and responsibilities. If NHTSA makes its roles and  responsibilities clearer, industry stakeholders will likely have a better  understanding of its oversight role for emerging vehicle technologies, and  NHTSA will likely be more effective in collaborating with FTC and other  federal agencies. However, if that opportunity is missed, consumers may  not fully embrace emerging technologies with potential safety benefits,  such as vehicle-to-vehicle technology and automated vehicles.
