For example, state and local governments  may offset increased costs in one program by making cuts to other  programs where they have more flexibility to adjust certain types of  spending. Alternatively, if their ability to adjust spending is limited, they  may seek additional revenue by increasing existing taxes or user charges  or imposing new ones. For example, some programs may have spending  that is defined or required in state law and must be funded annually,  regardless of broader economic circumstances. Other spending may not  be subject to legal or other requirements and is thus subject to decisions  influenced by current fiscal pressures.", "Changes in the makeup of state and local government services,  spending, and revenues may reflect economic or demographic changes,  a change in spending priorities, or changes in federal policy. Fiscal  pressures can result from spending growth or revenue declines that are  not the direct result of current state and local policy choices. These  choices may instead reflect automatic spending growth (for example, in  response to population shifts or an increase in the number of people  eligible for government programs) or declines in revenue due to changes  in the economy (for example, a shift from goods to services without a  corresponding shift in the tax base).

In light of the uncertainty, some states have  engaged in \u201cstress tests\u201d of their own budgets using various revenue and  expenditure scenarios to determine if they are in sufficient fiscal health to  weather a mild-to-severe recession.", "Moody\u2019s Analytics reported in 2019 that, based on the results of stress  tests it performed on all fifty states, 28 states have the level of cash  reserves necessary to manage a moderate recession without having to  raise taxes or cut spending. Some experts further noted that state and  local governments that have not been able to strengthen their cash  reserves could undergo more severe fiscal stress in an economic  downturn and require a greater level of assistance.", "Some experts also raised concerns related to the effects of federal  government shutdowns and continuing resolutions on state and local  governments and their ability to plan for and implement federally-funded  programs. In all but 4 of the last 42 years, Congress has passed  continuing resolutions to keep government services in operation until an  agreement is reached on final appropriations bills. In some years, when  new appropriations or a continuing resolution have not been enacted on  time, this lapse in appropriations\u2014or funding gap\u2014caused the  government to partially shut down, which halted some activities at federal  agencies until appropriations were passed.", "A number of experts told us that interruptions in appropriations and  subsequent delays in federal grants caused by shutdowns, for example,  may require states to spend additional unbudgeted funds to ensure  continuity of services in certain federally-funded programs, such as food  and nutrition and transportation. According to one expert, not all state or  local governments are in a position to access those funds in a timely  manner. Furthermore, one expert noted the impacts of continuing  resolutions on local governments by compressing the time available for  federal grant applications. As a result, some applicants (e.g., cities or  other localities) may not apply or miss deadlines for certain federal grant  programs.", "We and others have reported on the effects of government shutdowns  and its impact on some states. For example, we reported on the partial  shutdown of the federal government in October 2013, which lasted for a  period of 16 days due to a lapse in appropriations. Our report showed  that even if a state wanted to use its funds to continue services for a  federally-funded program, it might not have had sufficient liquid assets to  do so quickly.", "At that time, at least 12 states publicly reported that funding for certain  grant programs was only confirmed through October, meaning the  funding may not have been available if the shutdown had continued into  November. Some of these states expected to discontinue certain  federally-funded programs or services if the shutdown had extended into  November, while others expressed uncertainty regarding how they would  have proceeded if the shutdown had been longer.", "Physical infrastructure. Physical infrastructure at the state and local  government level includes a broad range of systems\u2014including  highways, mass transit, rail, water, and sewer systems. A number of  experts pointed to concerns related to an aging infrastructure and the  fiscal pressures that infrastructure demands place on state and local  governments. The cost of repairing and upgrading the nation\u2019s surface  transportation infrastructure to meet current and future demands is  estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Further, our 2017 report  noted that estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency put  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs at approximately  $655 billion nationwide during the next 20 years.", "State and local governments own a large portion of the nation\u2019s physical  infrastructure, while the federal government provides support to the sector  in the form of grants, bonds, and loans. Funds made available from the  Highway Trust Fund are distributed to states in the form of grants for  eligible projects. The federal government also supports additional  infrastructure spending through tax-exempt or tax-credit bonds, which  provide a tax exclusion or tax credit to owners of municipal bonds issued  by state and local governments. Further, through various loan  programs, such as the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and  Innovation Act program, the government supports project financing.  State and local governments also generate revenues for transportation  projects through their own sources including user fees and taxes.", "A number of experts shared concerns about the future of federal funding  for state and local surface transportation needs. One expert  acknowledged the benefits of highway grant programs provided through  the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act. However, this expert  also recognized that the act is set to expire in 2020 and its future, along  with other sources of federal funding through the Highway Trust Fund,  remains uncertain. We have also reported that traditional federal  funding sources for surface transportation, such as the Highway Trust  Fund, are eroding and the federal government lacks a long-term  sustainable strategy for funding surface transportation.", "Moreover, experts noted that physical infrastructure needs represent only  one among many competing priorities for state and local government  spending. One expert expressed concern that the availability of state and  local discretionary spending on infrastructure needs and maintenance will  increasingly be affected by growing pressures from other mandatory  spending categories, such as Medicaid.", "Many states have looked to modify or enhance other sources of revenue,  such as the gas tax, to help meet highway transportation costs. According  to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), since 2013, 31 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation that will or  may increase their motor fuel tax to support surface transportation costs.  Even so, two experts raised concerns about the viability of the gas tax as  a reliable revenue source since gasoline consumption has declined.  Further, NCSL reported that many states have received federal funding to  study and pilot user-based alternative mechanisms through the Surface  Transportation System Funding Alternative Program.", "We and others have also reported that some states have recognized the  need for an alternative funding mechanism to meet future revenue  demands. Some options that states have considered or implemented  include tying gas tax rates to inflation or population, taxes based on the  price of fuel, and taxing miles traveled instead of gas purchased\u2014also  referred to as mileage-based user fees.", "Further, experts pointed to the lack of a clearly articulated federal  highway infrastructure policy and the implications for state and local  governments. For example, one expert noted that states need the ability  to plan multiyear programs for large-scale transportation projects and that  an open dialogue about federal program implementation or renewal with  all three levels of government could help state and local governments  better plan for the future. This expert added that the uncertainty that state  and local governments experience could be reduced if the federal  government could better inform and communicate with state and local  governments regarding legislative policy developments and was willing to  engage in conversations with state and local governments.", "Tax policy. Experts discussed selected provisions of the law commonly  known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and other tax-related issues  that could exacerbate or help ease fiscal pressures for state and local  governments. Enacted in December 2017, TCJA included significant  changes to corporate and individual tax law, with implications for state  and local government tax collections. In particular, for individual  taxpayers, for tax years 2018 through 2025, tax rates were lowered for  nearly all income levels, some deductions from taxable income were  changed (personal exemptions were eliminated, while the standard  deduction was increased), and certain credits, such as the child tax credit,  were expanded.", "A number of experts agreed that with just over 2 years since its passage,  it is still too early to fully assess the effect of TCJA\u2019s provisions on state  and local government revenues. States are continuing to incorporate  some of the provisions of TCJA into their own tax codes. Some states  have adopted the federal definition of taxable income as a starting point  for state tax calculations, while other states use the federal definition of  adjusted gross income as a starting point. The choices states make  regarding their linkage to these definitions have implications for their state  tax revenues.", "Further, because TCJA placed a $10,000 annual cap on the federal  deduction for taxpayers\u2019 state and local taxes (SALT) from taxable  income beginning on January 1, 2018, some high-income taxpayers  prepaid their personal income and property taxes to take advantage of  the uncapped SALT deduction in 2017. As a result, some states  experienced an increase in revenues in late 2017. According to S&P  Global Ratings, the imposition of SALT caps incentivized many taxpayers  to accelerate their income tax payments into December 2017, but  consequently made December 2018 tax payments look smaller by  comparison. It also further reduced December 2018 payments by  lessening the incentive for many taxpayers to make early income tax  payments.", "Most experts raised the TCJA\u2019s elimination of advance refunding for tax- exempt municipal bonds as a potential source of fiscal stress for the state  and local government sector. State and local governments use these tax- exempt bonds to finance a broad range of projects and activities,  including public infrastructure. Prior to its elimination, the provision  allowed state and local governments to take advantage of favorable  interest rates to reduce borrowing costs, restructure debt, and free up  resources for other projects or investments. A number of experts  explained that the elimination of the provision could result in increasing  project costs\u2014ultimately increasing infrastructure and debt costs over  time.", "Some experts highlighted overall concerns about states\u2019 eroding sales tax  base. For example, the country has transitioned to a more service-based  economy, due to changes in consumption. As services have begun to  represent a larger and growing share of GDP, there has been an erosion  of states\u2019 sales tax bases.", "In contrast, a number of experts pointed to the outcome of the U.S.  Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. and its potential  for stimulating growth in sales tax revenue. The Court in South Dakota  v. Wayfair, Inc. held that states could require out-of-state sellers to collect  and remit sales taxes on purchases made from those out-of-state sellers,  even if the seller does not have a substantial physical presence in the  taxing state. A number of experts noted that remote sales taxes will likely  increase state and local sales tax revenues, but that states are still  realizing the effects of the ruling on their revenues.", "Following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision, numerous states that levy a  sales tax and the District of Columbia have taken some kind of  action to enforce remote sales tax collections. According to NCSL, as of  January 2020, 43 states and the District of Columbia currently require  remote sales tax collection. Some states have taken legislative action to  change their state laws in response to the outcome of the Wayfair case,  while some collection efforts have been led by departments of  revenue if statutory authority was already provided. However, it is too  soon to determine the full effects of the Wayfair case on states\u2019 sales tax  revenue.", "Natural disasters. A number of experts pointed to the increasing fiscal  pressure that state and local governments are under and will continue to  face, given the increasing frequency, severity, and cost of natural  disasters. We and others have reported on the increasing trend in the  number of natural disasters and related costs. For example, in 2018  alone, there were 14 weather and climate disaster events with losses  exceeding $1 billion each across the United States with total costs of at  least $91 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration. Further, disaster costs are projected to increase as  extreme weather events become more frequent and intense because of  climate change as observed and projected by the U.S. Global Change  Research Program and the National Academies.", "A number of experts acknowledged that the federal government plays a  critical role in providing disaster assistance to state and local  governments and stressed the need for continued financial support.  Some experts discussed the importance of federal assistance since  states may need to pay for immediate disaster costs, such as debris  removal, out of current expenditures and may not have the funds  available to cover those costs. Local governments in particular are  generally the first responders in the event of a disaster, often times using  their own personnel and funding in these circumstances.", "Some experts noted that these localities and communities may lack the  available cash reserves needed for disaster response-related resources,  such as public safety overtime and other types of public assistance. One  expert underscored the federal government\u2019s role as an economic  stabilizer in providing assistance to local governments during disasters.", "Given the increase in federal disaster spending, we and others have  underscored the importance of finding ways to address the growing costs  of natural disasters, citing investment in mitigation as one approach.  Some experts we interviewed also pointed to the importance of states\u2019  adoption of mitigation strategies as a way to help states and localities  reduce the environmental and fiscal effects of natural disasters. For  example, the Pew Charitable Trusts reported in 2020 that a number of  states and localities are looking to invest in infrastructure projects that will  help mitigate the potential effects of disasters before they occur.", "For example, according to Pew Charitable Trusts, one state plans to limit  development and move residents out of areas most prone to flooding,  while improving infrastructure in communities on higher ground that are  likely to receive displaced populations from neighboring towns. Another  state plans to invest its federal funds in flood control, removing homes  from high-risk areas and helping local governments pay for projects.  Further, one locality plans to spend $500 million on infrastructure  upgrades over the next few years, after its residents voted to authorize a  bond to address flooding and other concerns.", "Further, one expert stressed the importance of the Disaster Recovery  Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) in developing state and local mitigation  programs, in addition to strengthening federal, state, and local  relationships in disaster response and recovery efforts. Among other  things, the act increases the federal investment in predisaster mitigation,  increases reimbursement caps for state and local governments on a  range of disaster costs, and allows state and local governments to  administer housing assistance grants. We reported in 2019 that it is too  early to tell what effect implementation of DRRA will have on state and  local resilience.", "In addition, economic literature we reviewed highlighted the potential  long-term implications of natural disasters and climate change on state  and local governments\u2019 municipal bond ratings. For example, credit rating  firms\u2014Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and S&P Global  Ratings\u2014indicated that they are considering the effects of climate change  in their credit analyses of state and local governments. Specifically, S&P  Global Ratings has identified risk factors related to the environment,  among other credit risk factors, such as extreme weather events and  flooding that can affect an issuer\u2019s ability to meet full and timely debt  service.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and other interested parties.

Specifically, the objectives of our review were to (1) examine recent  trends in state and local government expenditures and revenues; and (2)  synthesize expert views regarding the effect of federal policy on state and  local government fiscal pressures.", "To describe recent trends in state and local government expenditures and  revenues, we analyzed categories of aggregate data on state and local  expenditures and revenues using inflation-adjusted data from the Bureau  of Economic Analysis\u2019s (BEA) National Income and Product Accounts  (NIPA) from 1998 to 2018. We analyzed changes in the shares of state  and local expenditures and revenues as a percent of total expenditures  and revenues respectively from 1998 to 2018. We determined that the  NIPA data were the most recent available data for the purpose of  examining aggregate state and local government revenue and  expenditure trends. The NIPA data do not always match state and local  government budget data due to methodological differences between how  BEA calculates NIPA data and how state and local governments compute  their budget data. We also reviewed our prior reports and those of others  to identify what is known about these trends and the factors that affect  them.", "To analyze trends in state and local government revenues and  expenditures among states, we used the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau)  government finance data and gross domestic product (GDP) price index  data from BEA to calculate inflation-adjusted values of selected  expenditure and revenue categories for each state (including the District  of Columbia) and for the United States for 1997 to 2017. Data for 1997,  2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 are based on the Bureau\u2019s Census of  Governments, which surveys all state and local governments in the  United States. Data for the other years are based on the Bureau\u2019s Annual  Survey of Government Finances. In these years, local government  finance statistics are based in part on a sample of local governments in  the United States. We determined that the Bureau\u2019s data were the most  comprehensive for the purpose of examining trends in state and local  government expenditures and revenues. However, due in part to  definitional differences among the states, such as those of coverage  (what constitutes a government entity) or measurement (cash or accrual  accounting), the data cannot be used as financial statements to measure  a government\u2019s fiscal condition or to calculate a surplus or deficit. We  assessed the reliability of the data we used for this analysis and  determined that BEA NIPA and the Bureau\u2019s data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Our data reliability assessment included  reviewing relevant documentation, interviewing knowledgeable BEA and  Bureau officials, and reviewing the data to identify obvious errors or  outliers.", "We examined patterns between state and local government revenue  growth and growth in overall state and local government spending using  data from the Bureau. For each state and the District of Columbia, we  assessed how fast each expenditure and revenue category grew between  1997 and 2017 and calculated the average annualized growth rate based  on year-to-year changes for each selected expenditure and revenue  category. For each expenditure and revenue growth rate calculation, we  identified the U.S. average annualized growth rate and the minimum and  maximum growth rates across states.", "Because changes in the levels of expenditure and revenue categories  can be affected by changes in state fiscal capacity\u2014such as increased  tax revenues due to population growth\u2014we compared the average  annual compound growth rate for each category of spending and  revenues to the average annual compound growth rate in state gross  domestic product (GDP). We chose state GDP as a proxy for each state\u2019s  resources or fiscal capacity. We determined state GDP to be the most  appropriate representation of a state\u2019s total resources or fiscal capacity.  To compare the growth in these categories relative to growth in each  state\u2019s resources, we compared the growth rate for each selected  expenditure and revenue category to the growth rate in each state\u2019s GDP  resources from 1997 to 2017. When expenditures in a state are growing  faster than GDP, the share of the state\u2019s resources that are dedicated to  state and local government services is growing. Over the long run, such  growth could create a fiscal pressure. This analysis also identified the  number of states where growth in a category was (1) greater than GDP  for that state or (2) less than GDP for that state.", "We also examined patterns between state and local revenue growth and  growth in state and local spending and federal grants using data from the  Bureau. For each state and the District of Columbia, we plotted the  average annual growth rate in general revenues against the average  annual growth rate in general expenditures from 1997 to 2017. We then  counted the number of states in which spending grew faster, slower, and  at the same rate as general revenues. We also analyzed growth in own- source revenues against growth in federal grant revenues using the same  approach. We then counted the number of states in which own-source  revenue grew faster, slower, and at the same rate as federal grants.", "To identify expenditure categories in the Bureau\u2019s data, we selected all of  the Bureau\u2019s general expenditure categories. We included other  expenditure categories, such as interest on debt and salaries and wages  to document their low growth rates. We included insurance benefits and  repayments because of its high growth rate and its inclusion of pension  benefits, which experts identified as a growing expense in some states.", "As part of our analysis of trends in state and local government  expenditures, we analyzed data from the National Association of State  Budget Officers (NASBO) on state rainy day fund balances and general  fund expenditures. NASBO\u2019s Fiscal Survey of States surveys state  budget officers in 50 states on general fund receipts, expenditures,  annual tax and revenue changes, and balance data, which includes rainy  day fund balances. We calculated state rainy day fund balances as a  percentage of state general fund expenditures among states from 1998 to  2018. We then plotted the median state rainy day fund balances for each  year from 1998 to 2018. We assessed the reliability of the data we used  for this analysis and determined that NASBO\u2019s data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Our data reliability assessment included  reviewing relevant documentation and consulting knowledgeable officials  about the data.", "To obtain expert views regarding the effect of federal policy on state and  local government fiscal pressures, we conducted a series of structured  interviews by telephone or in person with a nongeneralizable sample of  individuals representing organizations with recognized expertise in state  and local budgeting and finance economics, public policy, and  intergovernmental issues. To select these experts, we reviewed their  published or other publicly available work, professional affiliations, or  recommendations by other experts. These considerations informed  whether the experts we selected would be knowledgeable or have  expertise related to state and local government fiscal and  intergovernmental issues. We identified three categories of experts and  selected individuals within each category. These three categories  included: (1) officials representing state and local government  organizations; (2) providers of financial and credit risk information, such  as credit rating agencies; and (3) researchers representing think tanks  with expertise in state and local government finance, including taxes,  budgeting, and intergovernmental relations. We spoke with  representatives from the following 17 organizations as part of our  structured interviews:  1.  The Council of State Governments  2.  Federal Funds Information for States  4.  International City/County Management Association  5.  Moody\u2019s Analytics  6.  National Association of Counties  7.  National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers  8.

The United States Conference of Mayors  The results from the structured interviews are not generalizable and  represent the opinions of the individuals from the 17 organizations we  interviewed. However, we took steps to obtain opinions from experts with  different types of expertise and perspectives. For each question in the  structured interview, we coded, organized, and analyzed the responses to  develop common themes among the responses, based on the issues that  emerged most frequently. We use the terms \u201ca number of,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d and  \u201cmost\u201d to describe the number of experts who responded on a particular  issue.
