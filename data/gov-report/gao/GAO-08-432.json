GAO was asked to answer these questions: (1) to what extent are there undisbursed grant balances in expired grant accounts and do they share any program characteristics?; and (2) do these expired grants share grant management challenges and how have federal agencies improved grant closeout and diminished undisbursed balances? To do this, GAO analyzed grant balance data from the largest federal grant payment system; reviewed grant management problems and corrective actions from more than 150 audit reports; and reviewed guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Code of Federal Regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During calendar year 2006, about $1 billion in undisbursed funding remained in expired grant accounts in the largest civilian payment system for grants--the Payment Management System (PMS). PMS is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and makes payments for about 70 percent of grants and for 12 federal entities. Undisbursed funding is funding the federal government has obligated through a grant agreement, but which the grantee has not entirely spent. Among all of the expired grant accounts in PMS that remained open, these undisbursed funds typically represented about 1 percent of the total funds originally made available for these grants--meaning grantees had spent most of their available funds. However, when expired grant accounts with no funds remaining were excluded and the focus was narrowed to just expired grant accounts with undisbursed balances, GAO found the amount of undisbursed funding represented, on average, about 26 percent of the original funding made available. The expired but still open grant accounts were associated with thousands of grantees and over 325 different federal programs. GAO also found that expired grant accounts with the largest undisbursed balances in PMS for calendar years 2003 through 2006 shared a few common program characteristics. However, the results could not be compared to program characteristics for all closed federal grants or all closed grants using PMS, during this period, due to the burden of collecting comparable data for all closed federal grants from eight other federal civilian payments systems or for all closed grants from PMS. Past audits of federal agencies by GAO and Inspectors General and annual performance reports by at least 8 federal agencies in 2006 and 2007 suggested that grant management challenges including grant closeouts and undisbursed balances are a long-standing problem. Closeout procedures ensure grantees have met all financial requirements, provided final reports, and that unused funds are deobligated. The audits generally attributed the problems to inadequacies in awarding agencies' grant management processes, including closeouts as a low management priority, inconsistent closeout procedures, poorly timed communications with grantees, or insufficient compliance or enforcement. However, when federal agencies, such as the Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice, and the Environmental Protection Agency, took corrective actions, there were improvements in grant closeouts and resolution of undisbursed funding. The actions taken by these three agencies generally focused on making grant closeouts a higher agency management priority, as noted in their recent performance reports, and on improving overall closeout processing. Using federal payment systems to track undisbursed funding in expired grant accounts and including the status of grant closeouts in annual performance reports could raise the visibility of the problem both within the agency and governmentwide, and lead to improvements in grant closeouts and minimize undisbursed balances. OMB circulars do not currently require federal agencies to track and report on undisbursed funding in expired grant accounts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s reliance on grants to achieve national objectives  and respond to significant trends, such as an aging population and  changing threats to national security, has grown significantly. According to  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates, from 2000 through  2006, federal grant awards to nonfederal entities, such as states and  nonprofit organizations, increased from $300 billion to over $450 billion.  Grants now represent about one-sixth of the federal budget. If even a small  fraction of total grant funding is not spent in a prudent and timely fashion,  it can create potential problems for the federal government. The existence  of unspent funds can hinder the achievement of national objectives in  various ways, such as leaving projects incomplete, preventing the  reallocation of scarce resources to address other needs, or making federal  funds more susceptible to improper spending or accounting as monitoring  diminishes over time. In times of constrained resources, it is vital for  federal agencies to maximize the performance of their programs in order  to meet long-term goals.", "In the spring of 2006, your subcommittee concluded there was a need for  increased accountability and transparency for unspent funds in federal  programs and agencies. You requested that we review the status of grant  funds that grantees had not drawn down by the time the grants\u2019 period of  availability had ended (i.e., \u201cexpired\u201d). To respond to your request, we  identified and analyzed data from the largest federal civilian grant payment  management system\u2014accounting for about 70 percent of federal  disbursements to grantees in 2006\u2014to focus on agency-level grant  accounts that remained open after their expiration date (hereafter, referred to as \u201cexpired grant accounts\u201d) and had unspent funds in the form  of undisbursed balances. Undisbursed balances are funds that the federal  government has obligated by entering into a grant agreement, but the  grantee has not drawn down (\u201cdisbursed\u201d). These funds were obligated  from the federal perspective. However, once the grant\u2019s period of  availability to the grantee has expired, the grant could be closed out and  the funds deobligated by the awarding agency. Grant closeout procedures  ensure that grantees have met all financial requirements, provided their  final reports, and returned any undisbursed balances.", "Based on your request, this report answers these questions: (1) to what  extent are there undisbursed grant balances in expired grant accounts and  do they share any program characteristics?; and (2) do these expired  grants share grant management challenges and what actions have federal  agencies taken to improve grant closeout and diminish undisbursed  balances?", "To address our objectives, we analyzed data on undisbursed balances in  expired agency grant accounts and reviewed federal regulations, audit  reports, and annual performance reports relating to grant closeouts. To  identify the status of undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts, we  collected and analyzed 4 calendar years (from 2003 through 2006) of  quarterly payment data for grants with defined spending periods that  executed payments through the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS). PMS is the largest  of the nine civilian federal payment systems. In 2006, it handled about 70  percent of all federal grant disbursements. As of August 2007, PMS  provided payment services to nine federal departments, an independent  agency, a government corporation, and the Office of National Drug  Control Policy (ONDCP) within the Executive Office of the President. We  used program information from the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance (CFDA) to identify key program characteristics that were  associated with the expired grant accounts in PMS. We analyzed payment  data for expired grant accounts in PMS, from 2003 through 2006, as a  complete set of current PMS customers, rather than analyzing specific  federal agencies or grant programs. To identify federal guidelines on grant  closeouts, we reviewed related OMB circulars and agency regulations. To  identify federal guidelines on performance reporting we reviewed related  OMB circulars. To identify what other auditors found and recommended  as strategies to diminish unspent funds in expired grant accounts, we  conducted a Web-based literature search for related audit reports and  reviewed over 150 reports that we and various federal Inspectors General  (IG) issued from 2000 through 2007, and contacted officials from several  federal IG offices. In addition, we reviewed the 2006 and 2007  Performance and Accountability Reports (PAR) for 15 cabinet-level  executive departments and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Appendix I provides more information on our methodology and on PMS  and CFDA. We conducted this performance audit from October 2006 to  June 2008, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)  provides descriptions of these grant programs, as well as other domestic  assistance programs.", "The design and implementation of federal grants varies. For example,  grant programs generally use one of three ways to award funding to  grantees. Formula grants award funds based on distribution formulas  prescribed by legislation or regulation. Project grants generally award  funding for specific periods or specific projects, products, or services. As a  third method, some grant programs award funds using a hybrid of formula  and project-based awarding methods. In addition, federal agencies use a  variety of organizational approaches to implement grant programs. Some  agencies administer many grants through multiple, decentralized  components, while other agencies have small, centralized grant-making  offices that administer only a few grant programs.", "Federal grants are typically subject to a wide range of requirements  derived from a combination of program statutes, agency regulations, and  other guidance. They are also subject to many crosscutting requirements  that apply to most federal assistance programs, including statutory  provisions applicable to recipients of federal funds and administrative  requirements such as audit and record keeping and the allowability of  costs.", "As a general rule, grant programs are governed by detailed legislation as  well as implementing regulations issued by the responsible agency. Prior  to 1988, each agency issued regulations to govern its grant management,  and OMB Circular No. A-102, Grants and Cooperative Agreements With  State and Local Governments, also provided some governmentwide  guidance for grants to state and local governments. OMB Circular No.  A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and  Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other  Non-Profit Organizations, provided some guidance for grants to other  types of grantees like hospitals and other nonprofit institutions. In 1987, a  memorandum from the President directed OMB to revise Circular No.  A-102 to specify uniform, governmentwide terms and conditions for grants  to state and local governments, and directed executive branch  departments and agencies to propose and issue common regulations  adopting these terms and conditions verbatim, modified where necessary  to reflect inconsistent statutory requirements. Pursuant to this direction,  the first iteration of what has come to be known as the \u201ccommon rule\u201d  system was published on June 9, 1987.", "There are currently a number of OMB circulars on grants, which provide  guidance only to federal (grantor) agencies; they do not apply directly to  grantees. Therefore, each federal agency has issued largely identical sets  of regulations that prescribe requirements that are binding on their  grantees. These regulations are referred to as the \u201ccommon rules.\u201d Each  agency\u2019s common rule regulations are codified in the Code of Federal  Regulations.", "Grant programs also share a common life cycle for administering the  grants: announcement of grant opportunity, application, award,  postaward, and closeout. During the award stage, the federal awarding  agency enters into an agreement with the grantee. The grant agreement  stipulates the terms and conditions for the use of grant funds such as the  period of time funds are available for the grantee\u2019s use, as noted by a start  and end date. In addition, the awarding agency establishes an account in a  federal payment system to execute payments to the grantee.", "During the postaward stage, the grantee carries out the requirements of  the agreement and requests payments, while the awarding agency  approves payments and oversees the grantee. The Payment Management  System (PMS), operated by HHS, went online in 1984 and, as of 2006, was  the largest of the nine civilian federal payment systems. The system, which  handled about 70 percent of all federal grant disbursements in 2006, serves  nine federal departments, an independent agency, a government  corporation, and ONDCP. Appendix I provides a description of PMS and  appendix II provides a recent list of department- and agency-level PMS  customers. According to HHS, PMS is a full-service centralized grants  payment and cash management system. The system is fully automated to  receive payment requests, edit them for accuracy and content, transmit the  payment to either the Federal Reserve Bank or the U.S. Treasury for  deposit into the grantee\u2019s bank account, and record the payment  transactions and corresponding disbursements to the appropriate  accounts. Federal agencies pay HHS a service fee for maintaining accounts  and executing payments through PMS. PMS continues to charge agency  customers a servicing fee until an account is closed.", "When the grantee has completed all the work associated with a grant  agreement or the end date for the grant has arrived, or both, the awarding  agency and grantee close out the grant. Closeout procedures ensure that  grantees have met all financial requirements, provided their final reports,  and returned any unexpended balances. To close out a grant, federal  regulations generally require that the    awarding agency ensures the grantee has completed all work and    grantee settles (liquidates) all obligations 90 days after grant end date;    grantee submits all final financial, performance, and other reports within  90 days of grant end date; and    grantee requests an extension of the reporting deadline from the awarding  agency, if required.", "These requirements apply when the awarding agency has specified a  funding period for the grant (a start and end date) and has prohibited the  grantee from having carryover balances. In this report, we refer to grants  that were not closed after their end date as \u201cexpired\u201d grants and PMS grant  accounts that remained open after the grant\u2019s end date as \u201cexpired grant  accounts.\u201d", "PMS issues a quarterly report to its customers, referred to as the \u201ccloseout  report,\u201d listing expired grant accounts that remain open, and for each  account includes data on the funds made available and the amount of  funds disbursed (i.e., \u201cdrawn down\u201d or \u201ccharged\u201d). GAO recommended  HHS develop and distribute this type of report in 1987. HHS lists an  account on a quarterly PMS closeout report if the end date for the account  was 3 months old and there was no disbursement in the preceding 9  months.", "The closeout is an important grant management procedure because it is  the final point of accountability for grantees. An undisbursed balance in an  expired grant account can be an indication of a potential grant  management problem. Grantees that do not expend their funding may not  be meeting the program objectives for the intended beneficiaries. These  balances may also suggest that awarding agencies or grantees, or both,  may not be managing the funding efficiently or effectively. Effective grants  management, including the completion of grant closeout, increases the  likelihood that awarded grants contribute to agency goals.", "An agency or grant program office can track its performance in closing  grants and other grant management procedures using a variety of  measures. In this report, we use the amount of undisbursed funding to  assess one aspect of the performance of the expired grants\u2014their  financial status. Other types of measures track other aspects of  performance, such as the grants\u2019 service quality and customer satisfaction.

GPRA is part of a statutory framework that seeks to  create a more focused, results-oriented management and decision-making  process within both Congress and the executive branch. The act requires  federal agencies to develop strategic plans with long-term strategic goals,  annual goals linked to achieving the long-term goals, and annual reports  on the results achieved.

IG reports identified a variety of awarding agencies or programs  with closeout problems dating back to 2000. Maintaining undisbursed  balances in expired grant accounts may prevent the deobligation of  funding or expose the funding to improper spending or accounting. For  example, the DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported in 2006 that  $172 million in undisbursed funding could have been deobligated and that  several million dollars in funding used from expired grant accounts was  either unallowable or unsupportable.", "Audit reports identified several awarding agencies or programs with  closeout problems. They generally attributed the problems to inadequacies  in awarding agencies\u2019 grant management processes, including closeouts as  a low management priority, inconsistent closeout procedures, poorly  timed communications with grantees, or insufficient compliance or  enforcement.

NIH and EPA reported that grantee staff  resources were limited, staff were overburdened with other  responsibilities, and staff considered grant closeout a low priority. NIH,  DOJ, and EPA officials reported similar problems among agency grant  staff. Staff turnover, at either the agency or the grantee organization, also  led to lapses in the supervision of grants and the transfer of grant-specific  information to new staff. Agency staff also reported that delaying grant  closeout added to staff workload. For instance, NIH and EPA reported that  as time elapsed it became more burdensome for staff to close out an  expired account.", "Auditors noted that grant offices did not always have consistent grant  closeout procedures, such as due dates for closeout completion. For  example, we reported that EPA used closeouts to ensure that grant  recipients had met all financial requirements and had provided final  reports, and that any unexpended balances were returned to the agency.  EPA\u2019s policy stated that closeouts should occur within 180 days after the  grant\u2019s project end date. However, agency officials did not always comply  with this policy\u2014in fiscal year 2005 EPA closed out only 37 percent of the  grants within 180 days. In its 2006 report, the DOJ OIG reported that two  of the three DOJ grant offices had a deadline for closing out grants, while  the third office did not; that each of the three DOJ grant offices conducted  the closeouts process differently; and that each office had undefined and  undocumented \u201cworkarounds\u201d that had evolved over time.", "Auditors reported that agency communication with grantees, either the  content or the timing of the communication, also delayed grant closeouts.  The communication of inconsistent policies and procedures contributed to  grantee confusion, especially for grantees who work with multiple federal  programs of offices. For instance, DOJ reported OJP grantees, especially  those who dealt with multiple offices, were confused by the variation in  language, time frames, requirements, and communications. Auditors found  the mistiming of the agency closeout reminders, or the lack of such  reminders, also contributed to delays in report submissions. For example,  NIH reminded its grantees about their closeout reporting a year ahead of  time, too far ahead to serve as a timely reminder.", "Lastly, auditors also noted awarding agencies were not enforcing their  closeout requirements through the application of controls, corrective  actions, or penalties. For example, EPA grant officials told GAO they had  no realistic options for taking strong action against grantees, usually state  governments, for submitting late reports because the states had continuing  grants for environmental programs. The HHS OIG found NIH program  guidelines provided few specifics about what type of corrective actions  were appropriate and when the grant office should apply the actions. The  OIG noted that NIH grant offices could impose special award conditions  on the grantees, such as additional monitoring or withhold future funding.  However, the OIG found that grant officials rarely resorted to withholding  future funding from a grantee due to late closeout because agency officials  thought this penalty too severe and would slow down future project  development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Agencies Took Action to Improve Grant Closeouts", "paragraphs": ["In response to auditors\u2019 concerns, three federal agencies, DOJ\u2019s OJP,  HHS\u2019s NIH, and EPA, undertook actions to improve their grant closeout  processes.

Auditors  reported that when federal grant managers took these actions, agencies  generally improved the timeliness of grant closeouts, reduced grant  closeout backlogs, or improved their ability to identify and deobligate  unspent funds from expired grants, or a combination of the above.", "In 2000, DOJ\u2019s OJP initiated a pilot project called \u201cOperation Closeout\u201d to  deal with grant closeout backlogs. The agency reported that this initiative  accelerated the grant closeout process through revised closeout guidelines  and elevated the importance of the closeout function as a required  procedure in the administration of grants. Over a period of 6 months,  \u201cOperation Closeout\u201d closed 4,136 grants, resulting in over $30 million in  deobligated funds. In 2006, the DOJ OIG reported that since 2002 grant  closeout was a higher priority within DOJ and that its awarding agencies  made improvements in the timeliness of grant closeouts. For example,  from 2001 to 2005, OJP reduced its backlog of expired grants from 11,356  to 6,237. The report also indicated that OJP was recommending, among  several recommendations, establishing a performance measure to monitor  efficiency and compliance with its closeout process. In 2006, the DOJ OIG  also reported that OJP updated the grant monitoring requirements in its  Grant Manager\u2019s Manual, automated its Grant Adjustment Notice (GAN)  process, shortened its timeline for closeouts from 180 days to 120 days,  and addressed the backlog of grants overdue for closure. By automating  the GAN process, auditors reported that OJP reduced the time to respond  to grant adjustment requests by 10 days and planned to notify grantees of  decisions regarding grant adjustment requests through the Grants  Management System (GMS). OJP required that its grant staff conduct and  document all its programmatic monitoring efforts in GMS.", "To address its grant closeout problems, NIH undertook several corrective  actions in 2002 and 2003. The agency stated that it continued to emphasize  to grantees that the submission of final closeout reports was an agency  priority and improve agency monitoring. To address its backlog of expired  accounts and reduce the burden on monitoring staff, NIH management  assigned dedicated staff to resolving the backlog of accounts. Corrective  actions included creating a database to track receipt of final reports,  which allowed NIH to send individualized reminders to grantees of  outstanding reports. Another planned action was to provide technical  assistance to grantees through general outreach efforts or through  targeted follow-up with individual grantees. NIH also established a  workgroup and a reminder system to improve grantee compliance with its  closeout guidelines.", "Between 1995 and 2005, EPA efforts led to substantial progress in  resolving its backlog of expired grants.

In the 2006 DOJ and HHS PARs, both the  IG and the independent auditor specifically addressed grant closeout  problems and agency progress in addressing the problems. In each case,  the IG listed grant closeouts as contributing to the department\u2019s  difficulties with grants management at several of its agencies. In response,  the departments described both agency-level and departmentwide  initiatives to address the problems. In HHS\u2019s 2006 PAR, the independent  auditors reported the department had more than 64,000 grants, with a  remaining balance of $1.6 billion, eligible for closeout, and that 75 percent  of these grants had been expired for more than 2 years. In the HHS 2007  Agency Financial Report, the HHS Inspector General continued to cite  grant management, and specifically grant closeouts, as a management  challenge. In DOJ\u2019s 2006 and 2007 PAR, the independent auditors  highlighted the IGs findings and explained that the closeout delays  contributed to misstatements in the department\u2019s financial statements.

In 2005,  EPA had goal of 90 percent grant closure, and it reported in its 2006 PAR  achieving a 95 percent grant closure rate. In 2006, we concluded that,  while EPA\u2019s performance measure did not assess compliance since it did  not reflect the 180-day closeout standard, the measure was a valuable tool  for determining if grants were ultimately closed.

The financial  status of long-expired grant accounts is one aspect of agency performance  that has implications for broader program and agency-level performance.  By elevating this issue as a management priority in their annual  performance plans and PARs, the three agencies made grant closeouts a  priority for improving program and agency-wide performance.

The  ranges varied from relatively small grants of under $25,000 to very large  grants of up to $1 billion. For each funding range, we identified the  quarterly balances of undisbursed funds for each of the 16 quarters from  2003 through 2006.", "We next sorted the expired grants with undisbursed balances according to  the method used to award the funds to grantees. As described earlier,  federal awarding agencies typically award their grant funding using a  formula or on a project basis, or by using a hybrid of both methods. Our  guideline in sorting by funding award method was that if a program  description had more than one allocation method, we sorted the grant  according to the first allocation method listed in the CFDA program  description.

Among the 13  funding award ranges, we found the largest quarterly balances of  undisbursed funds in midsize grants, that had original funding awards  ranging from over $100,000 to $100 million (in nominal dollars) for expired  grants from 2003 through 2006. We also found that, between the two  funding awards methods, grants awarded on a project basis consistently  had the largest quarterly balances of undisbursed funding and that, among  the six types of grantees, state grantees had the largest quarterly amounts  of undisbursed funding, followed distantly by nonprofit organizations.  When comparing grants requiring a grantee contribution and those grants  that did not have this requirement\u2014the fourth characteristic examined\u2014 we found that neither type had consistently larger quarterly amounts of  undisbursed funding.", "Our analysis has several limitations. First, each analysis of the quarterly  undisbursed funding by program characteristic was an independent  assessment of the variation in undisbursed funding among expired grant  accounts. Consequently, the results for each program characteristic  cannot be combined into a general statement about the four  characteristics. Second, the results are limited to the expired grant  accounts with undisbursed grants balances listed in the PMS closeout  report from 2003 through 2006. We were not able to compare these results  to all closed federal grants or all closed grants in PMS due to the burden of  collecting comparable data for all closed federal grants from the eight  other federal civilian payments systems or for all closed grants from PMS.  Lastly, we did not interview policy experts or agency grant managers to  explore why expired grants with different program characteristics might  have larger undisbursed balances."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Federal Agencies Using PMS", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Office of Management and Budget", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Thomas James, Assistant  Director; Patricia Farrell Donahue, Analyst-in-Charge; Carlos Diz; Wesley  Dunn; Sharon Hogan; Elizabeth Hosler; Susan Mak; Anna Maria Ortiz; Neill  Martin-Rolsky; Minette Richardson; Jay Smale; and William Trancucci  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
