NNSA is responsible for managing nuclear weapon- and nonproliferation-related national security activities in laboratories and other facilities, collectively known as the nuclear security enterprise. GAO continues to identify problems across the nuclear security enterprise, from projects\u0092 cost and schedule overruns to inadequate oversight of safety and security at NNSA\u0092s sites. With NNSA proposing to spend tens of billions of dollars to modernize its facilities, it is important to ensure scarce resources are spent in an effective and efficient manner.", "This testimony addresses (1) NNSA\u0092s early experiences organizing and operating as a separately organized agency within DOE and (2) NNSA\u0092s efforts to correct long-standing management deficiencies.

A number of factors contributed to this. First, DOE and NNSA did not have a useful model to follow for establishing a separately organized agency in DOE. Several federal agencies were suggested as models, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce. However, GAO reported in January 2007 that agency officials GAO interviewed did not consider their agency to be separately organized or believed that their agency\u0092s operational methods were transferable to NNSA. Second, DOE\u0092s January 2000 plan to implement the NNSA Act did not define how NNSA would operate as a separately organized agency within DOE. Internal DOE opposition to the creation of NNSA led the department to fill virtually every significant statutory position in NNSA with DOE officials (i.e., having DOE officials contemporaneously serve in NNSA and DOE positions). As GAO testified in April 2001, this practice of \u0093dual-hatting\u0094 caused considerable concern about NNSA\u0092s ability to independently function. Also, lack of formal agreement between DOE and NNSA in a number of key areas such as, among others, budgeting and procurement, led to organizational conflicts that inhibited effective operations. Even where formal procedures were developed, interpersonal disagreements hindered effective cooperation. For example, a January 2007 GAO report described the conflict between NNSA and DOE counterintelligence offices, which led to Congress subsequently amending the NNSA Act to consolidate the counterintelligence programs of DOE and NNSA under DOE.", "NNSA has made considerable progress resolving some of its long-standing management deficiencies, but significant improvement is still needed especially in NNSA\u0092s management of its major projects and contracts. GAO reported in June 2004 that NNSA has better delineated lines of authority and has improved communication between its headquarters and site offices. In addition, NNSA\u0092s establishment of an effective headquarters security organization has made significant progress resolving many of the security weaknesses GAO has identified. Nevertheless, NNSA continues to experience major cost and schedule overruns on its projects, such as research and production facilities and nuclear weapons refurbishments, principally because of ineffective oversight and poor contractor management. In some areas, NNSA can be viewed as a success. Importantly, NNSA has continued to ensure that the nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable in the absence of underground nuclear testing. At the same time, NNSA\u0092s struggles in defining itself as a separately organized agency within DOE, and the considerable management problems that remain have led to calls in Congress and other organizations to increase NNSA\u0092s independence from DOE. However, senior DOE and NNSA officials have committed to continuing reform, and DOE\u0092s and NNSA\u0092s efforts have led to some management improvements. As a result, GAO continues to believe, as it concluded in its January 2007 report, that drastic organizational change to increase independence is unnecessary and questions whether such change would solve the agency\u0092s remaining management problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss the creation and  implementation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014 a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy (DOE).

The act established the position of DOE Under Secretary for  Nuclear Security, who was also designated as the Administrator of NNSA.  The Secretary of Energy and the Deputy Secretary of Energy were  allowed to establish policy for NNSA and to give direction to NNSA  through the Administrator; however, other DOE employees were  prohibited from directing the activities of individual NNSA employees. In  addition, the NNSA Act required that, among other things, NNSA develop  a planning, programming, and budgeting process to ensure that NNSA  operated under sound financial management principles. Using this  planning, programming, and budgeting process, NNSA is also required to  annually submit to Congress a Future Years Nuclear Security Program  (FYNSP) plan that details NNSA\u2019s planned expenditures for the next 5  years.", "DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s management of the nuclear security enterprise has  been the subject of much criticism. The department\u2019s problems are long- standing. For example, we first designated DOE\u2019s management of its  contracts as an area at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement in 1990 because of the department\u2019s record of  inadequate management and oversight of its contractors. In January  1995, we reported that DOE\u2019s laboratories did not have clearly defined  missions that focus their considerable resources on accomplishing the  department\u2019s changing objectives and national priorities. Noting that the  laboratories have made vital contributions to the nation\u2019s defense and  civilian science and technology efforts, we reported that DOE had not  coordinated these laboratories\u2019 efforts to solve national problems but had  instead managed each laboratory on a program-by-program basis.

These missions  are managed by various organizations within DOE and largely carried out  by contractors at DOE sites. According to federal budget data, NNSA is  the largest organization in DOE, overseeing nuclear weapons, nuclear  nonproliferation, and naval reactors missions at its sites. With a $10.5  billion budget in fiscal year 2011\u2014nearly 40 percent of DOE\u2019s total  budget\u2014NNSA is responsible for, among other things, providing the  United States with safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons in the  absence of underground nuclear testing and maintaining core  competencies in nuclear weapons science, technology, and engineering.  Ensuring that the nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable in  the absence of underground nuclear testing is extraordinarily complicated  and requires state-of-the-art experimental and computing facilities, as well  as the skills of top scientists in the field. Over the past decade, the United  States has invested billions of dollars in sustaining the cold war-era  stockpile and upgrading the laboratories and, in 2011, the administration  announced plans to request $88 billion from Congress over the next  decade to operate and modernize the nuclear security enterprise and  ensure that base scientific, technical, and engineering capabilities are  sufficiently supported, and the nuclear deterrent in the United States can  continue to be safe, secure, and reliable.", "Under DOE\u2019s long-standing model of having unique management and  operating (M&O) contractors at each site, management of its sites has  historically been decentralized and, thus, fragmented. Since the  Manhattan Project produced the first atomic bomb during World War II,  NNSA, DOE, and their predecessor agencies have depended on the  expertise of private firms, universities, and others to carry out research  and development work and efficiently operate the facilities necessary for  the nation\u2019s nuclear defense. DOE\u2019s relationship with these entities has  been formalized over the years through its M&O contracts\u2014agreements  that give DOE\u2019s contractors unique responsibility to carry out major  portions of DOE\u2019s missions and apply their scientific, technical, and  management expertise.", "Currently, DOE spends 90 percent of its annual budget on M&O  contracts, making it the largest non-Department of Defense contracting  agency in the government. The M&O contractors at DOE\u2019s NNSA sites  have operated under DOE\u2019s direction and oversight but largely  independently of one another. Various headquarters and field-based  organizations within DOE and NNSA develop policies, and NNSA site  offices, collocated with NNSA\u2019s sites, conduct day-to-day oversight of the  M&O contractors and evaluate the contractors\u2019 performance in carrying  out the sites\u2019 missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE and NNSA Struggled to Determine How NNSA Should Operate as a Separately Organized Agency", "paragraphs": ["NNSA focused considerable attention on reorganizing its internal  operations; however, it and DOE have struggled with establishing how  NNSA should operate as a separately organized agency within the  department.

For example, NNSA retains separate functions in areas such as, among  others, congressional affairs, general counsel, human resources,  procurement and acquisition, and public affairs.

There have been  continuing calls for removing NNSA from DOE and establishing it as a  separate agency.

DOE and NNSA have taken important steps to  address most of these recommendations. For example, to improve  security, we recommended that the Administrator of NNSA, among other  things, implement a professional development program for security staff  to ensure the completion of needed training, develop a framework to  evaluate results from security reviews and guide security improvements,  and establish formal mechanisms for sharing and implementing lessons  learned across the weapons complex. NNSA\u2019s establishment of an  effective headquarters security organization has made significant  progress implementing these recommendations by performing security  reviews, developing security performance measures, and instituting a  security lessons-learned center.", "Nevertheless, NNSA continues to experience significant deficiencies,  particularly in its management of major projects and contracts. As we  testified in February 2012, a basic tenet of effective management is the  ability to complete projects on time and within budget. However, for  more than a decade, NNSA has continued to experience significant cost  and schedule overruns on its major projects, principally because of  ineffective oversight and poor contractor management. We have reported  that NNSA\u2019s efforts to extend the operational lives of nuclear weapons in  the stockpile have experienced cost increases and schedule delays, such  as a $300 million cost increase and 2-year delay in the refurbishment of  the W87 nuclear warhead and a $70 million cost increase and 1-year  delay in the refurbishment of the W76 nuclear warhead. Furthermore,  we reported that the estimated cost to construct a modern Uranium  Processing Facility at NNSA\u2019s Y-12 National Security Complex  experienced a nearly sevenfold cost increase from between $600 million  and $1.1 billion in 2004 to between $4.2 billion and $6.5 billion in 2011.  We also reported in March 2012 that NNSA\u2019s project to construct a new  plutonium research facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2014the  Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility\u2014 would cost between $3.7 billion and $5.8 billion\u2014nearly a sixfold increase  from NNSA\u2019s original estimate. NNSA\u2019s February 2012 decision to defer  construction of this facility for at least 5 years will result in a total delay of  between 8 and 12 years from its original plans.", "NNSA\u2019s planning, programming, and budgeting process has also  experienced a setback, which raises questions about the process\u2019s  capability and flexibility. Specifically, NNSA\u2019s modernization and  operations plans are detailed and annually updated in the agency\u2019s  Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP), which provides  details of nuclear security enterprise modernization and operations plans  over the next two decades. In addition, as discussed above, the NNSA  Act requires NNSA to annually submit to Congress an FYNSP\u2014a budget  document approved by the Office of Management and Budget that details  NNSA\u2019s planned expenditures for the next 5 years. Furthermore, Section  1043 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012  requires the Department of Defense and NNSA to jointly produce an  annual report that, among other things, provides a detailed 10-year  estimate of modernization budget requirements. NNSA neither submitted  an FYNSP based on \u201cprogrammatic requirements\u201d nor the Section 1043  annual report with its fiscal year 2013 budget submission. In addition,  NNSA has yet to release an updated SSMP. According to the Secretary  of Energy, the August 2011 Budget Control Act created \u201cnew fiscal  realities\u201d that have caused the agency to revise its long-range  modernization and operations plans and budget. An NNSA official told  us that the revised plans, which will include the FYNSP, Section 1043  annual report, and updated SSMP should be completed in July 2012. We  are currently reviewing NNSA\u2019s planning, programming, and budgeting  process in response to a request from the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development, Senate Committee on Appropriations, and we  expect to issue a report on this work in the next few months.", "In conclusion, producing a well-organized and effective agency out of  what was widely considered a dysfunctional enterprise has been a  considerable challenge. In some areas, NNSA can be viewed as a  success. In particular, NNSA has successfully ensured that the nuclear  weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable in the absence of  underground nuclear testing, accomplishing this complicated task by  using state-of-the-art facilities, as well as the skills of top scientists. As we  testified in February 2012, maintaining government-owned facilities that  were constructed more than 50 years ago and ensuring M&O contractors  are sustaining critical human capital skills that are highly technical in  nature and limited in supply are both difficult undertakings. Careful federal  oversight over the tens of billions of dollars NNSA proposes to spend to  modernize nuclear facilities will be necessary to ensure these funds are  spent in as an effective and efficient manner as possible, especially given  NNSA\u2019s record of weak management of its major projects.", "Over the past decade, we have made numerous recommendations to  DOE and NNSA to improve their management and oversight practices.  DOE and NNSA have acted on many of these recommendations and  have made considerable progress. Nevertheless, enough significant  management problems remain that prompt some to call for removing  NNSA from DOE and either moving it to another department or  establishing it as a separate agency. As we concluded in January 2007,  however, we do not believe that such drastic changes are necessary, and  we continue to hold this view today. Importantly, we are uncertain  whether such significant organizational changes to increase NNSA\u2019s  independence would produce the desired effect of creating a modern,  responsive, effective, and efficient nuclear security enterprise. In light of  the substantial leadership commitment to reform made by senior DOE  and NNSA officials, and the significant improvements that have already  been made, we believe that NNSA remains capable of delivering the  management improvements necessary to be an effective organization,  and we will continue to monitor NNSA\u2019s progress making these  improvements.", "Chairman Turner, Ranking Member Sanchez, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
