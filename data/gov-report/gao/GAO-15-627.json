For example, reengineering business processes  to be as streamlined as possible can result in increased efficiencies, a  reduced number of interfaces, and decreased program costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Reengineering Efforts Have Moderately Helped to Streamline Business Processes and Realize Some Efficiencies, but More Work Is Needed to Fully Achieve Intended Outcomes, According to Portfolio Managers", "paragraphs": ["The department\u2019s business process reengineering efforts have had mixed  success in achieving their intended outcomes. Specifically, 63 percent of  the portfolio managers we surveyed reported that the efforts were  effective in helping to ensure that the business processes supported by  the defense business systems they manage are (or will be) streamlined  and efficient as practicable. As an example, one manager reported this  effort highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the systems within  their specific portfolio. Another reported that their portfolio has been  reduced from 147 systems to 13 due, in part, to the business process  reengineering efforts.", "However, the general consensus among surveyed portfolio managers  was that the department\u2019s efforts were less effective in helping to limit  tailoring of commercial off-the-shelf systems. Only 29 percent reported  that DOD\u2019s business process reengineering efforts were effective in  eliminating or reducing the need to tailor commercial off-the-shelf  systems. Tailoring might be required, for example, because existing  policy and guidance might limit a system\u2019s ability to conform to a specific  approach for executing a business process that is already built into an  individual commercial off-the-shelf system. Another reason given was that  managers have limited knowledge about the commercial off-the-shelf  products that are available via established enterprise licenses and this  limited knowledge makes it difficult to conduct effective business process  reengineering.", "Table 7 provides additional information on portfolio managers\u2019 responses  regarding the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s business process reengineering  efforts.", "Portfolio managers reported that business process reengineering has  been useful in helping to achieve selected benefits. In particular, 70  percent reported that efforts have resulted in streamlined business  processes. Sixty-seven percent reported that efforts have resulted in  improved documentation of business needs, which is consistent with  DOD\u2019s focus on developing problem statements for new capabilities.  Such problem statements reflect analysis of a perceived business  problem, capability gap, or opportunity. According to officials from the  Office of the DCMO, they help ensure that programs are aligned with  DOD\u2019s strategic needs, and also assist the department\u2019s efforts in  identifying redundancies and duplication. However, only 29 percent of the  portfolio managers surveyed reported that efforts to reduce program costs  have been effective. Table 8 summarizes the portfolio managers\u2019 survey  responses.", "The surveyed DOD portfolio managers identified a range of challenges to  fully achieving the business process reengineering outcomes described in  the fiscal year 2005 NDAA. In particular, cultural resistance to change  was the most frequently cited challenge (71 percent), followed by  parochialism (i.e., focusing on one\u2019s own sub-organization rather than  having an enterprise-wide view.), availability of skilled staff, and  availability of training (all at 67 percent). The quality of business process  reengineering compliance guidance, the compliance review process, and  the timing of the reengineering relative to system development work were  also reported as important challenges (all at 63 percent).", "Table 9 summarizes survey responses to questions about the challenges  to business process reengineering.", "DOD has taken steps to improve its reengineering efforts that may, in  part, address some of the challenges identified in our survey results. With  regard to parochialism (i.e., focusing on one\u2019s own sub-organization  rather than having an enterprisewide view), the department is developing  online tools that provide additional information to program managers,  portfolio managers, pre-certification authorities, and the Defense  Business Council. For example, the department\u2019s problem statement  portal is to be a repository for problem statement submissions and is to  be available departmentwide. In addition, the department has developed  its Integrated Business Framework-Data Alignment Portal, which is to  provide, among other things, additional information about individual  business systems, such as information about which systems execute  specific business activities and system functions.", "Further, with respect to addressing the challenge associated with the  business process reengineering compliance review process, the  department has taken steps to help ensure improved accountability for a  portion of certification and approval requests. In particular, according to  officials from the Office of the DCMO, the DCMO allowed the military  departments more autonomy and responsibility for reviewing their system  portfolios during fiscal year 2015 certification and approval reviews.  Nevertheless, as we have previously reported, and as discussed in  appendix II, this process is not guided by specific criteria for elevating  certain systems to the Defense Business Council that might require  additional oversight.", "Notwithstanding these improvement efforts, as reported in feedback by  the military department portfolio managers, additional work is needed.  These managers provided a number of suggestions to help address the  identified challenges. Suggestions included:  Improve business process reengineering training: Two portfolio  managers offered suggestions that relate to improved training. For  example, one manager stated that the department should establish  minimum training standards.", "Improve business process reengineering guidance: Two  managers offered suggestions associated with improved guidance.  For example, one portfolio manager stated that sufficient guidance  does not exist to describe meaningful business process models or  how such models should be analyzed.", "Align business process reengineering with system development  activities: One portfolio manager stated that the reengineering  process should be more closely tied to acquisition milestones instead  of being assessed on an annual basis.", "According to GAO\u2019s standards for internal controls,ensure that there are adequate means of obtaining information from  stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving  its goals. While we did not evaluate the effectiveness of these  suggestions, they may be valuable for the Office of the DCMO to consider  in its ongoing and future business process reengineering improvement  efforts.

Among  other things, portfolio managers reported that the architecture does not  enable DOD to produce reliable and timely information for decision- making purposes. Additionally, DOD\u2019s reengineering efforts are effective  in streamlining business processes, but not in reducing the tailoring of  commercial software products. Portfolio managers reported that various  challenges exist in achieving intended outcomes and benefits, including  cultural resistance, parochialism, and a lack of skilled staff.

Though we have made  recommendations in this area prior to 2011, those recommendations have  since been closed. We evaluated the department\u2019s written responses and  related documentation on steps completed to implement or partially  implement the recommendations. Documentation we analyzed included  guidance on business enterprise architecture and business process  reengineering compliance, guidance on certifying and approving defense  business systems, and documentation about the department\u2019s problem  statement development and review process. In addition, we interviewed  officials from the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer and the  Office of the Chief Information Officer, and observed a demonstration of  the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer\u2019s Integrated Business  Framework-Data Alignment Portal tool to better understand the actions  taken to address our recommendations.
