Technical challenges include the need for FCS vehicles to be smaller, weigh less, and be as lethal and survivable as current vehicles, which requires (1) a network to collect and deliver vast amounts of intelligence and communications information and (2) individual systems, such as manned ground vehicles, that are as complex as fighter aircraft. Its cost will be very high: its first increment--enough to equip about 1/3 of the force--will cost over $108 billion, with annual funding requests running from $3 billion to $9 billion per year. The program's pace and complexity also pose significant management challenges. The Army is using a Lead System Integrator to manage FCS and is using a contracting instrument--Other Transaction Agreement--that allows for more flexible negotiation of roles, responsibilities, and rights with the integrator. The FCS is at significant risk for not delivering required capability within budgeted resources. Currently, about 9 1/2 years is allowed from development start to production decision. DOD typically needs this period of time to develop a single advanced system, yet FCS is far greater in scope. The program's level of knowledge is far below that suggested by best practices or DOD policy: Nearly 2 years after program launch and with $4.6 billion invested, requirements are not firm and only 1 of over 50 technologies are mature. As planned, the program will attain the level of knowledge in 2008 that it should have had in 2003, but things are not going as planned. Progress in critical areas--such as the network, software, and requirements--has in fact been slower, and FCS is therefore likely to encounter problems late in development, when they are very costly to correct. Given the scope of the program, the impact of cost growth could be dire. To make FCS an effective acquisition program different approaches must be considered, including (1) setting the first stage of the program to demonstrate a worthwhile military capability, mature technology, and firm requirements; and (2) bundling its other capabilities into advanced technology demonstrators until they can be put in a future stage, which will provide guidance for decisions on requirements, lower the cost of development, and make for more reasonable cost and schedule estimates for future stages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of the Army\u2019s  Future Combat Systems (FCS), a networked family of weapons and other  systems.

The Future Force is to be offensively  oriented and will employ revolutionary operational concepts, enabled by  new technology. This force is to fight very differently than the Army has in  the past, using easily transportable lightweight vehicles, rather than  traditional heavily armored vehicles.

If successful, the program will  leverage individual capabilities of weapons and platforms and will  facilitate interoperability and open system designs. This is a significant  improvement over the traditional approach of building superior individual  weapons that must be netted together after the fact. Also, the system-of- systems network and weapons could give managers the flexibility to make  best value tradeoffs across traditional program lines. This transformation  of the Army, in terms of both operations and equipment, is under way with  the full cooperation of the Army warfighter community.

For the unit of action to be lethal, it must have  the capability to address the combat situation, set conditions, maneuver to  positions of advantage, and engage enemy formations at longer ranges and  with greater precision than the current force. To provide this level of  lethality and reduce the risk of detection, FCS must provide high single- shot weapon effectiveness. To be as survivable as the current heavy force,  the unit of action must find and kill the enemy before being seen and  identified. The individual FCS systems will also rely on a layered system of  protection involving several technologies that lowers the chances of a  vehicle or other system being seen and hit by the enemy. To be responsive,  the unit of action must be able to rapidly deploy anywhere in the world  and be rapidly transportable by various means\u2014particularly by the C-130  aircraft\u2014and ready to fight upon arrival. To facilitate rapid  transportability on the battlefield, FCS vehicles are to match the weight  and size constraints of the C-130 aircraft. The unit of action is to be  capable of sustaining itself for periods of 3 to 7 days, depending on the  level of conflict\u2014necessitating a small logistics footprint. This requires  subsystems with high reliability and low maintenance, reduced demand  for fuel and water, highly effective weapons, and fuel-efficient engines.", "Meeting all these requirements is unprecedented not only because of the  difficulty each represents individually, but because the solution for one  requirement may work against another requirement. For example,  solutions for lethality could increase vehicle weight and size. Solutions for  survivability could increase complexity and lower reliability. It is the  performance of the information network that is the linchpin for meeting  the other requirements.

The sheer scope of  the technological leap required for the FCS involves many elements.

Since this estimate, the Army has released an updated  research and development cost estimate of $30.3 billion in then-year  dollars. An updated procurement estimate is not yet available. The Army is  continuing to refine these cost estimates. As estimated, the FCS will  command a significant share of the Army\u2019s acquisition budget, particularly  that of ground combat vehicles, for the foreseeable future. In fiscal year  2006, the FCS budget request of $3.4 billion accounts for 65 percent of the  Army\u2019s proposed spending on programs in system development and  demonstration and 35 percent of that expected for all research,  development, test and evaluation activities.", "As the FCS begins to command large budgets, it will compete with other  major financial demands. Current military operations, such as in  Afghanistan and Iraq, require continued funding. Since September 2001,  DOD has needed over $240 billion in supplemental appropriations to  support the global war on terrorism. Current operations are also causing  faster wear on existing weapons, which will need refurbishment or  replacement sooner than planned. The equipment used by the current  force, such as Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, is expected to  remain in the active inventory until at least 2030. The cost to upgrade and  maintain this equipment over that length of time has not been estimated  but could be substantial. Also, the cost of converting current forces to new  modular, brigade-based units is expected to be at least $48 billion. Further,  FCS is part of a significant surge in the demand for new weapons. Just 4  years ago, the top 5 weapon systems cost about $280 billion; today, in the  same base year dollars, the top 5 weapon systems cost about $521 billion.

In 1991, Congress  made this authority permanent and extended it to the military  departments. In 1993, Congress enacted Section 845 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, which provided DARPA  with authority to use, for a 3-year period, other transactions to carry out  prototype projects directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems  proposed to be acquired or developed by DOD. Subsequent amendments  have extended this authority to the military departments and other defense  agencies.

We have found for a program to deliver a  successful product within available resources, managers should build high  levels of demonstrated knowledge before significant commitments are  made. In essence, knowledge supplants risk over time. This building of  knowledge can be described in three levels that should be attained over  the course of a program:    First, at program start, the customer\u2019s needs should match the developer\u2019s  available resources\u2014mature technologies, time, and funding. An  indication of this match is the demonstrated maturity of the technologies  needed to meet customer needs.", "Second, about midway through development, the product\u2019s design should  be stable and demonstrate that it is capable of meeting performance  requirements. The critical design review is the vehicle for making this  determination and generally signifies the point at which the program is  ready to start building production-representative prototypes.", "Third, by the time of the production decision, the product must be shown  to be producible within cost, schedule, and quality targets and have  demonstrated its reliability. It is also the point at which the design must  demonstrate that it performs as needed through realistic system-level  testing.", "The three levels of knowledge are related, in that a delay in attaining one  delays those that follow. Thus, if the technologies needed to meet  requirements are not mature, design and production maturity will be  delayed. On the successful commercial and defense programs we have  reviewed, managers were careful to conduct development of technology  separately from and ahead of the development of the product. For this  reason, the first knowledge level is the most important for improving the  chances of developing a weapon system within cost and schedule  estimates. DOD\u2019s acquisition policy has adopted the knowledge-based  approach to acquisitions. DOD policy requires program managers to  provide knowledge about key aspects of a system at key points in the  acquisition process. Program managers are also required to reduce  integration risk and demonstrate product design prior to the design  readiness review and to reduce manufacturing risk and demonstrate  producibility prior to full-rate production.", "DOD programs that have not attained these levels of knowledge have  experienced cost increases and schedule delays. We have recently  reported on such experiences with the F/A-22, the Joint Strike Fighter, the  Airborne Laser, and the Space Based Infrared System High. For example,  the $245 billion Joint Strike Fighter\u2019s acquisition strategy does not  embrace evolutionary, knowledge-based techniques intended to reduce  risks.

In fact,  most of the activities that have taken place during its first 2 years should  have been completed before starting system development and  demonstration. It may be several years before the program reaches the  level of knowledge it should have had at program start. Consequently, the  Army is depending on a strategy that must concurrently define  requirements, develop technology, design products, and test products.  Progress in executing the program thus far does not inspire confidence:  The requirements process is taking longer that planned, technology  maturity may actually have regressed, and a program that is critical for the  FCS network has recently run into problems and has been delayed.

The Army has been working diligently  to define these requirements, but the task is very difficult given that there  are over 10,000 specific system-of-systems requirements that must  collectively deliver the needed lethality, survivability, responsiveness, and  sustainability. For example, the Army is conducting at least 120 studies to  identify the design tradeoffs necessary before firming up requirements. As  of December 2004, 69 remain to be completed.

Often, it is a test that reveals the problem.  The \u201cchurn\u201d refers to the additional\u2014and unanticipated\u2014time, money,  and effort that must be invested to overcome the problem. Problems are  most serious when they delay product delivery, increase product cost, or  \u201cescape\u201d to the customer. The discovery of problems in testing conducted  late in development is a fairly common occurrence on DOD programs, as  is the attendant late-cycle churn. Often, tests of a full system, such as  launching a missile or flying an aircraft, become the vehicles for  discovering problems that could have been found out earlier and corrected  less expensively. When significant problems are revealed late in a weapon  system\u2019s development, the reaction\u2014or churn\u2014can take several forms:  extending schedules to increase the investment in more prototypes and  testing, terminating the program, or redesigning and modifying weapons  that have already made it to the field.

This is information the  combat units can access through WIN-T developed equipment and JTRS.", "The JTRS program to develop radios for ground vehicles and helicopters\u2014 referred to as Cluster 1\u2014began system development in June 2002 with an  aggressive schedule, immature technologies, and lack of clearly defined  and stable requirements. These factors have contributed to significant  cost, schedule, and performance problems from which the program has  not yet recovered. The Army has not been able to mature the technologies  needed to provide radios that both generate sufficient power and meet  platform size and weight constraints. Changes in the design are expected  to continue after the critical design review, and unit costs may make the  radios unaffordable in the quantities desired. Given these challenges, the  Army has proposed delaying the program 24 months and adding $458  million to the development effort. However, before approving the  restructure, the Office of the Secretary of Defense directed a partial work  stoppage, and the program is now focusing its efforts on a scheduled  operational assessment of the radio\u2019s functionality to determine the future  of the program. Consequently, the radio is not likely to be available for the  first spiral of the FCS network, slated for fiscal year 2008, and surrogate  radios may be needed to fill the gap.", "A second JTRS program, to develop small radios including those that  soldiers will carry (referred to as Cluster 5), also entered system  development with immature technologies and lack of well-defined  requirements, and faces even greater technical challenges due to the  smaller size, weight, power, and large data processing requirements for the  radios. For example, the Cluster 5 program has a requirement for a  wideband networking waveform despite its demanding size and power  constraints. In addition, the program was delayed in starting system  development last year because of a contract bid protest. Consequently, the  Cluster 5 radios are not likely to be available for the first FCS spiral either.  The Army has acknowledged that surrogate radios and waveforms may be  needed for the first spiral of FCS.", "The WIN-T program also began with an aggressive acquisition schedule  and immature technologies that are not scheduled to mature until after  production begins. Backup technologies have been identified, but they  offer less capability, and most are immature as well. In addition, the  schedule leaves little room for error correction and rework that may  hinder successful cost, schedule and performance outcomes. More  recently, the program strategy was altered to identify a single architecture  as soon as possible and to deliver networking and communications  capabilities sooner to meet near-term warfighting needs. Specifically, the  Army dropped its competitive strategy and is now having the two  contractors work together to develop the initial network architecture. A  plan for how to develop and field capabilities sooner is still to be  determined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Manned Ground Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["FCS includes eight manned ground vehicles, that require critical individual  and common technologies to meet required capabilities. For example, the  Mounted Combat System will require, among other new technologies, a  newly developed lightweight weapon for lethality; a hybrid electric drive  system and a high-density engine for mobility; advanced armors, an active  protection system, and advanced signature management systems for  survivability; a Joint Tactical Radio System with the wideband waveform  for communications and network connection; a computer-generated force  system for training; and a water generation system for sustainability. At  the same time, concepts for the manned ground vehicles have not been  decided and are awaiting the results of trade studies that will decide  critical design points such as weight and the type of drive system to be  used. Under other circumstances, each of the eight manned ground  systems would be a major defense acquisition program on par with the  Army\u2019s past major ground systems such as the Abrams tank, the Bradley  Fighting Vehicle, and the Crusader Artillery System. As such, each requires  a major effort to develop, design, and demonstrate the individual vehicles.", "Developing these technologies and integrating them into vehicles is made  vastly more difficult by the Army\u2019s requirement that the vehicles be  transportable by the C-130 cargo aircraft. However, the C-130 can carry the  FCS vehicles\u2019 projected weight of 19 tons only 5 percent of the time. In  2004, GAO reported a similar situation with the Stryker vehicles. The 19- ton weight of these vehicles significantly limits the C-130\u2019s range and the  size of the force that can be deployed. Currently, FCS vehicle designs are  estimated at over 25 tons per vehicle. To meet even this weight, the  advanced technologies required put the sophistication of the vehicles on a  par with that of fighter aircraft, according to some Army officials. This is  proving an extremely difficult requirement to meet without sacrificing  lethality, survivability, and sustainability. Currently, program officials are  considering other ways to meet the C-130 weight requirement, such as  transporting the vehicles with minimal armor and with only a minimal  amount of ammunition. As a result, vehicles would have to be armored  and loaded upon arrival to be combat ready."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCS Cost and Affordability Still to Be Determined", "paragraphs": ["The low levels of knowledge in the FCS program provide an insufficient  basis for making cost estimates. The program\u2019s immaturity at the time  system development and demonstration began resulted in a relatively low- fidelity cost estimate and open questions about the program\u2019s long-term  affordability. Although the program restructuring provides more time to  resolve risk and to demonstrate progress, the knowledge base for making  a confident estimate is still low. If the FCS cost estimate is not better than  past estimates, the likelihood for cost growth will be high, while the  prospects for finding more money for the program will be dim.", "The estimates for the original FCS program and the restructured program  are shown in table 2 below.", "At this point, the FCS cost estimate represents the position of the program  office. The Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Cost Analysis  Improvement Group will provide their independent estimates for the  May 2005 Milestone B update review. It is important to keep in mind that  the FCS program cost estimate does not reflect all of the costs needed to  field FCS capabilities. The costs of the complementary programs are  separate and will be substantial. For example, the research and  development and procurement costs for the JTRS (Clusters 1 and 5) and  the WIN-T programs are expected to be about $34.6 billion (fiscal year  2005 dollars).", "In addition, by April 2005, the Army has been tasked to provide an analysis  of FCS affordability considering other Army resource priorities, such as  modularity. This will be an important analysis, given that estimates of  modularity costs have been put at about $48 billion, and costs of current  operations and recapitalizing current equipment have been covered by  supplemental funding.", "As can be seen in table 3, substantial investments will be made before key  knowledge is gained on how well the system can perform. For example, by  the time of the critical design review in 2010, over $20 billion of research  and development funds will have been spent.", "The consequences of even modest cost increases and schedule delays for  the FCS would be dramatic. For example, a one-year delay late in FCS  development, not an uncommon occurrence for other DOD programs,  could cost over $3 billion. Given the size of the program, financial  consequences of following historical patterns of cost and schedule growth  could be dire."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to Current FCS Acquisition Strategy Still Warrant Consideration", "paragraphs": ["For any acquisition program, two basic questions can be asked. First, is it  worth doing? Second, is it being done the right way? On the first question,  the Army makes a compelling case that something must be done to equip  its future forces and that such equipment should be more responsive but  as effective as current equipment. The answer to the second question is  problematic. At this point, the FCS presents a concept that has been laid  out in some detail, an architecture or framework for integrating individual  capabilities, and an investment strategy for how to acquire those  capabilities. There is not enough knowledge to say whether the FCS is  doable, much less doable within a predictable frame of time and money.  Yet making confident predictions is a reasonable standard for a major  acquisition program given the resource commitments and opportunity  costs they entail. Against this standard, the FCS is not yet a good fit as an  acquisition program.", "That having been said, another important question that needs to be  answered is: If the Army needs FCS-like capabilities, what is the best way  to advance them to the point at which they can be acquired? Efforts that  fall in this area\u2014the transition between the laboratory and the acquisition  program\u2014do not yet have a place that has the right organizations,  resources, and responsibilities to advance them properly.", "At this point alternatives to the current FCS strategy warrant  consideration. For example, one possible alternative for advancing the  maturity of FCS capabilities could entail setting the first spiral or block as  the program of record for system development and demonstration. Such a  spiral should meet the standards of providing a worthwhile military  capability, having mature technology, and having firm requirements. Other  capabilities currently in the FCS program could be moved out of system  development and demonstration and instead be bundled into advanced  technology demonstrations that could develop and experiment with  advanced technologies in the more conducive environment of \u201cpre- acquisition\u201d until they are ready to be put into a future spiral. Advancing  technologies in this way will enable knowledge to guide decisions on  requirements, lower the cost of development, and make for more  reasonable cost and schedule estimates for future spirals.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
