Among other things, SROs monitor the markets, investigate and discipline members involved in improper trading, and make referrals to SEC regarding suspicious trades by nonmembers. For industry self-regulation to function effectively, SEC must ensure that SROs are fulfilling their regulatory responsibilities. This report (1) discusses the structure of SEC's inspection program for SROs, (2) evaluates certain aspects of SEC's inspection program, and (3) describes the SRO referral process and evaluates SEC's information system for receiving SRO referrals. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SEC inspection workpapers, analyzed SEC data on SRO referrals and related investigations, and interviewed SEC and SRO officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that SROs are fulfilling their regulatory responsibilities, SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) conducts routine and special inspections of SRO regulatory programs. OCIE conducts routine inspections of key programs every 1 to 4 years, inspecting larger SROs more frequently, and conducts special inspections (which arise from tips or the need to follow up on prior recommendations or enforcement actions) as warranted. More specifically, OCIE's inspections of SRO surveillance, investigative, and disciplinary programs (enforcement programs) involve evaluating the parameters of surveillance systems, reviewing the adequacy of policies and procedures for handling the resulting alerts and investigations, and reviewing case files to determine whether SRO staff are complying with its policies and procedures. GAO identified several opportunities for SEC to enhance its oversight of SROs through its inspection program. First, although examiners have developed processes for inspecting SRO enforcement programs, OCIE has not documented these processes or established written policies relating to internal controls over these processes, such as supervisory review or standards for data collection. Such documentation could strengthen OCIE's ability to provide reasonable assurances that its inspection processes and products are subject to key quality controls. Second, OCIE officials said that they focus inspections of SRO enforcement programs on areas judged to be high risk. However, this risk-assessment process does not leverage the reviews that SRO internal and external auditors performed, which could result in duplication of SRO efforts or missed opportunities to direct examination resources to other higher-risk or less-examined programs. OCIE officials told us that they plan to begin assessing SRO internal audit functions in 2008, including the quality of their work products, which would allow OCIE to assess the usefulness of these products for targeting its inspections. Finally, OCIE currently does not formally track the implementation status of SRO inspection recommendations; rather, management consults with staff to obtain such information as needed. Without formal tracking, OCIE's ability to efficiently and effectively generate and evaluate trend information, such as patterns in the types of deficiencies found or the implementation status of recommendations across SROs, or over time, may be limited. SEC's Division of Enforcement uses an electronic system to receive referrals of potential violations from SROs. These referrals undergo multiple stages of review and may lead Enforcement to open an investigation. From fiscal years 2003 to 2006, SEC received an increasing number of advisories and referrals from SROs, many of which involved insider trading. However, SEC's referral receipt and case tracking systems do not allow Enforcement staff to electronically search all advisory and referral information, which may limit SEC's ability to monitor unusual market activity, make decisions about opening investigations, and allow management to assess case activities, among other things."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Self-regulatory organizations (SRO) include, among others, national  securities exchanges and securities associations registered with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  (FINRA). At the time that the system of self-regulation was created,  Congress, regulators, and market participants recognized that this  structure possessed inherent conflicts of interest because of the dual role  of SROs as both market operators and regulators. Nevertheless, Congress  adopted self-regulation, as opposed to direct federal regulation of the  securities markets, to prevent excessive government involvement in  market operations, which could hinder competition and market innovation.  Also, Congress concluded that self-regulation with federal oversight would  be more efficient and less costly to taxpayers.", "For industry self-regulation to function effectively, SEC must ensure that  SROs are fulfilling their regulatory responsibilities. As regulators, SROs are  primarily responsible for establishing the standards under which their  members conduct business; monitoring the way that business is conducted;  bringing disciplinary actions against their members for violating applicable  federal statutes, SEC\u2019s rules, and their own rules; and referring potential  violations of nonmembers to SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement  (Enforcement). SEC oversees SROs through such actions as reviewing  their rule proposals and information technology (IT) security through its  Division of Market Regulation (Market Regulation), and periodically  inspecting their operations through its Office of Compliance Inspections and  Examinations (OCIE). OCIE inspections are intended to assess the  effectiveness of SRO operations and often make recommendations  intended to improve them. If OCIE finds that an SRO has failed to comply  with, or enforce member compliance with, SRO rules or federal securities  laws, it may refer the SRO to Enforcement for further investigation and  potential sanctions. More recently, recognizing the role of internal controls  in promoting compliance and effectiveness within SROs, OCIE has begun  focusing increased attention on the activity and work products of the  internal audit function at SROs.", "This report addresses your interest in the actions taken by SEC to ensure  that SROs\u2014in particular, the two largest SROs, NASD (the SRO that  provided market oversight of the NASDAQ Stock Market and certain other  exchanges prior to FINRA) and NYSE\u2014are fulfilling their regulatory  responsibilities by effectively monitoring and investigating suspicious  trading in listed securities and, where appropriate, prosecuting misconduct  involving member broker-dealers or referring potential misconduct by non- SRO members to SEC. It also addresses your interest in SEC\u2019s processes  for managing and acting upon referrals received by Enforcement from  SROs. Specifically, this report  1. discusses the overall structure of SEC\u2019s inspection program and, more  specifically, its approach to inspections of SRO surveillance,  investigative, and disciplinary programs (enforcement programs); 2. evaluates certain aspects of SEC\u2019s inspection program, including  guidance and planning, the use of SRO internal audit products, and the  tracking of inspection recommendations; and  3. describes the SRO referral process to SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division and  recent trends in referral numbers and related SEC investigations, and  evaluates SEC\u2019s information system for advisories and referrals.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed and analyzed OCIE  documentation of the 11 inspections completed between March 2002 and  January 2007 of NASD and NYSE enforcement programs, an OCIE  memorandum to the Commission describing the SRO inspection process,  and our prior work. Furthermore, we observed a demonstration of various  IT systems that NASD used to monitor the markets and track investigations  and disciplinary actions. We also conducted interviews with staff from  OCIE, NASD, and NYSE. To address our second objective, we reviewed  OCIE inspection guidance related to the review of SRO internal audit  reports, guidance for bank examiners from the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), inspection guidelines developed by the  Inspectors General (IG), and our prior work. In addition, we reviewed SRO  internal and external audits of IT security and interviewed staff from OCIE,  Market Regulation, NASD, and NYSE. Furthermore, we reviewed internal  control standards for the federal government and conducted interviews  with OCIE and Enforcement officials on their respective procedures for  ensuring that SROs implement inspection recommendations and remedial  actions required as part of enforcement actions. In addition, we reviewed  and summarized the enforcement actions brought by SEC against SROs  between 1995 and 2007. To address our third objective, we observed a  demonstration from Enforcement staff on the division\u2019s system for  receiving SRO referrals, and we interviewed Enforcement, NASD, and  NYSE staff to determine how SEC manages SRO referrals and conducts  investigations. To understand trends in SRO referrals and SEC  investigations related to these referrals, we requested and analyzed data  from SEC\u2019s referral receipt system and case tracking system from fiscal  years 2003 through 2006. We inquired about checks that SEC performs on  these data and determined they were reliable for our purposes.", "We performed our work in Washington, D.C.; New York, New York; and  Rockville, Maryland, between September 2006 and September 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

SROs maintain records  of their investigations and the resulting disciplinary actions as part of their  internal case tracking systems. In addition, as part of their market  surveillance efforts, SROs, such as NASD and NYSE, maintain databases  with information on individuals and firms associated with suspicious  trading activity, such as insider trading. NASD also maintains the Central  Registration Depository, the securities industry online registration and  licensing database.

Within OCIE, the Office of Market Oversight primarily focuses on issues  related to securities trading activities, with the objective of evaluating  whether SRO enforcement programs and procedures are adequate for  providing surveillance of the markets, investigating potential violations,  and disciplining violators under SRO jurisdiction. OCIE also inspects other  SRO regulatory programs, which include, among others, arbitration,  listings, sales practice, and financial and operational programs. As part of  the latter, OCIE coordinates the compliance inspections of NASD\u2019s   district offices, which are responsible for examining broker-dealer  members for compliance with SRO rules and federal securities laws.", "In cases where OCIE discovers potentially egregious violations of federal  securities laws or SRO rules during an SRO inspection, it may refer the case  to Enforcement, which is responsible for further investigating these  potential violations; recommending Commission action when appropriate,  either in a federal court or before an administrative law judge (ALJ); and  negotiating settlements.", "SEC\u2019s Market Regulation administers and executes the agency\u2019s programs  relating to the structure and operation of the securities markets, which  include regulation of SROs and review of their proposed rule changes.

OCIE typically staffs inspections with a lead attorney and from 2 to 6 other  staff, who also work concurrently on at least 1 other SRO inspection. The  number of staff dedicated to SRO inspections has fluctuated in recent  years, but as of September 2007 totaled 46. According to OCIE officials,  inspections of SRO enforcement programs are intended to assess the  design and operation of SRO enforcement programs to determine if they  effectively fulfill SRO regulatory responsibilities. As part of these  inspections, OCIE takes steps to assess SRO surveillance systems, reviews  SRO policies and procedures for investigating potential violations and  disciplining violators of rules and laws, and reviews samples of SRO case  files to determine whether SRO staff were complying with the policies and  procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overall Structure of OCIE Program Encompasses Routine Inspections of Key Regulatory Programs at SROs as Well as Special Inspections", "paragraphs": ["As part of its SRO oversight responsibilities, OCIE conducts both routine  and special inspections of SRO regulatory programs. At regular intervals,  OCIE conducts routine inspections of key regulatory programs, such as  SRO enforcement, arbitration, examination, and listings programs. The  inspection cycles are based on the size of the SRO market and the type of  regulatory program, with key programs of larger SROs, such as NYSE and  NASD, being inspected from every 1 to 2 years, and smaller regional SROs  from every 3 to 4 years. Inspection of enforcement programs typically  include a review of SRO surveillance programs for identifying potential  violations of trading rules or laws, investigating those potential violations,  and disciplining those who violate the rule or law. While sometimes OCIE  conducts a comprehensive review of these programs, especially at the  smaller SROs, often these inspections focus on a specific aspect of the  programs, such as fixed income. We discuss OCIE\u2019s process for targeting  their routine inspections later in this report. OCIE also conducts special  inspections of SRO regulatory programs, as warranted. Special inspections  typically originate from a tip or need to follow up on past inspection  findings and recommendations. Special inspections also can include sweep  inspections, where OCIE probes specific activities of all SROs or a sample  of them to identify emerging compliance issues. According to OCIE  officials, some aspect of every SRO is generally examined every year  through a routine examination of a specific regulatory program or through  a special inspection.", "OCIE\u2019s inspection process for SROs generally includes a planning phase, an  on-site review and analysis, and a final inspection report to the SRO (see  fig. 1). During inspection planning, OCIE identifies the SRO program to be  inspected and assigns staff who conduct initial research on the program,  prepare materials for each individual inspection on the basis of the  inspection\u2019s focus, and draft a planning memorandum. In preparation for  the on-site inspection, OCIE typically sends an initial document request to  the SRO, asking for general program information such as organizational  charts and copies of SRO policies and procedures or, if OCIE is reviewing a  surveillance program, logs of alerts and the resulting investigations. We  discuss OCIE\u2019s review of enforcement programs in more detail later in this  section. After reviewing the documents provided, staff plan the on-site  phase of the inspection, which can include additional requests for specific  documents, such as case files, to be made available for review while on- site. OCIE staff typically spends 1 week on-site interviewing SRO staff and  reviewing SRO case files and other documentation. After the on-site visit,  OCIE staff continue their analysis in the home office; conduct follow-up  interviews or request additional documentation, as needed; and begin  drafting the inspection report. Staff present their initial inspection findings  and recommendations to the SRO in an exit interview and incorporate  initial SRO responses into the draft inspection report. Once the report is  drafted, staff then circulate it to other interested SEC divisions and  offices\u2014such as the Office of General Counsel, Market Regulation, or  Enforcement\u2014for their review and comment, and then submit the report  to the Commission for review. Following Commission consideration and  authorization, staff issue a nonpublic report to the SRO and request that the  SRO respond in writing within a specified time frame, typically 30 days.", "According to OCIE officials, they staff SRO inspections with a lead attorney  and from 2 to 6 other staff reporting to an OCIE branch chief. These  individuals are typically staffed concurrently on at least 1 other SRO  inspection. As shown in table 1, as of September 2007, the SRO inspection  group consisted of 46 staff, including 14 managers, 29 examiners, and   3 other support staff. Of the 32 examiners and support staff, 16 are  dedicated to market oversight inspections.", "Table 1 shows that between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, SRO inspection  staffing increased from 36 to 62, or 72 percent. OCIE staff said that this  increase was largely due to the increase in funding SEC received as a result  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Since then, SRO inspection staffing has  declined from 62 to 46, or 26 percent, which OCIE officials attributed to  staff attrition and the inability of OCIE to hire replacements during a SEC- wide hiring freeze that occurred from May 2005 to October 2006. OCIE  officials stated that despite the decrease in staff numbers, they have  continued to conduct routine inspections on schedule, although the  inspections may last longer than usual. Also, they said that they have not  been able to do as many special inspections as they otherwise would have  conducted. OCIE officials told us that the SRO inspection group recently  received 6 additional professional staff positions, which it is now in the  process of filling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCIE Assesses Design and Operation of SRO Enforcement Programs to Determine Whether SROs Effectively Fulfill Their Regulatory Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["According to OCIE officials, inspections of SRO enforcement programs are  intended to assess the design and operation of SRO enforcement programs  to determine whether they effectively identify violations, enforce  compliance among members, and follow their own procedures. More  specifically, OCIE officials said that when inspecting SRO surveillance  programs, their objectives are to determine whether (1) the parameters of  SRO electronic surveillance systems are appropriately designed to generate  exceptions that identify potential instances of noncompliance with SRO  rules and federal securities laws and (2) the systems are effectively  detecting such activity. When reviewing SRO surveillance systems, OCIE  begins by asking the SRO for copies of the exchange rules that it is required  to enforce, a description of the coding behind the surveillance systems  designed to monitor the markets for compliance with these rules, and logs  of the alerts that these systems generated. OCIE staff then review this  information to determine whether the system is appropriately designed to  identify noncompliance and whether it is functioning as designed. For  example, as part of one inspection, OCIE staff found that the parameters of  a specific surveillance system were too restrictive, after observing that the  system did not generate any alerts over the inspection period. Conversely,  OCIE staff said that if in reviewing a surveillance system, the inspection  team saw that the system generated 10,000 alerts every quarter, they would  follow up with the SRO to determine whether the indications of numerous  rule violations were plausible or whether the parameters of the system  were set appropriately. Either way, they said that the inspection team  would dedicate resources to looking at that system.", "Similarly, when evaluating SRO programs for investigating potential  violations of SRO rules or federal securities laws and disciplining broker- dealer members, OCIE officials stated that their objective is to determine  whether (1) SRO policies and procedures are appropriately designed to  uncover violations of SRO rules and federal securities laws and to  administer the appropriate disciplinary measures and (2) the SRO is  complying with these policies and procedures. OCIE staff first request  copies of the relevant policies and procedures for investigating surveillance  alerts and for disciplining members found to be in violation of SRO rules  and federal securities laws. They also ask for lists of the resulting  investigations and enforcement actions, including referrals on  nonmembers to SEC. OCIE staff then analyze this information to assess the  extent to which SRO policies and procedures direct the SRO staff to  conduct thorough reviews and investigations and, when applicable, to take  appropriate disciplinary action. For example, during a recently completed  sweep inspection of SRO surveillance and investigative programs related to  insider trading, OCIE evaluated related SRO policies and procedures for  reviewing alerts and opening investigations to determine whether they  directed staff to coordinate appropriately with other SROs. We discuss the  results of this sweep inspection\u2014including a plan that the options SROs  submitted to SEC to create a more uniform and coordinated method for the  regulation, surveillance, investigation, and detection of insider trading\u2014in  appendix II. As part of another inspection we reviewed, OCIE found that an  SRO had not yet developed formal procedures for its analysts to review  alerts that were generated by a recently implemented surveillance system.  OCIE recommended that the SRO develop such procedures.", "When reviewing SRO enforcement programs, OCIE also assesses whether  the SRO is in compliance with its own policies and procedures. To  accomplish this objective, OCIE staff select and review case files  pertaining to a sample of alerts, investigations, and disciplinary files from  the lists that they have asked the SRO to generate. OCIE staff said when  reviewing these files, they pay particular attention to the strength of the  evidence upon which the SRO analyst relied in determining whether to  close an alert or an investigation or to refer the case to SRO enforcement,  SEC, or other appropriate regulators. In this way, OCIE staff said they can  evaluate whether the SRO is enforcing its rules and federal securities laws  consistently among its members and, in the case of certain federal laws  such as those prohibiting insider-trading, between members and  nonmembers. For example, in one inspection we reviewed, OCIE found  that the SRO used its informal disciplinary measures inappropriately when  disciplining its members, and recommended that formal disciplinary  actions be taken when informal actions had already occurred.", "OCIE inspections may result in recommendations to SROs that are  intended to address any deficiencies identified and to improve SRO  effectiveness. OCIE officials said that for SRO enforcement programs, they  tend to make recommendations flexible enough to allow SROs to  implement them in a manner that best fits their unique business models and  surveillance systems. As we have previously discussed, if OCIE finds  serious deficiencies at an SRO, it can refer the case to Enforcement. Such  referrals are relatively infrequent\u2014between January 1995 and September  2007, SEC brought and settled 10 enforcement actions against SROs (see  app. III). According to OCIE officials, recommendation follow-up is  primarily the responsibility of the examination team, under the supervision  of the assistant director assigned to the inspection. Inspection follow-up  begins with evaluating written responses by SROs to the inspection report  and obtaining documentation of SRO efforts to address the  recommendations, and can continue for several years, depending on the  complexity of the recommendation. For example, OCIE officials said that  some recommendations, such as those that involve the design and  implementation of new information technology, may require continued  dialogue with the SRO over several years before the recommendation is  fully implemented. OCIE also may follow up on inspection  recommendations during a subsequent inspection of the SRO. OCIE  officials said that in the event the SRO does not take steps to address a  recommendation that staff believe is critical, they can elevate the matter to  OCIE management or the Commission, although they said that this  happens infrequently. We discuss the tracking of inspection  recommendations later in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Written Inspection Guidance, Increased Leveraging of SRO Internal Audit Products, and IT Improvements Could Enhance SEC Oversight of SROs", "paragraphs": ["We identified several opportunities for OCIE and Market Regulation to  enhance their oversight of SROs by developing formal guidance, leveraging  the work of SRO internal audit functions, and enhancing information  systems. First, although OCIE has developed a general process for  inspecting SRO enforcement programs, it has not developed an  examination manual or other formal guidance for examiners to use when  conducting inspections, as it has for examinations of other market  participants. Such guidance could help OCIE ensure that its inspection  procedures and products are subject to uniform standards and quality  controls. Second, OCIE has recently expanded the use of the SRO internal  and external audit reports while on-site at the SRO; however, OCIE does  not leverage this work in the planning process, which could result in  duplication of effort and missed opportunities to better target inspection  resources. Third, in accordance with SEC policy, Market Regulation  regularly inspects SRO IT systems related to market operations for  adequate security controls and reviews related to SRO internal audit  reports. However, this review does not target SRO enforcement-related  databases, which contain investigative and disciplinary information that  SROs maintain and upon which other regulators rely. Finally, OCIE  currently does not formally track the implementation status of inspection  recommendations, which ranged as high as 29 in the inspections that we  reviewed. The lack of formal tracking may reduce OCIE\u2019s ability to  efficiently and effectively generate and evaluate trend information, such as  patterns in the types of deficiencies found or the implementation status of  recommendations across SROs, or over time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Formal Guidance for Inspections of SRO Enforcement Programs Could Limit OCIE\u2019s Ability to Ensure Staff Compliance with Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["Our interviews with OCIE officials and reviews of selected inspection  workpapers indicated that OCIE examiners typically follow a general  process when conducting reviews of SRO enforcement programs. This  process begins with examination planning, is followed by data gathering,  and ends with reporting. However, OCIE has not developed an examination  manual or other formal guidance for its examiners to use when conducting  inspections of SRO enforcement programs. According to OCIE officials,  because SRO rules and corresponding surveillance systems are unique and  constantly evolving, it would be difficult to develop a detailed inspection  manual that could be tailored to all SROs and also remain current. These  officials said that an examination manual is not necessary to ensure  consistency among SRO inspections because the SRO inspection group is a  relatively small group within OCIE, and all of the staff are centralized in  headquarters. On the other hand, they said that because OCIE\u2019s inspection  program for investment companies, investment advisers, and broker- dealers has hundreds of examiners across SEC headquarters and its  regional offices who are responsible for examining thousands of firms,  OCIE has developed detailed inspection manuals to ensure consistency  across examinations of these firms. Similarly, OCIE officials said that they  have developed guidelines for SRO examiners conducting oversight  inspections of NASD\u2019s district offices because OCIE relies on examination  staff in the SEC regional offices to assist them in conducting these  inspections.", "In contrast to OCIE, federal banking regulators, such as the Federal  Reserve and OCC, have developed written guidance for the examination of  large banks\u2014also highly complex and diverse institutions\u2014that outlines  the objectives of the program and describes the processes and functional  approaches used to meet those objectives. By not establishing written  guidance for conducting inspections of SRO enforcement and other  regulatory programs, OCIE may be limiting its ability to ensure that its  inspection processes and products are subject to basic quality controls in  such areas as examination planning, data collection, and report review. For  example, in several of the inspections we reviewed, we did not find  evidence of supervisory review, which is a key aspect of inspection quality  control. According to OCIE officials, the team leader is expected to review  the work of team members. However, without written policies and  procedures specifying how and when this review is to be conducted and  documented, it is difficult to establish whether the team leaders comply  with this quality control. According to inspection standards developed by  the IG community, each organization that conducts inspections should  develop and implement written policies and procedures for internal  controls over its inspection processes to provide reasonable assurance  over conformance with organizational policies and procedures. As another  example, when conducting inspections of SRO enforcement programs,  OCIE officials said that team leaders often require their teams to use data  collection instruments, such as checklists, when reviewing SRO files to  ensure a consistent and complete review of all of the files selected,  particularly when there are inexperienced staff on the team. While  potentially an effective means of collecting data, according to OCIE  officials, the decision to use these tools is up to the individual team leader,  and not all teams employ them. According to IG inspection standards,  evidence developed under an effective system of internal controls generally  is more reliable than evidence obtained where such controls are lacking.  By not establishing standards addressing quality controls in data collection,  OCIE\u2019s ability to ensure the consistency and reliability of data collected  across its SRO inspection teams may be limited. Furthermore, without  written guidelines, new examiners lack a reference tool that could facilitate  their orientation in the inspection program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCIE\u2019s Limited Use of SRO Internal Audit Reports in Inspection Planning May Diminish Opportunities to Better Target Inspection Resources", "paragraphs": ["While OCIE employs a risk-based approach to conducting SRO inspections,  OCIE\u2019s risk-assessment and inspection planning processes do not  incorporate information gathered through SRO internal audits. According  to OCIE officials, OCIE tailors inspections of SRO programs (particularly at  the two largest SROs) to focus on those areas judged to pose the greatest  risk to the SRO or the general market. In determining which areas present  the highest risk, OCIE officials said they consider such factors as the  amount of time that has passed since a particular area was last inspected,  the size of the area, the results of past inspections, and consultations with  other SEC offices and divisions. For example, because the enforcement  programs at NASD and NYSE encompass hundreds of surveillance  systems, OCIE officials said examiners cannot review all systems as part of  one inspection. As a result, OCIE officials said examiners first conduct a  preliminary analysis of requested documents and focus inspection  resources on those systems or areas that are judged to pose the greatest  risk. According to OCIE officials, because the regional SROs have smaller  programs, OCIE staff typically are able to conduct a more comprehensive  review of the entire enforcement program during a single inspection.", "We previously recommended that OCIE develop and implement a policy  requiring examiners to routinely use SRO internal review reports in  planning and conducting SRO inspections. Prior to October 2006, OCIE\u2019s  practice was to request SRO internal audit reports only when OCIE  believed specific problems existed at an SRO. In October 2006, OCIE issued  a memorandum broadening the circumstances in which OCIE would  request and use these reports. The memorandum directs examiners to  request that SROs make all internal audit reports related to the program  area under inspection available for the staff\u2019s on-site review, including  workpapers or any reviews conducted by any regulatory quality review unit  of the SRO or an outside auditor. According to the memorandum, on-site  review of these reports may be useful in determining whether the SRO has  identified particular areas of concern in a program area and adequately  addressed those problems, assessing whether an SRO addressed prior  inspection findings and recommendations, and helping staff determine  whether they should limit or expand their review of particular issues during  an inspection.", "OCIE staff said that in fiscal year 2008, they also plan to begin reviewing  the internal audit functions of SROs, with the goal of determining whether  SRO internal audit functions are effective. For example, OCIE officials said  that they plan to evaluate whether the internal audit functions are  independent of SRO management, conduct thorough reviews of all relevant  areas (particularly, regulatory programs), and have sufficient staffing  levels. OCIE officials said that as part of their reviews, they also plan to  assess the quality and reliability of SRO internal audit reports and assess  whether SROs have implemented the recommendations resulting from  these reports. OCIE officials told us that they are in the planning phase of  this review, and, as such, they have not yet developed written guidance for  their examiners in conducting these reviews.", "While OCIE\u2019s October 2006 memorandum broadened the use of SRO  internal audit reports to encompass on-site reviews during inspections, it  did not address the use of internal audit reports for planning purposes, as  we had recommended. In contrast, the risk assessments of large banks that  federal bank examiners conduct during the planning phase are based, in  part, on internal audit reports, and examiners may adjust their examination  plans to avoid duplication of effort and minimize burden to the bank. For  example, according to examination guidance that the Federal Reserve  issued, to avoid duplication of effort and burden to the institution,  examiners may consider using these workpapers and conclusions to the  extent that examiners test the work performed by the internal or external  auditors and determine it is reliable. Similarly, examination guidance  issued by OCC states that examiners\u2019 assessments of a bank\u2019s audit and  control functions help leverage OCC resources, establish the scope of  current and future supervisory activities, and assess the quality of risk  management.", "By not considering the work and work products of SRO internal audit  functions in its inspection planning process, OCIE examiners may be  duplicating SRO efforts, causing regulatory burden, or missing  opportunities to direct examination resources to other higher-risk or less- examined program areas. For example, our previous work, which focused  on the listing programs of SROs, showed that SRO internal audit functions  had examined or were in the process of examining aspects of their listing  programs that OCIE had covered in its most recent inspections, and that  resulting reports could be useful to OCIE in planning as well as conducting  inspections. As OCIE begins to assess the quality of SRO internal audit  functions and work products, the opportunity exists for OCIE to further  leverage these products in targeting its own inspection efforts. OCIE  officials said that as part of their upcoming reviews of SRO internal audit  functions, they will assess whether SRO internal audit products may be  helpful in assisting them in targeting inspections of particular SRO  functions.", "OCIE could also further leverage the work performed by SRO internal and  external auditors to monitor a particular regulatory program between  inspections. In our review of OCIE inspections of NASD and NYSE  enforcement programs, as many as 8 years passed between inspections of a  particular surveillance system and related investigations and disciplinary  actions. Moreover, as OCIE officials noted, the recent decline in SRO  inspection staff has lengthened the time it takes to complete a routine SRO  inspection and limited their ability to conduct additional special  inspections.

Under SEC\u2019s  Automation Review Policy (ARP), Market Regulation conducts on-site  reviews of SRO trading systems, information dissemination systems,  clearance and settlement systems, and electronic communications  networks and makes recommendations for improvements when  necessary. Market Regulation also conducts reviews of SRO general and  application controls over the collection of fees under section 31 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These are IT systems designated for  remitting fees to SEC as part of the section 31 program, which ensures that  the data produced by these systems are authorized, and completely and  accurately processed and reported.", "Market Regulation officials said that they do not target enforcement-related  databases for specific review, since the ARP policy statement is specifically  intended to oversee systems essential to market operations. These officials  said that Market Regulation could include a review of the security of  enforcement-related databases both in their general assessments of SRO IT  infrastructure security within the ARP and in section 31 reviews. They  explained that both of these reviews include testing of components and  evaluations of general access controls and changes made within SRO  organizationwide network structures in their routine reviews of specific IT  programs and systems, such as SRO computer operations, security  assessments, internal and external audit IT coverage, and systems outage  notification procedures and systems change notifications. However, these  general assessments by Market Regulation would not necessarily provide  SEC with information on potential risks specific to the security of the data  contained in enforcement-related databases.", "NASD and NYSE officials told us that they conduct their own regular  internal inspections of security of IT systems, which include reviews of  enforcement-related databases. In addition, both SROs contract with  external companies that regularly conduct reviews of the security controls  of their technology systems. We reviewed several of these internal and  external audits, which include reviews of SRO enforcement-related  systems and databases conducted from fiscal years 2002 through 2006.  These reviews generally concluded that NASD and NYSE have adequate  controls in place to protect sensitive enforcement-related data.", "The internal and external audit reports of NYSE and NASD that we  reviewed showed that these reports could be a valuable source of  information for Market Regulation on specific risks to enforcement-related  databases. Market Regulation officials said that in conducting ARP-related  inspections, they review SRO internal and external audit reports related to  the infrastructure of SRO IT systems; however, they do not specifically look  for information related to the assessment of security of enforcement- related databases.

For example, as we discuss later in  this report, SEC uses SRO surveillance data in carrying out its own  enforcement efforts related to securities trading. Furthermore, SROs are  responsible for maintaining complaint and disciplinary data on their  members\u2014information that is essential for identifying recidivists. By not  periodically obtaining information to ensure that the SRO risk-assessment  process and SRO-sponsored audits continue to be included in SRO  assessment cycles and that the audits are comprehensive and complete,  Market Regulation cannot assess whether SROs have taken the appropriate  steps to ensure the security of sensitive enforcement-related information,  or the level of risk that a data breach could pose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Formal Tracking System May Limit OCIE\u2019s Ability to Effectively Assess SRO Implementation of Inspection Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Although OCIE officials said that they have worked with SROs to address  the intent of recent inspection recommendations, we were not able to  readily verify the status of the recommendations in the inspections we  reviewed because OCIE does not formally track inspection  recommendations or the status of their implementation.

Of  the 11 inspections of NASD and NYSE enforcement programs we reviewed,  the number of recommendations OCIE made ranged from 4 to 29, with an  average of 11. They also ranged in complexity, from asking the SRO to  update its policies and procedures to recommending that an SRO  implement an entire surveillance program. For example, we observed  recommendations calling for, among other things, improving case file  documentation, changing the parameters of a surveillance system,  implementing an automated tracking system, and improving SRO member  education. OCIE officials said that some inspections resulted in as many as  30 or 40 recommendations. Without a formal tracking system, OCIE  management must rely on staff\u2019s availability and ability to recall  recommendation-related information, which may be reliable when  discussing an individual inspection, but may limit OCIE management\u2019s  ability to efficiently generate and evaluate trend information, such as  patterns in the types of deficiencies found or the implementation status of  recommendations across SROs, or over time. Implementing a formal  tracking system would not only allow management to more robustly assess  the recommendations to SROs and their progress in implementing them,  but would allow it to develop performance measures that could assist  management in evaluating the effectiveness of its inspection program.", "According to OCIE and SEC\u2019s OIT officials, OCIE recently began working  with OIT to develop a new examination tracking system that will include  the capability to track SRO responses and implementation status of OCIE  recommendations. OCIE officials said that planned requirements for the  system includes a field to enter the recommendation, a field for OCIE  inspectors to broadly categorize the status of its implementation, and a text  box for inspectors to elaborate on the recommendation and its  implementation status. OCIE officials also said that they expect that the  system will be able to trace the history of a recommendation. OIT officials  told us that they are developing separate software that will allow OCIE to  generate management reports using data from the tracking systems as well  as other database; however, the requirements for any management reports  OCIE would receive have yet to be determined. According to an OCIE  official, the recommendation tracking system and reporting capabilities  may be an effective way to provide OCIE management with a high-level  characterization of implementation status. OCIE officials said that in  response to our concerns, they plan to deploy an interim, stand-alone  recommendation tracking system that will provide a management report, in  the form of a spreadsheet, that contains all open recommendations to SROs  resulting from SRO inspections and the current status of SRO efforts to  implement them.

The system  primarily receives information on unusual market activity based on SRO  surveillance of trades among stock issuers. This information includes the  name of the security issuer; the date of the unusual activity; and a  description of the type of activity, among other data. The SRO system also  stores narrative attachments, which the SROs provide to SEC, that contain  additional information about individuals or entities, such as investment  advisers or hedge funds, associated with unusual market activity. While the  system allows OMS staff to search by issuer, the narrative information  cannot be easily searched in the system; instead, the attachments must be  individually opened and read. An Enforcement branch chief noted that  narrative information can help establish patterns of behavior that are  critical when SEC tries to investigate potentially fraudulent activity, such as  market manipulation and insider trading. Furthermore, only OMS branch  chiefs have access to the SRO system, so attorneys who need that  information have to consult with OMS branch chiefs or contact SRO staff  directly, rather than access that information electronically. In addition,  since the referral receipt and case tracking systems are not linked,  management is unable to readily assess the efficiency and effectiveness of  the referral and investigation processes. For example, SEC is unable to  extract information from a single source on how long it takes both SROs  and SEC to work through different stages of cases over time, from referral  receipt (SRO system) to opening MUIs and conducting investigations (case  tracking system). SEC headquarters and regional office officials noted  that receiving information in a timely manner is critical to the investigative  steps of assembling the facts of the case and collecting evidence on those  potentially involved with unusual market activity. To obtain this  information and customized reports and statistics on Enforcement  operations, division officials said they must submit requests to SEC\u2019s OIT  and then wait for OIT staff to respond to the request.

For example, in response to an OCIE recommendation, SROs in  the options market have developed a new surveillance authority, which is  intended to improve coordination among SROs in monitoring the markets  for insider trading and investigating any resulting alerts. The equities  markets are expected to soon follow with a similar plan. SEC, through its  Enforcement Division, has worked with SROs to detect and respond to  potential securities laws violations. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2006,  SEC responded to an increasing number of SRO referrals\u2014a large  percentage of which are related to insider trading\u2014with an increasing  number of investigations and enforcement actions. SEC has started to  incorporate the results of SRO internal audits into its on-site inspections,  which helps to leverage resources. In addition, the agency plans to expand  its oversight of SRO functions to include reviews of the internal audit  function\u2014with an emphasis on independence, staffing levels, and scope of  coverage. Such reviews could help ensure that SROs are effectively  assessing risks, instituting appropriate controls, and carrying out their  responsibilities.", "However, several opportunities exist to enhance the efforts used by SEC to  oversee SROs and, particularly, their enforcement programs. Specifically,  OCIE examiners are conducting inspections of SRO enforcement programs  without formal guidance. Although our review of a sample of inspections  found that examiners have developed a methodology for reviewing SRO  enforcement programs, the lack of written guidance\u2014which establishes  minimum standards and quality controls\u2014could limit OCIE\u2019s ability to  provide reasonable assurances that its inspection processes and products  are subject to basic quality controls in such areas as examination planning,  data collection, and report review. Moreover, the lack of formal guidance  could result in individual inspection teams creating data collection and  other examination tools that otherwise would be centralized and more  efficiently shared across inspection teams.", "Furthermore, OCIE\u2019s recent internal guidance on the use of SRO internal  audit-related reports does not address the use of these reports for risk- assessment and inspection planning purposes, as we have previously  recommended. We continue to believe that the use of these reports when  conducting risk assessments and determining the scope of an upcoming  inspection could allow OCIE to better leverage its inspection resources,  especially if OCIE determines that the reports produced by SRO internal  audit functions are reliable. As OCIE officials noted, they plan to begin  assessing SRO internal audit functions in 2008, including the quality and  reliability of their work products, although they have not yet developed  guidance for inspection staff on conducting these reviews. By not  considering the work and work products of the SRO internal audit function  in its inspection planning process, OCIE may be duplicating SRO efforts  and not maximizing the use of its limited resources. OCIE also may be  missing an opportunity to better monitor the effectiveness of the SRO  regulatory programs (including enforcement programs) between  inspections.", "SEC also has an opportunity to leverage the work of SRO internal audit  functions in its assessment of information security at SROs. Since ARP  Policy Statements specifically are intended to oversee systems essential to  market operations, Market Regulation officials do not target enforcement- related databases for specific review. Although SROs have assessed the  security controls of these databases, Market Regulation officials have little  knowledge of the content or comprehensiveness of these audits. As a  result, Market Regulation cannot determine whether SROs have taken the  appropriate steps to ensure the security of this sensitive information.  Market Regulation could facilitate this evaluation by making certain that  enforcement-related databases continue to be periodically reviewed by  SROs, and that these reviews are comprehensive and complete.", "Both OCIE and Enforcement could benefit from improvements to  information technology systems when overseeing SROs. OCIE currently  lacks a system that tracks the status of inspection recommendations. OCIE  officials told us that a new examination tracking database is in  development that will allow OCIE to track the implementation of  inspection recommendations as well as software that will allow OCIE to  generate management reports from this database. By ensuring these  system capabilities, OCIE management could improve its ability to monitor  the implementation of OCIE recommendations, and begin developing  measures for assessing the effectiveness of its program.", "Finally, while SEC has responded to a significant increase in SRO referrals  between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, Enforcement\u2019s systems for receiving  referrals and tracking the resulting investigations have limited capabilities  for searching and analyzing information related to these referrals.  Enforcement is currently working to address some limitations in its case  tracking system; however, this effort does not include making  improvements to the separate system used to receive and manage SRO  referrals. By including system improvements to allow electronic access to  all of the information contained in advisories and referrals submitted by  SROs, generate management reports, and provide links to the case tracking  system, Enforcement could enhance its ability to efficiently and effectively  manage SRO advisories and referrals and conduct analyses that could  contribute to improved SEC planning, operations, and oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance SEC oversight of SROs, we recommend that the SEC Chairman  take the following three actions:  establish a written framework for conducting inspections of SRO  enforcement programs to help ensure a reliable and consistent source of  information on SRO inspection processes, minimum standards, and  quality controls; and, as part of this framework, broaden current  guidance to SRO inspection staff on the use of SRO internal audit  reports to direct examiners to consider the extent to which they will rely  on reports and reviews of internal and external audit and other risk- management systems when planning SRO inspections;  ensure that Market Regulation makes certain that SROs include in their  periodic risk assessment of their IT systems a review of the security of  their enforcement-related databases, and that Market Regulation  reviews the comprehensiveness and completeness of the related SRO- sponsored audits of their enforcement-related databases; and  as part of the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve information   ensure that any software developed for tracking SRO inspections  includes the ability to track and report SRO responses to and  implementation status of OCIE inspections recommendations and   consider system improvements that would allow Enforcement staff  to electronically access and search all information in advisories and  referrals submitted by SROs and generate reports that would  facilitate monitoring and analysis of trend information and case  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from SEC.

We also  reviewed and analyzed an OCIE memorandum to the Commission  describing the SRO inspection process, staffing data provided by OCIE, and  our prior work. Furthermore, we observed a demonstration of various  information technology systems that NASD used to monitor the markets  and track investigations and disciplinary actions. Finally, we reviewed and  summarized the enforcement actions brought by SEC against SROs from  1995 to 2007. We also conducted interviews with staff from OCIE, NASD,  and NYSE.", "To evaluate certain aspects of SEC\u2019s inspection program, including  guidance and planning, the use of SRO internal audit products, and the  tracking of inspection recommendations, we reviewed OCIE inspection  guidance related to the review of NASD district offices and SRO internal  audit reports, guidance for bank examiners from the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency, inspection guidelines developed by the inspectors general, and  our prior work. In addition, we reviewed SEC guidance for conducting  reviews of SRO information technology (IT) related to market trading  operations and regulatory fee remittance, and NASD and NYSE internal  and external audits of IT security. Furthermore, we reviewed internal  control standards for the federal government and conducted interviews  with officials from OCIE and SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement  (Enforcement) on their respective procedures for ensuring that SROs  implement inspection recommendations and remedial actions required as  part of enforcement actions. We also conducted interviews with staff from  OCIE, SEC\u2019s Division of Market Regulation and Office of Information  Technology, NASD, and NYSE.", "To describe the SRO referral process and recent trends in referral numbers  and related SEC investigations, and evaluate SEC\u2019s information system for  advisories and referrals, we observed a demonstration from Enforcement  staff on the capabilities of their IT systems, analyzed data from SEC\u2019s SRO  Referral Receipt System (SRO system) and Case Activity Tracking System  (CATS), and interviewed Enforcement, NASD, and NYSE staff to determine  how SEC manages the processes for receiving SRO referrals and  conducting subsequent investigations. In particular, to understand trends in  SRO advisories, referrals, and subsequent SEC investigations, we requested  and analyzed data from SEC\u2019s referral and case tracking systems from  fiscal years 2003 through 2006. We analyzed the data to provide descriptive  information on the number of SEC\u2019s advisories, referrals, matters under  inquiry (MUI), investigations, actions, and case outcomes during the  period. We also analyzed these data by manually merging records from the  SRO system and CATS to obtain descriptive data on the amount of time it  takes SROs to identify unusual market activity and convey that information  to SEC, as well as how long it takes SEC to respond by opening MUIs and  investigations and achieving case outcomes. We inquired about checks SEC  performs on the data and deemed the data reliable for the purposes of  addressing our objectives. When calculating the average duration of stages  to process SRO referrals, we distinguished between case stages that  featured both open and close dates and those that were open or active as of  the date we received data from SEC, and we reported duration information  accordingly. In addition, to calculate case stage durations, we consulted  with SEC and SRO staff to distinguish between initial and updated referrals  and performed duration calculations using initial referrals only to avoid  double counting that could skew the average duration results.", "We performed our work in Washington, D.C.; New York, New York; and  Rockville, Maryland, between September 2006 and September 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Oversight of SRO Enforcement Programs Related to Insider Trading", "paragraphs": ["SRO surveillance, investigative, and disciplinary programs are designed to  enforce SRO rules and federal securities laws related to insider trading\u2014 the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to material,  nonpublic information about the security\u2014and are subject to SEC  oversight through periodic inspections by OCIE. In January 2007, OCIE  completed a sweep inspection (a probe of specific activities across all or a  sample of SROs) of SRO enforcement programs related to insider trading.  As a result of OCIE\u2019s inspection, the options SROs submitted a plan to SEC  to create a more uniform and coordinated method for surveillance and  investigation of insider trading in the options markets, and the equities  SROs indicated their intent to submit a similar plan.

Insider trading is illegal because  any trading that is based on this information is unfair to investors who do  not have access to the information. When persons buy or sell securities on  the basis of information not generally available to the public, investor  confidence in market fairness can be eroded. Information that could be  exploited for personal gain by insiders include such things as advance  knowledge of mergers or acquisitions, development of a new drug or  product, or earnings announcements. While company insiders (e.g.,  directors and senior executives) may be the most likely individuals to  possess material, nonpublic information, others outside of the company  also may gain access to the information and use it for their personal gain.  For example, employees at a copy store who discovered material,  nonpublic information while making presentation booklets for a firm could  commit insider trading if they traded on that information prior to it being  made public.", "To detect insider trading, SROs have established electronic surveillance  systems that monitor their markets for aberrational movements in a stock\u2019s  price or volume of shares traded, among other things, and generate alerts if  a stock\u2019s price or volume of shares traded moves outside of set parameters.  These systems link trade activity data to news and research about  corporate transactions (such as mergers, acquisitions, or earnings  announcements); public databases of listed company officers and  directors; and other internal and external sources of information to detect  possible insider trading. For example, the NASD Securities Observation  News Analysis and Regulation system combines trade activity on NASDAQ,  the American Stock Exchange, and the over-the-counter markets with news  stories and other external sources of information to detect potential  instances of insider trading and other potential violations of federal  securities laws or NASD rules.", "SRO staff review the thousands of alerts generated by the electronic  surveillance systems annually to identify those that are most likely to  involve insider trading or fraud and warrant further investigation. In  conducting reviews of these alerts, SRO staff consider such factors as the  materiality of news, the existence of any previous news announcements,  and the profit potential. If, in reviewing the trading associated with the  alert, SRO staff determines there is a strong likelihood of insider trading,  they can expand this review to a full investigation. In the course of a full  investigation, SROs gather information from their member broker-dealers  and the issuer of the traded stock to determine whether there is any  relationship between those individuals who traded the stock and those  individuals who had advance knowledge of the transaction or event. For  example, SRO staff will typically request from their member broker-dealers  the names of individuals and organizations that traded in advance of a  corporate transaction or event, a process known as bluesheeting. These  data are then cross-referenced with information the SRO staff obtain from  the issuer of the stock, including a chronology of the events leading up to  the corporate transaction or event and the names of individuals who had  knowledge of inside information.", "SROs have created technology-based tools to assist in the identification of  potential repeat offenders. For example, SROs can compare their blue  sheets to a database called the Unusual Activity File (UAF), which includes  data on suspicious trading activity identified by all SROs that are part of the  Intermarket Surveillance Group, to help identify persons or entities that  have been flagged in prior referrals or cases related to insider trading,  fraud, or market manipulation. Some SROs have also developed other  databases for their internal use. For example, NASD developed a database  similar to the UAF for suspicious trading activity it has identified. NYSE  also has developed a database of individuals who are affiliated with entities  that it considers at high risk for insider trading.", "When SROs find evidence of insider trading involving their members, they  can conduct disciplinary hearings and impose penalties ranging from  disciplinary letters to fines to expulsion from trading and SRO  membership. Because SROs do not have jurisdiction over entities and  individuals that are not part of their membership, they refer suspicious  trading on the part of nonmembers directly to Enforcement. Although  Enforcement staff do not have direct access to SRO surveillance data or  recidivist databases like the UAF, several staff told us they are able to  obtain any needed information from the SRO analysts who made the  referrals.", "Data we reviewed from NASD and NYSE between fiscal years 2003 and  2006 showed that the SROs referred significantly more nonmembers to  SEC for suspected insider trading than they referred members internally to  their own Enforcement staff. According to SRO staff, this may be because  the majority of the entities and individuals who trade on the basis of  material, nonpublic information do so as a result of connections to the  issuers of the stocks traded, rather than the investment advisor role that  would involve member firms and their employees. Another possible  explanation, according to SRO staff, is that the individual registered  persons (SRO members) typically conceal their misconduct by trading in  nominee accounts or secretly sharing in the profits generated by  nonregistered persons involved in the scheme. As a result, they said that  concealed member misconduct is often exposed through evidence  developed by SEC using its broader jurisdictional tools after the SRO has  referred a nonmember to SEC. For example, they said that SEC can expose  the concealed member misconduct by fully investigating the nonregistered  person\u2019s activities through documents such as telephone and bank records  obtained by subpoena. SEC also has the ability to issue subpoenas to  nonmembers to appear for investigative testimony."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC\u2019s Inspection Program to Oversee SRO Enforcement Efforts Has Identified Opportunities for SROs to Improve Surveillance of Insider Trading", "paragraphs": ["OCIE assesses the effectiveness of SRO regulatory programs, including  enforcement programs, through periodic inspections. OCIE officials said  that when evaluating SRO enforcement programs related to insider trading,  their objective is to assess whether the parameters of the surveillance  systems are appropriately set to detect abnormal movements in a stocks\u2019  price or volume and generate an alert, the extent to which SRO policies and  procedures direct the SRO staff to conduct thorough reviews of alerts and  resulting investigations, and the extent to which SRO analysts comply with  these policies and procedures and apply them consistently. OCIE staff said  that when reviewing case files, one of their priorities is to assess the  evidence upon which the SRO analyst relied when deciding to terminate  the review of an alert or investigation. For example, they said that they will  assess whether the analyst selected an appropriate period to review trading  records (because suspicious trades may have occurred several days or  weeks prior to the material news announcement), whether the analyst  reviewed the UAF and internal databases for evidence of recidivism, and  whether the analyst appropriately reviewed any other stocks or entities  related to the trading alert.", "OCIE officials said that in light of the recent increase in merger and  acquisition activity and the increased potential for insider trading, SROs  are making greater efforts to detect attempts of individuals or firms to  benefit on both sides of a merger or acquisition. For example, they said  that where previously it was common for one SRO analyst to investigate  any alerts generated from the movement of the target firm and for a  different analyst to investigate any alerts generated from the movement of  the acquiring firm\u2014making it difficult to identify an account or individual  that may have traded on both sides of the acquisition\u2014SRO policies now  generally require one analyst to review and investigate both stocks  involved in a merger or acquisition. Generally speaking, mergers and  acquisitions present opportunities for insider trading because the acquiring  company generally must pay more per share than the current price, causing  the target firm\u2019s stock price to increase. In this case, an individual with  knowledge of an upcoming acquisition could purchase the target\u2019s stock  prior to the announcement and then sell for a gain the stock after the  announcement at the higher price. An individual also could sell any  holdings or sell short the stock of the acquiring firm if the individual  believed that the acquiring firm\u2019s stock price would decrease after the  announcement. Finally, an individual could attempt to buy the target firm  and sell (or short sell) the acquiring firm in an attempt to benefit on both  sides of an acquisition.", "In January 2007, OCIE completed sweep inspections of surveillance and  investigatory programs related to insider trading at 10 SROs. As a result of  its inspections, OCIE identified opportunities for improved coordination  and standardization among SROs in monitoring and investigating possible  insider trading. OCIE found that because each SRO at the time maintained  its own surveillance systems, the variances in the system parameters could  result in the possibility that stock or option movements might generate an  alert at one SRO but not another. Furthermore, OCIE found that because  each SRO was responsible for monitoring every stock that traded on its  market, the SROs were duplicating the initial screening of alerts.", "As a result of OCIE\u2019s then ongoing inspection, the options SROs submitted  a plan to SEC to create a more uniform and coordinated method for the  regulation, surveillance, investigation, and detection of insider trading in  the options markets. SEC approved the plan, called Options Regulatory  Surveillance Authority (ORSA), in June 2006. The plan allows the options  SROs to delegate part or all of the responsibility of conducting insider  trading surveillance and investigations for all options trades to one or more  SROs, with individual SROs remaining responsible for the regulation of  their respective markets and retaining responsibility to bring disciplinary  proceedings as appropriate. ORSA has currently delegated this surveillance  and investigative responsibility to the Chicago Board Options Exchange.  The ORSA plan also provides for the establishment of a policy committee  that is responsible for overseeing the operation of the plan and for making  all relevant policy decisions, including reviewing and approving  surveillance standards and other parameters to be used by the SRO  performing the surveillance and investigative functions under the plan. The  committee also will establish guidelines for generating, reviewing, and  closing insider trading alerts; specific and detailed instructions on how  analysts should review alerts; and instructions on closing procedures,  including proper documentation and rationale for closing an alert. OCIE  officials stated that they have met regularly with the options SROs to  monitor the implementation of the plan and the development of related  policies and procedures. According to the Commission, the ORSA plan  should allow the options exchanges to more efficiently implement  surveillance programs for the detection of insider trading, while  eliminating redundant effort. As a result, OCIE officials believe the plan  will promote more effective regulation and surveillance.", "According to OCIE officials, the equities SROs are currently drafting a  similar plan for coordinating insider trading surveillance in equities  markets. However, instead of designating one SRO to conduct all insider  trading-related surveillance, OCIE officials said that the current draft  proposal would require each listing market, or its designee, to conduct  insider trading surveillance for its listed issues, regardless of where trading  in the security occurred. This includes reviewing alerts, pursuing  investigations, and resolving cases through referrals (to SEC) or  disciplinary action. OCIE officials said that the equities SROs anticipate  voting on a proposed plan at the October 2007 Intermarket Surveillance  Group meeting and to submit the plan to SEC by the end of 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SEC Civil Enforcement Actions against SROs, January 1995\u2013September 2007", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to sections 19 and 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, SEC  may bring enforcement actions against an SRO either in federal court or  through an administrative proceeding if it has found that an SRO has  violated or is unable to comply with the provisions of the act and related  rules and regulations, or if it has failed to enforce member compliance with  SRO rules without reasonable justification or excuse.
