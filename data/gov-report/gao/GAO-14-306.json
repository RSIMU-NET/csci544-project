The goals of OPM's innovation lab are to provide federal workers with 21st century skills in design-led innovation, such as intelligent risk-taking to develop new services, products, and processes. OPM's lab was built at a reported cost of $1.1 million, including facility upgrades and construction, equipment and training, and other personnel costs. The lab employs approximately 6 full-time equivalents, including a director, and in fiscal year 2013, the lab's operating costs were approximately $476,000, including salaries.", "OPM's innovation lab is similar in mission and design to other innovation labs GAO reviewed, and OPM has incorporated some of the prevalent practices that other labs use to sustain their operations. Specifically, OPM is using its lab for a variety of projects, including as a classroom for building the capacity to innovate in the federal government. Lab staff indicated that they plan to begin long-term immersion projects\u2014complex projects with diverse users\u2014within a few months. OPM plans to develop and implement evaluation plans specific to each immersion project that will help them track cost benefits or performance improvement benefits associated with the projects.", "Starting in March 2013, OPM lab staff began work on a program evaluation framework to more systematically measure the lab's progress toward meeting its overarching goals. In addition, lab staff members are tracking lab activities, such as classes and workshops, and are surveying lab users about the quality of their experience in the lab. However, they have not developed performance targets or measures related to project outcomes, and without a rigorous evaluation framework that can help OPM track the lab's performance, it will be hard to demonstrate that the lab is operating as originally envisioned.", "While labs provide a physical space where innovators can convene, federal agencies are not fully aware of their growing community. However, OPM is taking steps to ensure work done in the lab is shared across OPM and with other federal innovators\u2014for example, by hosting weekly training sessions in the lab on best practices. Studies show that information sharing and interorganizational networks can be a powerful driver supporting innovation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that the Director of OPM should direct lab staff to 1) develop a mix of performance targets and measures to help them monitor and report on progress toward lab goals, and 2) build on existing efforts to share information with other agencies that have innovation labs.

To try  to instill a culture of innovation in its agency, in March 2012, the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) followed the lead of a number of private  sector companies, nonprofit organizations, and U.S. and foreign  government bodies and created an innovation lab. An innovation lab is  generally defined as a distinct physical space with a set of policies for  engaging people and using technology in problem solving. OPM\u2019s lab,  located in the sub-basement of its Washington, D.C. headquarters, uses  a problem-solving approach called \u201chuman-centered design,\u201d which is  described as the discipline of generating concrete solutions and ideas  driven by the needs, behaviors, and context of the people for whom they  are designed. This approach also uses iterative testing of new services,  products, and processes and is intended to encourage faster learning at  the front end of the design process rather than large, expensive failures  upon implementation. The premise behind OPM\u2019s lab was that the new  space and a new approach to problem solving would support efforts to  address some complex issues and eventually lead to a more innovative  agency culture.", "You requested that we review OPM\u2019s innovation lab. This report (1)  describes the OPM innovation lab\u2019s start-up and operating costs, staffing  and organization, activities, and policies governing the lab\u2019s use, and (2)  assesses how OPM\u2019s innovation lab compares to other organizations\u2019  innovation labs, including how it uses benchmarks and associated metrics  and how it addresses potential challenges to innovation.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed documentation on OPM\u2019s  start-up and operating costs, staffing, and policies regarding the lab and  interviewed OPM staff overseeing the lab and its activities. To address  the second objective, we conducted a comprehensive literature search\u2014 including research conducted by global consulting firms and academic  institutions\u2014and interviewed representatives familiar with innovation  facilities. We reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from the  U.S. Census Bureau (Census), the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) innovation labs. In addition, we met with an official  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). While CFPB  lacks a dedicated innovation lab, the agency has a reputation among  federal agencies as a leader in innovative website development. We also  interviewed representatives from other government, private sector, and  nonprofit organization innovation facilities, such as Denmark\u2019s MindLab,  the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, and UNICEF\u2019s innovation  labs. To select organizations for comparison, we identified those with  innovation facilities similar to OPM\u2019s lab, including those with a dedicated  physical space and using similar problem-solving methods. We examined  documentation and interviewed OPM lab staff regarding identifying any  outcomes\u2014such as cost reductions, performance improvements, or other  results from projects\u2014undertaken by the lab since its inception. We also  conducted a detailed literature search to identify benchmarks and  associated metrics applicable to the development and use of innovation  facilities in the public and private sectors. Based on our literature search,  we identified common challenges that can hamper organizations\u2019 efforts  to use labs as innovation vehicles and prevalent practices that can  support labs\u2019 success and sustainability. In addition, we reviewed our  interview records to identify commonly recurring challenges and prevalent  practices that can support labs\u2019 success and sustainability. We verified  that the challenges and prevalent practices we identified during our  literature search were also those more often cited during the interviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to March 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. More detailed information on  our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Innovation is a dynamic process through which problems and challenges  are defined, new and creative ideas are developed, and new solutions are  selected and implemented. It is also a complex process that involves  taking iterative steps to solve problems. Innovation requires an  environment that encourages participants to challenge traditional  practices without fear of repercussions. Ideally, innovation participants  are empowered to be creative and make mistakes, and appropriate risk- taking is not only tolerated but encouraged.", "Some federal leaders are trying various innovation tools, including on-line  idea submission programs, competitions, and prizes, as ways of  unleashing employee creativity. For example, in a memorandum issued in  March 2010, the administration urged federal agencies to use challenges  and prizes to crowdsource innovative approaches to government  initiatives and programs. At relatively low costs, crowdsourcing initiatives  can garner valuable and creative solutions that may not have come  through traditional means. As another example, the Presidential  Innovation Fellows program pairs top innovators from the private sector,  nonprofit organizations, and academia with top innovators in government  to collaborate during focused six- to thirteen-month periods. The program  aims to develop solutions that can save lives, save taxpayer money, and  fuel job creation. For example, the goal of one of the program\u2019s projects is  to identify information critical to saving lives and mitigating damage in a  disaster.", "Even with the efforts of some federal leaders to encourage innovation,  federal government-wide scores tracking how agencies foster and reward  employee innovation dropped in 2013 for the second year in a row.  OPM\u2019s 2013 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, released in November  2013, found that only 35 percent of federal workers believe that creativity  and innovation are rewarded, with positive responses in this area showing  a steady decline of six percentage points over the past three years.  Research suggests that half of all innovations are not initiated by  organizational leaders. Instead, research shows that it is important to  have processes for gathering stakeholders\u2019 and front-line workers\u2019 views  to identify areas for possible improvement.", "As an innovation tool, labs are based on the idea that the competencies  needed for systematic innovation\u2014such as intelligent risk-taking to  develop new services, products and processes\u2014are not the same as  those required for daily operations. Innovation labs seek to provide  approaches, skills, models, and tools beyond those that most employees  are trained in and use to do their work. In addition, public sector  innovation labs can be viewed as attempts to create an organizational  response to a range of challenges to innovation, as innovation efforts face  unique obstacles in the public sector. For example, funding for new public  ventures is limited, and the risks of innovation are high in government. A  defining characteristic of the public sector is that it is subject to broad  scrutiny, so that when an innovation fails or is less than a complete  success, there is the prospect of political consequences.", "With constrained budgets expected to continue into the foreseeable  future, innovation in our public services is a necessity. In the last decade,  many public sector organizations around the globe have set up facilities  with the explicit purpose of supporting innovation efforts. For example,  Denmark\u2019s MindLab, started in 2002, is a cross-governmental innovation  unit that is part of the country\u2019s Ministry of Business and Growth, the  Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Employment, and Odense  Municipality, and which collaborates with the Ministry for Economic Affairs  and the Interior. The group covers broad policy areas including areas  such as entrepreneurship, digital self-service, education, and  employment. OPM\u2019s lab was modeled, in part, on Denmark\u2019s MindLab.", "OPM officials, consistent with other innovation lab representatives we  interviewed, maintained that, unlike a typical conference room, innovation  labs can be easily reconfigured for large groups and smaller breakout  sessions. They allow users to write on walls and preserve visual artifacts  more easily than typical cubicles and traditional office space. This can be  done with very low-tech tools such as markers and a whiteboard. Figure 1  shows a view of OPM\u2019s lab.", "Organizations with different missions are pursuing a lab-based strategy to  foster innovation. For example, organizations\u2014including OPM\u2014use their  labs as a space where participants can conceptualize and prototype new  products or processes outside their normal environment. Many also use  their labs as a teaching space where participants can exchange ideas  and information through classes, workshops, presentations, or other  events.

During these first 4  months after the lab was built, OPM made the space available to the  OPM workforce for meetings and events. OPM leadership also used this  time to investigate an appropriate problem-solving approach to pair with  the lab that would be consistent with approaches used by other labs; they  determined that a human-centered design approach and curriculum  would complement OPM employees\u2019 technical expertise and analytic  competencies. OPM also began to recruit interested staff from the  Employee Services Division to be trained in human-centered design  fundamentals: this staff would then support project sessions in the lab as  part of their collateral duties.", "Phase II lasted from July 2012 through March 2013 and consisted mostly  of facilitated sessions with OPM project teams. During these sessions,  Employee Services staff worked with project teams to generate ideas to  long-standing problems through exercises such as project or strategic  planning, brainstorming sessions, or stakeholder mapping aimed at  discussing and testing potential solutions. Topics discussed during these  sessions involved a variety of initiatives directed at improving OPM  processes and addressing government-wide human resources  challenges. OPM officials noted that innovation lab projects have  included, among others, designing an implementation plan with other  federal agencies to collect valid, accurate, and timely data on the federal  cyber security workforce; updating the government-wide strategy for  veterans recruitment; attracting and retaining individuals with talent in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines; and  specific challenges unique to individual agencies.", "Phase III lasted from April through November 2013. In Phase III, OPM  continued to provide facilitated design sessions and in some cases,  follow-on coaching to program offices from within OPM and OPM-led  projects. For example, a facilitated design session included lab staff  working with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Battery Working  Group to more effectively engage with the group\u2019s external stakeholders.  According to an OPM case study about the lab, eight FDA employees  attended the Fundamentals of Human-Centered Design course. Following  the course, lab staff provided planning support for a public workshop with  over 200 participants from stakeholder groups including medical device  and battery manufacturers, other regulatory groups, and hospital staff; lab  staff also attended the Battery-Powered Medical Device workshop to  support the FDA team in their use of design methods. According to an  FDA participant, their collaboration with the lab helped them engage in  stakeholder dialogue that would not have been otherwise possible. OPM  lab staff also began to offer classes in the lab designed to develop  mission-critical skills federal workers need to become better problem  solvers. The OPM lab offers courses such as Human-Centered Design  Fundamentals, Prototyping in the Public Sector, and Communicating  Visually, among other topics. These classes are available to OPM staff  and other federal workers. Staff also made the lab available for federal  communities of practice to convene. According to lab staff, the lab is  becoming a hub for a number of standing meetings of a growing  community of federal innovators and innovation communities of practice.", "Table 3 presents a summary of OPM\u2019s human-centered design lab  activities since its inception.", "Lab staff report that in the future they intend to expand from their session- based work and targeted design support projects, such as those  consultative sessions that took place in the lab during Phase III. While  some of these more episodic projects may continue to occur, the lab\u2019s  focus will be on creating and establishing large-scale projects typically  involving stakeholders from either wholly within OPM or across different  agencies that are working on crosscutting issues. As discussed later in  the report, projects appropriate for this design method would have diverse  users, be more complex, and be called immersion projects.

Many of  the lab representatives said building or establishing a distinct space  carries an important symbolic value as it signals an organization-level  commitment to a culture that supports innovation. However, simply  building a lab is not sufficient to change an organization\u2019s culture; it is  necessary to also introduce a new framework for problem solving.  Although these organizations use different terminology to describe their  selected frameworks, such as agile development and human-centered  design, the general principles are similar. They include placing users at  the center of the desired solution\u2014research on successful innovation  practices shows the importance of engaging customers and  understanding their needs. Further, they include extensive collaboration  with relevant stakeholders, experimentation, prototyping, and iterative  steps to find a solution. A primary objective of this approach is to allow for  failure in the beginning of the design cycle, so that organizations can  manage and learn from early mistakes, rather than try to recover from an  expensive, comprehensive failure upon implementation.", "For example, Census and HUD have similar problem-solving frameworks  for lab use. As figure 3 shows, the Census Center for Applied Technology  and the HUD Innovation Lab rely on a five-step framework to guide  innovation in their labs.", "As another example, although CFPB does not have a dedicated physical  space, it used a similar framework to develop its on-line mortgage  disclosure form. According to CFPB\u2019s Creative Director for Technology  and Innovation, designers interacted with end-users including mortgage  applicants, prototyped different forms, and made refinements based on  continual feedback before launching the new form.

This problem-solving framework is similar to those  employed by other innovation labs.", "As discussed earlier in this report, similar to other organizations with labs,  OPM is using its lab for a variety of purposes including as a learning  space for classes on human-centered design principles and techniques  and as a meeting space for interagency task teams and communities of  practice. As originally envisioned in its strategic and performance plans,  the lab was designed to host a mix of activities rooted in the human- centered design approach, including longer-term design challenges.  Moreover, OPM lab staff asserted that to gain an organization\u2019s  confidence and to instill a culture of innovation, it is necessary for a  successful innovation lab to have an array of sufficiently compelling  projects that demonstrate how the lab approach can lead to performance  improvements.", "Based on our interviews with public and private sector organizations with  similar innovation facilities, larger-scale problem-solving projects were  common activities in their innovation labs\u2019 service portfolios. As an  example, Denmark\u2019s MindLab has contributed to tackling several pressing  social issues including simplifying the process for managing claims  related to industrial accidents and shortening the time before injured  workers return to the market. Opportunities to showcase a new approach  to problem solving reduce the likelihood that the lab might lose its  distinction as different from a traditional meeting space or classroom  usually associated with training facilities.", "Consistent with what staff from other labs told us, OPM officials said they  needed the past two years to first introduce agency staff to human- centered design concepts and applications before they could initiate an  immersion project. Lab staff said this phased approach was necessary for  several reasons. Targeted design support sessions allowed lab staff to  expose lab users to design methods and provided opportunities for  collaboration. These sessions also allowed lab staff to quickly show value  for program offices in response to a specific need. For example, OPM lab  staff members were able to help FDA staff plan and engage with over 200  different stakeholders at a conference. They also said targeted design  support is a critical way for emerging design practitioners to develop and  hone their own skills before applying them to a longer term, and higher  stakes, project engagement. Lab staff said overall these sessions  benefited both the users of the lab, who developed new skills to take to  their home offices, such as problem framing and engaging with  stakeholders, as well as lab employees, who continue to grow and refine  their human-centered design skills. In a December 2013 document, OPM  staff stated they intend to create and establish these longer-term  immersion projects and evaluate their impact during the next phase of the  lab\u2019s development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Has Not Fully Developed Meaningful Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["Measuring the long-term outcomes of innovation labs is a prevalent  practice for building acceptance and demonstrating the value of the labs.  Consistent with our literature review, several representatives we  interviewed from other innovation labs concurred with the director of  innovation at Denmark\u2019s innovation lab, MindLab, who said that  innovation labs need to know how much they are spending and their  outcomes. According to the director, the labs must also be able to  attribute where the change happens based on their work. In addition, lab  staff must be prepared to present a narrative of their work. He  acknowledged that innovation labs are risky because they look different,  and they have a different focus than other government entities. The  director said that, as a result, innovation lab officials need to show where  the funds are going along with the benefits and results of those  investments.", "Representatives from newer labs\u2014i.e. those operating less than three  years\u2014stated they primarily rely on output measures to gauge their initial  efforts such as number of users, ways in which the lab is being used,  classes or events held in the lab, and anecdotal evidence. Developing  outcome measures is more challenging for several reasons. Appropriate  outcome measures are often not obvious at the onset of a project.  Moreover, agencies may not have appropriate measures or baseline data  when they start using an innovation lab as a problem-solving tool, and the  role of the lab in driving a successful innovation may not always be clear.", "Given these challenges to accurately measuring innovation and the value  of an innovation lab, lab managers from labs that have been operating for  a longer period of time told us they focus on developing meaningful  milestones and measures applicable to different phases of the innovation  lifecycle, such as problem generation, idea generation, and skills  development. For example, the UNICEF Innovation Unit\u2014which has been  helping member-country offices set up innovation labs since 2006\u2014and  several European initiatives developed a set of benchmarks intended to  help them measure the value of public sector labs and identify ways in  which the lab\u2019s performance can be improved. The benchmarks  UNICEF developed span across six categories, such as problem  definition and idea generation, internal and external collaboration, and  secondary effects. Within each category, they include a list of questions  intended to assess their strengths and weaknesses. For example, they  want to know whether labs are helping employees define problems and  generate ideas, strengthen internal collaborations, and build external  partnerships. They also measure the extent to which work done in the  labs results in new team or staff capacity, excitement and goodwill toward  the organization, and an increase in leverage and influence in their field.  OPM is undertaking a similar effort to establish benchmarks that will help  lab staff gauge the extent to which lab users are learning and applying  many of these same skills, but the lab is not mature enough to have  results.", "OPM documents state that the goal of OPM\u2019s innovation lab is to provide  federal workers with 21st century skills in design-led innovation, and the  intended purpose of the lab is to provide a physical space for project- based problem solving. The documents also note that the value of the lab  can be measured, in part, by how well it helps develop the mission-critical  competencies to improve the federal workforce\u2019s ability to solve problems  and deliver results.", "In its strategy document, OPM laid out the following high-level goals for  the innovation lab:", "Employees assigned to the innovation lab should go back to their  home organization with an understanding of, and an appreciation for,  the power of innovative approaches to problem solving.", "Employees should be equipped to implement similar methodologies in  their home organizations on future projects.", "As the innovation lab matures, and as more and more projects are  completed, the notion of using innovation to tackle complex problems  will gain traction across the organization.", "Eventually, leaders and employees across OPM will vie to get their  issues sent to the innovation lab for resolution.", "This in turn will contribute to a decrease in organizational silos, and a  concurrent increase in cross-organizational teams addressing one  organization\u2019s issues.", "In the same document, OPM officials also described an evaluation  strategy resembling an agile approach. Specifically, OPM described  these goals as moving targets which would be achieved through an  evolving and self-correcting process. Lab staff immediately started to  track lab activities and outputs, such as number of participating people  and agencies, and how participants used the lab, such as consultative  sessions, follow-on coaching, training classes, or as a meeting space.  Five months after the lab opened, they also started to survey users who  participated in day-long facilitated sessions. For example, there was a  one-page evaluation that asked respondents to rate the appropriateness  of the environment and quality of the facilitators. The surveys also asked  whether users would recommend the lab to colleagues and whether  human-centered design problem-solving tools can be used as an effective  tool government-wide. The responses were generally positive\u2014about 82  percent of respondents (84 out of 103) said they would recommend the  lab to someone else, providing a baseline for subsequent survey findings.  According to lab staff, they periodically reviewed the available data and  adjusted their strategy for operating the lab.", "Starting in March 2013, a year after the lab opened, OPM lab staff began  work on a program evaluation framework to more systematically measure  the lab\u2019s progress toward meeting their overarching goals. To evaluate  the extent to which lab participants are learning and applying innovative  approaches, lab staff intends to measure the lab\u2019s performance along  three overarching categories: service experience, skill development, and  project outcome. According to the framework, resources dedicated to  evaluation efforts will reflect the resources needed to host lab-sponsored  events. Episodic events such as consulting sessions will correspond to a  \u201clight-touch\u201d follow-up effort, such as immediately surveying all  participants on their session experience and skills development. More  long-term, resource-intensive efforts such as immersion projects will  employ a more robust follow-up effort that, in addition to assessing the  session experience and skills development, will also address project- specific outcomes. Collection of assessment data in all three areas will  include the administration of surveys to participants both before and right  after a session, and some services will involve the administration of  surveys to participants before a service and subsequent periodic check- ins. Depending on the nature of the lab session, information on skill  development and outcomes will also be obtained from session clients in  pre-session scoping conversations and periodic, post-session check-ins  using either surveys, or interviews. For one type of session, assessment  of participant skill development will also include a survey of participant  supervisors.", "Lab staff has used a series of surveys to measure participant experience  and skills development, and to capture specific project-related outcomes  for the different services they offer. However, the survey instruments are  unlikely to yield data that would be of sufficient capacity, credibility, and  relevance to indicate the nature and extent to which the lab is achieving  what it intends to accomplish or its value to those who use the lab space.  Although there are several items across all surveys that are reasonably  aligned with generally accepted questionnaire and item design principles,  there are limitations associated with many items where language is  ambiguous, where the intent of the question is not clear, and directions  are lacking. For example, phrases such as \u201cchanged behavior\u201d or  \u201ctangible outputs you can move forward\u201d are open to numerous  interpretations and are likely to engender an array of responses that  range from being relevant to not at all relevant or relatable to the  purposes or objectives of the session. In addition, some of the items may  be more likely to engender responses with a greater likelihood of being  subject to a respondent\u2019s social desirability bias. For example, the  respondent may want to provide answers that are socially desirable,  maintain the status quo, or make a good impression.", "While some customization is to be expected, the surveys did not indicate  any approach to evaluate some core aspects of the lab and its value  using a consistently presented set of the same questions. For example,  the question asking participants about the likelihood that they would  recommend the lab to someone else is the type of item that could, with  revision, be incorporated in all of the surveys. Analyses of a core set of  items by type of lab event or service would enable lab staff to discern and  compare where participants were more and less engaged in lab activities  and curricula. Consequently, these survey instruments and the items on  them may be susceptible to various types of question and respondent  bias and could, when the responses are analyzed, produce results that  would be difficult to interpret or link to expected participant effects, or to  the intent or activities of the workshop session. Moreover, lab staff has  not developed outcome measures or milestones related to customer  experience and skills development.", "The evaluation framework being developed by OPM does not include  interim performance targets or measures. Best practices state that new  initiatives benefit when managers set time-bounded, quantifiable interim  goals, establish related performance measures, collect data, and use that  information to assess and adjust their performance. To evaluate the  overall performance of MindLab, the director said he develops an annual  work plan, which describes the number and types of projects and other  activities the lab will undertake, as well as the relative resource allocation  to those projects and activities. He said his staff also conducts an annual  review of the budget and actual expenditures with the board. OPM lab  staff has been tracking outputs\u2014such as number of participants and  number and type of activities\u2014meaning that they have baseline data  which could inform realistic, meaningful targets and measures related to  lab use and activities for the upcoming year. Although they continue to  refine their surveys, they could use the results from earlier versions to  establish targets and measures related to customer experience and skills  development. Meaningful measures or milestones could help them  assess their progress toward improving participants\u2019 ability to solve  problems and accurately measure the effect of working in the lab on  services, products, and processes.", "As mentioned previously, the lab plans to host the more resource- intensive immersion projects. To demonstrate that the lab is operating as  originally intended, evaluation plans will be needed for specific immersion  projects that can help track cost-benefits and performance improvement  outcomes. OPM stated that evaluation plans will be prepared for each  immersion project to account for project outcomes. They indicated that  they wanted to host their first immersion project within the next several  months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Has Started Efforts to Connect with the Federal Innovation Community, but Has Not Fully Leveraged Other Agencies\u2019 Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Another prevalent practice we identified included leveraging other  innovation labs\u2019 efforts to try to increase the value of the lab approach.  Studies show that information sharing and interorganizational networks  can be a powerful driver supporting innovation. One study showed that  interorganizational networks of innovators help members develop new  products at a faster rate with lower investment commitments, due in large  part to the information sharing that takes place. Sharing information can  help mitigate the risks and uncertainty that typically characterize  innovation ventures. Best practices state the importance of establishing  channels of communication and other mechanisms that facilitate  knowledge-sharing and building networks of like-minded communities to  help agencies achieve crosscutting objectives. For example, the Census  Bureau\u2019s Chief Technology Officer suggested a way in which innovation  leaders could share information and pool resources. Specifically, instead  of each agency creating its own technology innovation lab with its own  hardware, software, and associated maintenance, they could use a  common innovation infrastructure service in the public cloud. Every  agency could still have their own branded offering and could still provide  access in their own facility or at their regional offices. However, an  outside vendor could provide the infrastructure. For example, if an agency  wanted to experiment with some unique visual analytic tools, they could  purchase what they need on a subscription service; this would eliminate  agencies buying all the tools themselves.", "While labs provide a physical space where innovators can convene,  federal agencies are not fully aware of their growing community. As of  June 2013, OPM was unaware that other agencies such as Census,  HUD, and NASA were pursuing a lab approach to promote innovation.  Moreover, the lab directors at these agencies were not aware or only  marginally aware of OPM\u2019s lab and its resources or other federal  innovation labs. OPM\u2019s efforts to develop an innovation lab occurred  around the same time or pre-dated those of other agencies we  interviewed.", "According to OPM officials, during its first year of operations, OPM lab  staff focused their efforts on promoting awareness of the lab and its  resources internally to OPM staff. In their second year, OPM lab staff  planned more activities intended to promote the lab and its resources  externally to connect with federal agencies\u2019 innovation efforts. Staff noted  the OPM lab is the hub of various interagency networks of innovation  practitioners. For example, an interagency community of practice on idea  generation meets in the lab on a monthly basis. OPM\u2019s lab staff also  reported that they host weekly trainings in the lab on best practices,  including webinars about measuring the success of enterprise-level  design efforts and the value of visualizing information. These training  sessions include case study presentations from other federal agencies,  such as GSA, and non-federal entities. In addition, OPM has shared best  practices with other public sector design labs across the globe by  participating in a number of conferences. OPM is also collaborating with a  current Presidential Innovation Fellow, who is building an innovation  toolkit. Although projects in the lab are currently managed and for the  most part delivered by OPM employees, staff noted that they are  increasingly looking to leverage detailees, short-term assignments, and  other ways to harness the potential of talent from other agencies. OPM  staff said they also give regular tours of their innovation lab for other  government entities already supporting innovation initiatives or  developing them. In addition to these activities, OPM hosted a convening  of federal innovators to compare various agencies\u2019 innovation  communication efforts across the agencies.", "Several federal officials we interviewed said they would welcome the  opportunity to communicate as the need arose with a community of peers  to exchange information and ideas and trouble-shoot problems related to  the start-up and maintenance of their labs. For example, CFPB\u2019s Creative  Director for Technology and Innovation said it would be helpful to find out  what other bureaus and departments are doing to incorporate design  principles, so that she could exchange ideas and information. An official  from NASA\u2019s Swamp Works noted that it would be beneficial to show that  others in the federal sector are also looking at innovation labs. To that  end, simply knowing the innovation community exists and how agency  staff leading innovation efforts can initiate a conversation related to a  specific topic would likely be beneficial and would help avoid the risk of a  fragmented innovation community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM\u2019s 2014 through 2018 Strategic Plan Indicates It Intends to Use the Lab to Advance OPM Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Because innovation necessarily entails culture change, experimentation,  periodic setbacks, and often resource investments, another prevalent  practice necessary to sustain a lab includes leadership support.

For example, the Census Bureau\u2019s Chief  Technology Officer noted that support by Census Bureau leadership is  critical to ensure staff participation and the continued availability of funds  to drive innovation in its Center for Applied Technology lab. Other lab  directors highlighted several strategies they use to balance the risks and  failures that accompany a problem-solving methodology rooted in a more  experimental approach. These include accelerated timelines of three to  six months, which allows organizations to quickly shelve projects that are  without merit. Some lab leaders also noted that a quick win or early  success can give new labs the underlying support they need to take on  riskier projects.", "In March 2014, OPM released its 2014 through 2018 strategic plan, which  states that the agency plans to seek new, innovative ways to accomplish  its work of advancing human resource management in the federal  government.
