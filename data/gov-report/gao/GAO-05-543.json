To fulfill their missions, these agencies deploy a variety of valuable air and marine assets. In this report, GAO analyzed (1) what efforts DHS has undertaken to facilitate coordination of the air and marine assets of the three agencies and (2) how the agencies' local air and marine units have, in selected areas, coordinated the use of assets and what challenges they faced."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS established departmental councils that have identified opportunities to achieve cost savings or cost efficiencies involving the department's air and marine assets--airplanes, helicopters, and boats. Specifically, the aviation council issued a plan that provides a framework for increasing coordination and collaboration across agencies in the operation and support of aviation assets and resources. For example, the plan identifies opportunities to improve the tracking of aviation assets, develop standardized training programs across agencies, and consolidate maintenance programs and facilities. An additional plan outlines a broad-based approach for effectively employing the department's aviation assets. The boats council helped CBP take advantage of large-volume discounts to purchase six boats through an existing USCG contract, saving an estimated $300,000. DHS officials said they are also developing a plan for merging the assets and personnel of the Air and Marine Operations division of ICE with CBP. This effort is intended to enable DHS to maximize the use of its aircraft and pilots and gain potential efficiencies in maintenance, acquisition, and training. DHS expects to finish planning how this effort will be accomplished by September 30, 2005. The agencies at the four locations GAO visited had undertaken efforts to coordinate assets and related training on an ad hoc basis because of the willingness of local commanders to cooperate with each other. For example, in South Florida, the three agencies jointly developed weekly air and marine schedules for the aircraft and boats they deploy to increase coverage in the area and reduce duplication of patrols. In Bellingham, Washington, USCG provided training to CBP staff, enabling CBP boat operators to supplement USCG crew. Officials at all locations noted that challenges affect the extent to which such coordination can reasonably occur. For example, some assets are not shared because agencies' needs differ. Headquarter officials also cited potential legal issues that could limit efforts to coordinate the use of assets among agencies, such as prohibition of the diversion of USCG assets to any other organization or entity of DHS. Local unit officials stated that DHS needed to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the agencies in conducting their homeland security missions to ensure that DHS's air and marine assets are used in an efficient and coordinated manner that optimizes use of DHS's resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) was created by Congress to strengthen the  federal government\u2019s efforts to protect the United States from future  attacks.

We designated DHS\u2019s  transformation as a high-risk area in 2003, based on the enormous  challenges of transforming 22 agencies into one department and the  serious consequences of failing to effectively address its management  challenges and program risks could have for our national security. DHS  continues to face daunting challenges as officials undertake to integrate  and transform these separate federal agencies. One key challenge is  ensuring that the agencies responsible for securing the nation\u2019s air, land,  and sea borders\u2014the nation\u2019s first line of defense against terrorism\u2014can  successfully carry out their border security missions on a daily basis.

To fulfill their missions, these agencies deployed an array of  valuable assets.  At the time of our review, this included approximately   500 aircraft and 1,900 boats. On July 13, 2005, the Secretary of DHS  announced a reorganization that would combine the air assets from CBP\u2019s  two aviation programs\u2014one within Air and Marine Operations (AMO) and  the other within the Office of Border Patrol (OBP)\u2014into one called CBP  Air.  This action followed the October 2004 announcement that ICE\u2019s air  and marine assets were being moved to CBP.

Within CBP, the United  States Border Patrol is the agency responsible for the enforcement of  federal immigration laws between ports. In addition to the priority  homeland security mission of CBP, Border Patrol has its traditional  mission of preventing illegal aliens, smugglers, narcotics, and other  contraband from entering the United States. Border Patrol agents perform  their duties by land, sea, and air near and along over 8,000 miles of U.S.  boundaries. Also within BTS, ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration  and customs laws within the United States, and its mission is to detect and  prevent terrorist and criminal acts by targeting the people, money, and  materials that support terrorists and criminal networks. Within ICE,  AMO\u2019s mission is to protect the American people and critical  infrastructure by using an integrated and coordinated air and marine force  to deter, interdict, and prevent acts of terrorism arising from threats of  unlawful movement of people and goods across U.S. borders.

Two such councils\u2014the Aviation Management Council and  Boats Commodity Council\u2014are staffed by subject matter experts from all  agencies with aviation and boat programs.", "The Aviation Management Council was tasked with reviewing and  analyzing a February 2004 contractor report that provided an assessment  of the aviation operations and support programs of the USCG, CBP, and  ICE, and with determining the feasibility of implementing the report\u2019s  recommendations. Specifically, the contractor study examined DHS\u2019s  aviation capabilities in relation to the collective assets of these three  agencies and identified overlaps in aviation capability, assets, training,  maintenance and logistics, facilities, and acquisition that could be  minimized to achieve efficiencies and reduce operating expenses. To  address one of the contractor study\u2019s recommendations, the council issued  a broad-based departmentwide \u201cconcept of operations\u201d plan to DHS senior  management in April 2005 that establishes a framework for how the  agencies can work collaboratively in a joint environment to accomplish  mission priorities. The concept of operations plan provides a broad,  generalized description of the missions each agency typically conducts on  a regular basis. The plan assigns each agency primary, secondary, or  tertiary responsibility levels for missions based on the capabilities of the  agencies, but notes that each agency remains responsible for the day-to- day operations of its aviation assets. In cases where more than one of the  agencies have the appropriate skills and regularly perform the same  mission, the plan calls for the operational lead to be based on the  geographic location and local availability of resources. However, the plan  does not indicate who will make decisions on the lead agency in cases  where two units perform the same mission or specify how operations are  to be coordinated.", "The Aviation Commodity Council, another departmental council with the  same membership as the Aviation Management Council, examined other  recommendations in the contractor study for achieving efficiencies and  economies, such as colocating agency facilities in proximity, including air  hangars and maintenance facilities, and consolidating common training for  agencies under single contracts where feasible. For example, one  contractor study recommendation called for the development of a  common information technology system for use in managing aviation  assets. The contractor study concluded that bringing the aviation  programs of all three agencies under one information system would  improve DHS\u2019s ability to make accurate comparisons of the costs of  maintenance for the department as well as decisions on how to integrate  its aviation maintenance operations. According to the contractor study,  each agency currently uses a different method for recording and  calculating asset use and costs, including parts and maintenance. In  addressing this recommendation, the Aviation Management Council  initiated a pilot project in 2004 to examine the feasibility of using the Coast  Guard\u2019s Aviation Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) to  maintain data on all of DHS\u2019s aviation assets. The pilot project, scheduled  to be completed in September 2005, is examining options for incorporating  the separate aviation data of the CBP and ICE aviation fleets into one  system with the Coast Guard.", "The Boats Commodity Council has identified areas for collaborating on  marine asset procurements, conducting joint training programs, and  consolidating some maintenance programs to achieve savings among the  agencies. For example, rather than initiating a separate procurement, CBP  acquired six boats through an existing Coast Guard contract and saved  $300,000 by taking advantage of USCG\u2019s large-volume discounts. The  Coast Guard has also entered into an agreement with ICE for outboard  engine maintenance through ICE\u2019s maintenance program at its National  Marine Service Center. The council also proposed a study to determine if  the different boat training schools used by the agencies can be  consolidated to achieve additional cost efficiencies. Council officials  indicated that where possible, officials are looking to use the same types  of patrol boats and equipment for additional savings, efficient use, and  reduced labor costs. The boats council\u2019s plan identifies issues to study for  future cost savings in acquisition, training, and maintenance. In most  cases, these actions are to be carried out using working groups to develop  the specific details on how DHS can achieve efficiencies and savings for  each of the selected opportunities.

In addition, DHS has not done a baseline study on boats such as the  contractor study done for aviation assets. According to DHS, a newly  chartered Logistics Functional Committee has been tasked with  developing a concept of operations plan for the DHS boat community and  is recommending that DHS agencies with boat programs request funding in  their fiscal year 2007 budgets to conduct a baseline study similar to that  conducted on aviation assets.

Local unit officials told us that they had received no guidance or  requirements from DHS to coordinate the use of or share assets. They  attributed the ability to work together to the leadership and personalities  of those in charge of the units. In December 2002, prior to the formation of  DHS, they established the Partners\u2019 Forum to discuss and make decisions  on options for coordination and collaboration that affect the entire region.  Local unit officials told us that prior to the forum, coordination was  limited. Miami CBP officials noted that a major benefit of this coordination  is being able to learn from one another and to understand the methods  used by the various agencies in performing their missions.

First, local unit officials from each of the three agencies told us  that their respective roles and responsibilities were not clear and at times  overlapped. Local unit officials stated that as their homeland security  missions evolve, in some instances it was not clear which agency should  take the lead on certain actions. Such clarification, local officials said,  would help determine how to prioritize and optimize staff resources and  air and marine asset utilization to ensure readiness for both homeland  security and legacy missions. Headquarters officials agreed that local  officials might benefit from clarification of their roles and responsibilities  for homeland security missions and that there was some overlap. In some  cases, they are flying the same aircraft and in other cases they are using  aircraft with similar operational capabilities, since each agency uses assets  for patrol, surveillance, and interdiction.", "Another challenge to asset coordination is that agencies must meet  readiness requirements that limit the use of assets that are on standby in  the event they are needed. For example, a USCG official stated that Coast  Guard units have many unscheduled operations and must maintain certain  resource levels that allow them to meet readiness standards for carrying  out missions, such as search and rescue, and thus a station must maintain  a certain number of assets at all times. Thus, units cannot afford to use the  assets for coordinated missions without hindering their ability to respond  to emergencies. CBP officials told us that they need to have assets on  standby to respond to certain situations, such as to assist foot patrol  agents in preventing illegal aliens from crossing the border. ICE officials  told us that some of their air and marine resources are committed to  operations with other law enforcement organizations that limit their  availability for use in coordination with other border security agencies.  Additionally, local officials told us that they had been called upon to  provide air and marine assets and personnel for national, coordinated  operations conducted by DHS, including one on the northern border and  another in the South Florida area. While ability to move local assets to  support national missions is important, it does affect local operations by  limiting asset availability for local coordinated operations.", "Local officials also cited differences in asset capabilities as limiting  opportunities for asset coordination. Specifically, differences in the  capabilities and configurations of the air and marine assets used by the  three agencies to achieve both homeland security and legacy missions may  make it difficult to interchange assets. For example, ICE has faster fixed  wing aircraft and Blackhawk helicopters to be able to chase suspects over  long distances, while the border patrol uses smaller, slower helicopters to  track illegal immigrants. These helicopters are not suitable for maritime  missions but need to be able to withstand tremendous heat, as often  encountered in the southern border regions. Agency officials in the  locations we visited also said that in some cases technical problems arose  that made it difficult for individuals among the different local units to  communicate using secure radio channels.", "Differences in training and staff expertise present other challenges or  limitations to asset coordination. For example, while all agencies\u2019 pilots  and marine boat and vessel operators receive basic training at the Federal  Law Enforcement Training Center, each agency also provides specific  training for its staff based on legacy missions and needs. Because of  different operational requirements needed to accomplish missions, staff  receive training on operating procedures that best suit the  accomplishment of their respective missions. In addition, agency officials  told us that training needs differ because there is a range of skill levels  among the pilots and marine operators in each agency because of the  different types of assets used. Also, the various air programs have different  entry requirements. Another factor that affects asset coordination is that  pilots and marine operators can be certified only on a specific number of  aviation or marine assets at a given time, primarily for safety reasons. This  limits their ability to operate various types of equipment. Agency officials  said that only a certain amount of training coordination is necessary and  that staff need to continue to specialize and keep certifications current.", "Headquarters officials cited potential legal issues that could limit efforts to  coordinate the use of assets among agencies. The Homeland Security Act  of 2002, which established DHS, prohibited the diversion of USCG assets  to any other organization or entity of DHS, except for details or  assignments that do not reduce the USCG\u2019s capability to perform its  missions. USCG officials cite this provision as a potential legal barrier to  efforts to coordinate assets. In addition, under federal law, an agency may  transfer excess property within the agency when it is no longer needed for  the purposes of the appropriation used to purchase it, but generally not if  the property continues to meet the transferring unit\u2019s need. Without  specific authority, such as that provided for excess property, the transfer  could result in an unauthorized augmentation of the receiving unit\u2019s  appropriation account. These issues would not apply, however, to the  transfer of the Air and Marine Operations program from ICE to CBP  because the assets remain with the appropriation account from which they  were purchased. Fiscal year 2005 appropriations language also generally  prohibits CBP from transferring aircraft or related equipment to agencies  outside DHS without the prior approval of the House and Senate  Appropriations Committees but does not prohibit sharing within DHS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security plays a critical role in  strengthening efforts by the United States to combat terrorist threats, in  part by coordinating a vast array of resources that protect our borders.  One of the ongoing challenges facing the department is balancing the need  for a department-level coordinated, integrated approach to implementing  border security while supporting the efforts of agencies with border  security responsibilities, including the United States Coast Guard,  Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, as they fulfill their missions in the field. Part of this  challenge involves determining how agency air and marine assets can best  be coordinated locally to optimize their effectiveness while avoiding  duplication of efforts and resources. The department has begun to address  this challenge by identifying opportunities for the border security agencies  to improve the efficient use of their air and marine assets--airplanes,  helicopters, and boats--and proposing broad plans and time frames for  further analysis and development of implementation plans.", "In order to maximize operational and cost efficiencies in the use of assets  for border security, it is important to clarify how field units should work  together and under what circumstances. This clarification will help ensure  that the mix of services at the nation\u2019s borders and the enforcement of  border security are carried out in an efficient and integrated fashion, as  stated in DHS\u2019s 2004 strategic plan. Additional steps could be taken to help  ensure that agencies coordinate their assets to the extent practicable and  permitted by law without compromising or conflicting with their primary  security missions. Local units of CBP, ICE, and USCG appear to have  developed ad hoc asset coordination procedures driven by local  circumstances and situations. These efforts have occurred without clear  delineation of roles and responsibilities at the headquarters and field unit  levels on coordinating efforts, and without guidance from DHS concerning  how and when this coordination should occur. To further facilitate the  coordination of air and marine assets among DHS agencies, an  examination of whether the Homeland Security Act of 2002 poses a  potential legal obstacle to such efforts should clarify the extent to which  the USCG can coordinate assets with CBP and other agencies.  Such a  determination may be important, particularly given the fact that USCG  employs the majority of DHS\u2019s marine assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to help ensure that the use of available air and marine assets is  effectively coordinated to meet border security needs, we are  recommending that the Secretary of Homeland Security take the following  two actions:  1.  Provide guidance that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of USCG  and CBP, the primary DHS agencies that employ air and marine assets,  in their homeland security missions, as well as how asset use should  be coordinated.  2.  Determine whether the Homeland Security Act\u2019s prohibition on  diversion of USCG assets, or any similar restriction in appropriations  laws, limits the ability of USCG to coordinate assets with other  agencies, and if so, evaluate the merits, including the costs and  benefits of proposing a change in relevant laws to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.

DHS generally concurred with the  report\u2019s recommendations.", "In its comments, DHS stated that the Secretary recently proposed changes  to the organization with a focus on ensuring that all elements of the  department are effectively organized and mission-focused, and that  operations are integrated and coordinated in a manner that will allow the  department to best address any threats with appropriate actions and  policies. Specifically, DHS stated that the move of AMO from ICE to CBP  last fall, and the recent reorganization of the CBP aviation program, which  consolidates the two separate air programs within CBP, will enable the  CBP air program to more effectively carry out border and homeland  security missions. DHS stated that the implementation of the new CBP  aviation program began July 14, 2005, and is expected to be phased in  through October 1, 2005. DHS believes these initiatives, along with other  changes to be proposed as a result of the Secretary\u2019s comprehensive  review, should address the recommendations contained in this report. As  part of these initiatives, DHS needs to ensure that guidance provided by  the department will address the coordination of air and marine assets  within CBP, as well as ensure that the role and use of USCG air and  marine assets in homeland security missions is coordinated with CBP.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  date of this letter.
