Our 1994 report identified a number of risks, both to individual firms and to the financial system as a whole, associated with those products. We initiated this follow-up review to determine what progress has been made by financial regulators and industry participants to address the areas of concern we identified in 1994 and to determine what still needs to be done.

Despite the losses, derivatives use has continued to grow rapidly, reaching about $55.7 trillion outstanding worldwide by 1995. Although they can be complex, derivatives provide effective ways to manage financial risks, generate profits, and lower financing costs, and the vast majority of the firms using derivatives did so without reporting major unanticipated losses.", "The losses attributed to derivatives in 1994 and 1995 focused regulators\u2019 and market participants\u2019 attention on the importance of sound derivatives risk-management and internal control systems. Some of the losses showed that understanding the risks in how profits are generated can be as important as determining why losses occurred. As pointed out in our May 1994 report, the risks that derivatives pose are not new or unique, but certain derivatives can be more complex and volatile than other financial instruments. The associated risks can be difficult to identify, measure, monitor, and manage. For example, they may contain potential leverage, or leverage multipliers, that can greatly increase an investor\u2019s gains or losses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Derivatives are globally used financial products that essentially unbundle and transfer risks from entities less able or willing to manage them to those more willing or able to do so. The general types of risk associated with derivatives\u2014credit, market, legal, and operations\u2014exist for many financial activities. The values of derivatives are based on, or derived from, the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index\u2014called the underlying. Common types of underlying assets are stocks, bonds, and physical commodities, such as wheat, oil, and lumber. An example of an underlying reference rate is the interest rate on the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill. An example of an underlying index is the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, which measures the performance of 500 common stocks.", "Derivatives include customized and standardized contracts. Some derivatives are customized contracts between parties (also called counterparties) that include one or more negotiated terms in addition to price. Negotiated terms can include the quality and quantity of the underlying, time and place of delivery, and method of payment. Other derivatives are standardized contracts whose terms are fixed\u2014except for price, which the market determines. Derivatives can be privately negotiated by the parties; these are called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Derivatives also can be traded through central locations, called organized exchanges, where buyers and sellers or their representatives meet to determine derivatives prices; these are called exchange-traded derivatives.", "Derivative products include forwards, futures, options, and swaps. Forwards, futures, and options are typically used to hedge or to speculate. Swaps are typically used to hedge or to obtain more desirable financing. All derivative products can be combined to create more complex derivatives, called hybrid derivatives. Forwards and futures are contracts that obligate the holder to buy or sell a specific underlying at a specified price, quantity, and date in the future. Forwards are commercial, private contracts for the delivery of a commodity where delivery is deferred for convenience. Futures are usually standardized contracts traded on organized exchanges. Option contracts, which can be either customized and privately negotiated or standardized, give the purchaser the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a specified quantity of a commodity or financial asset at a particular price (the exercise price) on or before a certain future date. Swaps are generally OTC agreements between counterparties to make periodic payments to each other for a stated time. Some swaps are now exchange traded.", "Derivatives market participants include end-users and dealers. End-users include banks, securities firms, insurance companies, governments, mutual and pension funds, and commercial entities worldwide. Certain institutions that use derivatives also act as dealers by quoting prices to, buying derivatives from, and selling derivatives to end-users and other dealers. They also develop customized derivative products for their clients.", "Market participants can use derivatives to protect against adverse changes in the values of assets or liabilities, called hedging. Hedgers try to protect themselves from market risk, which is the exposure to financial loss caused by adverse changes in the values of assets or liabilities. They protect themselves by entering into derivatives transactions whose values are expected to change in the opposite direction as the values of their assets or liabilities. For example, a hedger can protect asset values through derivatives transactions that increase in value as the asset values decline. The increases in value of the derivatives contracts (profits) will offset, or hedge, the decrease in values of the assets (losses).", "In contrast, market participants can also use derivatives to take on risk in an attempt to profit from changes in the values of derivatives or their underlyings, called speculating. Rather than purchasing the underlying, speculators can use derivatives to attempt to profit by anticipating movements in market rates and prices. As speculators enter into transactions with hedgers and other speculators, they provide liquidity to the derivatives markets, thereby helping to ensure that high volumes of trading can occur without significantly affecting prices.", "Derivatives can be more cost-effective for market participants than transactions in the underlying cash markets because of the reduced transaction costs and the leverage that derivatives provide. For example, instead of buying or selling $100,000 worth of U.S. Treasury bonds, a market participant can realize the benefits of buying or selling the same amount of bonds by using a derivatives contract and posting a deposit, called a margin, of only about $1,500, or 1.5 percent of the face amount of the bonds. Likewise, a market participant can achieve a result similar to buying or selling all of the stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index by buying or selling a derivatives contract on this index for as little as 5 to 10 percent of the cost of the underlying stocks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structured Notes and Mortgage-Backed Securities", "paragraphs": ["Some of the losses attributed to derivatives have involved either structured notes or a specific type of mortgage-backed security called a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO). These financial products have characteristics and risks similar to derivatives. We include them in our discussion of losses but focus on the four traditional types of derivatives\u2014forwards, futures, options, and swaps\u2014when we discuss derivatives and derivatives oversight throughout the report, unless otherwise indicated.", "Structured notes are debt securities. Their cash flows, which resemble those of derivatives, depend on one or more indexes, and they may have added features such as embedded options. Structured notes are treated similarly to derivatives by banking regulators. Indexes that typically are used to determine the cash flows associated with structured notes include the Federal Funds Rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the Cost of Funds Index. Some common types of structured notes are range bonds that pay investors on the basis of whether a reference rate is between levels of a specific index established at issue, index amortizing notes that pay investors on the basis of a predetermined amortization schedule linked to the level of a specific index, inverse floaters that have coupon rates that increase as interest rates decline and decrease as rates rise, and dual index notes that have coupon rates determined by the difference between two market indexes.", "In addition, some analysts consider step-up bonds to be structured notes. The investor in these bonds is paid at an above-market yield for Treasury securities for a short noncall period, and then, if not called, the coupon rate steps up to a higher rate.", "Investors in structured notes that are issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) perceive little, if any, credit risk because of investors\u2019 perception of implied U.S. government backing. The investor, however, is exposed to market risks.", "Mortgage-backed securities are financial products whose payments are derived from a pool of home mortgages. CMOs are one of the most common types of multiclass mortgage-backed securities. By repackaging the mortgage payments, issuers of multiclass mortgage-backed securities can create securities that are customized regarding yield, risk, and maturities. For example, payments to investors can be separated into principal-only and interest-only securities that can be sold separately. The values of these securities are sensitive to mortgage prepayment rates driven largely by changing interest rates. That is, if interest rates decline, mortgagors are more likely to prepay their mortgages. These prepayments accelerate the payment of principal-only securities and reduce payments of interest-only securities. Some classes of CMOs and interest-only and principal-only securities are more risky than other classes, because their payments can be especially sensitive to prepayment rates.", "Multiclass mortgage-backed securities issuance is dominated by two GSEs: the Federal National Mortgage Association, also called Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, also called Freddie Mac. These securities are also issued by non-GSE conduits that securitize mortgages not qualified for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Volume of Derivatives Activity", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reported the results of a comprehensive derivatives survey by the central banks of 26 countries.That survey estimated that total notional/contract amounts of derivatives contracts outstanding worldwide were about $55.7 trillion as of the end of March 1995. About $47.5 trillion of this amount were OTC contracts and $8.2 trillion were exchange-traded contracts. Although notional/contract amounts are indicators of volume, gross market values, or replacement costs, provide a more accurate measure of the economic significance of the derivatives contracts outstanding. BIS reported the gross market values of the OTC derivatives as being $2.2 trillion, or about 4.6 percent of the notional/contract amounts. To our knowledge, directly comparable data for structured notes and CMOs do not exist. The best available data show the amounts of these products issued by U.S. GSEs each year. These data indicate that the total amounts of these products issued in calendar year 1995 were about $10 billion for structured notes and about $23 billion for CMOs.", "Table 1.1 shows derivatives volumes from the annual reports of the 15 major U.S. OTC derivatives dealers we identified. These volumes increased every year. Among the dealers we identified, bank dealers dominate total derivatives volume, accounting for about 69 percent each year since 1990; securities firms accounted for about 27 percent and insurance companies the remaining 4 percent. The derivatives volumes reported by insurance company affiliates grew more than the volumes reported by either banks or securities firms in 4 of the 5 years we analyzed, from year-end 1990 through year-end 1995.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) oversees banks with national charters. The Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) oversees all bank holding companies and those banks with state charters that are members of the Federal Reserve. State-chartered banks that are not Federal Reserve members are subject to the oversight of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and state banking authorities. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) oversees federally insured thrifts and thrift holding companies, whether they are state or federally chartered. The Federal Reserve, the lender of last resort for banks and other financial institutions, has the additional responsibility of ensuring the overall stability of the U.S. financial system. FDIC also has some backup responsibilities for all federally insured depository institutions, even those primarily overseen by the Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS.", "As part of this oversight responsibility, bank regulators assess bank and thrift compliance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). FDICIA requires management of large banks and thrifts to annually assess and publicly report on the effectiveness of each institution\u2019s internal control system over financial reporting. It also requires an independent external auditor to attest to management\u2019s assertions in a separate report. In addition, FDICIA requires large institutions to have an audit committee made up of outside directors who are independent of institution management and to establish a reporting link between the audit committee and external auditors. For the largest institutions, FDICIA requires that audit committees include members with banking or related financial management experience.", "SEC regulates activities involving securities and the firms that trade these products, including broker-dealers, which must register with SEC and comply with requirements for regulatory reporting, minimum capital, and examinations. Broker-dealers must also comply with the requirements of the various exchanges and industry associations of which they are members, such as the New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers, which are granted self-regulatory authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. CFTC regulates activities involving futures and the firms that trade these products, including futures commission merchants (FCM)\u2014firms that buy and sell contracts as agents for customers. These firms also must comply with rules imposed by the various futures exchanges and industry associations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, as well as the National Futures Association, all of which act as self-regulatory organizations under the Commodity Exchange Act. For the most part, neither SEC nor CFTC directly regulates OTC derivative products or the dealers of these products unless their trading is conducted in a regulated entity.", "The regulatory approaches of these financial regulators differ. A primary mission of bank regulators is to promote the safety and soundness of the financial system and protect the federal deposit insurance funds\u2014the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund. They address this goal through various actions, including establishing capital requirements, establishing information reporting requirements, conducting periodic examinations, and issuing enforcement actions. SEC\u2019s and CFTC\u2019s primary purposes are to protect investors or customers in the public securities and futures markets and to maintain fair and orderly markets. Unlike bank regulators, who can regulate all bank activities, SEC and CFTC are authorized to regulate only activities involving securities and futures and only those firms that trade these products. To the extent OTC derivatives are not securities or futures, neither agency directly regulates those products nor the dealers of those products, unless such trading is conducted in a regulated entity.", "Federal financial regulators share information and ideas through groups and task forces, such as the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets. Individual agencies also work together on various issues. For example, the banking regulators coordinate certain activities through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), which develops uniform principles, standards, and report forms and coordinates the development of uniform reporting systems and regulations. Internationally, U.S. and foreign regulators work together through various committees, such as the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, which develops capital standards and issues various types of guidance for banks.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for private sector entities. These standards are referred to as generally accepted accounting principles and are promulgated through the issuance of statements of financial accounting standards (SFAS) by FASB. SFAS are officially regarded as authoritative by SEC and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

To determine whether key controls had been designed into institutions\u2019 systems, we compared their controls to a list of key internal controls that all institutions should have in place. We compiled the list of key controls from various sources, which included bank regulators\u2019 examination guidance; guidance from AICPA and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO); and recommendations from the Group of Thirty (G-30). To determine the internal controls in place at each of the 12 institutions, we reviewed bank regulatory examination workpapers and discussed controls with examiners, institution management, and, when possible, internal auditors. We did not test the controls to determine if they were functioning as described. We also discussed FDICIA requirements, such as formal internal control assessments and external auditor attestations, with institution management to determine their usefulness.", "To update information on bank regulators, we reviewed their examination guidance, examiner training, special studies, and other relevant documents. Our analysis focused on the Federal Reserve and OCC because they were the primary regulators of the seven major bank derivatives dealers. To evaluate the quality and content of bank regulatory examination activities relative to derivatives, we reviewed a total of 12 bank examination reports from 1992 to 1994 for the 7 largest U.S. bank OTC derivatives dealers and conducted follow-up interviews with examination staff. OCC examiners performed 7 of the 12 examinations we reviewed. Federal Reserve examiners performed the remaining five. As part of our review, we used bank examination guidance and G-30 recommendations as criteria to identify the vital elements of an effective risk-management system.

Although these voluntary actions for improving corporate governance and controls are valuable, they may not be adopted by all of those who are vulnerable to the risks associated with derivatives, structured notes, and CMOs. In addition, we continue to be concerned that favorable market conditions may mask the need for further improvements and that the passage of time may lessen the vigilance of entities\u2019 directors and senior management.", "We discussed the internal control assessments and reporting required under FDICIA with officials from 12 end-user banks and thrifts. They told us that they generally found the assessments and reports useful in enhancing internal controls for these institutions. We continue to believe that internal control assessments and reporting are essential for ensuring that the directors and senior management of major OTC derivatives dealers and end-users exercise their fiduciary responsibilities regarding derivatives and similar financial instruments. SEC has acknowledged that there may be benefits associated with management or auditor reports on internal control systems of SEC registrants that are major dealers and end-users of complex derivative products, as GAO recommended. However, SEC has stated that it is focusing on accounting for and providing greater disclosure of market risk for derivative products, which it views as a more appropriate priority at this time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Corporate Governance Weaknesses Contributed to Losses", "paragraphs": ["Since our May 1994 report, some financial institutions, commercial corporations, and local governments have sustained significant losses attributed to activities involving derivatives, structured notes, and CMOs. A common factor in each of the losses was a weak corporate governance system that did not establish, maintain, or monitor effective risk management and internal controls.", "Characteristics of an effective corporate governance system include a responsible board of directors that approves policies governing the nature and extent of derivatives use in the context of an overall risk-management policy and that provides effective oversight; management that properly implements board-approved policies and risk limits and that establishes controls to ensure that the risks of derivatives activities are managed in accordance with the board\u2019s authorization; qualified personnel and comprehensive systems that match the scope, size, and complexity of derivatives activities and risks; established functions for monitoring activities that are independent of trading personnel and allow for effective supervision of risks; audits that help ensure that approved policies, procedures, and limits associated with significant risks are effectively implemented, followed, and not circumvented by management; and independent and knowledgeable audit committees that provide effective oversight of compliance with internal controls related to derivatives activities.", "Although no corporate governance system, however elaborate, can prevent all losses, the following examples of some of the most publicized losses from derivatives activities illustrate that the severe losses that occurred might have been avoided or reduced in severity if the basic principles of sound internal controls and governance systems had been followed. These examples are discussed in more detail in appendix I.", "The first example involved losses by a major OTC derivatives dealer, Bankers Trust. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bankers Trust failed to adjust its internal controls in response to a riskier new line of business, marketing and sales of leveraged derivatives. Subsequent investigations by the Federal Reserve, SEC, and CFTC found problems related to this new line of business and failure of the entity\u2019s management to reasonably supervise individuals involved. Bankers Trust suffered significant losses because of OTC derivatives when some of its clients decided not to honor their derivatives obligations and sued Bankers Trust.", "According to the SEC settlement, Gibson Greetings, one of Bankers Trust\u2019s clients that defaulted on its obligations to Bankers Trust and subsequently sued it, also lacked appropriate controls over derivatives activities. Several key Gibson officials did not fully understand either derivatives or the risks involved in the speculative structure of their investments with Bankers Trust and were unable to readily determine the value of Gibson\u2019s derivatives holdings. According to an SEC release, Gibson relied totally on Bankers Trust to establish values for use in preparing its financial statements and in periodic reports filed with SEC. As a result, according to SEC\u2019s release, representatives of Bankers Trust were able to mislead Gibson about the value of the company\u2019s derivatives positions by providing values that significantly understated the magnitude of the losses.", "An example of significant derivatives losses concerning a local government occurred in Orange County, California. According to a California State Auditor\u2019s report, Orange County filed for bankruptcy when the county Treasurer\u2019s flawed investment strategy, which stressed yield over liquidity or security, resulted in about $1.7 billion in losses. The losses reportedly occurred in an atmosphere of inadequate risk management and poor supervision by the county board. A report by a committee of the California legislature cited a lack of involvement by the County Board of Supervisors as one cause of the bankruptcy filing. Other reports by the County Auditor and an outside consultant identified numerous internal control weaknesses that may have contributed to the collapse of Orange County\u2019s investment pool. The outside consultant also noted that the county\u2019s investment policy did not define a diversification strategy, establish limits on levels of certain high-risk investments, or prohibit leveraging of the investment portfolio. In addition, the report stated that the Treasurer\u2019s office did not periodically report the results, status, or makeup of the investment portfolio, and periodic reviews of securities\u2019 market values were not documented and maintained. Because the County Board of Supervisors and management did not perform their basic governance responsibilities, they did not deal effectively with the significant risks of the investment activities being carried out by the Treasurer. This lack of oversight, combined with the basic control weaknesses, resulted in unchecked high-risk investment strategies that proved detrimental to the participants in the Orange County investment pool.", "Another example of significant losses involved Cap Corp, which was formerly one of the nation\u2019s largest corporate credit unions with reported assets of $1.6 billion. Cap Corp failed in January 1995 and was placed into conservatorship by the National Credit Union Administration. By February 1995, when we testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the total loss on Cap Corp\u2019s portfolio was about $61 million. We said that Cap Corp\u2019s failure was, in part, the result of inadequate oversight by the board of directors of a risky investment strategy, no internal audit function, and other weaknesses in internal controls. In particular, Cap Corp lacked a model to test the overall sensitivity of its investment portfolio to potential changes in interest rates. Cap Corp also failed to react readily to the growing mismatch between its assets and liabilities. Cap Corp\u2019s board of directors not only failed to ensure that an adequate risk-management system was established and functioning, it also did not appear to adequately oversee Cap Corp\u2019s investment activities. Virtually all responsibility for Cap Corp\u2019s investment activities was delegated to an investment committee comprising Cap Corp\u2019s senior management, and the board showed little interest in the decisions this committee made.", "Finally, in February 1995, Barings, a British investment bank, collapsed after losing over $1 billion trading financial futures and options on exchanges in Singapore and Japan. The Bank of England report issued after the bank\u2019s failure indicated that one employee\u2019s trading activities apparently were responsible for all the losses. The regulators said that these losses went undetected as a consequence of failed management oversight and a lack of basic internal controls. For example, Barings\u2019 management did not adequately follow up on a number of warning signs, including findings reported by the internal auditors, over a prolonged period. According to the regulators\u2019 report, this employee originally was authorized to perform certain limited trading activities for customers. However, he began to generate profits through unauthorized trading for Barings\u2019 own account. Despite significant reported profits, Barings\u2019 management believed that his activity represented no significant risk to Barings until the large losses suddenly became evident. Until this time, he was able to conceal his losses largely because he was responsible for both initiating and recording trades\u2014a lack of basic separation of duties.Barings collapsed because of its management\u2019s failure to institute a proper system of internal controls; enforce accountability for profits, risks, and operations; and follow up on warning systems. \u201cThe over $1 billion loss suffered by Daiwa and the catastrophic losses suffered by Barings in Singapore because of a rogue trader illustrate the enormity of the damage that can be incurred by global trading banks when internal control systems are less than adequate. . . . The lesson forcefully taught by these cases is that management must pay as much attention to such seemingly mundane tasks as back office settlement and internal audit functions as to the more exotic high technology front-end trading systems.\u201d", "Given the lax corporate governance associated with the losses reported since 1994, we continue to support the wider application of FDICIA-type internal control assessments and reporting to cover more than large insured depository institutions. Losses at these entities clearly illustrate the results that can occur when effective risk-management and internal control systems are not developed, properly implemented, and vigilantly enforced.

Further, only the guidance of the Derivatives Policy Group (DPG) calls for a periodic assessment of the effectiveness of these controls by auditors, but it does not require public reporting of the results.

The estimate would determine the bank\u2019s regulatory capital requirement. To ensure that a bank\u2019s capital commitment was adequate to cover both its trading position risks and its ability to manage those risks, a regulator would provide incentives in the form of penalties for a bank\u2019s failure to contain its loss within the committed-capital amount. These penalties could include fines, higher capital requirements, restrictions on trading activities, or public announcement of the bank\u2019s delinquency. Further, both the commitment and a bank\u2019s risk-management system would be subject to review by regulatory authorities, who would have to be satisfied that the pre-committed amount was consistent with the bank\u2019s trading position and risk-management system.", "This proposed approach presumes that methods for measuring and managing market risk will continue to evolve. It could encourage development of progressive risk management tools, because the proposed approach would devolve responsibility for setting capital from regulators to banks and provide incentives for banks to set capital prudently. If enacted with carefully designed penalties, it could create incentives for banks to set aside adequate capital for the purpose of meeting unexpected losses. According to a Federal Reserve Bank president, the Federal Reserve recognizes that the penalties cannot be so severe that they impair profitability or push a bank into financial distress. The approach could also encourage banks to implement adequate risk-management systems and internal models. Although no further action had been taken on this approach as of July 1996, industry reactions have been generally favorable.

In the absence of accounting rules for these derivatives, accounting practices of derivatives market participants had been shaped by common industry practice and by the adaptation of existing rules for similar financial products.", "We found that in practice, derivatives used for trading purposes were recorded at market value, while derivatives used for hedging purposes were recorded consistent with the item being hedged, either at market value or at cost. If the hedged item was recorded at cost, then gains or losses from changes in the market value of the derivatives were deferred until the related gains or losses on the hedged item were realized, which we referred to as deferral hedge accounting. If the hedge operated as planned, the income statement effects of the derivative product and the hedged item would theoretically offset each other. However, we found that determining whether a hedge was operating effectively and thus qualified for hedge accounting was difficult, not only because of the complexities involved but also because of confusion about the definition of hedging. Some believed that hedging meant activities to reduce, or neutralize, exposure to risk of loss from changes in market conditions, while others believed that hedging also encompassed activities that adjust risk to take advantage of anticipated changes in market conditions.

We reviewed the 1992 annual reports of 10 large U.S. bank holding companies with significant derivatives activity and found these institutions were generally complying with these standards, although some variances in the extent and methods of disclosures existed. A proposed disclosure standard, which was expected to be issued by the end of 1994, required additional disclosures about derivatives and their fair values.

The problems we found centered around the use of deferral hedge accounting, whereby gains and losses from these derivatives activities are not recorded in income as they occur. We found that more than half of the institutions used deferral hedge accounting for risk-adjusting or, at least in one case, purely speculative, derivatives activity that was based on anticipated market movements. We believe that deferral hedge accounting should be limited to activities intended to decrease an entity\u2019s exposure to risk of loss and should not be used when an entity uses derivatives to attempt to profit or speculate on market movements. Only 5 of the 12 institutions used deferral hedge accounting appropriately for derivatives activities designed to neutralize their exposure to interest or foreign exchange rate risk. Seven used deferral hedge accounting for derivatives activities designed to adjust rather than neutralize their risks and therefore, in our view, inappropriately delayed recording gains and losses on these transactions.", "Each of the 12 banks and thrifts we selected for review engaged in activities using derivatives that they defined as \u201chedging.\u201d Each of the institutions also used deferral accounting for these designated hedging activities.

The criteria used by these 12 institutions to justify hedge accounting, while reportedly based on the limited accounting standards that do exist for derivatives, also varied significantly. The specific hedge objectives and related criteria of selected institutions in our sample are described in appendix VII.", "The hedging objective of all five risk-reducing institutions was to neutralize the impact of potential loss from changes in interest or foreign exchange rates on their operating income. For example, some employed a hedging strategy to lock in a spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid out on liabilities. Under this type of strategy, changes in the market values of the assets and liabilities involved, when adjusted by changes in market values of the derivatives used as a hedge, would generally be offset, thereby neutralizing the effect of rate changes on the institutions\u2019 overall financial position. Changes in the market values of assets and liabilities carried at historical cost are not recorded until they are sold. The offset from changes in the market values of the derivatives is accomplished by similarly deferring any realized hedge gains and losses on the derivatives. The deferred hedge gains and losses would generally be amortized over time and recognized as an adjustment to net interest income related to the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. Any changes in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates would be offset by amortization of the related hedge gains and losses.", "The other seven institutions in our sample used strategies they labeled as hedging that were risk-adjusting activities based on anticipated market movements. For example, if an institution\u2019s management believed interest rates were going to decline, they would use derivatives to adjust their exposure to interest rates so that they could profit from a decline in rates. If rates increased rather than declined, such a strategy would generally result in losses for the institution. In either case, neither the changes in market values nor the impact on net interest income from the derivatives would be offset by corresponding changes in the market values or net interest income from the assets or liabilities purportedly being hedged. In other words, the institutions used the derivatives to shift their exposure to changes in interest rates rather than to protect against such changes. Because deferral hedge accounting was applied by these institutions, the gains or losses from these types of risk-adjusting activities were deferred and not recorded in income until a later time.", "In some cases it may be appropriate for institutions to position themselves to take advantage of expected changes in interest rates. However, we believe that the resulting gains and losses from these activities should not be afforded deferral hedge accounting. Deferral of such gains and losses can result in large accumulations, particularly of losses, that either get deferred in the balance sheet, with no income statement recognition, or do not show up in the financial statements (as is usually the case with swaps) until the derivatives position is closed.

These market value losses are often not recorded by the entity because accounting rules allow many investment securities to be carried at historical cost. In particular, accounting practices followed by state and local governments allow virtually all securities to be carried at historical cost. Further, accounting rules do not require disclosures about the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the market value of the investment portfolio.

In the fall of 1994, many member credit unions began withdrawing shares they held in Cap Corp. To avoid recording the losses on its CMO portfolio, Cap Corp funded these withdrawals with additional borrowing rather than selling some of its CMO portfolio. Once these borrowings resulted in violation of regulatory borrowing limits, Cap Corp was forced to liquidate some of these investments at substantial losses to fund credit union member withdrawals. Yet, Cap Corp continued to record the vast majority of its portfolio at historical cost, apparently taking advantage of the subjective criteria of SFAS No. 115 that allow entities to carry such securities at cost if they have the ability and intent to hold them to maturity. As of September 30, 1994, Cap Corp\u2019s internal reports showed that over 95 percent of its portfolio was carried at historical cost, which was approximately $35 million greater than the market value of these securities at that time.

These criteria are more restrictive than those used in current practice and are likely to limit the types of activities that qualify for hedge accounting under the proposed standard. All of these criteria are discussed in appendix IX, and a discussion of selected criteria follows.", "For a derivative to qualify as a fair value hedge, formal documentation of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk being hedged must exist, and the use of the derivative must be consistent with the entity\u2019s established policy for risk management. In addition, the item being hedged must be specifically identified as a single asset or liability or a portfolio of similar items sharing common characteristics; the hedged item must be reliably measurable at fair value, and changes in the fair value must be expected to be substantially offset by changes in the derivative; and the hedged item individually must present an exposure to price changes that could affect reported earnings.", "The criteria for a cash flow hedge also require that formal documentation of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk being hedged exist and that the use of the derivative be consistent with the entity\u2019s established policy for risk management. In addition, for a cash flow hedge, the forecasted transaction must be probable, be part of an established business activity, and represent an exposure to price changes that could affect reported earnings. Further, the net cash flows from the derivative must be expected to substantially offset all of the changes in net cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction that are attributable to the risk being hedged.", "The proposed standard also includes specific disclosure requirements for derivatives and similar financial instruments. For all derivatives, each entity is required to distinguish among derivatives designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and all other derivatives. The entity must disclose its objectives for holding or issuing the instruments, the context needed to understand those objectives, its strategies for achieving those objectives, and the notional or contract amount of the derivatives when necessary for an understanding of the objectives.", "For derivatives designated as hedges, the entity must provide a description of the entity\u2019s risk-management policy for such hedges, including a description of the items whose risks are being hedged and the classes of derivatives used to hedge those risks; the amount of gains or losses on the derivatives and the items being hedged, if applicable, that were recognized in earnings during the reporting period as well as a description of where those gains and losses and the related hedged items are reported in the financial statements; and the cumulative amount of derivatives gains or losses that have not yet been recognized in earnings and a description of where they are reported in the financial statements.", "In addition, for fair value hedges, the entity must also disclose the amount of gains and losses recognized in earnings when performance under a hedged-firm commitment is no longer probable. For cash flow hedges, the entity also must disclose the designated reporting periods in which the forecasted transactions are expected to occur and the deferred amounts to be recognized in earnings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Standard Has Many Advantages Over Current Practice", "paragraphs": ["The proposed standard has many advantages over current hedge accounting practices. For example, as outlined in appendix VI, current accounting standards for derivatives address only certain types of derivative instruments, while the proposed standard applies to all derivatives and to financial instruments with characteristics similar to derivatives. Derivatives held by end-users for hedging purposes are currently not reflected on the balance sheet. Under the proposed approach, all derivatives would be recorded as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measured at fair value. Under existing hedge accounting, gains and losses on a qualifying derivative hedging instrument are deferred to offset the change in value of the underlying asset or liability being hedged (the hedged item). These changes in fair values are not recorded in earnings. Under the proposed standard, gains or losses on a derivative used as a fair value hedge would be included in earnings, and offsetting losses or gains on the hedged item would be accelerated and recognized in earnings in the same period. Accelerating the gain or loss on the hedged item generally has the added benefit of adjusting the historical cost amount of that asset or liability toward its fair value.", "FASB\u2019s proposed standard would help eliminate the inappropriate uses of deferral hedge accounting that we noted among the 12 institutions we reviewed (see app. VII). Many of these institutions incurred large declines in the values of their derivatives, which were not reflected in their financial statements. Had the proposed standard been in place, such derivatives would have been required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value; the related losses would have been reflected in the financial statements, either in earnings or in other comprehensive income.", "We also note in appendix VII that the 12 institutions varied widely in their application of hedge criteria. For example, they differed significantly in how they determined whether there was high correlation between changes in the market value of a derivative and changes in market value of the underlying hedged asset or liability\u2014a requirement under current hedge accounting. Under the proposed standard, calculating correlation becomes essentially unnecessary since both hedge and nonhedge gains and losses are required to be reported in earnings. An ineffective hedge would result in little or no offsetting losses or gains from the hedged item, with the net accounting effect being the same as if the derivative had not been designated as a hedge. In addition, the proposal requires discontinuance of hedge accounting if a hedge fails to meet any of the previously listed criteria.", "There also are inconsistencies in the hedge criteria established in the current standards. For example, as described in appendix VI, SFAS No. 52 and SFAS No. 80 differ in the allowed use of hedge accounting for anticipated, or forecasted, transactions. The proposed standard would eliminate such inconsistencies by establishing one set of standards for all derivatives and superseding prior standards that caused such inconsistencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Standard Would Not Accommodate Macrohedging", "paragraphs": ["The 12 institutions in our sample used both micro- and macrohedging strategies.

Because of this, the proposed standard generally does not easily accommodate macrohedging. As many institutions currently use macrohedging strategies, the limitations imposed on such strategies under the proposed standard have caused concern and opposition to the proposed approach. In our sample institutions, eight used macrohedging strategies. Of those eight, six were risk-adjusting rather than risk-reducing strategies. As previously discussed, we do not believe risk-adjusting strategies should qualify for special hedge accounting treatment. The proposed standard would help eliminate the ability of entities to inappropriately use hedge accounting for risk-adjusting strategies; however, it would also limit the ability to use hedge accounting for valid macrohedging risk-reducing strategies.", "We believe the only viable solution to these macrohedging issues is comprehensive market value accounting of all financial instruments, because it is the only reliable way that offsetting gains and losses in the portfolio and in the derivative instruments can be matched up. Under comprehensive market value accounting, the results of any hedging strategies would be clearly reflected in earnings. Effective risk-reducing macrohedging strategies would generally result in minimal volatility in earnings, while macrohedging risk-adjusting strategies would often result in significant earnings fluctuations.", "However, we recognize that adoption of a market value accounting model would require the resolution of significant implementation issues and therefore may not be a feasible solution in the short term. Officials from most of the 12 banks and thrifts in our sample told us they were opposed to market value accounting for all financial instruments. They expressed concerns about how to determine market values for financial instruments with no ready market, the treatment of intangible assets, and the overall volatility in the financial statements that may result from temporary shifts in the financial markets. They also indicated that it would be very burdensome to determine market values for commercial loan portfolios on a regular basis.

In developing the proposed standard, FASB made several fundamental decisions about how to account for derivatives. One of those decisions was that fair value is the most relevant measure for all financial instruments and the only relevant measure for derivatives. In the background information accompanying the proposed standard, FASB acknowledged its belief that fair values for financial assets and liabilities provide more relevant and understandable information than cost or cost-based measures and that with the passage of time, historical prices become irrelevant. It also acknowledged that a fair value approach would have been simple and readily understandable to financial statement users, would have increased comparability for identical balance sheet positions between entities, and would have eliminated the need for special accounting for hedges of financial instruments.", "In further reviewing the background information, we noted that in keeping with this belief, FASB considered measuring all financial instruments at fair value in the proposed standard. Some FASB members indicated that changing the accounting model so that all financial instruments are carried at fair value is the only conceptually consistent solution to hedging issues. However, a number of FASB members chose not to pursue such a model for various reasons. In general, many FASB members did not believe that this could be accomplished in one step. Some FASB members were concerned that a substantial amount of time would be needed to fully address and agree upon the implementation issues of such a model. These include conceptual issues about the valuation of financial assets and liabilities and the reliability of measuring the fair value of some financial instruments. In addition, some FASB members were concerned about the significant impact the requirement would have on financial reporting practices. Because many preparers of financial statements oppose FASB\u2019s proposed requirement that all financial instruments be measured at fair value and because pressure exists to present a solution to the long-standing derivatives problem, FASB opted to develop an interim solution.

In January 1996, the Committee amended the Basle Accord to incorporate market risks. Specifically, this amendment addressed interest rate and equity-price risk in trading activities and foreign-exchange risk and commodities risk throughout a bank. As stated in the amendment, the new capital standards for market risk should be implemented by the Group of Ten supervisory authorities by year-end 1997, at the latest. In implementing this amendment\u2019s capital standards requirement for market risk, central banks can allow the reporting banks to use either a standardized model or their internal model; those banks wishing to use their own models are required to adhere to certain standards. Regulators also are to play a role in ensuring that the internal models used by banks are adequately measuring market risk.
