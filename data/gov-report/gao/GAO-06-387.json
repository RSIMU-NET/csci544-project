The \"bank activities\" rule addressed the applicability of state laws to national banking activities, while the \"visitorial powers\" rule set forth OCC's view of its authority to inspect, examine, supervise, and regulate national banks and their operating subsidiaries. The rules raised concerns among some state officials and consumer advocates. GAO examined (1) how the rules clarify the applicability of state laws to national banks, (2) how the rules have affected state-level consumer protection efforts, (3) the rules' potential effects on banks' choices of a federal or state charter, and (4) measures that could address states' concerns regarding consumer protection."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the bank activities rule, OCC sought to clarify the applicability of state laws by relating them to certain categories, or subjects, of activity conducted by national banks and their operating subsidiaries. However, the rule does not fully resolve uncertainties about the applicability of state consumer protection laws, particularly those aimed at preventing unfair and deceptive acts and practices. OCC has indicated that, even under the standard for preemption set forth in the rules, state consumer protection laws can apply; for example, OCC has said that state consumer protection laws, and specifically fair lending laws, may apply to national banks and their operating subsidiaries. State officials reacted differently to the rules' effect on relationships with national banks. In the views of most officials GAO contacted, the preemption rules have had the effects of limiting the actions states can take to resolve consumer issues, as well as adversely changing the way national banks respond to consumer complaints and inquiries from state officials. OCC has issued guidance to national banks and proposed an agreement with the states designed to facilitate the resolution of, and sharing information about, individual consumer complaints. Other state officials said that they still have good working relationships with national banks and their operating subsidiaries, and some national bank officials stated that they view cooperation with state attorneys general as good business practice. Because many factors, including the size and complexity of banking operations and an institution's business needs, can affect a bank's choice of a federal or state charter, it is difficult to isolate the effects, if any, of the preemption rules. GAO's analysis of OCC and other data shows that, from 1990 to 2004, less than 2 percent of the nation's thousands of banks changed between the federal and state charters. Because OCC and state regulators are funded by fees paid by entities they supervise, however, the shift of a large bank can affect their budgets. In response to the perceived disadvantages of the state charter, some states have reported actions to address potential charter changes by their state banks. Measures that could address states' concerns about protecting consumers include providing for some state jurisdiction over operating subsidiaries, establishing a consensus-based national consumer protection lending standard, and further clarifying the applicability of state consumer protection laws. The first two measures present complex legal and policy issues, as well as implementation challenges. However, an OCC initiative to clarify the rules' applicability would be consistent with one of OCC's strategic goals and could assist both the states and the OCC in their consumer protection efforts--for example, by providing a means to systematically share relevant information on local conditions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On January 13, 2004, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (OCC), which supervises federally chartered \u201cnational\u201d  banks, issued two sets of final rules: one covering the preemption of state  laws relating to the banking activities of national banks and their operating  subsidiaries (\u201cbank activities rule\u201d) and one concerning OCC\u2019s supervisory  authority over those institutions (\u201cvisitorial powers rule\u201d). Together, these  rules are commonly referred to as the OCC preemption rules. The bank  activities rule addresses the applicability of state laws to lending, deposit- taking, and all other activities of national banks authorized by the National  Bank Act. The visitorial powers rule clarifies OCC\u2019s view of its supervisory  authority over national banks and their operating subsidiaries, which OCC  interprets to be its exclusive power to inspect, examine, supervise, and  regulate the business activities of national banks.", "The rules drew strong opposition from a number of state legislators,  attorneys general, consumer group representatives, and Members of  Congress. Some opposed OCC\u2019s legal justification for issuing the proposed  rules. Others opposed the rules because of what they viewed as potentially  adverse effects on consumer protection and the dual banking system.  More specifically, opponents stated that the scope of preemption of state  law under the rules would weaken consumer protections and that the rules  could undermine the dual banking system because, for example, state- chartered banks located in states with regulatory schemes more stringent  than that for national banks would have an incentive to change their  charters from state to federal. Supporters of the rules asserted that  providing uniform regulation for national banks, rather than differing state  regulatory regimes, was necessary to ensure efficient nationwide operation  of national banks.", "In your letter, you requested that we review OCC\u2019s rulemaking process for  promulgating the bank activities and the visitorial powers rules; examine  OCC\u2019s process and capacity to handle consumer complaints; and assess the  impact and potential impact of the rules on consumer protection and the  dual banking system. On October 17, 2005, and February 23, 2006,  respectively, we provided you with reports on the rulemaking process and  OCC\u2019s consumer complaints process and capacity. This final report  focuses on the impact and the potential impact of the rules on consumer  protection and the dual banking system. Specifically, the report examines  (1) how the preemption rules clarify the applicability of state laws to  national banks; (2) how the rules have affected state-level consumer  protection efforts; (3) the rules\u2019 potential effects on banks\u2019 decisions to  seek the federal, versus state, charters; and (4) measures that could  address states\u2019 concerns regarding consumer protection. Additionally, we  provide information on how OCC and other federal regulators, as well as  state bank regulators, are funded. We provide this additional information in  appendixes IV, V, and VI.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed the content of comment letters  submitted to OCC during the rulemaking process and reviewed transcripts  of congressional hearings on the rules to identify issues raised. We  conducted site visits or phone interviews with officials and representatives  of state attorneys general offices, state banking departments, consumer  groups, state bankers associations, and national and state banks in six  states (California, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, Idaho, and Iowa). In  addition, we interviewed legal and academic individuals and conducted our  own legal research. We selected these states, among other reasons,  because of their interest in the preemption issue, as identified by  congressional testimony, comment letters, and referrals from  representatives of national organizations. Therefore, the views expressed  by officials in these six states may not be representative of all state  officials. In Washington, D.C., we interviewed the national associations  comprising state attorneys general and state bank regulators;  representatives of national consumer groups; and officials at OCC and  other federal bank regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC). To assess trends in chartering decisions and their  effects on OCC\u2019s and states\u2019 budgets, we obtained and analyzed data on  charter conversions, mergers, assets, and assessment payments from OCC,  FRB, and certain state bank regulators. To describe how the OCC and state  banking departments are funded, we interviewed OCC and state bank  regulators, and reviewed annual reports, past GAO reports, and the  Conference of State Bank Supervisors\u2019 (CSBS) Profile of State-Chartered  Banking. We conducted our audit work in the previously mentioned six  states and Washington, D.C., from August 2004 through March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As of September 30, 2005, there were 1,846 federally chartered banks and  5,695 state-chartered banks. National banks are federally chartered under  the National Bank Act. The act sets forth the types of activities permissible  for national banks and, together with other federal law, provides OCC with  supervisory and enforcement authority over those institutions. State banks  receive their powers from their chartering states, subject to activities  restrictions and other restrictions and requirements imposed by federal  law. State banks are chartered and supervised by the individual states but  also have a primary federal regulator (see fig. 1). FRB is the primary federal  regulator of state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.  FDIC is the primary federal regulator of state banks that are not members  of the Federal Reserve System. OCC and state regulators collect  assessments and other fees from banks to cover the costs of supervising  these entities. OCC does not receive congressional appropriations.", "Banks chartered in the United States can exist independently or as part of a  bank holding company. OCC, which administers the National Bank Act,  permits national banks to conduct their activities through operating  subsidiaries, which typically are state-chartered businesses. OCC has  concluded that a national bank\u2019s use of an operating subsidiary is a power  permitted by the National Bank Act and that national banks\u2019 exercise of  their powers through operating subsidiaries is subject to the same laws that  apply to the national banks directly. Because OCC supervises national  banks, the agency also supervises national bank operating subsidiaries.  Further, many federally and state-chartered banks exist as parts of bank  holding companies. Bank holding companies may also include nonbank  financial companies, such as finance and mortgage companies that are  subsidiaries of the holding companies. These holding company  subsidiaries are referred to as affiliates of the banks because of their  common ownership or control by the holding company. Unlike national  bank operating subsidiaries, nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding  companies often are subject to regulation by states and their activities may  be subject to federal supervision as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCC\u2019s Mission and Regulatory Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["OCC\u2019s mission focuses on the chartering and oversight of national banks to  assure their safety and soundness and on fair access to financial services  and fair treatment of bank customers. OCC groups its regulatory  responsibilities into three program areas: chartering, regulation, and  supervision. Chartering activities include not only review and approval of  charters but also review and approval of mergers, acquisitions, and  reorganizations. Regulatory activities result in the establishment of  regulations, policies, operating guidance, interpretations, and examination  policies and handbooks. OCC\u2019s supervisory activities encompass bank  examinations and enforcement activities, dispute resolution, ongoing  monitoring of banks, and analysis of systemic risk and market trends.", "As of March 2005, the assets of the banks that OCC supervises accounted  for approximately 67 percent\u2014about $5.8 trillion\u2014of assets in the nation\u2019s  banks. Among the banks OCC supervises are 14 of the top 20 banks in asset  size. OCC also supervises federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.", "As the supervisor of national banks, OCC has regulatory and enforcement  authority to protect national bank consumers. In addition to exercising its  supervisory responsibilities under the National Bank Act, which include  consumer protection, OCC enforces other consumer protection laws.  These include the Federal Trade Commission Act or FTC Act, which  prohibits unfair and deceptive practices, and the Federal Home Ownership  and Equity Protection Act, which addresses predatory practices in  residential mortgage lending. With respect to real estate lending, other  consumer protection laws that national banks and their operating  subsidiaries are subject to include, but are not limited to, the Truth in  Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, and  the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.", "One of OCC\u2019s strategic goals is to ensure that all customers of national  banks have equal access to financial services and are treated fairly. The  agency\u2019s strategic plan lists objectives and strategies to achieve this goal  and includes fostering fair treatment through OCC guidance and  supervisory enforcement actions, where appropriate, and providing an  avenue for customers of national banks to resolve complaints. The main  division within OCC tasked with handling consumer complaints is the  Customer Assistance Group (CAG); its mission is to ensure that bank  customers receive fair treatment in resolving their complaints with national  banks. In our recent report on OCC consumer assistance efforts, we found  that, in addition to resolving individual complaints, OCC uses consumer  complaint data collected by CAG (1) to assess risks and identify potential  safety, soundness, or compliance issues at banks; (2) to provide feedback  to banks on complaint trends; (3) and to inform policy guidance for the  banks it supervises.

Before promulgating the preemption rules in January  2004, OCC primarily addressed preemption issues through opinion letters  issued in response to specific inquiries from banks or states. According to  OCC, the preemption rules \u201ccodified\u201d judicial decisions and OCC opinions  on preemption of particular state laws by making those determinations  generally applicable to state laws and clarifying certain related issues.", "However, the preemption rules were controversial. In commenting on the  proposed rules, some opponents questioned whether OCC, in issuing the  bank activities rule, interpreted the National Bank Act too broadly,  particularly with respect to the act\u2019s effect on the applicability of state law  to national bank operating subsidiaries. Others opposed the rules because  of what they viewed as potentially adverse effects on consumer protection  and the dual banking system. For example, consumer groups and state  legislators feared that the preemption of state law, particularly with respect  to predatory lending practices, would weaken consumer protections. In  comments on the proposed visitorial powers rule, most opponents  questioned OCC\u2019s assertion of exclusive visitorial authority with respect to  national bank operating subsidiaries. Opponents expressed concern that  the visitorial powers rule eliminates states\u2019 ability to oversee and take  enforcement actions against national bank operating subsidiaries, even  though those entities may be state-licensed businesses.", "Supporters of the proposed bank activities rule, a group consisting largely  of national banks, asserted that subjecting national banks to uniform  regulation, rather than differing state regulatory regimes, was necessary to  ensure efficient nationwide operation of national banks. According to these  commenters, national banks operating under varied state laws would face  increased costs, compliance burdens, and exposure to litigation based on  differing, and sometimes conflicting, state laws. In comments on the  proposed visitorial powers rule, most proponents suggested that OCC  make technical clarifications to the rule, specifically related to the  exclusivity of OCC\u2019s visitorial powers with respect to national banks\u2019  operating subsidiaries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OCC Described Types of State Laws That Would Be Preempted, but Questions Remain Regarding the Rules\u2019 Scope and Effect", "paragraphs": ["In the bank activities rule, OCC attempted to clarify the types of state laws  that would be preempted by relating them to certain categories, or  subjects, of activity conducted by national banks and their operating  subsidiaries.

For each of the first three categories, OCC listed subjects that it  concluded are not subject to state law because state laws concerning those  subjects already had been preempted under OCC interpretations of the  National Bank Act, or by judicial decisions, or were found to be preempted  by OTS for federal thrifts. For state laws relating to any of the three  categories but not to subjects specified in the lists, OCC announced that it  would apply the test for federal preemption established by Supreme Court  precedents. According to OCC, that test calls for a determination of  whether a state law \u201cobstructs, impairs, or conditions\u201d a national bank\u2019s  ability to perform a federally authorized activity.

That provision makes national banks subject to the visitorial  powers vested in courts of justice, such as a state court\u2019s authority to issue  orders or writs compelling the production of information or witnesses, but  according to OCC, does not authorize states or other governmental entities  to exercise visitorial powers over national banks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questions Remain Concerning the Applicability of State Consumer Protection Laws", "paragraphs": ["Although OCC issued the bank activities rule to clarify the applicability of  state laws to national banks and their operating subsidiaries, many of the  state officials, consumer groups, and law professionals we interviewed said  that the preemption rules did not resolve questions about the applicability  of certain types of state law to national banks and their operating  subsidiaries. One set of concerns, discussed in appendix II of this report,  reflects differences about how the rules and OCC\u2019s authority under the  National Bank Act should be interpreted. In OCC\u2019s view, the rules resolved  many uncertainties that had existed before the rules but did not resolve all  issues about the extent of preemption. A second set of concerns regarding  uncertainty over the applicability of state consumer protection laws,  particularly those prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices  (UDAP) exists, at least in part, because of OCC\u2019s statements that under the  preemption rules such laws may apply to national banks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statements by OCC Suggest That State Consumer Protection Laws Can Be Consistent with Federal Law", "paragraphs": ["In the bank activities rulemaking, OCC specified that a state law relating to  a subject listed as preempted, as well as any other state law determined to  be preempted by OCC or a court, does not apply to national banks and their  operating subsidiaries regardless of how the law is characterized.  Accordingly, a state law would not escape preemption simply because the  state describes it as a consumer protection law. However, OCC has  indicated that even under the standard for preemption set forth in the rules,  state consumer protection laws can apply to national banks and their  operating subsidiaries. Moreover, to the extent that a state\u2019s consumer  protection law might apply to a subject on one of the preemption lists, OCC  has not specifically indicated what characteristics of the state law would  cause it to be preempted.", "Some state officials and consumer groups we met with were unclear as to  whether or not a state consumer protection law would apply to national  banks because it is \u201cotherwise consistent with\u201d the National Bank Act, even  if the law were to have more than an incidental effect on a national bank\u2019s  activity. Some referred to a long-standing decision by a Federal Court of  Appeals, discussed below, holding that a state\u2019s law restricting  discriminatory real estate lending practices applied to national banks. They  said that the court\u2019s reasoning could justify the application of other types of  state laws, such as consumer protection laws, to national bank business  practices. Moreover, on several occasions, OCC has made statements that  reasonably could be interpreted to indicate that state consumer protection  laws can be consistent with federal law and, therefore, not preempted,  even if they directly affect a national bank\u2019s business activity.", "In National State Bank of Elizabeth, N.J. v. Long, the United States Court  of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that a provision of a New Jersey law  prohibiting redlining in mortgage lending applied to a national bank.  Recognizing that prohibiting redlining was consistent with federal policy,  the court ruled that the bank\u2019s compliance with the New Jersey statute  would not frustrate the \u201caims of the federal banking system\u201d or \u201cimpair a  national bank's efficiency\u201d in conducting activities permitted by federal  law. This decision demonstrates that a state law determined to be  consistent with federal policy can govern a national bank\u2019s exercise of a  federally granted power, even if the law directly affects the way in which  the bank conducts its activity. According to some of the individuals we  interviewed, the same analysis justifies application of state consumer  protection laws to national bank activities such as real estate lending.", "Some of the individuals we interviewed asserted that the Long court\u2019s  analysis justifies the application of state consumer protection laws to  national banks, at least to the extent that the laws are consistent with  federal policy. They pointed out, moreover, that federal consumer  protection laws applicable to banking activities (discussed later in this  report) accommodate state laws that impose standards and requirements  stricter than those contained in the federal laws themselves, provided the  state laws are otherwise consistent with the federal law. Those federal laws  contain savings clauses preserving from preemption state laws that impose  stricter standards than in the federal laws. However, courts have  recognized that those savings clauses do not necessarily preserve such  state laws from preemption by the National Bank Act. Several consumer  groups and state officials also referred to OCC statements as indications of  OCC\u2019s recognition that, to some extent, the application of consumer  protection laws to national banks is consistent with federal policy. For  example, since the promulgation of the preemption rules, OCC has said  that state consumer protection laws, and specifically fair lending laws, may  apply to national banks and their operating subsidiaries. Also, while the  bank activities rule specifies that national banks may engage in real estate  lending without regard to state law limitations concerning the \u201cterms of  credit,\u201d the Comptroller recently referred to the agency\u2019s responsibility to  enforce \u201capplicable state consumer protection laws\u201d and referred to state  fair lending laws as an example.", "A number of state laws prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and such laws may be  applicable to insured depository institutions.

State banking  department officials we spoke with also had mixed views regarding the  applicability of state UDAP laws. In one state, a banking department  official said that the state\u2019s UDAP statute would likely be preempted. In  another state, an official said that state\u2019s UDAP laws would not be  preempted. Two other state banking department officials were unclear  about the status of their states\u2019 UDAP laws.", "Representatives of national banks also had mixed views about the  applicability of state UDAP laws. Representatives of one national bank  stated that state UDAP laws were preempted, whereas representatives of  two other national banks stated that state UDAP laws were, in fact,  applicable to national banks and their operating subsidiaries. The status of  state UDAP laws is not clear because, some argued, those laws generally  are consistent with federal laws and policies and, therefore, might not  obstruct, impair, or condition the ability of national banks and operating  subsidiaries to carry out activities authorized by the National Bank Act.", "In addition to uncertainty over the applicability of state consumer  protection laws, state officials, consumer groups, and others asserted that  the effects of the preemption rules will remain unclear until legal  arguments are resolved.

In addition, some  state officials noted that they previously had been able to examine  operating subsidiaries without challenge, but after the visitorial powers  rule was issued some national bank operating subsidiaries declined to  submit to state examinations or relinquished their state licenses.

While we found some examples of operating subsidiaries that did  not comply with state regulatory requirements after the preemption rules  were issued, we note that others had not complied with state requirements  before the rules were issued. Some state officials also believed that the  preemption rules might prompt holding companies with national bank  subsidiaries to move lines of business from a national banks\u2019 holding  company affiliate into an operating subsidiary to avoid state regulation.

Officials from some state attorney general offices and state  banking departments told us that the preemption rules have caused them to  approach national banks and their operating subsidiaries about consumer  protection issues differently than they did in the past. For example, one  state banking department official said that, instead of approaching a  national bank operating subsidiary from a regulatory posture, the  department now will try to resolve a consumer complaint with a national  bank operating subsidiary only if the department has a contact at that  particular operating subsidiary, but having a contact is the exception rather  than the rule. Other state officials told us that the preemption rules have  not caused them to change their practices, either because they continued  to attempt resolution at the local level or because they continued to  forward unresolved complaints to OCC as they had done prior to the  issuance of the preemption rules.", "Both before and after issuing the preemption rules, OCC issued guidance  that, among other things, addressed how banks should handle contacts  from state officials. Specifically, OCC issued guidance in 2002\u2014prior to the  visitorial powers rule\u2014encouraging national banks to consult the agency  about information requests by state officials to determine whether the  request constituted an attempt to exercise visitorial or enforcement power  over the bank. The guidance also advised national banks that state  officials were to contact OCC, rather than the bank itself, if they had  information to indicate that the bank might be violating federal law or an  applicable state law. In February 2004, approximately 1 month after the  visitorial powers rule became effective, OCC updated its 2002 guidance to  clarify how national banks should respond to consumer complaints  referred directly to the bank by state officials. While the 2002 guidance  was silent on consumer complaint handling specifically, the 2004 guidance  stated that OCC does not regard referral of complaints by state officials as  an exercise of supervisory powers by the states and that national banks  should deal with the complaining customer directly. The 2004 guidance  advised national banks to contact OCC if (1) the bank considers a referral  to be a state effort to direct the bank\u2019s conduct or otherwise to exercise  visitorial authority over the national bank or (2) the state-referred  complaint deals with the applicability of a state law or issues of  preemption.

Also, OCC noted  that the proposed MOU did not provide for referrals from OCC to state  agencies of consumer complaints OCC received pertaining to state- regulated entities. Therefore, in 2004, OCC attempted to address these  concerns in a revised MOU, which it provided to CSBS and the Chairman of  the NAAG Consumer Protection Committee. According to OCC, the revised  MOU expressly says that an exchange of information does not involve any  concession of jurisdiction by either the states or by OCC to the other.

Deregulation  and technological changes have also facilitated globalization.  Consolidation (merging of firms in the same sector) and conglomeration  (merging of firms in other sectors) have increasingly come to characterize  the large players in the financial services industry.

As a result, the financial services industry has become more complex and  competition sharper.", "In our October 2004 report on changes in the financial services industry, we  cited technological change and deregulation as important drivers of  consolidation in the banking industry. For example, in the early 1980s,  bank holding companies faced limitations on their ability to own banks  located in different states. Some states did not allow banks to branch at all.  With the advent of regional interstate compacts in the late 1980s, some  banks began to merge regionally. Additionally, the Riegle-Neal Interstate  Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 removed restrictions on  bank holding companies\u2019 ability to acquire banks located in different states  and permitted banks in different states to merge, subject to a process that  permitted states to opt out of that authority.

For example, officials of some  large national banks stated that they valued OCC\u2019s ability to effectively  supervise and regulate large scale banks with complex financial products  and services. Officials from one large state bank said that they valued  federal supervision by FDIC and, at the holding company level, FRB. Some  bank and state and federal regulatory officials said that smaller banks  prefer the generally lower examination fees charged by state regulators and  lower regulatory compliance costs associated with their state charters  relative to the federal charter. For example, officials of one small state  bank, which was previously federally chartered, said that they had to  undertake more administrative tasks under the federal charter, such as  greater reporting requirements needed to demonstrate compliance with  federal laws, and that such tasks were relatively burdensome for a small  bank.", "Some bank officials and state and federal regulators agreed that smaller  banks with few or no operations in other states value accessibility to and  convenient interaction with state regulators. Additionally, officials of  smaller banks said they value the state regulators\u2019 understanding of local  market conditions and participants and the needs of small-scale banking.  Officials of one small state bank said that, when their bank switched from  the federal charter to a state charter, one important consideration was the  state regulators\u2019 frequent visits to the bank and their responsiveness and  accessibility. Bank officials, industry representatives, and regulators also  agreed that new banks tend to be state-chartered because state regulators  tend to play an important role in fostering the development and growth of  start-up banks.", "Bank and state regulatory officials noted that a pre-existing relationship  between a bank\u2019s senior management and a regulator or management\u2019s  knowledge about a particular regulator can play an important role in  choosing or maintaining a charter. For example, officials noted that if  management has already established a good, long-term relationship with a  particular regulator, or if they were familiar with a regulator, they would  likely remain with that regulator when considering charter options.  Officials from two large, state-chartered banks operating in multiple states  said that they valued their relationship with their home state regulators  because they were very responsive and provided quality services. Officials  from one of the banks stated that they knew the staff of their state banking  department very well, and they respected the banking commissioner\u2019s  \u201chands-on\u201d approach to supervision.", "Mergers and acquisitions of banking institutions also influence charter  choice. For example, officials from a large banking institution stated that,  because their merger with another large banking institution combined  federally and state-chartered entities, they decided to convert from a state  to the federal charter to maintain only one charter type in the resulting  company. As a result, they believed they would be able to simplify their  operations, reduce inefficiencies, and lower risks to the financial safety and  soundness of the merged company and have the advantages of the federal  charter companywide. The history of acquisitions in a company also may  affect charter choice.

Between 1999 and 2004, the  assessments collected from national banks funded an average of 96 percent  of OCC\u2019s budget. Thus, its budget also could be affected by charter  changes. OCC derives much of its assessments from a relatively small  number of institutions. Although OCC oversees about 1,900 national banks,  the 20 largest banks accounted for approximately 57 percent of OCC\u2019s  assessments in December 2004.

OCC\u2019s  assessment revenue from conversions to the federal charter jumped by  about 8 percent, or about $23 million, as of December 31, 2004. The  increase is largely attributable to the conversion of one of the two large  state banks mentioned previously, which accounted for about 98 percent of  the increase in OCC\u2019s assessment revenue from charter conversions.", "According to OCC officials, the agency is in a position to sustain any  serious decrease to its revenue stream. OCC\u2019s financial strategy includes  establishing reserves to address unexpected fluctuations in assessment  revenue and an increase in demand on resources. According to OCC, its  \u201ccontingency reserve\u201d would be used to counter any adverse budgetary  effects of a large national bank changing charters. OCC\u2019s policy is to  maintain the contingency reserve at between 40 and 60 percent of its  budget. According to OCC, at the beginning of fiscal year 2006, the  contingency reserve was 49 percent of OCC\u2019s budget.

Therefore, some state  regulators and banking industry officials expressed concern that the  federal charter, and particularly the preemption of state laws, will result in  competitive advantages for federally chartered banks over state chartered  banks. According to some state officials, state chartered banks that operate  in multiple states could be at the greatest competitive disadvantage. In  contrast, according to OCC and many banking industry participants, from a  legal perspective, the preemption rules did not change anything; state laws  always have been subject to preemption under the National Bank Act and  the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and, therefore, state banks  historically have faced the possibility that a federal charter could be more  beneficial than a state charter.", "As noted above, many factors may influence banks\u2019 choice of a state or  federal charter.

They stated that large  banks and banks with operations in multiple states prefer the federal  charter because it makes it easier and less costly to do business. Some  bank officials stated that OCC preemption also makes the federal charter  attractive because the rules clarify supervisory and regulatory authority for  national banks and their operating subsidiaries and also encourage more  standardized banking practices. For example, officials from one national  bank said that changes in the banking industry, such as interstate banking,  make it more important for banks with multistate operations to have  uniform federal regulations to operate across states and to achieve  economies of scale. Similarly, an official from another large national bank  noted that having a consistent set of national regulations also facilitates  banks in offering consumers, who are becoming increasingly mobile,  financial products and services across the country.", "Officials from one large federally chartered bank said that a state charter  for them would be impractical because it would be expensive to develop  and maintain different operational systems for different state laws.  Officials from one large, state-chartered bank operating in multiple states  said that they need to tailor their products, fees, forms, disclosures, and  staff training to the requirements of each state and that the requirements  could be conflicting.

Parity statutes generally grant state-chartered banks the  same powers given to national banks and treat state banks like national  banks in other ways. According to data from CSBS, prior to the rules, 46  states had parity statutes granting state-chartered banks parity with  national banks. Of those, 11 states had parity statutes that were triggered  automatically; that is, when national banks were granted certain powers,  state banks in that state were automatically granted the same powers.", "According to CSBS, the remaining 35 states\u2019 parity laws require the state  bank regulator\u2019s permission before a state bank is allowed to operate under  the parity law\u2019s provisions. Representatives of one state bankers  association told us in their state\u2014where regulator approval for parity is  required\u2014there are often long delays, with some state bank\u2019s parity  applications pending for 2-3 years. Further, according to state regulators  many states\u2019 parity laws include other restrictions that some say may make  it difficult for a state bank to be competitive with national banks. After the  preemption rules were promulgated, one state bank regulator proposed to  enhance the state\u2019s current parity statute to include an automatic trigger for  state-chartered banks when national banks are given certain powers by the  OCC. Thus, in the view of many industry participants and observers we  spoke with, state parity laws are not an ideal solution to leveling any  competitive advantage federally chartered banks might have over state- chartered banks. However, an effective parity law could provide an  incentive for existing state-chartered banks to maintain their state charters.", "We note that views about the rationale for parity laws generally did not  address other possible explanations for those laws, such as a belief that  federal regulation is an appropriate model for regulating and supervising  state banks. Regardless of a state\u2019s reasons for having a parity law, many  participants and regulators in the banking industry maintain that without  regulatory parity the dual banking system will suffer because banks will  migrate to the regulatory regime they consider to be most advantageous. In  recent testimony before FDIC, some regulatory officials and banking  industry representatives testified that unless efforts were made to restore  parity between federal and state bank regulation, the dual banking system,  which they described as having encouraged economic development  especially at the community level, would be adversely affected, as would  healthy competition, regulatory innovation, and checks and balances  among state and federal regulators.", "Some state regulatory officials with whom we spoke recognized the  budgetary consequences associated with state banks changing to the  federal charter. To reduce the impact on their budgets if one of their largest  state-chartered banks changed charters, some state regulators we spoke  with have taken steps to limit the potential for instability. For example, one  state banking department has changed its method of collecting  assessments. Prior to 2005, this state banking department was not  collecting assessments from sources other than approximately 300  depository institutions, a small portion of the approximately 3,400 bank  and nonbank institutions such as check cashers and money transmitters  that it oversaw. Now this state regulator collects assessments from all of its  regulated entities. Other officials have said they were considering  alternative methods of determining assessments to decrease the banking  department\u2019s reliance on one or a few banks to sustain their budgets.", "Although state banking departments would experience smaller budgets if  assessments were lost, the decrease in assessments would be somewhat  offset by the decreased costs of supervising a smaller group of banks and  other financial entities. There are other factors that could mitigate the  consequences of any loss of revenue to a state regulator; for example,  funding formulas that cushion the impact of charter conversions. For  instance, in one state that we visited, each bank effectively paid a  proportionate amount of the banking department\u2019s expenses as its  assessment, with consideration given for asset size. As a result,  assessments varied directly with changes in the department\u2019s spending and  with the number of state-chartered banks.

Providing such a role would likely require  amending the National Bank Act to specify either that (1) the states and  OCC share jurisdiction over operating subsidiaries or (2) operating  subsidiaries are to be treated as national bank affiliates. However,  providing for state involvement in the supervision of operating  subsidiaries, even if only for consumer protection purposes, raises difficult  questions. Some individuals we interviewed said that doing so would  significantly interfere with Congress\u2019 objectives in establishing a national  banking system. Others maintained that state and federal supervisory  interests could be balanced without undermining national banks\u2019 ability to  conduct business.", "Some supporters of state supervision maintain that the National Bank Act  currently does not preempt the application of state laws to operating  subsidiaries. Those subscribing to this view maintain that OCC\u2019s  interpretation of the act is wrong because the preemption standards and  visitorial powers limitations under the act pertain specifically to national  banks, not to their operating subsidiaries. According to this position, under  the National Bank Act and other federal banking laws, operating  subsidiaries should be treated as \u201caffiliates\u201d of national banks, and federal  law recognizes the authority of states to regulate affiliates. However,  several recent federal court decisions have held that OCC has reasonably  interpreted the National Bank Act to permit a national bank\u2019s use of  operating subsidiaries to conduct its business. Some authorities assert  that Congress agrees with OCC\u2019s regulatory scheme for operating  subsidiaries, pointing out that Congress has let the interpretation stand for  more than 30 years. They also refer to a provision of GLBA, in which  Congress specifically recognized the existence of operating subsidiaries by  using OCC\u2019s interpretation to describe them. Further, they maintain that,  in GLBA, Congress implicitly recognized that OCC\u2019s authority over  operating subsidiaries is exclusive unless Congress specifically says  otherwise.", "Because operating subsidiaries are, by definition, a part of a national bank\u2019s  business activity, amending the National Bank Act to provide states with  authority to regulate them concurrently with OCC would set the stage for  state regulation of a national bank in exercising its federally granted  powers. One possible effect of this approach is that, even if a state\u2019s  authority over an operating subsidiary were limited to consumer  protection, it would be difficult to limit state supervision of the bank.  Assuming that a regulatory line could be drawn to separate the activities of  the operating subsidiary from those of the bank, states would need to  monitor, if not supervise, the activities that trigger consumer protection  concerns. To the extent that these activities reflect business decisions,  policies, or practices by the national bank, an opportunity would exist for  state intrusion into the bank itself. This could lead to, among other things,  regulatory disputes over jurisdiction, differing views about the safety and  soundness of the bank, or other points of contention arising from  regulatory policies and objectives of OCC and the states.", "Similarly, amending the National Bank Act to specify that operating  subsidiaries are affiliates of national banks could have unintended  consequences. Assuming that the activities of an operating subsidiary  continued to be limited to activities permissible for its parent bank, the  bank simply could move those activities into the bank, in which case the  efficiencies gained from conducting those activities through a separate  unit, if any, would be lost. Alternatively, those activities could be shifted to  an affiliate of the bank. The potential impact on the national bank\u2019s delivery  of products and services, its costs, and its safety and soundness could be  significant.", "Some state officials noted that states already work effectively with other  federal regulators to monitor and enforce compliance with consumer  protection laws. They described efforts their offices took with federal  regulators, such as FTC, to identify and take enforcement actions against  unlawful practices. One official said FTC works with state officials by  meeting periodically with state regulators to discuss issues of mutual  concern and, when appropriate, to divide investigative responsibilities. In  one instance, the state attorney general coordinated efforts with FTC to  investigate and reach settlement with certain entities that had engaged in  deceptive practices. Some state officials said that their relationships with  federal regulators were based on shared regulatory authority over state- chartered entities and that a similar relationship with OCC should exist  with respect to national bank operating subsidiaries.", "We were told of similar federal-state arrangements with respect to state- chartered depository institutions that are subject to both federal and state  supervision. State officials said that they work with FDIC and FRB  regularly to conduct bank examinations and identify and stop practices  that violate applicable laws. As an example, one official said that state  regulators, FDIC, and FRB have entered into cooperative regulatory  agreements to supervise interstate operations of state-chartered banks that  conduct activities in other (host) states. Some state officials said that  having the same kind of relationship with OCC concerning national bank  operating subsidiaries would enhance consumer protection in their states.", "All of the above examples involve state-chartered entities that are outside  of a national bank and are subject to supervision by both federal and state  authorities. Although those entities are subject to some federal laws that  preempt or can have a preemptive effect on state laws, state officials  generally believed that states have enough supervisory authority over the  institutions to ensure their conformity with state policies as expressed in  state laws. The extent to which those examples should serve as models for  national bank regulation depends on several considerations, not the least  of which would involve policy judgments about the autonomy, if not the  purpose, of the national bank charter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Consensus-Based National Consumer Protection Lending Standard Applicable to All Lending Institutions Would Provide Uniformity but Limit State Autonomy", "paragraphs": ["During our work, we asked state officials and others for their opinions on  whether it is desirable to have a federal lending law ensuring the same level  of consumer protection to customers of all lending institutions, including  banks and regardless of charter.

In addition, officials referred to other  federal consumer protection laws that apply to national banks and national  bank operating subsidiaries. Others stated that existing consumer  protection standards in federal lending laws are weak and suggested a  stricter, consensus-based national consumer protection standard  applicable to lending activities by all state-chartered and federally  chartered financial institutions. Assuming such a standard could be set,  lenders and consumers could rely upon protections that would not change  based upon the lending institution\u2019s charter. A consensus-based national  consumer protection lending standard, however, would appear to limit  states\u2019 abilities to enact standards of their own.", "The rationale for a consensus-based national consumer protection lending  standard generally is that (1) developing such a standard would protect  consumers more than existing laws do and (2) having the right type of  standard would help reduce concerns about the preemptive effect of  federal laws on state consumer protection programs. However, some of the  individuals we interviewed agreed that adopting a consensus-based  national consumer protection lending standard, even if sound policy, would  be difficult to accomplish. Among other things, defining the conduct  subject to a standard could be difficult. While some individuals referred to  certain antipredatory lending bills pending in Congress as appropriate  models, others stated that it would be difficult to find a uniform solution to  practices that are viewed as predatory.", "We also found mixed views on whether a consensus-based national  consumer protection lending standard should serve as a ceiling (which  would not allow state authorities to impose more stringent standards) or a  floor (which would so allow). Some officials stated they would prefer a  floor so that states could go farther to address the particular needs of their  states. One state attorney general official stated that the benefits of having  a floor would be realized when there were more specific practices that  needed to be addressed, such as predatory lending. On the other hand,  another attorney general official said that floor-type standards such as  those contained in federal laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the  FTC Act, do not themselves impose adequate protections and often have  not led to more protective state laws.", "Under either approach, valid regulatory objectives could be compromised.  A federal \u201cceiling\u201d could deprive states of the ability to address practices  and implement policies unique to local conditions. State officials and  consumer groups maintain that the states serve as laboratories for  regulatory innovation necessary for adequately policing financial industry  products and practices. A uniform national \u201cceiling\u201d could deprive states of  the ability to act independently.

Also, in 2004 testimony before the Senate, the  Comptroller described OCC\u2019s commitment to protect consumers and  welcomed opportunities to share information and cooperate and  coordinate with states to address customer complaints and consumer  protection issues.

The actions were based on alleged  unfair and deceptive practices that violated the FTC Act, the California  Business and Professions Code, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and other  applicable laws. OCC instituted an enforcement action against the national  bank, while the state filed a civil judicial action against the national bank\u2019s  state-chartered parent\u2014a financial corporation\u2014and two other state- chartered affiliates.

It could also have the added  benefit of facilitating the sharing of information among the states and OCC  on conditions in a state or a location that might be conducive to predatory  lending or other abuses and could help individual states, as well as OCC.

Based on OCC\u2019s own statements, the scope  and the effects of the rules are not entirely clear. It is, therefore, not  surprising that some state officials said they are uncertain as to what state  consumer protection laws apply to national banks and their operating  subsidiaries.", "Many state officials we spoke with maintain that their ability to protect  consumers by directly contacting national banks and their operating  subsidiaries has been diminished by the preemption rules. However, to  date, courts have upheld OCC\u2019s view that it has exclusive authority to  supervise national bank operating subsidiaries. State officials reported that  they have maintained cooperative relationships with national banks and/or  operating subsidiaries since OCC issued the preemption rules. While state  officials expressed particular concerns that the rules could prompt national  banks, or their holding companies, to move activities into operating  subsidiaries in order to avoid state regulation, such movements occurred  prior to the rules and can result from many factors. OCC has issued  guidance to national banks designed to facilitate the resolution of  individual consumer complaints and address broader consumer protection  issues that state officials believe warrant attention.", "Changes in charter type\u2014federal or state\u2014are influenced by many factors  including whether or not a bank has operations in multiple states.  Consistent federal laws throughout the country are an attraction to banks  with a presence in more than one state and especially banks with a national  presence. Preemption of state law is part of that attraction for such banks  but cannot be attributed as the sole reason some banks choose the federal  charter. While the number of charter changes has been relatively small  during the period we reviewed (1990 through 2004), the amount of the  corresponding bank assets that moved from state bank regulators\u2019  supervision to that of OCC as a result of charter changes did increase  noticeably in 2004, albeit largely because of the charter conversion of one  large bank. Because both OCC and state banking departments are funded  by the entities they regulate and their formulas for the assessments charged  are based partially, if not totally, on the assets of the banks and other  entities they regulate, their budgets and workloads can be affected by  changes in bank charters. OCC has a reserve fund to protect itself from any  dramatic shifts away from the federal charter, but some state banking  departments\u2019 budgets and workloads could face reductions if large state  banks changed to the federal charter.", "Our work identified three general measures that, while not necessarily  exhaustive of all potential measures, could help address state officials\u2019  concerns about protecting consumers of national banks and operating  subsidiaries.

The third  measure, in contrast to the first two, would not raise complex issues such  as the potential need to amend the National Bank Act. Rather, it would  require OCC to clarify the characteristics of state consumer protection  laws that would make them subject to federal preemption. We recognize  the impracticality of specifying precisely which provisions of state laws  are, or are not, preempted, and acknowledge that some uncertainty may  always exist. Nevertheless, we believe that an OCC outreach effort to  describe in more detail which characteristics of state consumer protection  laws would make them subject to preemption could help state officials  better understand the effect of the rules and help allay their concerns.

OCC commented that the preemption rules provided  clarification regarding the types of state laws listed in the regulations, and  noted that recent court decisions reflect a growing judicial consensus  about uniform federal standards that form the core of the national banking  system. OCC agreed with our observation that it may be impractical to  specify precisely which provisions of state laws are, or are not, preempted.

Preemption may be either  express\u2014where Congress specifically states in a statute that the statute  preempts state law\u2014or implied in a statute\u2019s structure and purpose.  Implied preemption occurs through either \u201cfield preemption\u201d or \u201cconflict  preemption.\u201d Field preemption occurs when Congress (1) has established a  scheme of federal regulation so pervasive that there is no room left for  states to supplement it or (2) has enacted a statute that touches a field in  which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be  assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject. In  contrast, conflict preemption occurs when a state law actually conflicts  with federal law. To determine whether a conflict exists, courts consider  whether compliance with both federal and state law is a physical  impossibility or whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the  accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of  Congress. Despite these separate analytical approaches, in practice the  differences between the two are not always exclusive or distinct. Rather, as  a practical matter, there can be a substantial overlap between the  categories, with courts using a similar analysis to address field and conflict  preemption.", "Even though field preemption and conflict preemption are not mutually  exclusive concepts, the Supreme Court and federal courts traditionally  have applied the conflict analysis to determine preemption questions  arising under the National Bank Act. Supreme Court and other federal  court cases addressing preemption under the act have been decided on the  basis of whether a conflict exists between the federal law and a state law. It  is well settled that with respect to national banks, the National Bank Act  preempts a state law that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and  execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Critics of the  bank activities rule asserted that (1) the controlling Supreme Court  precedent for finding this type of conflict preemption under the National  Bank Act is set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Barnett Bank of  Marion County v. Nelson and (2) the Barnett Bank decision sets a  standard for preemption that is stricter than the one applied by OCC, so  that under that standard fewer state laws would be preempted.", "In defining the pre-emptive scope of statutes and regulations granting a power to national  banks, these  cases take the view that normally Congress would not want  States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly  granted. To say this is not to deprive States of the power to regulate national banks, where  (unlike here) doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank\u2019s  exercise of its powers.", "Several critics of the bank activities rule interpret this passage to mean that  state law applies to national banks if the law does not \u201cprevent or  significantly interfere with\u201d the banks\u2019 ability to engage in activities  authorized by the National Bank Act. They said that, in the Barnett  decision, the Supreme Court clarified its earlier articulations of conflict  preemption under the National Bank Act and that this standard tolerates  state regulation of national banks to a greater extent than OCC\u2019s \u201cobstruct,  impair or condition\u201d test. According to this argument, state law governs a  national bank\u2019s exercise of its federally granted powers unless applying the  law would at least significantly interfere with the bank\u2019s ability to engage in  banking. OCC interprets the Barnett language to be one of many ways in  which the Supreme Court has articulated the standard for preemption  under the National Bank Act. In the preamble accompanying publication  of the final bank activities rule, OCC explained that its articulation of the  standard does not differ in substance from the language used in Barnett or  any other Supreme Court test for preemption under the National Bank Act,  stating that \u201che variety of formulations quoted by the Court, . . . defeats  any suggestion that any one phrase constitutes the exclusive standard for  preemption.\u201d", "According to some of the sources we consulted, primarily state regulators  and consumer groups, under the Barnett decision the application of state  laws to national bank activities can be consistent with the National Bank  Act. Referring to the rule that state law is preempted when applying it  would create \u201can obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and  objectives of Congress,\u201d one legal individual asserted that since at least the  early twentieth century it has been an objective of Congress to provide for  state regulation of banking activities regardless of whether a bank has a  federal or state charter. The individual described this objective as a  congressionally established \u201ccompetitive equilibrium\u201d within the U.S.  banking system. According to this perspective, allowing a state law to  govern a national bank\u2019s exercise of its federally granted powers would be  consistent with the purposes and objectives of Congress.", "In support of this position, several state officials and consumer groups we  interviewed referred to a provision of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking  and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Interstate Banking Act). In that  legislation, Congress specified that host state laws regarding community  reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and the establishment of  intrastate branches apply to branches of out-of-state national banks except  when, among other things, federal law preempts their application to a  national bank. In the conference report accompanying the legislation, the  conferees stated that preemption determinations made by the federal  banking agencies through opinion letters and interpretive regulations \u201cplay  an important role in maintaining the balance of Federal and State law under  the dual banking system.\u201d The conference report did not discuss how  preemption determinations affect the dual banking system. Instead, the  discussion referred to state interests in protecting individuals, businesses  and communities in their dealings with depository institutions. However,  some parties we interviewed maintained that the Interstate Banking Act  and its legislative history show that Congress intends states to have a role  in regulating national bank activities and that this relationship is a feature  of the dual banking system.", "Several individuals and industry participants we interviewed said that,  while Congress may not have prohibited some state regulation of national  banks, Congress consistently has endorsed the concept that state laws do  not apply to national banking when those laws are inconsistent with federal  law. This, they said, is because Congress established the national bank  system to be separate from state banking systems. According to this view,  the concept of a dual banking system does not contemplate state regulation  of national banks, but recognizes that states have authority to regulate the  banks they charter.", "Those sharing this perspective, including OCC representatives, referred to  various authorities to demonstrate that Congress established the national  bank system to be independent of state regulation, except to the extent  provided by federal law. They relied primarily on Supreme Court decisions  that referred to the National Bank Act and its legislative history as an  expression of Congress\u2019 intent to have a national charter separate from  state regulation. For example, in one of those decisions the Supreme  Court indicated that the National Bank Act does not contemplate state  regulation as a component of the national bank regulatory system.  Describing national banks as \u201cfederal instrumentalities,\u201d the Supreme  Court concluded that a state law was preempted under the National Bank  Act because, among other things, Congress had not expressed its intent  that a federally authorized national bank activity be subject to local  restrictions. In that decision, the Supreme Court held that the National  Bank Act preempted a state law forbidding national banks from using  \u201csaving\u201d or \u201csavings\u201d in their names or advertising. The Supreme Court said  that it found \u201cno indication that Congress intended to make this phase of  national banking subject to local restrictions, as it has done by express  language in several other instances.\u201d", "Several individuals, including OCC representatives, also said that even if  Congress, in the 1994 Interstate Banking Act, contemplated the potential  application of state laws to national bank activities, Congress clearly did  not intend state laws to apply if they conflict with federal law. They said  that, although the Interstate Banking Act demonstrates Congress\u2019 belief  that states have an interest in how national banks conduct their activities in  the four areas specified in the act, neither the act nor its legislative history  suggest that state laws in those four areas override federal preemption. In  their view, Congress\u2019 recognition that state laws are subject to preemption  signifies that Congress did not intend the application of state laws covering  those four areas to be a purpose or objective of national bank regulation  when such state laws conflict with federal law.", "The general rule governing preemption under the National Bank Act is that state law applies  to national banks unless that law conflicts with federal law, unduly burdens the operations  of national banks, or interferes with the objectives of the national banking system. (citations  omitted).", "In addition to disagreement over the regulatory objectives of the National  Bank Act, we also encountered differences of opinion over the scope of the  preemption rules. Some individuals we interviewed asserted that, despite  OCC\u2019s invocation of the conflict preemption standard, in fact OCC has  preempted the field of national bank regulation. That is, under OCC\u2019s test,  there is no room for state law in the regulation of the business activities of  national banks because those activities are solely a matter of federal law.  OCC, on the other hand, maintains that it applies the conflict preemption  standard with the objective of enabling national banks to operate to the full  extent of their powers under federal law \u201cwithout interference from  inconsistent state laws.\u201d As discussed previously, courts sometimes apply  field and conflict preemption analyses interchangeably. To date, however,  federal courts have recognized that OCC preemption determinations are  based on an analysis of whether a conflict exists between federal and state  law. Courts addressing the preemption regulations have not questioned  OCC\u2019s determination that conflict between state and federal laws is the  predicate for the preemption rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Breadth of the Preemption Lists in the Bank Activities Rule", "paragraphs": ["In the bank activities rule, OCC explained that state laws concerning the  subjects listed as preempted already had been preempted, either by OCC  administrative determinations, or by federal court decisions or precedents  applicable to federal thrifts. However, some of the subjects listed as  preempted have not been specifically addressed in precedents applying the  National Bank Act. Rather, information from OCC shows that some  subjects of state law were included on the preemption lists because they  had been preempted by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). In issuing  the bank activities rule, OCC concluded that with respect to the  applicability of state law, Congress used the same scheme for both national  banks and federally chartered thrifts under the Home Owners Loan Act  (HOLA). Opponents of the bank activities rule criticized this approach.  They questioned the applicability of OTS precedents to preemption under  the National Bank Act, asserting that Congress did not intend HOLA and  the National Bank Act to have identical preemptive effects. In addition,  several state officials and consumer groups said that the terms OCC used to  describe preempted subjects of state law are too broad.", "Those questioning OCC\u2019s reliance on OTS regulations asserted that  preemption under the National Bank Act is not as expansive as it is under  HOLA, and thus OCC wrongly concluded that state laws preempted under  HOLA also are preempted under the National Bank Act. They maintained  that the Supreme Court\u2019s description of OTS\u2019 preemptive authority  recognizes the broad preemptive impact of HOLA, which some federal  courts have characterized as field preemption. Critics of the bank  activities rule said that, because preemption under the National Bank Act is  conflict-based, it calls for an analysis of whether a state law covering an  OTS-preempted subject conflicts with the National Bank Act. They  maintained that OTS, using a field preemption analysis, would not have  considered whether a conflict exists. They asserted that the National Bank  Act, unlike HOLA, contemplates that states have a role in regulating  activities of national banks, and particularly those of national bank  operating subsidiaries, which typically are formed under state laws  governing the establishment of business entities. According to OCC, for  purposes of the bank activities rule labeling preemption as either \u201cfield  preemption\u201d or \u201cconflict based\u201d is \u201clargely immaterial to whether a state  law is preempted under the National Bank Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Aspects of the Preemption Rulemaking", "paragraphs": ["State representatives, consumer groups, and others challenged the bank  activities rule with respect to real estate lending. Referring to the grant of  real estate lending powers in the National Bank Act and past versions of  OCC\u2019s real estate lending rule, these individuals asserted that in the bank  activities rule OCC broadened the scope of preemption beyond what  Congress intends. One argument was based on the provision in the  National Bank Act that authorizes national banks to make real estate loans.  The provision permits national banks to conduct real estate lending  \u201csubject to section 1828(o) of this title (12 U.S. Code) and such restrictions  and requirements as the Comptroller of the Currency may prescribe by  regulation or order.\u201d Section 1828(o) requires the federal banking  agencies to have uniform regulations prescribing standards for real estate  loans. The standards include a requirement that lenders comply with \u201call  real estate related laws and regulations.\u201d Some individuals we interviewed  said that this standard means that the same real estate lending laws must  apply to all federally insured depository institutions and that, because state  laws apply to one set of institutions\u2014specifically state banks\u2014 those same  laws apply to national banks.", "Opponents also argued that OCC, by broadening the scope of preemption  for real estate lending, acted contrary to its previous determinations of  limited preemption for this activity. Before the bank activities rule was  issued, OCC\u2019s regulations specifically preempted state law with respect to  only five aspects of real estate lending. In interpretive letters describing  the preemptive effect of the rule, OCC officials sometimes stated that its  purpose was to preempt only five categories of state law restrictions on  national bank real estate lending, and that \u201ct was not the intention of  , however, to preempt all state regulation of real estate lending.\u201d  OCC stated that the rule clarified the \u201climited scope\u201d of preemption with  respect to real estate lending, thus \u201cany state regulations outside of the five  areas cited continue to apply to national banks, unless preempted by other  regulation.\u201d OCC maintained this position while applying the same  preemption standard it applied in the bank activities rule.", "Critics of the bank activities rule asserted that OCC\u2019s past statements were  correctly based on the conclusion that the National Bank Act has a limited  preemptive effect with respect to real estate lending and that OCC has not  adequately justified its new, contrary interpretation. According to OCC, the  substance of the bank activities rule is not new; it reiterates preemption  determinations that had been made before the rule was promulgated.  Therefore, the rule does not represent a change in OCC\u2019s application of  preemption principles with respect to real estate lending. Moreover, OCC  revised the rule in 1995 to say that OCC would apply principles of federal  preemption to state laws concerning aspects of national bank real estate  lending not listed in the regulation. OCC had been following this approach  in its interpretive letters on preemption since at least 1985.", "Some critics of the bank activities rule also challenged preemption with  respect to deposit-taking, which is one of the four categories of bank  activity set forth in the bank activities rule. They asserted that (1) deposits  are personal property and deposit accounts are contracts between the  depositor and the bank and (2) Congress did not intend the National Bank  Act to supersede state property and contract laws. The bank activities rule  provides that state laws on the subjects of contracts and the acquisition  and transfer of property are not inconsistent with national bank powers  and apply to national banks \u201cto the extent that they only incidentally affect  the exercise\u201d of the bank\u2019s powers. The disagreement with OCC\u2019s  preemption concerning deposit-taking focuses on whether a particular  state law that could be preempted (because it relates to deposit-taking)  might not be preempted (because it is a state contract or property law). We  found one case in which a California state court held that a state law  relating to deposit taking was not preempted because, among other things,  the court concluded it was a law governing contracts having only an  incidental effect on the bank\u2019s deposit-taking.

These disagreements arise mainly from the  contention that OCC has improperly interpreted the status of operating  subsidiaries under the National Bank Act.", "Although a national bank operating subsidiary typically is formed under  state business association laws, under OCC\u2019s interpretation of the National  Bank Act the entity exists only as a means through which national banks  may conduct federally authorized banking activities. This is because OCC  permits national banks to have operating subsidiaries on the theory that  conducting business through an operating subsidiary is an activity  permitted by the National Bank Act.

To illustrate this point, we calculated the price per  million dollars in assets for the largest possible total asset size within each  assessment range (see table 2).", "For example, table 2 shows that a national bank with about $2 million in  total assets would pay about $2,500 per million dollars of assets for  supervision, while the price of supervision for a national bank of about $2  billion is less than $100 per million dollars of assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mergers and Consolidations Result in Less Revenue for OCC", "paragraphs": ["OCC\u2019s assessment formula prices supervision for merged national banks at  a rate less than that of individual national banks with equivalent total  assets.

In all cases, OCC received less revenue in  assessments after the merger occurred, compared with individual  assessments prior to the merger. Table 3 shows the asset amounts of the  banks in one of our examples and the effect of OCC\u2019s formula. In this  example, the impact is a change in OCC\u2019s budget that decreases assessment  revenue by about $76,500.", "An OCC official acknowledged that the regressive nature of its assessment  formula could reduce the assessment paid by merged banks compared with  individual bank assessments prior to a merger. However, the official stated  that costs associated with supervising merged banks were dependent on  specific characteristics of the merged bank. For example, if a national bank  located in California merged with a national bank located in New York,  OCC may need to continue to maintain bicoastal bank examination teams.  In this case, assessments would decrease, but costs would remain the  same. In most cases however, over time, mergers of roughly equal-sized  banks would realize savings and other synergies that do not require extra  resources. For example, certain fixed costs could be spread across the  merged banks; thus, as the bank\u2019s assets grow larger, average costs  generally decrease."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How Selected Federal Financial Industry Regulators Are Funded", "paragraphs": ["FDIC is to contribute to the stability of and public confidence in  the nation\u2019s financial system by insuring deposits, examining  and supervising financial institutions, and managing  receiverships.
