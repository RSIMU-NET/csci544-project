In 2010, in response to these and other challenges, DOT established the FAAC to develop a manageable, actionable list of recommendations for DOT. In April 2011, the FAAC released a report outlining 23 recommendations in five areas: environment, financing, competitiveness and viability, labor and workforce, and safety.", "GAO was asked to review the status of DOT's efforts to implement the FAAC recommendations.

On November 12, 2009, the  Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) convened an  Aviation Summit to gather industry and expert opinion on actions that  would promote future success of the aviation industry. The discussion  centered on five areas: environment, financing, competitiveness and  viability, labor and workforce, and safety. With these areas in mind,  Secretary Ray LaHood chartered the Future of Aviation Advisory  Committee (FAAC) on April 16, 2010, to develop a manageable,  actionable list of recommendations in each of these five areas for DOT.  The FAAC included 19 members\u20141 government official and 18 non- government representatives\u2014from a cross-section of stakeholders, such  as air carriers, airports, airline labor unions, manufacturers, and  representatives from the finance community, academia, and passenger  interests. On April 11, 2011, the FAAC issued a final report listing 23  recommendations that the FAAC identified as critical to the future of the  U.S. aviation industry.", "You asked us to review the status of DOT\u2019s efforts to implement the  FAAC recommendations. We examined 10 of the FAAC\u2019s 23  recommendations to determine (1) DOT\u2019s progress in addressing the  selected recommendations and any further planned actions; (2) the FAAC  members\u2019 perspectives on the extent to which DOT\u2019s actions address  these recommendations; and (3) the challenges, if any, that DOT faces in  addressing the recommendations. The 10 selected recommendations  cover each of the 5 areas reviewed by the FAAC and allowed us to  leverage ongoing or recently completed GAO work. Given that the 10  recommendations are directed toward specific, discrete actions, our  statements regarding DOT\u2019s progress in addressing the  recommendations are specific to each recommendation and cannot be  generalized to assess DOT\u2019s overall progress across all 23 FAAC  recommendations. We did not analyze the validity of the commission\u2019s  recommendations, and our work does not take a position on, or represent  an endorsement of, the recommendations. See table 1 for a list of the  recommendations we reviewed.", "To determine DOT\u2019s progress and challenges in addressing the selected  recommendations, we reviewed relevant GAO and DOT Office of  Inspector General reports, agency documents, including plans for  addressing the recommendations, DOT and Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) documentation of actions taken, and DOT\u2019s website  for tracking progress on the committee\u2019s recommendations. We also  reviewed legislation to determine the extent to which it affected or  addressed the recommendations. In addition, we interviewed DOT and  FAA officials about the steps they have taken to address the  recommendations and any challenges they have faced in implementing  the recommendations. We also interviewed 17 of the 18 FAAC non- government members to obtain their perspectives on the extent to which  DOT\u2019s actions addressed the recommendations from the subcommittees  on which they served, any challenges DOT faces in addressing the  recommendations, and what, if any, additional actions DOT should take to  address the recommendations. Although DOT is not required to  implement any of the FAAC\u2019s recommendations, we solicited the  committee members\u2019 perspective on whether DOT should continue  monitoring and reporting on its progress in addressing the  recommendations. A list of the FAAC members we interviewed is  available in appendix II.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 through July  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. aerospace industry contributes to the nation\u2019s economic health  and national security. The industry\u2019s wide-ranging activities\u2014including  aircraft manufacturing and commercial aviation\u2014make it a major  contributor to U.S. economic growth. DOT and the FAA (an administration  of DOT) each play a policy and regulatory role in aviation, with DOT  involved in consumer and economic issues, such as licensing airlines and  reviewing applications for antitrust immunity between airlines, and FAA\u2019s  overseeing the safety of civil aviation. To inform these efforts, various  administrations and Congresses have periodically established  committees or commissions comprised of external stakeholders to  provide recommendations for DOT and FAA, as well as other agencies  involved in aviation, to consider in their implementation of aviation policy.  For example, in 1996, President Clinton established the White House  Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, which provided 57  recommendations in the areas of safety, air traffic control, security, and  accident response. In 2001, Congress established the Commission on the  Future of the United States Aerospace Industry to study issues  associated with the future of this industry in the global economy, and to  recommend potential actions by the federal government to support the  maintenance of a robust aerospace industry in the 21st century.", "In contrast to these two efforts, the FAAC was established as a federal  advisory committee, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act  (FACA). Federal advisory committees exist throughout the executive  branch of the federal government, providing input and advice to agencies  in a variety of ways, such as preparing reports and developing  recommendations. GAO has noted that advisory committees can be  effective tools for agencies to gather input on topics of interest by  informing agency leaders about issues of importance to the agencies\u2019  missions, consolidating input from multiple sources, and providing input at  a relatively low cost. While an advisory group\u2019s input or  recommendations may form the basis for a federal agency\u2019s decisions or  policies, other factors may play a role in determining what action an  agency ultimately takes. Because such groups are by design advisory,  agencies are not required to implement their advice or recommendations.", "On April 16, 2010, Secretary Ray LaHood chartered the FAAC for a one- year term and asked the DOT Assistant Secretary for Aviation and  International Affairs to lead the effort. The FAAC was directed to provide  information, advice, and recommendations to the Secretary on ensuring  the competitiveness of the U.S. aviation industry and its capability to  address the evolving transportation needs, challenges, and opportunities  of the global economy. The FAAC was comprised of a cross-section of  aviation stakeholders. During its first meeting, the Secretary asked the  FAAC to develop consensus-based recommendations that could be acted  upon immediately or in the near future, with tangible results. He also  stated that the FAAC should remain cognizant of the tools that DOT and  FAA could use to implement the recommendations, such as the federal  rulemaking process, proposing legislation to Congress, and  recommending compliance measures for industry. The FAAC established  subcommittees to develop recommendations in the five areas specified in  the FAAC charter: environment, financing, competitiveness and viability,  labor and workforce, and safety. The subcommittees met multiple times  over the course of 2010, and the full FAAC briefed the Secretary on its 23  recommendations on December 15, 2010, with a final report outlining the  recommendations and their underlying rationale released on April 11,  2011.", "The Secretary publicly emphasized that the FAAC recommendations  would not \u201csit on a shelf,\u201d and DOT established a process to implement  the recommendations. DOT officials stated that the Office of Aviation and  International Affairs has led DOT\u2019s work on addressing the FAAC  recommendations and has provided periodic updates to FAAC members.  Each recommendation was assigned to an \u201cowner\u201d\u2014DOT or FAA staff\u2014 some of whom were already conducting work relevant to the  recommendation. DOT officials also noted that some of the  recommendations with multiple subactions have more than one owner.  DOT staff collaborated with recommendation owners to create a \u201csmart  sheet\u201d for addressing each FAAC recommendation. This document  provided information on interim goals, or actions that must occur to reach  the final goal; beneficiaries and allies of the recommendation; and  potential challenges. The owners were not required to update these  documents as time progressed. DOT officials stated that for about a year  after the FAAC report was released, DOT\u2019s Office of Aviation and  International Affairs had regular status meetings with the recommendation  owners to ascertain their progress, and recommendation owners then  reported progress periodically to DOT officials. DOT periodically updates  a website on the status of the FAAC recommendations. During the course  of our review, we noted that some of the recommendations had not been  updated for over one year; however, DOT updated the status of all of the  recommendations on its website in June 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT and FAA Officials Believe That Seven of the Selected Recommendations Are Addressed and That Three Are In Progress", "paragraphs": ["DOT and FAA have taken actions on the 10 FAAC recommendations we  reviewed. DOT and FAA officials noted that 3 of the 10 recommendations  we reviewed\u2014sustainable alternative fuels, global competitiveness, and a  harmonized approach to carbon dioxide emission reductions\u2014continue to  be addressed as part of long-term efforts. For example, DOT officials  noted that addressing the global competitiveness recommendation is tied  to long-term policy efforts with no timetable for conclusion, such as  negotiating agreements with other countries to reduce the barriers for  U.S. carriers interested in serving markets in those countries. While  officials stated that DOT and FAA have addressed the other seven  recommendations, they highlighted ongoing work on issues related to  some of these recommendations. For example, FAA officials noted they  have addressed the recommendation to accelerate investment and  installation of NextGen equipment on aircraft because they are working to  develop a program to provide financial incentives and operational benefits  to operators that install NextGen equipment early. However, the officials  added that they are still working to determine what the program will entail,  including soliciting input from aircraft operators and potential private  partners to determine how to establish an incentive program that  operators want to participate in. They also noted that the appropriations  requirements for a credit program have not yet been met.

See table 2 for a summary of the  recommendations as well as their status according to DOT and the FAAC  subcommittee members we interviewed.", "Similar to DOT and FAA officials, FAAC members stated that some  recommendations may not be fully addressed due to the  recommendation\u2019s being linked to ongoing or long-term efforts. For  example, FAAC members noted that DOT and FAA efforts to address the  sustainable alternative fuels recommendation require collaborating across  many agencies, such as the Department of Energy (DOE), the United  States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), and a continued, long-term federal focus. In  some cases, FAAC members stated that DOT and FAA should continue  their current efforts to address the recommendations; but some FAAC  members felt that DOT and FAA should take additional actions to address  certain recommendations. For example, five of the six finance FAAC  subcommittee members stated that the recommendation to fund  accelerated NextGen equipage of aircraft was not addressed, and two  suggested that the department take additional steps to collaborate with  industry to design an incentive program and develop a stronger business  case for airlines to invest in equipping early. Conversely, five of the seven  subcommittee members believe that the department\u2019s actions addressed  the recommendation on science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics (STEM) education.

On the other hand, two FAAC members  stated that DOT should continue reporting only on certain  recommendations, such as recommendations that would be implemented  over the long term or recommendations it has not addressed. Another  FAAC member stated that DOT and FAA should ensure that efforts to  address the recommendations become ingrained into the daily work of  agency staff, rather than DOT\u2019s and FAA\u2019s viewing them as a separate  effort. The remaining FAAC member stated that DOT should reassess  whether it makes sense to continue or close out the effort, adding that as  time passes, the recommendations may become irrelevant or unlikely to  be addressed. DOT officials told us that for ongoing recommendations,  they will continue work on these recommendations and are determining  the extent to which it will continue reporting on the status of the  recommendations.

Specifically,  DOT and FAA officials or FAAC members identified resource constraints,  such as limited funding for programs or staff, as a challenge in  implementing 6 of the 10 FAAC recommendations that we reviewed.  These 6 include the recommendations pertaining to sustainable fuels,  carbon dioxide emission reductions, reviewing eligibility criteria for the  Airport Improvement and Passenger Facility Charge Programs, STEM  education, predictive safety risk-discovery capability, and prioritizing  rulemaking. Agency officials and committee members also explained how  constrained resources might affect progress in addressing these  recommendations. For example, when discussing the recommendation  that DOT and FAA establish a harmonized approach for aviation carbon  dioxide emission reductions, FAA officials told us that resource  constraints could hamper their ability to conduct necessary research and  participate in international forums designed to foster discussion on  harmonized regulatory approaches. However, DOT and FAA officials also  outlined their methods for operating within these constraints. For  example, while noting that funding and limited resources pose challenges  to maintaining long-term STEM efforts, officials stated that the agencies  work to leverage resources through stakeholder partnerships. In addition,  DOT and FAA officials or FAAC members identified challenges in  collaborating with and gaining the consensus of a number of stakeholders  for four recommendations, those related to sustainable fuels, carbon  dioxide emission reductions, global competitiveness, and STEM  education. These recommendations range in the type of involvement  needed both within and outside DOT and FAA. For example, six of the  seven FAAC labor and workforce subcommittee members we interviewed  recognized DOT\u2019s ongoing efforts on STEM issues require that DOT  maintain the participation of outside groups, such as other agencies,  industry, and other stakeholders.", "However, each recommendation also had unique challenges. For  example, with respect to the recommendation that the agencies ensure  that safety data submitted by air carriers and other stakeholders is  protected from public disclosure, FAAC members noted that despite legal  protections provided by recent legislation, industry concerns remain  regarding the disclosure of safety data during legal proceedings. FAA  officials have recognized that such concerns could limit the  implementation of FAA efforts to promote safety management systems,  which depend upon the open sharing of safety information among  aviation stakeholders. In addition, DOT and FAA officials noted that in  some cases they took actions to address the recommendation, but factors  beyond DOT\u2019s control, such as the need for legislative action, affected  DOT\u2019s ability to fully implement the recommendation. For example, while  the agency supported a provision that would have extended the  alternative minimum tax exemption for all private activity bonds, including  airport private-activity bonds\u2014as recommended by the FAAC\u2014this  provision did not become law. Agency officials view this recommendation  as addressed since any further action would require legislative action,  and there is not currently a legislative vehicle for this provision.", "Section 1 of this report includes the 10 recommendations in our review,  detailed discussions of DOT and FAA completed or planned actions to  address each of the 10 FAAC recommendations, FAAC members\u2019  assessment of DOT and FAA progress, and challenges to implementing  each recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided DOT with a draft of this report for their review and comment.

One subcommittee member stated that while DOT or  FAA may not have the statutory authority to provide incentives to  accelerate development and deployment, they should explore their  authority to support additional deployment activities. In our discussions  with FAA officials on this issue, they stated that FAA has not sought direct  authority for these activities because they believe that it is a wiser use of  federal resources to use existing federal support mechanisms that are  funded by USDA and DOE. Another subcommittee member stated that  more overall federal funding is needed for research on conversion  technology and getting through the fuel approval process, and that the  research projects that receive federal funding should be focused  specifically on producing the data needed for fuel approval, rather than  addressing broader issues.
