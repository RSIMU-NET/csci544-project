Community hospitals generally have no restrictions on whom they can serve. A hospital\u2019s target population is limited primarily by the facility\u2019s capabilities and business decisions. In contrast, VA hospitals have historically been limited to treating mainly veterans\u2014adult males. Recent eligibility and contracting reform legislation, as discussed below, has broadened the types of patients VA hospitals may treat.", "Whom they can buy care from and sell care to. Community hospitals have few restrictions on their ability to contract to buy or sell patient care or nonpatient care services. Historically, VA facilities have been limited primarily to sharing health care services with other federal hospitals and with their medical school affiliates. Recent legislation has removed most restrictions on VA contracting.", "Who pays for the care provided. Most community hospital revenue comes from payments for patients sponsored by public payers (primarily Medicare and Medicaid) and private health insurers. Small portions also come directly from patients and state and local governments as operating subsidies. VA hospitals receive funding through an annual appropriation process. VA receives virtually no funding through Medicare and Medicaid and before August 1997 returned recoveries from private health insurance (other than a portion needed to cover the cost of operating the recovery program) to the general fund in the Department of the Treasury. Although VA facilities relied almost entirely on appropriated funds, they were allowed to retain certain payments resulting from sale of health care resources to the Department of Defense (DOD), other federal facilities, and certain other providers.", "In addition, although most VA hospitals, like their community counterparts, focus on short-term acute care services, other VA hospitals focus more on psychiatric and long-term care services. Under the AHA definitions, hospitals that primarily focus on psychiatric care, long-term care, or specialty services, even if they also provide some short-term care, are considered noncommunity hospitals. Systemwide, over 50 percent of VA\u2019s 50,787 operating beds in fiscal year 1995 were devoted to long-term care (intermediate medicine), specialized services (rehabilitation of the blind, treatment of spinal cord injuries, and rehabilitation medicine), or psychiatric care (see fig. 1.3). About 18 percent of VA hospitals provide mainly psychiatric care.", "In administering the veterans\u2019 health benefits program authorized under title 38 of the U.S. Code, some of VA\u2019s responsibilities are like those of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in administering Medicare benefits and like those of private health insurance companies in administering health insurance policies. For example, VA is responsible for determining under the statute (1) which benefits veterans are eligible to receive, (2) whether and how much veterans must contribute toward the cost of their care, and (3) where veterans may obtain covered services (in other words, whether they must use VA-operated facilities or may obtain needed services from other providers at VA expense). Similarly, VA, like HCFA and private insurers, is responsible for ensuring that the health care benefits provided to its beneficiaries\u2014veterans\u2014are (1) medically necessary and (2) provided in the most appropriate care setting whether that is a hospital, nursing home, or outpatient clinic.", "In operating a health care delivery program, VA\u2019s role is like that of the major private-sector health care delivery networks as operated by Kaiser Permanente.

Private-sector hospitals are facing increased pressures from both private insurers and public health benefits programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to eliminate inappropriate admissions and reduce hospital lengths of stay. For example, private health insurers increasingly use preadmission screening to ensure the medical necessity of hospital admissions and set limits on approved lengths of stay.

Next, we developed estimates of additional excess capacity under differing assumptions about the amount of medically unnecessary care being provided.

Third, we conducted an extensive literature search using Healthstar, Econlit, and other search engines to identify pertinent literature on the list of specific actions.

With such a limited inpatient surgical workload, VA could discontinue the inpatient programs and either refer veterans to other VA facilities or use its new contracting authority to purchase care from community hospitals closer to the veterans\u2019 homes. Referring veterans to other VA hospitals could help build workload at those facilities but would probably make health care less accessible for veterans (except in those places where two or more VA medical centers were in close proximity such as in Chicago, Boston, and Pittsburgh).

The OIG also found, however, that the wide variation in reporting of the number of patients treated in substance abuse treatment programs in the VA databases prevents VHA officials from really knowing the impact of these conversions to outpatient treatment on access to care for homeless and other economically disadvantaged veterans.", "The OIG also identified needed improvements in (1) methods for identifying homeless veterans seeking treatment in both VA and community-based substance abuse treatment programs; (2) efforts to ensure that halfway house beds are available for veterans needing such aftercare; and (3) medical record documentation to show that VA employees discussed the ability of veterans, particularly homeless or economically disadvantaged veterans, to arrange transportation to outpatient substance abuse treatment.", "The OIG found transportation to be a major barrier to outpatient substance abuse treatment, particularly in small urban areas. A third of the patients from small urban areas interviewed by the OIG indicated that inadequate transportation systems limited patients\u2019 access to outpatient care. The OIG reviewed the medical records of 71 homeless patients discharged from inpatient substance abuse treatment programs and found that 50 records had no information to show that program officials had discussed transportation issues with the veterans.", "In response to the OIG report, VHA identified actions to strengthen the substance abuse program, including establishing a committee to discuss possible solutions to the transportation problem. Because these actions are in the planning stage, it is not clear what their effect will be on lessening the impact of VA\u2019s shift of substance abuse treatment to outpatient settings on access to care for homeless veterans.", "Although the OIG has evaluated VA\u2019s efforts to shift substance abuse treatment from inpatient to outpatient settings and corrective actions are planned or under way, less is known about the effects of other efforts to shift care to outpatient settings. For example, a large percentage of homeless veterans suffer from serious mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a result, such veterans may face the same transportation barriers as veterans with substance abuse problems in accessing outpatient mental health care, for example, PTSD treatment.

Hospitals were paid their actual costs as long as they were reasonable, related to patient care, and not in excess of maximum allowable amounts established by the program. This method encouraged hospitals to spend more and keep patients in the hospital longer because the more they spent for services, the larger their reimbursement would be.

Hospitals are paid a predetermined amount for each Medicare discharge. Acute care patients are placed in 1 of over 400 diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs, on the basis of their principal diagnoses, the presence of complicating conditions, whether certain procedures were performed, and their age. In determining the payment amount, HHS basically calculates the average cost of treating Medicare patients in each DRG using historical hospital cost data and then adjusts the PPS rates for factors such as differences in area wages, teaching activity, and care to the poor.", "Hospitals whose average costs are lower than the PPS rates may keep all of the difference; hospitals whose costs are above these rates must absorb the loss. To reduce the risk to hospitals of costly cases, Medicare pays hospitals additional amounts for high-cost \u201coutliers.\u201d", "PPS drastically changed hospitals\u2019 financial incentives. Under the cost- reimbursement system, hospitals had an incentive to keep patients longer and provide more ancillary services because each day of care and service provided was reimbursed separately. Under PPS, hospitals have a financial incentive to limit lengths of stay and the number of ancillary services provided because payment is fixed without regard to these factors. Both the average length of hospital stay and the number of admissions to community hospitals declined after PPS was introduced.", "Although PPS was initially limited to payment for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, many other health care programs adopted similar payment methods. For example, the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) implemented a DRG-based PPS on October 1, 1987, to reduce government costs and provide an incentive for hospitals to reduce operating costs. Similarly, in 1991, 20 states reported using a DRG-based PPS under their Medicaid programs.", "Unlike community hospitals, whose revenues come mainly from third- party payments, VA hospitals do not depend on such payments.

Initially, VA planned to use RAM to measure and redistribute acute inpatient care resources, including all general medical, surgical, rehabilitation, neurological, and psychiatric services.", "In 1985, RAM was expanded to include outpatient and extended care services. Funds for outpatient care were allocated using an age-adjusted, capitation method with six price groups determined by the type and extent of utilization during a year. Extended care, including intermediate hospital care and nursing home care, was to be funded through a Resource Utilization Group (RUG) system. Similar to hospital DRGs, the RUG system classifies long-term care patients according to the amount of direct nursing that they require.", "Unlike Medicare\u2019s PPS\u2019 effects on community hospitals, however, RAM had little effect on VA hospitals\u2019 budgets. RAM showed that VA hospitals incurred differing costs for treating similar patients and provided for shifting significant amounts of resources among facilities to encourage more efficient operations. VA never fully implemented RAM, however, shifting few resources (less than 2 percent of the total dollars budgeted) among facilities.", "RAM was abandoned in 1990 because of concerns that medical centers were gaming the system to maximize resource allocations. Gaming involves medical centers performing work beyond their resources to justify additional resources in the future.

The financial incentives vary by type of HMO. For example, staff model HMOs provide services through salaried primary care physicians; such physicians do not directly benefit financially by limiting the services they provide. Other types of HMOs and managed care plans, however, provide physicians financial incentives through capitation to control (1) use of primary care services, (2) referrals to specialists, and (3) hospital admissions.", "Capitation payment mechanisms require primary care physicians or groups of physicians to accept a monthly designated amount as payment in full for each assigned enrollee, no matter how often during the month the physician or group of physicians provides services or how much the services cost.

After HCFA\u2019s interpretation of this and other benefit coverage requirements was struck down in a 1988 lawsuit (Duggan v. Bowen), Medicare coverage was further broadened. As a result of the lawsuit, HCFA revised its home health guidance to cover home health care that is part time or intermittent, enabling home health agencies to increase the frequency of visits. In addition, patients now qualify for skilled observation by a nurse or therapist if a reasonable possibility exists for complications or the need to change treatment. Moreover, the benefit now allows maintenance therapy, that is, therapy services required for the patient to simply maintain function. Previously, patients were eligible for therapy only if expected to show improvement from such services.", "These changes made Medicare home health care available to more beneficiaries for less acute conditions and for longer periods of time.

As discussed, the largest increases in home health visits did not occur during the 5 years following implementation of the PPS.

The ultimate effect of VERA on hospital operations, however, depends on several factors. First, how effective will VERA be in changing practice patterns absent the financial risk upon which both prospective payment and capitation are based? Unlike private-sector hospitals and health plans, VISNs do not have a contractual obligation to provide their users needed health care services. Theoretically, if a VISN runs out of funds, it may deny care to any veteran, including those with service-connected disabilities. By contrast, private insurers have a contractual obligation to provide their members the full range of health care services covered by the plan.", "Because implementation of VERA did not begin until April 1997 and resource shifts are being phased in over several years, little is known about how VISNs and individual facilities are reacting to both increased and decreased resource allocations and the potential effects, both positive and negative, on veterans\u2019 access to health care services.", "Determining the effect of VERA on VA hospitals\u2019 efficiency will be difficult because VISNs and individual facilities can and do shift costs to other programs such as the Medicare home health and hospice programs and the Medicaid nursing home program. In other words, increased costs in other programs may offset reductions in VA costs per patient served.", "Another reason why VERA\u2019s effects are uncertain relates to VISNs\u2019 decisions on allocating resources. If VISNs use VERA to provide veterans the same opportunity for VA-supported hospital care regardless of veterans\u2019 residence, then fewer funds will be available to support existing VA hospitals and more funds will be allocated to purchase care from community hospitals closer to veterans\u2019 homes. This is because about 89 percent of veterans live more than 5 miles from a VA hospital providing acute medical and surgical care, and many veterans\u2014given a choice between care in non-VA facilities close to their homes and more distant VA facilities\u2014with no difference in out-of-pocket costs, would most likely choose non-VA care.", "Although it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of VA\u2019s new preadmission screening and continuing stay review requirements, data from both the Washington, D.C., and Martinsburg, West Virginia, VA medical centers indicate that about 45 percent of acute inpatient admissions and about 60 percent of acute days of care (in both centers) did not meet standards for acuity or intensity of care.

Private-sector community hospitals generally do not get paid if they admit patients without the insurer\u2019s prior approval, except in an emergency. Under VA\u2019s preadmission certification program, however, neither the hospital nor the physician authorizing the admission incurs any direct financial penalty for admitting a patient whom the screening program determined did not need to be admitted.", "Even without giving hospitals and physicians a direct financial stake in admission decisions, preadmission screening and continuing stay reviews should somewhat affect nonacute admissions.

This authority could increase the use of VA hospitals if VA uses it to serve more nonveterans or decrease the use of VA hospitals if VA uses it to allow veterans, such as the new users attracted to the system through CBOCs, to use community hospitals closer to their homes.", "A third factor that could affect future demand for VA hospital care is delaying Medicare eligibility. As discussed, veterans tend to stop using or reduce their use of VA hospitals after they become eligible for Medicare. Thus, delaying eligibility for Medicare benefits could delay veterans\u2019 leaving the VA system. More importantly, VA could serve as an increasingly important source of health care coverage for veterans retiring before they qualified for Medicare. Many such veterans might not be able to continue coverage under their employer-provided health insurance, or such coverage might be prohibitively expensive.", "MSAs, authorized under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, are the fourth factor that could increase future demand for VA hospital care. Medicare- eligible veterans may have financial incentives to establish such accounts, enroll in the VA health care system, obtain essentially free care from VA, and then pocket the excess funds in the account. MSAs could, however, be structured to prevent people with such accounts from using other federal health benefits. The Balanced Budget Act permits the Secretary of HHS to apply rules that will ensure that such dual enrollment will not result in increased expenditures for the federal government. Veterans enrolling in MSAs would no longer be able to use both VA and Medicare services. About half of the Medicare-eligible veterans using VA services use both VA and Medicare services.", "Further changes in the private health insurance market could also affect future demand for VA hospital care. First, recently enacted legislation could make it easier for people to maintain their private health insurance when they lose or change jobs.

Two studies at individual VA facilities found that HMO enrollment ranged from 10 percent among veterans of all ages to about 25 percent among elderly veterans.", "Finally, the recent trend toward increased beneficiary cost sharing in managed care plans could provide financial incentives for veterans to obtain care from VA hospitals. One found that copayments for hospital stays rose from $4.50 a day in 1987 to $24.90 a day in 1993; for inpatient mental health care services, copayments increased from $3.39 to $14.51 per day.

To the extent that veteran users in some VISNs have poorer health than those in other VISNs, then higher hospital use can be expected, and it may not be reasonable to expect such VISNs to decrease utilization rates. Similarly, differences in the age of the veteran population can affect hospital use. Hospital use generally increases with population age; therefore, VISNs serving elderly veterans could be expected to have higher rates of hospital use. VA, however, in developing VERA, concluded that the higher hospital use in some VISNs could not be explained by differences in veterans\u2019 ages.", "Insurance use could also affect the extent of VA hospital use. Veterans with public or private insurance are much less likely to use VA hospital care than are the uninsured. Thus, variation in the rate of insurance coverage among VISNs could help explain variation in hospital usage. Similarly, the market penetration of managed care plans could help explain the lower hospital use in some VISNs. This is because veterans enrolled in managed care plans can generally obtain hospital care closer to their homes with low cost sharing through managed care plans.", "Finally, differences in medical practice may explain variation in hospital use. As previously discussed, hospital lengths of stay for short-term hospitalizations are generally longer in the Northeast than in the West. This could help explain the higher rate of hospital use in VISNs in the Middle Atlantic states.", "VERA and the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s 1997 performance measures for VISN directors, however, give conflicting views of the extent to which such variation is due to differences in efficiency rather than medical practice or health status. Under the performance measures, VA compared the VA acute bed-days of care per 1,000 users in each VISN with Medicare beds-days of care per 1,000 beneficiaries in the comparable census division. VA defined as fully successful performance reduced VA bed-days of care that matched local Medicare performance.", "Of the seven VISNs required to reduce acute bed-days of care by 20 percent or more to achieve fully successful performance, VERA designated four to receive additional resources. The VISN required to reduce acute bed-days of care the most\u201437 percent\u2014was VISN 19 (Denver), which VERA identified as needing a 6.6-percent increase in funding. Similarly, VISN 2 (Albany) and VISN 4 (Pittsburgh)\u2014whose acute care rates were already below the Medicare rate\u2014were found under VERA to be among the less efficient VISNs. Under VERA, VISN 2 (Albany) would absorb the second largest decrease in funding. Under the performance measures, however, it would be expected to absorb the funding decrease without reducing acute bed-days of care.", "Another performance measure that provides a conflicting view of VISN efficiency is reduced operating beds. Under this performance goal, fully successful performance is judged to be reduced operating beds to match the assigned targets. As was the case with days of care, however, the VISNs with the largest targeted reductions in operating beds are among those qualifying for the largest resource increases under VERA. Ten of the 11 VISNs expected to close 300 or more operating beds in fiscal year 1997 should, under VERA, receive increased resource allocations of up to 15 percent.

Under this approach, excess capacity is defined as the number of beds that would need to be eliminated to raise actual occupancy rates up to a prescribed efficient level. For example, if average occupancy were 60 percent and the target rate were 85 percent, 25 percent of beds would be excess. In fact, an 85-percent occupancy level is generally considered optimum. In other words, a hospital is not considered to have excess capacity until its average occupancy drops below 85 percent.", "Estimates of medically unnecessary days of care. Under this approach, a percentage of the days of care provided is assumed, on the basis of studies, to be medically unnecessary. A 1970s study used this approach and estimated that 264,000 community hospital beds were in excess. The study assumed that one-third of the days of care provided by community hospitals were medically unnecessary. Between 1980 and 1995, community hospital beds declined by about 115,000 beds mainly in response to actions taken to reduce medically unnecessary days of care. Estimates derived from this approach are often added to estimates of excess capacity derived through the first approach.", "Target beds per 1,000 population. Under this approach, excess capacity is the difference between operating beds and some target number of beds per 1,000 population. For example, the Institute of Medicine set a target to reduce the beds per 1,000 population from 4.4 to 4.0 beds in a 1976 report.Unlike the target occupancy rate approach, this approach can be used to predict future bed needs by basing the estimates on projected population.", "The use of target occupancy rates is the most conservative approach for estimating excess beds because it basically counts empty beds at the time of the study.

In addition, it assumes that current hospital utilization rates are appropriate, that is, that all admissions and lengths of stay are appropriate.", "Just as the use of target occupancy rates may understate the extent of excess beds, the other two approaches may overstate realistic reductions in excess beds.

Such referrals are necessary if community hospitals in Martinsburg or nearby cities such as Hagerstown, Maryland, cannot provide the services. But, for services available from community hospitals, referral to a distant VA medical center may create unnecessary hardships for veterans and their families.

For example, VA could reach agreements with community hospitals about the proliferation of high-technology equipment.

Veteran cost sharing provides less than 1 percent of the cost of providing VA-supported nursing home care. On the other hand, expanding the availability of nursing home care would help bridge the gap in health care coverage for elderly veterans.", "The second major issue concerning vertical integration is the extent to which CBOCs may generate new demand for VA hospital care. Many CBOCs are located far (often over 50 miles) from the nearest VA facility. CBOC physicians are expected to refer veterans needing specialized services or hospital care to a VA hospital. Distance from a VA hospital, however, significantly affects the likelihood that veterans will seek care from a VA facility. The rate at which veterans use VA hospitals declines significantly at distances of over 5 miles from a VA facility. Thus, the extent to which CBOCs serve veterans who have other health care options through public or private health insurance further reduces the likelihood of VA hospital use.", "Because VA\u2019s contracting authority did not expand until October 1996, it is too soon to determine its effect on demand for VA hospital care. Use of the authority to contract for hospital and specialized services from private-sector providers to improve veterans\u2019 access to hospital care could further reduce demand for VA hospital care. Our work on other countries\u2019 veterans health care systems found that use of veterans\u2019 hospitals declined once veterans gained access to community hospitals through national health insurance or changes in the veterans\u2019 program to authorize contract care.

Rural hospitals, in particular, have had to develop programs to cope with chronic shortages of medical personnel, and they have reportedly done so successfully.", "Clinical personnel are usually cross-trained within their general area of expertise to allow them to expand the scope of their practice. For example, a registered nurse normally working on general surgical cases might be cross-trained to assist with orthopedic surgery. Similarly, licensed practical nurses may be trained to assume certain duties traditionally performed by registered nurses.", "Cross-training allows hospitals to more efficiently use resources by expanding the number of clinical and nonclinical staff trained to perform a given task. For example, if nursing assistants are trained to perform nonpatient care duties, such as changing bed linens, they can substitute for housekeeping staff.", "The 1996 Patient Care Survey of the American Journal of Nursing, a national survey including responses from 7,560 nurses, reported that nurses are caring for more patients, have been cross-trained to assume more nursing responsibilities, and have substantially less time to provide all aspects of nursing care.", "In its December 1995 report, Critical Challenges: Revitalizing the Health Professions for the Twenty-First Century, the Pew Health Professions Commission recommended that team training and cross-professional education continue and expand.", "VA similarly supports cross-training and multi-skilling and, according to a VA official, VA facilities are using physician extenders and other allied health professionals. For example, the Acting Director of Surgical Services told us that VA started cross-training some technicians in intensive care, respiratory therapy, and laboratory services. Neither he nor other VA officials, however, could provide data on the extensiveness of cross- training in the VA system.", "In VA\u2019s Prescription for Change, the Under Secretary for Health described several actions to expand the use of cross-training and multi-skilling. First, under its goal of improving customer service, VA plans to establish new positions for multi-skilled caregivers as part of efforts to empower staff to plan and execute their work to best respond to patient needs. In addition, to help make VA an employer of choice, VA established a work group to examine cross-training, employee development, and other workforce issues. Finally, in March 1995, VA revised its directives on the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical pharmacists to better utilize such personnel. The revised guidance also established prescribing guidelines for these professions.", "VA\u2019s Office of Academic Affairs is also supporting cross-training through its Primary Care Education program and \u201cfirm\u201d system. VA officials told us that the programs emphasize team building among multidisciplinary staff rather than cross-training of staff to perform more than one job.", "VISN strategic plans generally support the need to enhance training of hospital personnel but focus more on retraining personnel to work in outpatient settings and in providing primary care.

But, with the shortage of registered nurses in the 1980s and increasing pressures to contain costs, community hospitals increasingly sought to develop lower cost alternatives. One such alternative is the use of specially trained nursing assistants, often referred to as nurse extenders, to assume many tasks normally performed by registered nurses. This reduces the need for higher paid nurses and allows registered nurses to use their advanced education and experience to enhance all patient care activities.", "Registered nurses remain pivotal in coordinating care in hospitals, sometimes as case managers. Nursing assistants\u2019 roles, however, have been changing. In some community hospitals, nursing assistants, under the direction of a registered nurse, are assuming more responsibility for direct care. Under nurse extender programs, nursing assistants or other ancillary personnel are generally trained to replace or assist registered nurses in performing relatively simple bedside care such as changing dressings and taking vital signs. In addition, they sometimes help nurses in providing total bedside care. Still others are trained to help telemonitor, lift patients, administer electrocardiographs, or provide physical therapy.", "Registered nurses assume additional management and supervisory responsibilities to monitor the nurse extenders. Meanwhile, nurse extenders relieve registered nurses of many routine patient care-related duties. Creating nurse extender positions is sometimes accompanied by changing the roles of other support personnel such as those performing dietary, housekeeping, and transportation services.", "Following are examples of three hospitals\u2019 efforts to expand the roles of nursing assistants and other ancillary personnel:", "A Southern Maryland hospital developed a new patient care delivery model to respond to a nursing shortage. The hospital, forced to close 10 percent of its beds because of a staffing shortage, could reopen the beds only through the use of agency nurses, a temporary and costly option. To reduce its need for registered nurses, the hospital created two new patient care positions\u2014nursing technician and patient care assistant\u2014by expanding the duties of nursing assistants and housekeepers. It expanded the former nursing assistant job description to include more technical duties previously performed by nurses. It reassigned unskilled tasks to personnel in other departments.

Before assuming these expanded duties, the former housekeepers were trained in infection control procedures and body mechanics. Many of the tasks the patient care assistants assumed had been previously done by nursing assistants. Unlike the former housekeepers, who reported to the general services department, patient care assistants report directly to the care unit.", "The hospital also expanded the roles of other nonpatient care staff. For example, dietary aides distribute and collect patient meal trays, a task previously performed by nursing assistants.", "The hospital reported that it reduced by 12 percent the number of registered nurses needed by shifting non-nursing tasks to nursing technicians and patient care assistants. The hospital also reported increased employee satisfaction among nursing technicians and patient care assistants resulting from their interaction with patients and nurses, improved documentation and care planning, better continuity of care from shift to shift, more time for patient teaching, and a cleaner unit.", "Boston\u2019s University Hospital developed a patient care technician position. Patient care technicians, who must have 4 years of education beyond high school, complete a formal 8-week training program followed by a 3-month probationary period. As in the Southern Maryland hospital, the patient care technician worked closely with a registered nurse. An official from the Boston University Medical Center, however, told us that the hospital discontinued the program because it was not cost-effective.", "She said that the positions had high turnover rates because the program was limited to individuals with college degrees in fields other than nursing and such individuals often returned to their original fields or took other jobs. Another problem the program had was inadequate training of nurses in delegating duties to the technicians.", "Braintree Hospital (in Maine) developed a rehabilitation technician position. In addition to the duties normally performed by a nursing assistant, the rehabilitation technician (1) prepares narrative documentation; (2) provides special eye and skin care, bowel care, simple treatments and dressings, and tube feeding; and (3) applies hot and cold compresses.", "Just as nurse extenders are reducing community hospitals\u2019 demand for registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, and nurse midwives often substitute for physicians. Several factors have influenced this trend, including the need to lower health care costs and improve access to care for the poor and residents of rural areas. In 1990, Medicare and Medicaid began reimbursing certain nonphysician health professionals for the care they deliver, allowing them to expand their roles and perform functions previously performed by physicians.", "Many nurses frown on the use of nurse extenders and other unlicensed assistive personnel. For example, the Patient Care Survey of the American Journal of Nursing revealed that only about 13 percent of the nurses surveyed believed the use of such personnel improved patient care where they worked.

Patient-centered care also focuses on customer satisfaction by increasing involvement of patients and their families in treatment decisions and reducing the number of a patient\u2019s caregivers during a hospital stay.

Patient-centered care generally reduces the number of caregivers interacting with a given patient during a 3-day stay from up to 55 to fewer than 15.", "A third feature of patient-centered care involves redesigning wards to bring ancillary services closer to patients. Hospitals group patients with similar care needs together on a single ward rather than disperse them to several wards. This enables redesigning wards to bring ancillary services closer to patients. By grouping like patients together, hospitals can move ancillary services for about 90 percent of the procedures required by these patients to that ward. Hospitals can use space previously used for supplies and the central nursing station for high-volume ancillary services such as pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, and physical therapy.", "With supplies, medical records, and caregivers closer to patients, hospitals may also move the traditional nursing station closer to patients. In addition, hospitals may locate work areas for preparing patient charts and other functions at smaller units throughout the ward.", "Placing ancillary services, such as X ray, laboratory, pharmacy, and rehabilitation, on the patient floor often greatly reduces travel time from patients\u2019 rooms to the service area. In addition, X ray technicians, medical technologists, pharmacists, and therapists can become more a part of the care team.

Although the Under Secretary for Health\u2019s criteria for potential realignment encourage contracting for services when they are cheaper and of equal or better quality, VISN strategic plans generally do not address such contracting. Until VA completes improvements in information and financial management systems, VA hospitals may not have the type of reliable cost and utilization data they need to make informed decisions on contracting for services rather than providing them directly or obtaining them from another VA facility. Another factor relating to such decisions is their effect on VA employees and the community. For example, contracting to obtain dietary services from a local provider might save jobs in the community and provide employment opportunities for current employees without relocating them. On the other hand, providing the services through one consolidated VA location might save jobs within the VA system and improve efficiency at the gaining VA facility through economies of scale. Such action would, however, more adversely affect the community standing to lose jobs.", "In addition, VISNs and individual VA hospital directors will have to make difficult choices about using part-time and intermittent employees.

Similarly, can VA devise alternatives to using, or other ways to use, part-time and intermittent employees to make comparable efficiency improvements without the disadvantages associated with using such employees? For example, VA facilities might be able to save resources by pooling staff with each other or with nearby community hospitals.", "Finally, community hospitals typically pay differentials to part-time and intermittent employees, but such differentials are not available to VA employees.

First, regarding efforts to develop and implement clinical guidelines, little information is available either in VA or the private sector on the extent to which physicians and other caregivers are following clinical guidelines and to what effect. In addition, VA\u2019s development and evaluation of clinical guidelines rely heavily on successful completion of efforts to improve its management information and financial management systems. Thus, VA, like the private sector, faces significant challenges, in developing clinical guidelines, evaluating their effectiveness, and ensuring their appropriate use.", "The second major challenge is in developing and using outcome measures. For example, outcome measures will probably have little effect on hospital operations and individual provider performance without VA\u2019s effectively distributing the results of assessments and monitoring corrective actions. Similarly, the effectiveness of outcome measures will depend heavily on VA\u2019s ability to identify and develop meaningful ways to compare VA and other health care providers and programs as well as VA facilities and providers. VA must take care, however, to ensure that the results portrayed by outcome measures reflect differences in performance rather than differences in the populations studied. Effective case mix comparisons are, however, difficult to develop.", "One of VA\u2019s initial efforts to develop outcome measures is its performance measures for VISN directors. These measures are process oriented, however, such as the number of surgeries shifted to outpatient settings and the reduction of BDOC, rather than outcome oriented. As discussed in chapter 6, VA\u2019s 1997 performance measures present a view of VISN efficiency that conflicts with that portrayed by VERA. For example, VA began setting its goals for reducing BDOC on the basis of Medicare days of care per 1,000 beneficiaries by census division. Under this performance measure, VERA identified four of the seven VISNs required to reduce BDOC by 20 percent or more as comparatively more efficient VISNs. The VISN required to reduce BDOC by the greatest percentage\u201439 percent\u2014was determined under VERA to qualify for one of the larger increases in funding on the basis of its perceived efficiency.", "Similarly, another performance measure set VISN-specific goals for increasing the number of mandatory care category users. Generally, however, the VISNs needing the smallest increases in new users to meet their goals were those receiving the largest increases in funding under VERA.", "Because of the apparent inconsistencies between the performance measures and VERA analyses, VA faces a significant challenge in determining (1) the underlying causes of variation in the rates of hospital use and (2) to what extent the variation can be reduced without jeopardizing patient care. An important part of such an assessment is developing baseline data on each VA facility. VA studies show that although all VA hospitals studied had significant amounts of non-acute care, the percentages varied from about 25 percent to over 70 percent. Baseline data on VA\u2019s surgery programs showing the percentages of surgeries needed to be done on an inpatient basis would provide a sound basis for establishing goals for reducing inpatient surgeries. Setting performance measures without such baseline data could require some facilities to jeopardize patient care to meet the goals, while other facilities could meet the goals and still provide extensive non-acute care. VA is gathering the types of baseline data that could be used to establish facility-specific performance measures through its preadmission screening program.", "A third challenge VA faces is in evaluating the effectiveness of VA initiatives, such as establishing temporary lodging in VA hospitals, in reducing costs. For example, little is known about how much it costs VA to provide temporary lodging because such initiatives are recent. VISNs and individual hospitals face significant challenges in determining when it would be less expensive to purchase care from a hospital or outpatient clinic closer to a veteran\u2019s home rather than pay for additional nights of lodging to provide care at a VA facility.", "Although the temporary lodging program should be less expensive than admitting a patient earlier or keeping a patient in a hospital longer than medically necessary, providing lodging in a hospital using VA hospital staff may not always be the lowest cost alternative. In arranging for temporary lodging, VA could explore many other alternatives, including using nearby commercial lodging and hiring an outside contractor to operate a temporary lodging unit.", "The use of temporary lodging also raises several policy issues. For example, to what extent should veterans, rather than the government, be expected to pay for temporary lodging incident to direct patient care? To the extent that providing free lodging encourages longer and more frequent stays, it could offset the savings achieved by using fewer hospital beds. Similarly, to what extent should temporary lodging be made available to family members? Finally, should temporary lodging be provided to veterans traveling significant distances for outpatient services?", "Neither performance measures nor VISN strategic plans focus on efforts to shift care to post-acute settings when medically appropriate. The effectiveness of such actions depends on many factors such as the adequacy of discharge planning efforts, efforts to ensure that patients are not discharged before medically appropriate, the extent to which patients receive appropriate follow-on care, and the extent to which the cost of home health or other post-acute care services exceed the cost that would have been incurred through continued institutional care.", "The overall effect of VA efforts depends as well on the extent to which VA facilities shift the costs of post-acute care to other payers such as the Medicare home health program.

Our analysis of 1992 National Survey of Veterans data estimated that fewer than half of the 159,000 veterans who did not obtain needed hospital care lived within 25 miles of a VA hospital. By comparison, we estimated that over 90 percent lived within 25 miles of a private-sector hospital. One option for improving the health status of such veterans would be for VA to use its expanded contracting authority to purchase hospital and other services for uninsured veterans that live far from a VA hospital."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Serving Uninsured Veterans", "paragraphs": ["On average, the VA health care system provides a higher proportion of care to patients with no health insurance than any category of community hospital, including public teaching hospitals. Still, many veterans without health insurance have reported that they have not used VA health care services and that they have unmet health care needs.", "In 1990, 9 out of 10 veterans reported having public or private health insurance. That meant, however, that about 2.6 million veterans had neither public nor private health insurance. Without a demonstrated ability to pay for care, individuals\u2019 access to health care is much more limited in the private sector, decreasing their ability to receive needed care. Lacking insurance, people often postpone obtaining care until their conditions become more serious and require more costly medical services.", "In the past, most veterans who lacked insurance coverage could get needed hospital care through public programs and VA. Still, VA\u2019s 1992 National Survey of Veterans estimated that about 159,000 veterans could not get needed hospital care in 1992, and about 228,000 could not get needed outpatient services. By far, the most common reason veterans cited for not obtaining needed care was that they could not afford to pay for it.", "So, if VA is to fulfill its safety net mission, it will have to ensure that VISNs and individual facilities do not react to incentives to generate revenue by reducing services to uninsured veterans and those with service-connected disabilities. Similarly, monitoring will be needed to ensure that facilities do not inappropriately bill insurers for services provided to service-connected veterans to generate additional revenues. Moreover, the incentive to target programs toward revenue-generating veterans is greatest if the facility providing the care retains the funds. Such an arrangement, however, would also provide the greatest incentive for operating an effective program. VA faces the challenge of identifying and applying the appropriate balance.", "In addition, ownership conversions of public and nonprofit hospitals could affect the ability of low-income or uninsured veterans to obtain services from such hospitals. With community hospitals\u2019 support for the medically indigent apparently decreasing, should VA follow their lead? Or, should VA try to fill the void left by those providers? For example, veterans without health insurance often have families without health insurance. Should VA hospitals use their excess capacity to serve veterans\u2019 uninsured dependents? If so, how should such care be financed? For example, should recoveries from private health insurance be earmarked for use in providing services to the families of uninsured veterans?"], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions, Agency Comments, and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Both VA and community hospitals are struggling to survive. Demand for hospital care, which increased for much of the century, has steadily declined since the 1980s in community hospitals and since the 1960s in VA hospitals. Although many factors have contributed to the declining demand, VA has been less affected by the effects of payment and other reforms than have community hospitals. Therefore, further reductions in use of VA hospitals are likely as VA tries to shift more of its care to outpatient and other more cost-effective settings. In addition, VA, unlike community hospitals, has a declining target population.", "One of the most crucial decisions facing the Congress and the administration as they plan for the future of the veterans\u2019 health care system is the extent of effort that should be spent to preserve VA\u2019s direct delivery infrastructure and the process that should be followed to effect change.", "VA, amid a massive restructuring of its health care system, has made efficiency improvements to the system. These actions have focused heavily on shifting patients from inpatient hospitals to outpatient and other more appropriate care settings\u2014actions taken by community hospitals during the 1980s. The efforts\u2019 success, however, has further reduced the workload of VA hospitals, increasing the cost of serving the remaining patients and heightening the need to address the future of the hospitals. Because fixed costs are dispersed over fewer patients, the declining use of VA hospitals increases the cost of providing hospital care to remaining patients.", "Community hospitals, also faced with declining workloads, have tried many approaches to reducing their costs, including increased use of part-time and intermittent employees and use of nurse extenders and other unlicensed assistive personnel. With the exception of efforts to integrate and consolidate patient care services and administrative functions of VA hospitals in close proximity, VA has not emphasized improving the efficiency of some hospital operations as much as community hospitals have. For example, VA could not pursue contracting for patient and nonpatient care services to the same extent as community hospitals.", "Not everyone accepts all of the changes taking place in community hospitals, however. For example, some view the use of some patient- centered care with skepticism because they are concerned about hospitals\u2019 cutting costs by reducing nursing staff. Decisions will have to be made about which community hospital initiatives VA should pursue and to what extent.", "In fact, many of VA\u2019s actions to improve the efficiency of its health care system, such as the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system and preadmission screening, come from private-sector initiatives. These actions differ, however, from their private-sector counterparts because they lack the same financial incentives and risks. Nonetheless, individuals differ about the appropriate risk that is assumed by individual providers. A provider\u2019s assuming too much risk or having too strong a financial incentive could adversely affect patient care. Too little risk, in contrast, could limit the effectiveness of the initiative. VA thus faces difficult decisions about the extent to which it should use financial incentives and risks to change practice patterns.", "The reduced use of VA hospitals associated with efficiency improvements, coupled with the declining veteran population and continued enrollment growth in managed care plans, makes preserving VA hospitals exceedingly difficult. About 46 percent of the beds in VA hospitals have been closed, and over 80 percent of the remaining beds might become excess within the next 5 to 10 years if VA\u2019s efficiency improvement efforts succeed. This gives VA two basic options: attract significant numbers of new users or close hospitals.", "VA\u2019s current efforts to attract new users, however, are unlikely to generate significant demand for hospital care. Its efforts legitimately focus more on improving the accessibility of outpatient care for veterans who live far from a VA clinic than on generating demand for VA hospital care. If VA hospitals are to remain exclusively for veterans, VA will have to attract a much larger and ever-increasing proportion of the veteran population.", "Other countries, such as Australia, have opened their veterans hospitals to nonveterans to build workload. Allowing VA hospitals to treat more nonveterans could increase VA hospital use and broaden VA\u2019s patient mix, strengthening VA\u2019s medical education mission. Without better systems for determining the cost of care, however, such action could result in funds appropriated for veterans\u2019 health care being used to pay for care for nonveterans. In addition, if VA opened its hospitals to nonveterans, it would be expanding the areas in which it directly competes with private-sector hospitals in nearby communities. Essentially, every nonveteran coming into a VA hospital would be one fewer patient for a private-sector hospital. Thus, expanding VA\u2019s role in providing care to nonveterans could further jeopardize the fiscal viability of private-sector hospitals.", "If VA decides to compete directly with community hospitals for both veteran and nonveteran patients, then it will subsequently have to decide the extent to which it should adopt private-sector practices on advertising and adding amenities, areas on which VA, up to now, has not focused. Similarly, decisions would have to be made about whether to market services to managed care plans and, if so, how to price them to compete with community hospitals. Several factors, including its medical education and research missions, currently limit VA\u2019s ability to compete with community hospitals on the basis of price.", "Closing some VA hospitals, on the other hand, could make more funds available for expanding the use of contract hospitals for providing services to veterans who have service-connected disabilities or lack public or private insurance and do not live near a VA hospital. Now, the cost of maintaining its hospitals limits VA\u2019s ability to meet the hospital care needs of some veterans with no public or private health insurance. This is because VA hospitals have more than enough capacity to serve all veterans seeking care, regardless of their finances. In other words, insured veterans living close to a VA hospital have better access to VA-supported care than do uninsured veterans who live far from a VA hospital. Maintaining VA hospitals in markets with declining demand could result in funds being used to pay for hospital care provided to veterans in the discretionary care category, while the hospital care needs of uninsured veterans in other areas are unmet. Other countries have successfully closed veterans hospitals, while improving veterans\u2019 access to hospital care by contracting with community hospitals.", "The declining use of community hospitals and VA\u2019s vast purchasing power could allow VA, like HMOs and other managed care plans, to negotiate significant discounts from community hospitals. This could improve the accessibility of VA-supported hospital care for uninsured veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities. Contracting could help improve the financial status of some community hospitals by increasing patient workload.", "Because they serve a large proportion of uninsured and low-income patients, VA hospitals are more like public hospitals than either nonprofit or for-profit community hospitals. Many of the actions VA is taking, however, threaten to divert it from its traditional safety net mission to more directly competing with community hospitals for revenue-generating patients. Therefore, the Congress and VA have important decisions to make about the extent to which VA should focus its strategic goals on its safety net role.", "Finally, medical education has played a vital role in improving the quality of care in VA hospitals for over 50 years. Similarly, VA has played an important part in training a large proportion of the nation\u2019s physicians. With a growing surplus of physicians, however, and a steadily declining veteran population, the Congress and VA face difficult decisions about the future of affiliation agreements. For example, should VA hospitals receive the same kinds of incentives to reduce the number of residency positions they support that the Congress provided non-VA hospitals through the Balanced Budget Act?", "Decisions about the future of VA hospitals, whether it be to close hospitals or open them to nonveterans, have significant implications for veterans, VA employees, affiliated medical schools, community hospitals, and taxpayers. It is therefore important that the Congress and the administration have available sufficient information to properly weigh the potential effects of VA health care system infrastructure changes on all affected stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In a letter dated March 5, 1998, VA\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Policy and Planning said that this report extensively assesses the VA health care system from its inception to the present and accurately depicts the dynamic reengineering of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) into the type of organization necessary to ensure that VA patients receive the care they need. The letter states that VA considers the report a valuable tool for helping the Department as it develops strategic initiatives to provide seamless health care services to veterans.", "VA stated that although it may agree with the issues and challenges identified in the report, it does not necessarily agree with the report\u2019s conclusions on VA\u2019s approach to the issues, the effect of continued reengineering on veterans, and the direction of VA\u2019s health care system. Our report, VA stated, often focuses on issues from past reports that VA believes are either no longer relevant, have been resolved, or are already being addressed in conjunction with its reengineering program. This, in VA\u2019s opinion, leads the report to conclusions about the future that are not certain and that the Department is not prepared to acknowledge as the only or most probable ones. Our report is intended to identify and analyze the implications of different approaches to restructuring the veterans health care program, not to draw conclusions about the direction of the program. We believe our focus on issues raised in past reports is appropriate both for documenting the progress VA has made in its restructuring efforts and the lessons learned along the way.", "VA also contends that many of the issues we cite as not being addressed in the first submission of Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) plans are addressed in VHA\u2019s guidance for the plans submitted in October 1997 and that future versions of the guidance will continue to address these issues and others.", "We recognize that the VISN plans we reviewed were the networks\u2019 first attempt at developing strategic/business plans. We reviewed the plans in detail, however, because efforts to obtain information from VA\u2019s central office yielded few specifics on the extent to which VA was implementing initiatives like those of many community hospitals. Our review of the plans was linked to VA\u2019s guidance on preparing the plans and to the Under Secretary\u2019s Prescription for Change. Our review, however, was not intended to criticize VA\u2019s efforts to develop strategic plans. Nor are we suggesting that VA should necessarily adopt all of the community hospital initiatives. VA stated that the current national health care climate, as our report acknowledges, remains unsettled, and VA\u2019s vision of future health care delivery scenarios is based on trends that continue to emerge. This report, VA stated, clarifies that VA is at a watershed and that among the issues pertinent to the future of both VA and non-VA health care are (1) how VA can best provide services to an aging population with multiple health care needs and function as a safety net provider, (2) whether VA should continue to provide services directly, and (3) how new technologies will affect VA health care.", "In addition, VA indicated that it agrees that recent and proposed changes in VA and other programs make the future demand for both VA and non-VA hospital care uncertain. It noted that outpatient care, coupled with intensive care services, is a probable future model of U.S. health care. According to VA, it is therefore logical that in the future both VA and non-VA hospitals will change and some may close. VA agreed with our observation that decisions about whether to close or consolidate hospitals or services, change missions, sell excess capacity, or identify enhanced uses of excess space will require that the effect on all stakeholders (veterans, VA employees, community hospitals, medical schools, and individual communities) be fully considered without undue political influence.", "VA also stated that because VHA is in the midst of reengineering the health care system, significant uncertainty and ultimately no clear answers exist to the many questions this report raises. According to VA, improving its information and financial systems will be critical to answering these questions and will enable VA to demonstrate good value not only in cost, but also in quality, service, patients\u2019 functional status, accessibility, and satisfaction. VA stated that by (1) following through with the transformation already occurring in its infrastructure and processes; (2) continuing to improve its strategic planning and resource allocation; and (3) implementing and monitoring clinical guidelines, performance measures, and outcomes, it will be able to successfully address these questions and other stakeholders\u2019 needs.", "Regarding its safety net mission, VA said that it disagrees with our contention that eligibility reform and changes in contracting and resource allocation will cause VA to focus less on serving service-connected veterans and on its safety net role regarding low-income or uninsured veterans and enhance marketing to high-income, insured veterans. VA stated that contrary to the impression left by this report, approximately 95 percent of VA patients are veterans who meet congressional mandates for care, including veterans with service-connected disabilities and those with no service-connected disabilities who have the lowest incomes and poorest insurance coverage. According to VA, VERA focuses not simply on dollars per user but on dollars per mandatory user. The report does not contend that VA will focus less on serving service-connected veterans or its safety net role regarding low-income or uninsured veterans. We recognize that VA\u2019s strategic goals and performance measures call for increasing VA\u2019s market share of mandatory veterans. Even some veterans within the mandatory care group, however, have a greater need for or more right to care than others. First, veterans seeking care for service-connected disabilities should have the highest priority for care. Similarly, lower income veterans who lack other health care options, such as public or private health insurance, have a greater need for VA health care services than other veterans. We are concerned that VERA and the new medical care cost recovery provisions could at least in the short term provide financial incentives for individual facility managers to focus on serving revenue- generating veterans\u2014those with higher incomes or private health insurance\u2014rather than veterans with service-connected disabilities or no health insurance. We are also concerned about the extent to which VA can recover its costs for treating nonmandatory veterans to permit it to maintain or increase services to mandatory veterans.", "In addition, unless VA improves its medical facilities\u2019 determination of which care category\u2014mandatory or discretionary\u2014a veteran is placed in, it will be difficult to accurately determine whom VA is serving. A discrepancy continues to exist between the care categories assigned by VA medical facilities, which, according to VA, report that less than 5 percent of both inpatient and outpatient users were discretionary in fiscal year 1995 and our prior work, which found that about 15 percent of the veterans using VA facilities who have no service-connected disabilities have sufficiently high incomes that would place them in the lowest priority category under the new patient enrollment system.", "Additional VA comments and technical corrections have been incorporated in this report as appropriate.
