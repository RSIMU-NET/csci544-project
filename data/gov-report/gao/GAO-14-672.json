In 2012, GAO reported that, in response to these regulations and other factors such as low natural gas prices, companies might retire or retrofit some units. GAO reported that these actions may increase electricity prices and, according to some stakeholders, may affect reliability\u2013the ability to meet consumers' demand\u2014in some regions.

GAO concluded that such a process was needed until at least 2017 to monitor the complexity of implementation and extent of potential effects on price and reliability. Since that time, DOE, EPA, and FERC have taken initial steps to monitor industry progress responding to EPA regulations including jointly conducting regular meetings with key industry stakeholders. Currently, these monitoring efforts are primarily focused on industry's implementation of one of four EPA regulations\u2014the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards\u2014and the regions with a large amount of capacity that must comply with that regulation. Agency officials told GAO that in light of EPA's recent and pending actions on regulations including those to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing generating units, these coordination efforts may need to be revisited.", "According to GAO's analysis of public data, power companies now plan to retire a greater percentage of coal-fueled generating capacity and retrofit less capacity with environmental controls than the estimates GAO reported in July 2012. About 13 percent of coal-fueled generating capacity\u201442,192 megawatts (MW)\u2014has either been retired since 2012 or is planned for retirement by 2025, which exceeds the estimates of 2 to 12 percent of capacity that GAO reported in 2012 (see fig.). The units that power companies have retired or plan to retire are generally older, smaller, more polluting and not used extensively, with some exceptions. For example, some larger generating units are also planned for retirement. In addition, the capacity is geographically concentrated in four states: Ohio (14 percent), Pennsylvania (11 percent), Kentucky (7 percent), and West Virginia (6 percent). GAO's analysis identified about 70,000 MW of generating capacity that has either completed some type of retrofit to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter since 2012 or plan to complete one by 2025, which is less than the estimate of 102,000 MW GAO reported in 2012."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations but believes it is important that these agencies jointly monitor industry progress and fully document these steps as GAO recommended in 2012. The agencies concurred with GAO's findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Coal is a key domestic fuel source, producing about 37 percent of the  nation\u2019s electricity supply in 2012. Burning coal for electricity production  results in the emission of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen  oxides (NO), and mercury and other metals. Coal-fueled electricity  generating units are among the largest emitters of these pollutants. Using  coal to generate electricity has been associated with human health and  environmental concerns by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  the primary federal agency responsible for implementing many of the  nation\u2019s environmental laws. For example, according to EPA data, SO have been linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. In  addition, coal-fueled generating units emit large quantities of carbon  dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change, and  can use significant quantities of water and create large amounts of waste  products that require disposal. and NO emissions contribute to the formation of fine particulate matter, and NO  contributes to the formation of ozone. Fine particulate matter may aggravate respiratory  and cardiovascular diseases and is associated with asthma attacks and premature death.  Ozone can inflame lung tissue and increase susceptibility to bronchitis and pneumonia. these actions. At that time, EPA had recently proposed or finalized four  regulations, as required or authorized, that aimed to address certain  health or environmental impacts associated with coal-fueled electricity  generating units. These regulations included the: (1) Cross-State Air  Pollution Rule (CSAPR); (2) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS);  (3) Cooling Water Intake Structures regulation, which we refer to as  316(b); and (4) Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric  Utilities regulation (CCR). Currently, MATS is the only one of the four  regulations that has been in effect; the other regulations have been either  in active litigation or have undetermined regulatory compliance periods. In  July 2012, we reported that it was uncertain how power companies  would respond to these regulations, but that available information  suggested they would retrofit some units with controls to reduce  pollutants or take other steps to reduce adverse impacts. We also  reported that when it was not economic to take these actions\u2014whether  due to the cost of undertaking these retrofits or because of other changes  that have occurred in the electric power sector, such as lower prices for  natural gas\u2014power companies may retire some units. We reported  estimates that 2 to 12 percent of coal-fueled capacity could be retired,  and that some regions, particularly the Midwest, could see more  significant levels of retirements. These retirements could affect the  amount of coal-fueled generating capacity and the amount of electricity  actually generated from coal. Available information also suggested that,  while these actions may not cause widespread concerns about  reliability\u2014the ability to meet the needs of consumers even when  generating equipment fails unexpectedly, or other factors affect the  electricity system, they may contribute to reliability challenges in some  regions and these actions would likely increase electricity prices in some  regions. In October 2012, we also reported that two broad trends were  affecting power companies\u2019 decisions related to coal-fueled generating  units\u2014recent environmental regulations and changing market conditions,  such as the recent decrease in the price of natural gas. We found that  power companies may build new generating units, upgrade transmission  systems to maintain reliability, and increasingly use natural gas to  produce electricity as coal units are retired, and remaining coal units  become somewhat more expensive to operate.", "Two federal agencies have responsibilities for overseeing actions power  companies take in response to federal regulations and mitigating some  potential adverse implications. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) is generally responsible for ensuring that certain  electricity and transmission prices are \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d as well as  approving and enforcing standards for reliability. The Department of  Energy (DOE) works to modernize the electricity system, enhance the  security and reliability of the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure, and facilitate  recovery from any disruptions. DOE also has authority to compel  generating units to produce electricity in certain emergency situations. In  our July 2012 report, we recommended that DOE, FERC, and EPA  develop and document a formal, joint process consistent with each  agency\u2019s respective statutory authorities to monitor industry\u2019s progress in  responding to the EPA regulations until at least 2017 and that each  agency, to the extent practical, leverage resources and share the results  of its efforts with the other agencies. DOE and EPA agreed with this  recommendation, and FERC disagreed, stating that the agencies were  working to establish a more formal approach to coordination to the extent  that FERC\u2019s authority allows.", "You asked us to examine actions these agencies\u2019 have taken in response  to our recommendation in our July 2012 report and provide updated  information on planned coal-fueled generating unit retirements and  retrofits.

We interviewed and obtained information from a  sample of stakeholders who were identified and interviewed as part of our  July 2012 review. Stakeholders we interviewed and obtained information  from included six Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO), the North  American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), and two industry  groups that represent power companies. We used data from SNL  Financial (SNL) to provide information on historic and planned retrofits  and retirements of coal-fueled generating units. Information regarding  planned retrofits and retirements reflect publicly reported plans as  identified by SNL. To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed  and corresponded via e-mail with knowledgeable SNL staff, analyzed the  data to identify any problems with completeness and accuracy, and,  where possible, corroborated the data with other available information.  We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also analyzed information on retirements and retrofits provided by RTOs.  To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed and corresponded  via e-mail with knowledgeable officials, analyzed the data to identify any  problems with completeness and accuracy, and, where possible,  corroborated the data with other available information.

Historically, coal-fueled generating units have  provided about half of the electricity produced in the United States\u2014an  amount that has declined in recent years, falling to 37 percent in 2012.", "In addition to coal, electricity is  To address concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste,  several environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act,  and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, were enacted. As  required or authorized by these laws, EPA recently proposed or finalized  four key regulations that will affect coal-fueled units. As outlined in table  1, these regulations are at different stages of development and have  different compliance deadlines.", "These four regulations have potentially significant implications for public  health and the environment. In particular, EPA projected that, among  other benefits, CSAPR would reduce SO emissions by over half in covered states, reducing asthma and  related human health impacts. In addition, EPA projected that MATS  would reduce mercury emissions by 75 percent from coal-fueled  electricity generating units, reducing the impacts of mercury on adults and  children.", "In addition to these four regulations, on June 2, 2014, EPA proposed new  regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled  generating units that, if finalized, will impact the electricity industry,  including coal-fueled generating units, aiming for overall reductions  equivalent to 30 percent from 2005 emissions levels by 2030. The  proposed regulations include state-specific goals for carbon dioxide  emissions and guidelines for states to follow in developing, submitting,  and implementing plans to achieve these goals, which would be due in  June 2016, although, under some circumstances, a state may submit an  initial plan by June 2016 and a completed plan up to 2 years later.", "In addition to DOE, FERC, and EPA, other key stakeholders have certain  responsibilities for overseeing actions power companies take in response  to the regulations and have a role in mitigating some potential adverse  implications. These other stakeholders include state environmental and  electricity regulators and system planners that coordinate planning  decisions regarding transmission and generation infrastructure to  maintain the reliable supply of electricity to consumers. System planners  and operators attempt to avoid reliability problems through advance  planning of transmission and, in some cases, generation resources, and  coordinating or determining operational decisions such as which  generating resources are operated to meet demand throughout the day.  The role of a system planner can be carried out by individual power  companies or RTOs. System planners\u2019 responsibilities include analyzing  expected future changes in generation and transmission assets, such as  the retirement of a generating unit; customer demand; and emerging  reliability issues. For example, once a power company notifies the system  planner that it is considering retiring a generating unit, the system planner  generally studies the electricity system to assess whether the retirement  would cause reliability challenges and identify long- or short-term  solutions to mitigate any impacts. The solutions could include building  new generating units, reducing demand in specific areas, building new  transmission lines or adding other equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE, EPA, and FERC Are Coordinating Efforts to Monitor Industry\u2019s Response to Key EPA Regulations in Response to GAO\u2019s Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["DOE, EPA, and FERC have taken initial steps to implement the  recommendation we made in our July 2012 report that these agencies  develop and document a formal, joint process to monitor industry  progress in responding to the four EPA regulations.

The MATS regulation  was finalized in February 2012 and calls for a 3-year compliance period  for existing generating units with the deadline of April 16, 2015, but  permitting authorities may provide an extra year for certain generating  units that request additional time to comply. Agency officials and  stakeholders told us that state agencies are generally providing the 1- year extension for generating units\u2014providing these units a total of 4  years to comply. In addition, according to the National Association of  Clean Air Agencies (NACAA), as of May 2014, all but 9 of over 100  requests for extensions were granted by the state permitting agencies.

According to EPA officials, compliance with the MATS requirements has  been less challenging for industry than anticipated, and operators have  generally been able to undertake retrofits as part of scheduled  maintenance outages; however, certain retrofits, such as the installation  of a fabric filter will require additional or longer outages to be completed.  According to EPA officials, whether a plant will need to schedule outages  for retrofits will depend on a number of factors including the type of  controls required for compliance. EPA officials told us they anticipate few  administrative orders to be requested. However, if EPA receives a  request for an administrative order, EPA has stated in its policy that it will  rely on the advice and counsel of reliability experts, including FERC, to  identify and analyze reliability risks, but EPA officials will make the final  decision on these requests.

As a result,  according to officials from one RTO, their region has increased  coordination with the natural gas industry through a stakeholder forum  and a series of gas infrastructure studies. These officials said that, while  relying on natural gas to generate electricity has not historically negatively  affected reliability, greater reliance on natural gas may require more  consideration of potential fuel-related future reliability challenges.", "RTO officials and other industry stakeholders also told us recent and  pending actions on regulations could have impacts on electricity prices.

Officials  from several RTOs told us that, while they analyze the potential reliability  impacts of specific generating units that power companies are  considering retiring, they do not analyze the potential market impacts of  these retirements on electricity prices or other market factors. In addition,  several RTO officials told us they cannot estimate the impacts of these  potential retirements on the markets due to the number of factors involved  in determining market prices and affecting markets.

Generating units that power companies have retired or plan  to retire are generally smaller. Smaller generating units are generally  less fuel efficient than larger units and can be more expensive to  retrofit, maintain, and operate on a per-MW basis. In particular,  smaller units\u2014those less that 300 MW\u2014comprise about 63 percent of  the net summer generating capacity that power companies retired or  plan to retire from 2012 through 2025 (26,659 MW from 208 of the  238 units).

Generating units that power companies retired or  plan to retire over the next 3 years emit air pollutants such as SO at generally higher rates than the remaining fleet. According to  our analysis, units that were retired or are planned for retirement from  2014 through 2017 emitted on average almost three times as much  SO per unit of fuel used at the generating unit in 2013 as units that  are not planned for retirement. Similarly, units that were retired or  are planned for retirement from 2014 through 2017 emitted on  average about 41 percent more NO per unit of fuel used at the  generating unit in 2013 than units not planned for retirement.", "Not used extensively. Most generating units that power companies  have retired or plan to retire have not been extensively used in recent  years, but other units were used more often. Specifically, according  to our analysis, from 2012 through 2025, power companies retired or  plan to retire units that comprise about 70 percent of the net summer  generating capacity (30,000 MW from 186 of the 238 units) that  operated the equivalent of less than half of the hours they were  available over the past few years. However, data also indicate that  about 13 of the 238 units that companies retired or plan to retire\u2014 which represent about 4,200 MW of net summer generating  capacity\u2014operated the equivalent of 70 percent or more of the hours  they were available over the past few years.", "Geographically concentrated. Generating units that power  companies have retired or plan to retire are concentrated in certain  states (see fig. 2). Specifically, about 38 percent of the net summer  generating capacity that power companies retired or plan to retire  from 2012 through 2025 is located in four states\u2014Ohio (14 percent),  Pennsylvania (11 percent), Kentucky (7 percent), and West Virginia (6  percent).

These retrofits include the use of a wide range of  the technologies we reported at that time. As noted in our July 2012  report, operators of generating units were expected to rely on the  combined installation of several technologies to comply with the  regulations. These technologies include: (1) fabric filters or electrostatic  precipitators to control particulate matter; (2) flue gas desulfurization  units\u2014also known as scrubbers\u2014or dry sorbent injection units to control  SO and acid gas emissions; (3) selective catalytic reduction or selective  noncatalytic reduction units to control NO; and (4) activated carbon  injection units to reduce mercury emissions.

In  particular, EPA estimated that, in response to MATS, companies would  retrofit 102,000 MW of generating capacity with fabric filters and 83,000  MW with new scrubbers or scrubber upgrades. In addition, a study by  NERC, which collectively examined early versions of all four regulations  in 2011, estimated that 576 units that account for about 234,371 MW of  capacity would be retrofitted by the end of 2015.", "We identified two key characteristics of the units that power companies  have retrofitted or plan to retrofit as follows:", "Larger.

Reliable electricity remains critically important to U.S.  homes and businesses and is itself reliant upon the availability of  sufficient generating capacity. DOE, EPA, and FERC have taken initial  steps to implement our recommendation to establish a joint process to  monitor industry\u2019s progress in responding to the four EPA regulations and  other factors. However, stakeholders, including a FERC Commissioner,  continue to express concerns about reliability and electricity prices.  Furthermore, proposed regulations focused on reducing emissions of  carbon dioxide from the electricity sector, when finalized, may pose  additional challenges for coal-fueled generating units. The initial  coordination efforts now under way across the three agencies are an  important tool for understanding and monitoring the potential effects of  EPA regulations and other factors on the electricity sector.
