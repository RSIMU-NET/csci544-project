The  adjustments consisted of reductions to the expenditures charged to the  program. Many adjustments to mining law program expenditures are  caused by the reallocation of charge card purchases, which occurs when  a BLM employee makes a purchase for the benefit of a program other  than the program to which his or her charge card account was assigned  (i.e., the default program code to the charge card account).

For employees who perform direct  work for the mining law program, accurate recording of actual hours is  especially important to BLM ensuring that its records are as accurate as  possible and that it is able to use past year records as a basis for  estimating future program needs. The other 7 employees performed  support functions, such as office personnel, information technology, and  finance, which provided services across multiple BLM programs. BLM  allocates the costs of employees who perform support functions across  several subactivities using either of two alternative methods to assess  support costs: (1) actual labor expenditures or (2) base funding.
