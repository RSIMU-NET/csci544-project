In addition, Congress recently provided the Coast Guard with funding for a ninth National Security Cutter\u2014one more than it had planned for in 2005. Further, the Coast Guard has reduced the operational capacities of several assets to reflect more realistic and achievable operational targets. For example, the Coast Guard reduced the operational capacity of the Fast Response Cutter from 3,000 hours per vessel per year to 2,500 hours. GAO has also consistently found that there is a significant difference between the funding the Coast Guard estimates it needs for its major acquisitions and what it has traditionally requested and received. The Coast Guard's attempts to address this difference by establishing its future fleet's mission needs within reasonable budget constraints have been unsuccessful. GAO has made several recommendations for the Coast Guard to improve its recapitalization business case, including that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources needed to acquire them. The Coast Guard concurred with the recommendation and has actions underway, but has not completed this plan. Given that key changes have taken place since 2005, the Coast Guard should continue to take steps to address GAO's recommendations.", "GAO reported in May 2016 that the Coast Guard uses the Standard Operational Planning Process to annually allocate asset resource hours to field units for meeting missions, but the headquarters' Strategic Planning Directions used in this process do not provide field units with strategic, realistic goals.

These allocations have consistently exceeded actual asset resource hours used by field units.

While the Coast Guard is continuing to  acquire and deploy new assets each year, the Coast Guard operated  assets in fiscal year 2015 below the baseline level of resource hours  outlined for these assets in the 2005 Mission Needs Statement. For  example, in fiscal year 2015, a mix of new and legacy Patrol Cutters,  including new Fast Response Cutters, used 82,233 resource hours of the  174,000 resource hours specified in the 2005 baseline\u2014a 52 percent  difference. The asset resource hours used in fiscal year 2015 were  below the 2005 baseline level, in part, because not all of the new assets  planned as part of the 2005 baseline were deployed and fully operational  by fiscal year 2015.

However, we reported  in March 2015 that the unexpected transfer of C-27J aircraft from the  Department of Defense in December 2013 represented a significant  change to this aircraft fleet mix. As a result of this change, the Coast  Guard decreased its planned acquisition of HC-144 aircraft. In another  example, with regard to its aircraft fleet, the Coast Guard initially planned  for fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Vertical Take-Off and  Landing Unmanned Air Vehicles in the 2005 baseline, but, as of May  2016, Coast Guard officials stated these unmanned assets have not yet  been acquired. For the major cutter fleet, the Coast Guard had planned  for 8 National Security Cutters and 25 Offshore Patrol Cutters to replace  the legacy fleet of High and Medium Endurance Cutters in its 2005  Mission Needs Statement baseline.

For example, regarding fixed-wing aircraft, the Coast  Guard originally planned for each HC-144 aircraft to operate 1,200 flight  hours per year. However, we reported in March 2015 that the Coast  Guard had decided to reduce the HC-144 flight hours from 1,200 hours to  1,000 hours per year due primarily to the high cost of maintaining the  aircraft at the 1,200-hour per year pace. For patrol cutters, the 2005  Mission Needs Statement baseline planned for each Fast Response  Cutter to operate for 3,000 hours per year. However, the Coast Guard\u2019s  April 2016 report to Congress on its capital investments states that the  planned resource hours for each Fast Response Cutter is 2,500 hours per  year\u2014a reduction of 500 hours per cutter from the 2005 baseline.

For the past 6 years, we have consistently found that there is a  significant difference between the funding the Coast Guard estimates it  needs to carry out its program of record for its major acquisitions and  what it has traditionally requested and received through annual  appropriations. To date, the Coast Guard\u2019s attempts to address this  difference by establishing its future fleet\u2019s mission needs within  reasonable budget constraints have been unsuccessful. For example, in  September 2012, we reported that the Coast Guard had completed two  efforts (Fleet Mix Phases One and Two) to reassess the mix of assets  that comprised its former Deepwater program, but both efforts used its  2005 Mission Needs Statement and 2007 program of record as the basis  of the analysis and did not consider realistic fiscal constraints. In  particular, the Coast Guard began Fleet Mix Phase One in 2008 that  considered the 2007 program of record to be the \u201cfloor\u201d for asset  capabilities and quantities and did not impose cost constraints.  Consequently, the results were not used as a basis for trade-off  decisions. In the second effort, Fleet Mix Phase Two, the Coast Guard  analyzed how long it would take to buy the program of record under two  different funding constraints: (1) an upper bound of $1.64 billion per year  and (2) a lower bound of $1.2 billion per year. However, both scenarios  are greater than the Coast Guard\u2019s last four budget requests, indicating  the upper bound funding level is unrealistic and the lower bound is  optimistic. Further, the analyses did not assess options lower than the  current program of record. Therefore, neither of these analyses prepared  the Coast Guard to make the trade-offs required to develop a solid  business case that matched its needed capabilities with anticipated  resources.", "Instead of developing a solid business case, we reported in June 2014  that the Coast Guard is shaping its asset capabilities through the budget  process. As the Coast Guard has faced fiscal constraints in recent  years, this has led to asset capability gaps. As a result, the Coast Guard  does not have a long-term plan that demonstrates how it will maintain  today\u2019s service level and meet identified needs. For example, the Coast  Guard has already experienced a gap in heavy icebreaking capability and  is falling short of meeting current and future major cutter operational  hours. While some of these operational capability gaps are being filled  through Congressional appropriations that exceed Coast Guard budget  requests and transfers of assets from other agencies, the Coast Guard is  likely to continue to face similar shortfalls and gaps while the Offshore  Patrol Cutter fleet, estimated to absorb about two-thirds of the Coast  Guard\u2019s acquisition funding from 2018 until 2034, is being built. During  this time, the Coast Guard faces other recapitalization needs\u2014such as  rebuilding the 87-foot patrol boat fleet, the MH-60 and MH-65 helicopter  fleets, and possibly extending the service lives of the 270-foot Medium  Endurance Cutters, among many other projects\u2014that it may not be able  to fund with its remaining budget. Office of Management and Budget,  Department of Homeland Security, and Coast Guard efforts are underway  to address these funding gaps, but to date, these efforts have not led to  the difficult trade-off decisions needed to create a solid business case  and improve the affordability of the Coast Guard\u2019s proposed fleet mix. We  recommended in June 2014, that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet  modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the  current level of service\u2014aircraft and vessels\u2014and the fiscal resources  needed to buy the identified assets. We further recommended that the  plan should consider trade-offs if the fiscal resources needed to execute  the plan are not consistent with annual budgets. The Coast Guard  concurred with our recommendation, but its response did not fully  address our concerns or set forth an estimated date for completion. As  of June 2016, the Coast Guard has yet to complete this plan.

For  example, officials from six of the nine Coast Guard districts we  interviewed told us that they generally record one mission per asset  deployment, even though each asset\u2019s crew may have performed two  or more missions during a deployment. Officials from the remaining  three districts told us that if their assets\u2019 crews perform more than one  mission per deployment, the crews generally apportion the number of  hours spent on each mission performed. Coast Guard officials stated  that the resource hour data were accurate enough for operational  planning purposes, and that they were in the process of determining  how best to account for time spent by assets on multiple missions and  in transit in order to obtain more accurate and complete data on the  time assets spend conducting each of its missions. For example, in  April 2014, the Coast Guard issued instructions to its field units to  provide definitions, policies, and processes for reporting their  operational activities and also established a council to coordinate  changes among the various operational reporting systems used by  different field units.", "Tracking how increased strategic commitments affect resource  hours available: According to Coast Guard officials, the Strategic  Planning Directions\u2019 allocations of certain asset hours in support of  strategic commitments have grown from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year  2016. Headquarters and field unit officials we met with told us that it  has become increasingly difficult to fulfill these growing strategic  commitments when asset performance levels have generally  remained the same or declined in recent years. Further, in February  2015, the Coast Guard Commandant testified before a congressional  subcommittee that the Coast Guard\u2019s mission demands continue to  grow and evolve and that given the age and condition of some of its  legacy assets, the success of future missions relies on the continued  recapitalization of Coast Guard aircraft, cutters, boats, and  infrastructure. To meet these challenges, the Coast Guard is taking  steps to provide more transparency regarding asset resource hours  needed to support strategic commitments and the remaining resource  hours available to field unit commanders. For example, starting in  fiscal year 2015, the Coast Guard began using a new data field to  track the time assets spent supporting its Arctic strategy.", "In conclusion, given that many of the assumptions underlying the Coast  Guard\u2019s acquisition plans have changed since 2005 and are no longer  accurate, and the importance of ensuring that limited acquisition  resources are invested as efficiently and effectively as possible, the Coast  Guard should continue to follow through with our recommendations to  identify the cost, capability, and quantity of its fleet mix, as well as the  trade-offs that would need to be made given fiscal constraints.  Furthermore, to ensure that assets are deployed consistent with Coast  Guard mission priorities, the Coast Guard should follow through with  implementing our prior recommendations to improve its annual resource  allocation process.", "Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
