Ongoing costs of telework programs include training and managing the telework program and one-time costs include information technology set up. The ongoing cost most frequently cited by the selected agencies was personnel costs. However, GAO found that the selected agencies had little data to support the benefits or costs associated with their telework programs. All of the selected agencies could provide some supporting documentation for some of the benefits and only two could provide supporting documentation for some of the costs.", "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) collects data on telework via its annual data call and consults with the Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council about its annual telework report to Congress. However, GAO found substantial declines in agency reporting of telework cost savings to OPM. For example, in 2012, agencies reported 66 examples of telework cost savings, but a year later they reported 29 examples. Amidst this decline, OPM decided to collect less information about cost savings\u2014a key benefit of telework. OPM asked agencies for cost savings information in 2011, 2012, and 2013 but did not in its 2014-2015 agency data request. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 requires an annual assessment of agencies in meeting established outcome goals. Assessments that include information on benefits, net costs savings, and costs can help decision makers in determining the overall effects of their telework programs and the progress achieved. OPM officials stated that they streamlined the annual data request to focus on the act's requirements, which do not explicitly include reporting on cost savings. However, as a result of this decision Congress will have less information to assess the value of telework.", "OPM provides resources to agencies to help them with their telework programs, but may be missing other opportunities to help agencies better identify the net cost savings associated with their telework programs. The resources OPM offers include fee-for-service assistance to help implement or improve existing telework programs and training and webinars on responding to its annual data call. However, OPM guidance lacks information about how agencies can use existing data collection efforts to more readily identify benefits of their telework programs, and OPM has not provided guidance on how agencies should calculate the costs of their programs. By not taking advantage of existing data sources or having guidance on calculating costs, agencies are limited in their efforts to evaluate the net cost savings associated with their telework programs. As a result, Congress does not have the information it needs to assess the true value of telework, which could impact its ability to provide oversight of telework across the federal government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of OPM should include cost savings questions in future telework data calls and provide clarifying guidance on options for developing supporting data for benefits and costs.

While the OIG noted that EPA has begun to change its time  and attendance policies and practices, it identified a culture of  complacency among some EPA supervisors regarding time and  attendance controls, and taking prompt action against employees, and  the OIG recommended that the agency take measures to communicate  its commitment to internal controls.", "Although both DOT and EPA reported that they did not identify telework  risks associated with fraud, waste, or abuse, both reported taking actions  to avoid these risks. While EPA did not identify telework risks associated  with fraud, waste, or abuse in response to our questions, EPA officials did  describe actions the agency had taken to avoid such risks. EPA adopted  a new policy that requires employees to complete telework training prior  to being approved to telework, to annually recertify their telework  agreements, and to document their time and attendance telework status.  In the event of fraud, waste, or abuse, the policy allows management to  modify or terminate a telework agreement at any time.", "In addition, the Census and Commerce OIGs also reported on cases of  abuse and waste involving, but not limited to, telework. First, in 2015, the  Census OIG reported that employees in its Census Hiring and  Employment Check office engaged in time and attendance abuse\u2014some  of which involved employees who claimed to telework a full day with  evidence showing they performed little or no work at all. Second, the  Department of Commerce OIG uncovered waste in 2014 at the U.S.  Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board. At one  office, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board paid the employees  approximately $5 million for time in which employees were not working.", "DOT did not identify telework risks associated with fraud, waste, or  abuse, but it reported occasionally issuing preemptive guidance to hedge  against potential risks.

EPA and GSA are already using the data for  this purpose.", "Under OMB\u2019s Reduce the Footprint memorandum, CFO Act agencies are  required to submit plans that include the efficient use of office space and  to identify cost-effective alternatives to the acquisition of additional office  space, such as teleworking and hoteling. Agencies are also required to  specify annual reduction targets for domestic office and warehouse  space. If an agency requires less office space due to teleworking and  consolidates that space, this could result in agencies meeting reduction  targets, disposing of surplus properties, and using their real estate more  efficiently. DOT\u2019s 2016-2020 plan identified telework as a strategy to  consolidate office space and improve space management. DOT identified  the introduction of full-time telework as a contributing factor to closing the  Federal Highway Administration Legal Services and Resource Center  office in San Francisco, resulting in a reduction of 9,804 rentable square  feet. In addition, according to DOT, it anticipates that the combination of  alternative work schedules, telework, and shared workspace scenarios  will reduce the office workspaces designed in the future by at least 10  percent. GSA also identified telework as a contributing factor to its  headquarters renovation which resulted in a 40 percent reduction in office  space and $24.6 million in annual rent savings.", "Executive Order 13693 on planning for federal sustainability and its  implementing instructions requires agencies to submit and annually  update a plan focused on, among other things, specific agency strategies  to accomplish greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, including  approaches for achieving the goals and quantifiable metrics for agency  implementation. The data generated to measure a reduction in  greenhouse gas emissions could be partially a result of telework reducing  real estate use, utilities, and commuting. For example, GSA calculated  the environmental impact associated with its telework program by using  data generated for this order. In addition, EPA\u2019s 2014 plan recognized  that telework contributed to the agency\u2019s reduction of greenhouse gas  emissions by about 40 percent from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2013  because its telework program allowed staff to work from an alternate  location. The plan noted that telework decreased the greenhouse gas  emissions associated with employee commuting by reducing the number  of days employees commute to work each week.", "GSA also created the Carbon Footprint Tool (tool) to help agencies meet  the executive order\u2019s requirements, which can be used to calculate  greenhouse gas emissions avoided from teleworking. The tool calculates,  measures, and reports greenhouse gas emission reductions. The tool  allows agencies to change the number of teleworkers to calculate the  impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition,  the OPM data call does not include questions on costs incurred and  OPM\u2019s data call training materials do not discuss the types of costs that  agencies\u2019 telework programs may incur.

The act requires an assessment of  each agency\u2019s progress in meeting established telework-related outcome  goals. An evaluation of benefits and costs, which would assist agencies in  identifying net cost savings, provides a systematic framework for  assessing telework programs. Thus, an agency\u2019s potential to realize net  cost savings depends on its ability to develop data on costs incurred from  implementing the telework program. We have previously found that  federal agencies should establish measurable telework program goals  and processes, procedures or a tracking system to collect data to  evaluate their telework programs, and that complete and reliable  information is vital to assessing effectiveness.", "OPM officials said that it is difficult to provide government-wide guidance  on evaluating telework programs as agency use of telework to achieve  goals varies. Furthermore, OPM officials stated that it is difficult to identify  the effects of telework because it requires extensive research design and  a staff with the expertise and skills to conduct rigorous evaluations. For  example, OPM officials said that agencies vary in the resources available  to them to track and evaluate telework programs. In addition, OPM  officials said they do not have the resources to target and assist each  agency in establishing appropriate qualitative and quantitative measures  and teleworking goals. OPM officials also stated that agencies may not be  aware of all the available resources, including OPM\u2019s services for a fee.  However, the CHCO Council provides an additional avenue for OPM to  engage agencies on telework. As mentioned, the council receives  updates from OPM on agencies\u2019 annual telework reports and discusses  their implications and promising practices. Telework was discussed at the  February 2016 meeting.", "While we recognize that providing this guidance could be challenging,  some of the agencies we reviewed told us that they could benefit from  having such guidance.

A better understanding of the benefits achieved and costs  incurred via telework can help an agency determine the value of this tool.

Even though agencies are not  required to report on costs incurred by the act, Congress has a clear  interest in the value of this flexibility offered to the federal  workforce. Congress signaled its interest by assigning OPM a role in  reporting an assessment of each agency\u2019s progress in meeting telework  outcome goals that reflect benefits, such as the impact on recruitment  and retention and energy use. However, agencies continue to face  challenges in quantifying the impact of telework, identifying costs  incurred, and translating benefits into quantifiable cost savings. OPM can  work with the CHCO Council on methods to assist agencies in assessing  the benefits and costs associated with their telework programs.", "OPM did not ask agencies about cost savings in its 2014-2015 telework  data call despite a substantial decrease in the number of cost savings  examples reported associated with telework programs and the number of  agencies planning on tracking telework cost savings. However, the act  requires an assessment of each agency\u2019s progress in meeting telework- related outcome goals that reflect the benefits agencies can achieve and,  in some cases, these may be cost savings. In the current fiscal climate,  cost savings is an important measure of the success of telework  programs and the absence of these questions will likely result in agencies  reporting even more limited cost savings information than they do  currently.", "The six selected agencies had little supporting data for either the benefits  or costs associated with their telework programs. Such supporting data  are important to inform decision making about the value of telework.  Moreover, without data on net benefits including cost savings associated  with telework, agencies have incomplete information to determine the  value of telework through assessing whether the benefits being achieved  outweigh the costs incurred.

To determine the reliability of the data that OPM used in  the 2014 annual report to Congress, we reviewed our prior data reliability  assessments conducted on OPM\u2019s 2011 data call. In addition, we  consulted knowledgeable OPM officials about OPM\u2019s data collection  methods over time for its 2011, 2012, and 2013 telework data calls since  the enactment of the act. We did this to determine if significant changes  had occurred that might affect the reliability of the data in the 2014 annual  report. For the purposes of our review, we have determined that the data  are sufficiently reliable for providing contextual information on agencies  reporting telework participation, telework-related outcome goals, cost  savings from telework, barriers to telework participation, and methods to  overcoming these barriers.", "To identify the selected agencies, we compiled a universe of agencies  that had: reported achieving cost savings or a methodology for calculating  cost savings associated with telework programs in the 2013 OPM data  call, been identified by OPM as a leader, or were recipients of a 2013  telework Mobile Work Exchange award.

We selected a nongeneralizable sample of six  agencies: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC), General Services Administration (GSA),  Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Department of Transportation  (DOT), and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Initially we  had also selected the United States Patent and Trade Office.

We also  identified a third report focused on nonfederal telework programs that  provided a more detailed review of one-time and ongoing costs  associated with implementing and maintaining telework programs. In  addition, we conducted another literature review to check that the  inventory was not missing any key benefits or costs incurred.

In addition, we conducted  semi-structured interviews with selected agency officials on benefits,  costs incurred, and challenges associated with calculating benefits and  costs incurred. We analyzed this information to assess the extent that the  selected agencies have supporting data for the benefits and costs  associated with telework programs that the agencies identified. We  defined supporting data as having both a data source and a  corresponding methodology. Supporting data can be quantitative,  monetized, or qualitative. For example, emissions reductions connected  to telework can be measured in metric tons of carbon emissions reduced  or avoided. Cost savings can include spending on transit subsidies or  utility bills. Qualitative support for benefits might include responses from  open-ended survey questions or results from focus groups indicating that  telework has improved work/life balance. We reviewed whether the  selected agencies had supporting data and not the quality of the  supporting data because this was outside of the scope of our review. We  present the examples of supporting data for contextual purposes only.  Since FDIC initiated the agency\u2019s telework program in 2003, we included  supporting data that pre-dated the 2010 act.", "We used our previous report that found that agencies should establish  measurable telework program goals and processes, procedures or a  tracking system to collect data to evaluate the telework program.

In  addition, we interviewed the creator of the calculator and asked detailed  questions about some of its assumptions. In general, we found that the  creators of the calculator supported the assumptions employed by citing  studies and the findings of others. However, we noted certain limitations  in the literature cited. Specifically, we noted that because much of the  literature supporting the assumptions was based on the private sector,  there is less demonstrated applicability to the federal government. For  example, the calculator claimed unused sick days due to telework as a  financial benefit to the organization, given that unused sick days are  forfeited at the end of the year, which is not true for the federal  government (although the authors note that this can be adjusted in the  calculator). In addition, the paper assumes cost savings because of a  reduced footprint due to real estate savings. However, the paper does not  take into account that employees may tend to telework on similar days,  reducing the ability to achieve savings by sharing office space.", "In addition, OMB guidance on benefit-cost analysis suggests that  uncertainty be incorporated into a benefit-cost estimate and estimates of  outcomes presented with a range. In this way, policy makers can  determine not just what the most likely outcome is, but the distribution of  outcomes that are within the range of possibility.
