Top leadership commitment--a vision of diversity demonstrated and communicated throughout an organization by top-level management. Diversity as part of an organization's strategic plan--a diversity strategy and plan that are developed and aligned with the organization's strategic plan. Diversity linked to performance--the understanding that a more diverse and inclusive work environment can yield greater productivity and help improve individual and organizational performance. Measurement--a set of quantitative and qualitative measures of the impact of various aspects of an overall diversity program. Accountability--the means to ensure that leaders are responsible for diversity by linking their performance assessment and compensation to the progress of diversity initiatives. Succession planning--an ongoing, strategic process for identifying and developing a diverse pool of talent for an organization's potential future leaders. Recruitment--the process of attracting a supply of qualified, diverse applicants for employment. Employee involvement--the contribution of employees in driving diversity throughout an organization. Diversity training--organizational efforts to inform and educate management and staff about diversity. Experts and the literature generally agree that a combination of the identified practices should be considered when an organization is developing and implementing diversity management. We selected 10 agencies with the highest summary rankings from a 1999 governmentwide survey of federal agencies' diversity management programs to review for examples of the implementation of the identified practices. The implementation of the leading practices by these agencies may provide insights to other agencies as they undertake or attempt to strengthen or improve their own diversity management initiatives.

In  1987, a landmark report entitled Workforce 2000, written by researchers  with the Hudson Institute for the Department of Labor, described the  increasing diversity of the American workforce by the year 2000.  Among  the demographic changes the report projected was a rise in the average age  of the workforce and an increase in the number of women and minorities  entering the workforce.  Against this backdrop of expectations for an  increasingly diverse workforce, by the 1990s, an industry of consultants  had developed, offering books, videos, and training to sensitize workplaces  \u201cto the different perspectives and needs of a more diverse workforce.\u201d  Dr.  R. Roosevelt Thomas, Jr. is generally credited with originating the term  \u201cmanaging diversity\u201d in 1990.", "The concept of managing diversity includes everyone and therefore serves  as a complement to equal employment opportunity (EEO).  EEO focuses  on those groups protected by law from employment discrimination.  By  law, employment actions are to be free from prohibited discrimination on  such bases as race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability.  For purposes of this review, workforce diversity refers to ways  in which people in a workforce are similar and different from one another.   In addition to the characteristics protected by law, other similarities and  differences commonly cited by the literature include but are not limited to  background, education, language skills, personality, sexual orientation, and  work role.  OPM includes workforce diversity as a critical success factor  for one of the six elements of human capital leadership\u2014results-oriented  performance culture\u2014in its Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework.   OPM uses the critical success factors in this  framework when scoring a federal agency\u2019s implementation of Strategic  Human Capital under the President\u2019s Management Agenda.

Similarly, top management  commitment is a fundamental element in the implementation of diversity  management initiatives.  According to the literature, leaders and managers  within organizations are primarily responsible for the success of diversity  management because they must provide the visibility and commit the time  and necessary resources.  A leader committed to diversity management  communicates the organization\u2019s support for diversity in newsletters,  policy statements, speeches, meetings, and Web sites.  Communication of  this commitment from senior management throughout the organization  sends a clear message to others in the organization about the seriousness  and business relevance of diversity management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diversity as Part of the Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["Because successful change management initiatives in large public and  private sector organizations suggest that it can often take 5 to 7 years to  substantially complete such initiatives, it is important to institutionalize  them by integrating the initiatives into agencies\u2019 strategic planning efforts.", "As we have said, sustaining top leadership commitment to improvement is  particularly challenging in the federal government because of the turnover  of senior agency political officials.  In 2003, we reported that  governmentwide, the average tenure of political appointees for 1990  through 2001 was just under 3 years.  Integrating diversity management  into an organization\u2019s strategic plan fosters a culture change that supports  and values differences.  One recognized expert we talked with also pointed  out that an organization must link diversity to its overall strategic plan to  ensure that diversity initiatives are not viewed as an \u201cextra,\u201d which could  make them vulnerable to cuts, for example, when funds are tight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diversity Linked to Performance", "paragraphs": ["By focusing on diversity management and looking for more ways to be truly  inclusive, leading organizations have recognized that diversity can  contribute to the achievement of improved individual and organizational  performance.

For  example, promoting diversity might help an organization expand services  to meet the needs of a more diverse customer base.

Organizations also can track the  return they receive on investments in such areas as diversity training and recruitment to evaluate the progress they are making in those efforts.  In  addition to analyzing quantitative workforce data, organizations can use  qualitative data derived from interviews, focus groups, and surveys for  identifying employee perceptions\u2014including available opportunities and  work environment/culture\u2014among various segments of their workforces.   For example, organizations can ask employees a series of general  organizational questions in such areas as climate, organizational  commitment, promotions, job satisfaction, supervision, and performance  evaluations.  Over time, trends in responses are the types of qualitative  information that can help organizations assess how their diversity  initiatives are progressing in achieving organizational goals and objectives.   Finally, in a 2001 report on human capital and workforce diversity, the  National Academy of Public Administration stated that good performance  measurements shared some common traits regardless of the environment  in which they were used, including being based on reliable and accurate  data that are consistent and compatible with existing business systems and  processes.

An organization may make managers\u2019  performance ratings and compensation dependent, in part, on their success  in achieving diversity-related goals.  For federal senior executives, such  accountability is consistent with section 4313 of title 5, which provides  performance appraisal criteria for those in the Senior Executive Service  (SES), including the achievement of EEO requirements.  This  accountability also is consistent with EEOC\u2019s recent instructions to federal  agencies for implementing EEO Management Directive 715.  The  instructions describe the requirement that agencies inform managers and  supervisors that success and a positive evaluation will include an  assessment of how that manager contributes to the agency\u2019s EEO program  by emphasizing to managers and supervisors that equality of opportunity is  essential to attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified  workforce, with such a workforce being essential to ensuring the agency\u2019s  achievement of its strategic mission.", "Recognizing that an agency\u2019s people are vital assets and people achieve  organizational goals and results, OPM\u2019s regulations on SES performance  management call for appraisal of executives using measures that balance  organizational results with employee perspectives.  In 2002, we reported  that senior executives can foster fairness and diversity by protecting the  rights of all employees, providing a fair dispute resolution system, and  working to prevent discrimination through equality of employment and  opportunity.  We found examples of senior executive performance  expectations included (1) taking steps to implement EEO requirements;   (2) requiring all subordinate managers and supervisors to receive diversity  awareness and EEO training; and (3) establishing a zero tolerance standard  for discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Succession Planning", "paragraphs": ["Succession planning is a comprehensive, ongoing strategic process that  provides for forecasting an organization\u2019s senior leadership needs;  identifying and developing candidates who have the potential to be future  leaders; and selecting individuals from among a diverse pool of qualified  candidates to meet executive resource needs.  Succession planning and  management can help an organization become what it needs to be, rather  than simply recreate the existing organization.  Leading organizations go  beyond a \u201creplacement\u201d approach that focuses on identifying particular  individuals as possible successors for specific top-ranking positions and  engage in broad, integrated succession planning and management efforts  that focus on strengthening both current and future capacity.  They  anticipate the need for leaders and other key employees with the necessary  competencies to successfully meet the complex challenges of the 21st  century.", "Succession planning also is tied to the federal government\u2019s opportunity to  change the diversity of the executive corps through new appointments.  As we testified in October 2003, the federal government faces large losses in  its SES, primarily through retirement but also because of other normal  attrition.  The SES generally represents the most experienced and senior  segment of the federal workforce.  The expected loss of more than half of  current career SES members through fiscal year 2007, as well as significant  attrition in the GS-15 and GS-14 workforce\u2014the key source for SES  appointments\u2014has important implications for federal agencies and  underscores the need for effective succession planning.  This presents the  government with substantial challenges for ensuring an able management  cadre and also presents opportunities to affect the composition of the SES.   In September 2003, we reported that agencies in other countries use  succession planning and management to achieve a more diverse  workforce, maintain their leadership capacity, and increase the retention of  high-potential staff.

In addition, the literature discusses the  importance of organizations building formal relationships with such  schools to ensure the cultivation of talent for future talent pools.  The  literature states that organizations also may want to consider partnering  with multicultural professional organizations and speaking at their  conferences to communicate their commitment to diversity to external  audiences and strengthen and maintain relationships.  Although the focus  of recruitment efforts in the diversity management literature is with  colleges and universities, given the number of federal employees, including  those in the SES, who are eligible for retirement in the next few years, there  will be a need for the federal government to also recruit midcareer  employees, which we are defining as employees who are generally 40 and  over and have 10 or more years of work experience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employee Involvement", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature, involving employees in diversity management  helps them contribute to driving diversity throughout an organization.

Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  U. S. Government Accountability Office  Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the draft report, Diversity  Management:  Expert-Identified Leading Practices and Agency Examples (GAO-05-90).", "I commend you for identifying leading diversity management practices and their use in  the federal government.  Expanding agency knowledge of the available tools to achieve diversity  is critical to the government\u2019s success in maintaining a workplace that is inclusive and  responsive to the needs of an increasingly diverse workforce.", "The agency examples included in the report should demonstrate the principles of  workforce diversity.  Federal agencies can learn from the experiences and successes of others.", "While this report will assist in that effort, additional studies are clearly needed to explore this  area in more depth.", "EEOC believes that Management Directive-715 will be an invaluable tool to help  agencies to improve their workforce diversity and could assist in this effort.  As you know,  EEOC expects to begin receiving federal agency MD-715 reports beginning in January, 2005   and EEOC can begin providing data that would facilitate GAO\u2019s knowledge base in such an  evaluation.  In short, future studies of this area are warranted to evaluate whether the identified  diversity management practices have actually achieved or improved workforce diversity in  general or in the federal agencies covered.", "One of the nine important factors to diversity management GAO cites is \u201cmeasurement.\u201d", "A future study could also examine  initiatives to measure diversity and  how particular measures  relate  to the cited practices.  Because GAO reports are widely read throughout the federal  government and viewed as being highly authoritative, and because there are so few reports on  diversity in the federal sector, future studies could explore in more depth the effectiveness of  leading diversity practices.", "The Honorable David M. Walker  This report defines diversity as the ways in which people in a workforce are similar and different  from each other, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, background, education,   work role and personality. A future report might provide a discussion of the means through   which agencies can determine how the multitude of similarities and differences that individuals  bring to the workplace are important to creating a \u201chigh performance organization\u201d with \u201ca  positive work environment where . . . all can reach their potential and maximize their  contributions to an organization's strategic goals and objectives.\u201d", "Such a study would be a valuable supplement to this report. Several organizations in this  area could be consulted in studying the relationships among these variables such as Diversity  Inc. and the National Multicultural Institute. Diversity Inc, for example, periodically publishes  various lists showing the top companies for diversity and which also purport to show a  relationship between diversity and profitability.", "Again, thank you for the opportunity to submit the EEOC\u2019s views on your draft report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Karin K.
