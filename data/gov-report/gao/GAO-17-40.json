For example, over half of the respondents (54 percent) reported that interpreting the revised STCW requirements was a challenge. To address this issue, Coast Guard has ongoing outreach efforts to obtain feedback from training providers, help them interpret Coast Guard's regulations, and determine what additional guidance is needed. Almost half of the respondents (46 percent) reported that recruiting qualified course instructors was a challenge. However, Coast Guard stated that the revised requirements related to instructor's qualifications have not changed substantially; therefore, the challenge experienced with recruiting instructors may be related to specific training providers, rather than to the revised STCW requirements. Training providers not expecting to meet the deadline for implementing the revised STCW requirements (19 percent) provided various reasons, such as a lack of funding to address the requirements, needing additional Coast Guard guidance, or lacking the time to complete the required documentation.", "Coast Guard evaluated the costs and benefits of the revised STCW requirements, and training providers who responded to GAO's survey reported related impacts of implementing the revised requirements. For example, Coast Guard evaluated the average costs to training providers for developing a QSS and the costs for conducting STCW audits. About half of the surveyed training providers expected their costs would be similar to Coast Guard's estimates. About one third anticipated incurring costs higher than the Coast Guard's average estimate due to needing more time for administrative tasks than Coast Guard allowed or purchasing additional training equipment. Coast Guard officials said they estimated average costs, and therefore did not consider specific items that particular training providers may need. Over half of training providers agreed with Coast Guard's assessment of potential benefits from the revised STCW requirements, such as increased vessel safety, with most of the remaining providers expecting no effect from the STCW changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. merchant marine\u2014the commercial ships of the United States  and the mariners who operate them\u2014is a critical component of the U.S.  freight transportation sector and contributes billions of dollars to the  country\u2019s national output.

To incorporate the 2010 amendments to the IMO\u2019s Standards of Training,  Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Convention, Coast  Guard issued a final rule on December 24, 2013 (referred to as the  STCW final rule). To be consistent with the international standards, the  revised STCW requirements must be fully implemented by January 1,  2017. In general, the revised STCW implementation process consists of  activities such as ensuring that instructors obtain additional training,  providers update the training curriculum to reflect the revised STCW  requirements, and providers develop a quality assurance policy, among  other things. About 60,000 U.S. mariners, 316 owners and operators of  1,044 U.S. flag vessels, and 167 STCW maritime training providers will  be affected by the revised STCW requirements.

The STCW final rule is intended to  strengthen U.S. authority to enforce the STCW convention and code  against foreign-flag vessels in U.S. waters. Similarly, Coast Guard  officials noted that it is important that all U.S. flagged seagoing vessels  visiting foreign ports employ only mariners who are fully compliant with  the STCW requirements because doing so prevents U.S. flagged vessels  from being detained while docked in foreign ports.", "In 2014, we reviewed the availability of maritime training, the availability  of financial assistance for maritime training, and Maritime Administration  (MARAD) actions to ensure mariners meet commerce and defense needs  and industry stakeholder views on those actions. We found that the costs  associated with required maritime training\u2014whether borne by the  mariners or by entities such as federal agencies\u2014vary depending on the  type of training and the training provider. For example, at that time  several stakeholders estimated that the cost of Coast Guard-required  entry-level mariner training\u2014including basic safety training and other up- front costs for required physical exams and drug tests\u2014ranged from  about $1,500 to $3,000. In another example, a large private-training  provider reported that one week of training\u2014mostly designed for current  mariners seeking to advance their careers or keep up with training  requirements\u2014cost about $1,300 per mariner. Based on our 2014  analysis, we found that for prospective mariners enrolled in their first year  at state maritime academies, tuition, fees, and room and board costs for  an in-state mariner could be as high as $29,000 or as low as $19,000 per  year, depending on the academy.", "Maritime training providers have raised questions in testimony to  Congress and in comments to the proposed STCW rule regarding the  guidance Coast Guard has provided to them and the cost of implementing  the new STCW requirements.

Furthermore, of the  training providers who reported that they sought clarification on the  requirements from resources such as the Coast Guard\u2019s call center, five  respondents reported receiving ambiguous or conflicting information, one  stated that representatives would read the guidance documents rather  than provide explanations, and another stated that the representatives  are more proficient in credentialing requirements rather than STCW  requirements. When we asked Coast Guard about these challenges,  officials responded that in addition to revising the NVICs based on  training provider feedback, they also prepared responses for individual  questions and have outreach activities planned as Coast Guard seeks to  provide clarification to the providers.", "State maritime academies also reported challenges interpreting the  revised STCW requirements. For example, officials from one state  maritime academy stated that some of the revised STCW requirements  became clear after they were subjected to a Coast Guard audit.  Furthermore, other state maritime academy officials we interviewed  stated that Coast Guard\u2019s guidance does not offer much assistance to  academies; as a result, the academies should be given separate STCW  guidance that takes into consideration the academic system in which they  operate. When asked about these challenges noted by the state maritime  academies, Coast Guard officials stated that they are determining the  type of guidance necessary to assist the state maritime academies and  plan to develop guidance for the maritime academies in the future.", "Recruiting qualified instructors: Recruiting qualified instructors to teach  STCW-related courses was the next most frequently reported challenge  with 46 percent of respondents reporting it as a challenge. According to  Coast Guard guidance, requesting approval of new instructors as of  March 2014 should include documentation of the proposed instructor\u2019s  experience, training, or evidence of the ability to use effective instructional  techniques that could include train-the-trainer certification. In their survey  responses, five training providers reported that these requirements have  decreased the supply of qualified instructors to teach STCW courses and  three reported that instructors will require higher compensation. In  addition, several of the training providers reported that qualified  instructors may be unaffordable to some providers or the increased costs  may be passed on to the mariners seeking STCW-related training.  Additionally, the supply of qualified instructors is declining, especially for  engineering instructors, according to 11 training providers. Seven  providers reported that the cost or time commitment required for potential  instructors to acquire the additional qualifications is a challenge. In  addition, one provider reported that some qualified mariners who could  potentially serve as faculty may not be interested in meeting the rigorous  STCW faculty requirements. Two other providers reported that some  qualified mariners may opt to take more competitive salaries at sea rather  than working as instructors. The Coast Guard acknowledged the effort  required for instructors to be compliant, but stated that the revised  guidance has not changed substantially regarding instructor qualification  and that instructors have always been expected to hold appropriate  credentials to teach maritime courses. In addition, the Coast Guard  officials stated that they are unable to speak to the challenge of recruiting  qualified instructors for any specific training providers.", "Developing QSS: Almost half of the training providers\u201346 percent\u2013 reported that developing the organizations\u2019 QSS was a challenge to  meeting the deadline. One provider reported that due to the QSS  development cost, it will not develop such a system and therefore may  lose its STCW training status. Six providers reported that they believe the  QSS requirement is an unnecessary administrative burden and expense  to the providers, especially for small providers that may stop offering  STCW courses because of the cost that may be associated with  developing a QSS, according to a maritime professional. Two survey  respondents also stated that they were reluctant to dedicate resources to  developing a QSS because it was unclear at the time of our survey what  would be required to be fully compliant. In addition, most state maritime  academy officials we interviewed reported that a QSS is redundant since  the academy\u2019s accreditation status already ensures the quality of the  maritime training programs. With regards to cost, Coast Guard officials  stated that any cost incurred from developing a QSS is dependent on the  provider since the process requires documenting what providers do to  ensure program quality and compliance. According to Coast Guard  officials, regarding the redundancy of a QSS, the maritime academies  provided this comment during the development of the STCW final rule  and in response text was added to the regulation to enable the Coast  Guard to take accreditation body requirements into account when  assessing compliance with applicable QSS requirements. As of  November 2016, the Coast Guard is developing the policy to implement  this regulatory flexibility for the maritime academies. In addition, Coast  Guard officials stated that potential guidance may result after Coast  Guard explores how the accreditation process could be used to fulfill the  QSS requirements.", "Developing curriculum: Based on our survey, 44 percent of  respondents reported that developing curriculum to meet the revised  STCW requirements is an implementation challenge. For example, three  providers reported that the curriculum development process related to  STCW requirements is arduous, vague, or expensive. Two providers  reported that having a sample curriculum related to STCW requirements  would be helpful. In addition, one provider reported that academies  needed more time to implement the STCW requirement changes within  their academic systems to accommodate the needs of the cadet. When  asked about this challenge, Coast Guard officials acknowledged there  can be costs associated with curriculum development, but noted that the  Coast Guard STCW regulation and policy guidance issued in January  2014 match the standards set by the IMO.", "Willingness to stay in the industry: According to some survey  respondents, the effort required by mariners to comply with the revised  STCW requirements may result in some mariners leaving the industry.  Forty-one percent of the survey respondents reported that the willingness  of STCW-certified merchant mariners to remain employed in the industry  following the revised STCW requirements poses a challenge. In the  narrative responses, ten training providers reported that more mariners  may leave the industry or are looking for other employment options  because it is too difficult to maintain a merchant mariner credential under  the revised requirements. Training providers we interviewed also stated  that some mariners are opting to retire rather than meeting the new  requirements. Three narrative responses also noted that maintaining the  credential is expensive because of the cost of training, cost of travel to  attend training including lodging expenses, as well as the corresponding  loss of wages experienced when mariners are not at sea while they  attend training. Two survey respondents indicated that sometimes  mariners pay these costs out of pocket or some costs may be covered by  unions. When we asked about the challenge of mariner\u2019s willingness to  stay in the industry, Coast Guard officials stated that the guidance  provides the minimum standards required of mariners and they have the  flexibility to choose the courses or programs they wish to take. Coast  Guard also acknowledged that some mariners may gravitate towards  professions that give greater flexibility to their schedule and work-life  balance.", "In addition to the challenges listed in the survey, survey respondents  identified other challenges in their narrative responses, including the need  for better harmonization of the Coast Guard\u2019s training for domestic  waterways and the STCW requirements. One provider reported that it has  to use resources to cross-check both requirements to ensure that its  program is accurate and in agreement. Academy officials we interviewed  also reported that the overlapping of the domestic and STCW  requirements is a strain on the time and resources of the academies.  Coast Guard officials responded that in cases where a specific topic  meets both a domestic and STCW requirement, it is only required to be  done once and documented as meeting the STCW requirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Assessed Costs and Benefits of STCW Implementation, and Training Providers We Surveyed Reported Varying Perspectives on STCW Costs and Benefits", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard Assessed Costs and Benefits in Accordance with Key Practices for Federal Rulemaking", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard estimated the costs and benefits of implementing the  revised STCW requirements in its regulatory analysis of the STCW final  rule. Costs and benefits are two of the four elements that the Office of  Management and Budget and GAO have identified as important to any  regulatory assessment for federal rulemaking, and based on our analysis,  Coast Guard\u2019s rulemaking for implementing STCW regulatory revisions  addressed all four elements. Coast Guard estimated the total present  value cost of implementing the revised STCW requirements over 10 years  to be $228.9 million, or about $32.6 million annually. Coast Guard estimates included implementation costs associated with four general  areas\u2014mariner training, medical examination, sea service, and training  providers. As shown in figure 6, Coast Guard estimated the majority of  costs were to meet mariner training requirements.", "Coast Guard also identified qualitative benefits expected from  implementing the revised STCW requirements that would result from  increased and consistent training and enhanced medical evaluation.  Expected benefits included, for example, an increase in vessel safety and  a decrease in the risk of accidents. Coast Guard officials told us that they  did not quantify the benefits of implementing the revised STCW  requirements because of uncertainty about the relationship between  training and human factors involved in accidents. Officials stated that to  estimate benefits, Coast Guard reviewed studies on the effectiveness of  training in other industrial settings, but because of the difference in  contexts and the range of measures of effectiveness, they concluded that  the benefits transfer was not robust enough to quantify benefits for  STCW. Instead, Coast Guard conducted a \u201cbreak-even\u201d analysis of the  expected benefits, noting that break-even analyses are used for situations  where benefits from a regulatory action cannot be quantified. Such  analyses are intended to answer the question: \u201cHow small could the non- quantified benefits be before the rule would yield zero net benefits?\u201d We  describe the Coast Guard\u2019s benefits estimates in more detail below.", "Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to periodically review significant  regulations to identify those that may be outmoded, ineffective,  insufficient or excessively burdensome, and to modify the regulations  according to what has been learned.

Specifically, in estimating the costs of implementing the revised STCW  requirements, Coast Guard estimated average dollar costs for small and  non-small training providers across five cost categories. For example,  using Coast Guard estimates, the average cost for initial auditor  training\u2014one of the five cost categories\u2014for small providers was $3,499  and for non-small providers was $16,023. Across these five cost  categories, about half of responding training providers (46 to 50 percent)  indicated that their costs would be similar to Coast Guard\u2019s cost  estimates, as shown in figure 7 below. About a third of respondents (28 to  39 percent) expect costs to be higher than Coast Guard estimated and 2  to 14 percent anticipated costs lower than Coast Guard\u2019s estimates. In  addition, a small number of providers (between 10 and 13) responded  \u201cother\u201d to these questions. For example, one provider who indicated  \u201cother\u201d when comparing anticipated costs to Coast Guard estimates said  \u201cour training system is much more complex than any other commercial  provider\u201d while another stated \u201cmy training school consists of a single all- in-one manager/owner/instructor.\u201d", "Some survey respondents identified costs that they did not believe were  included in Coast Guard\u2019s average estimates for training providers. For  example, while Coast Guard included estimates for developing QSS  procedures, several training providers indicated that new QSS  requirements could involve more administrative time than estimated by  Coast Guard. Officials at one maritime academy indicated that they  allocated 9 hours per week to maintain the STCW system and believed  that the Coast Guard\u2019s average estimates \u201cdid not come close to the true  costs\u201d incurred by a large training provider. Officials at another maritime  academy indicated that implementing the requirements would require  \u201cmore courses, more assessments, more record keeping, more  simulation.\u201d Coast Guard officials told us that they plan to consult with  state academies about the perceived impacts related to implementing the  requirements. A recently purchased simulator used for STCW training at  a maritime academy is displayed in figure 8.", "In addition to administrative costs, academy officials stated that the extra  days of sea time required under the revised STCW requirements cost an  additional $7,000 a week to operate and staff the ship. Coast Guard  stated that it developed its cost estimates for a typical or average entity,  and therefore the costs used for estimating national effects did not include  costs that a specific entity might incur. When asked for their perspectives  on the training providers\u2019 view of the cost of the revised STCW  requirements, Coast Guard officials stated that providers had the  opportunity to comment on the Coast Guard cost estimates during the  supplemental notice period and those comments were adjudicated and  applicable text amended before the final rule was issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Perspectives on Benefits of the Revised STCW Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In estimating the benefits of implementing the revised STCW  requirements, Coast Guard identified nine categories of potential benefits.

For example, as shown in  figure 9 below, 70 percent of training providers indicated that increased  mariner situational awareness was a benefit of the STCW regulatory  revisions. Also, between zero and nine providers across categories  reported the effects might be negative, rather than provide benefits, with  one state maritime academy noting that the documentation required to  demonstrate compliance with STCW\u2014much of which has to be  completed at sea\u2014is cumbersome.", "Training providers varied by type of organization in their perspectives of  the benefits of implementing the revised STCW requirements. For  example, the U.S. Merchant Maritime Academy and most of state  maritime academies\u2019 cadet programs (4 of 6) and union training providers  (3 of 5) expected that implementing the revised STCW requirements  would have no effect on the potential benefit of decreasing the risk of  property loss, whereas with other types of providers, such as colleges  and universities, most (10 of 15) expected a positive effect from the  benefit."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS and the Department of  Transportation (DOT) for review and comment.

Out of the universe of 167 STCW training  providers, 136 responded for a response rate of 81 percent. Of those  responding, 10 indicated they were not currently teaching STCW courses.  As such, we removed these respondents from our sample resulting in a  total population of 126 training providers teaching at least one STCW  course, and subject to STCW regulatory requirements. Not all  respondents answered every question so the response rate varied by  question.

In addition, to  supplement training provider information gathered by the survey, we  interviewed officials at the federal maritime academy and the state  maritime academies to understand their unique perspective on  implementing the revised STCW requirements. Four of the six state  maritime academies and the federal maritime academy were interviewed  by phone, and we conducted site visits at two state academies\u2014Texas  A&M at Galveston Maritime Academy and the Great Lakes Maritime  Academy. These academies were selected because both academies had  been recently audited by the Coast Guard for STCW compliance and  could share what was learned from the audits.
