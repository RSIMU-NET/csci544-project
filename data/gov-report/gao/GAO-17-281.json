However, none of the cost estimates for the selected investments exhibited all of these characteristics. Only one estimate\u2014for the Customer Relationship Management investment\u2014more than minimally met best practices associated with any of the four characteristics because it partially met the practices for a comprehensive and accurate estimate. The remaining three investments minimally or did not meet the best practices associated with the four characteristics. For example, the Enterprise Data Warehouse estimate minimally met all four characteristics; the Enterprise Voucher Management System estimate did not meet the characteristic for being accurate and minimally met the other three characteristics; and the Federal Housing Administration Automation and Modernization estimate did not meet the characteristic for being credible, while minimally meeting the remaining characteristics (see table).", "The significant weaknesses in the cost estimates for the selected investments can largely be attributed to the department's lack of guidance for developing reliable cost estimates. HUD officials responsible for the selected investments stated that the department had not required the development of estimates that exhibit the four characteristics of a reliable estimate. As a result, according to these officials, cost estimating practices have been decentralized and inconsistent across the department. While HUD drafted guidance in June 2015 that was intended to conform to the best practices in GAO's Cost Guide , the department has not yet finalized the guidance because it has focused on establishing the infrastructure needed to support improved cost estimation practices.

This  resulted in a list of nine potential modernization investments. From this  list, we then chose the four modernization investments that comprised the  largest portion of the funding requested, 81 percent, for fiscal year 2017.", "For each of the four selections, we assessed the reliability of the  investments\u2019 cost estimates by comparing the estimates and supporting  documentation to the best practices discussed in the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide (Cost Guide).

Its systems also support the processing of  applications for, and the management of, more than 50 grant programs  administered by the department.", "However, according to HUD, its IT environment has not been sufficient to  effectively support business functions because its systems are  overlapping and duplicative, not integrated, necessitate manual  workloads, and employ antiquated technologies that are costly to  maintain. The department has reported that its environment consists of: over 200 information systems, many of which perform the same  function and, thus, are overlapping and duplicative;  stove-piped, nonintegrated systems that result in identical data  existing in multiple systems; manual processing for business functions due to a lack of systems to  support these processes; and antiquated technology (15 to 30 years old) and complex systems that  are costly to maintain.", "To address challenges with its IT environment, HUD has developed a  number of plans in recent years to guide its modernization efforts.

However, none  of the estimates fully met this practice, in part because investment  documentation did not completely define system requirements, reflect  current schedules, and demonstrate that efforts were technically  reasonable. Further, work breakdown structures that had been developed  were not sufficiently detailed for any of the investments to ensure that  cost elements were neither omitted nor double counted, and allowed for  traceability between the investment\u2019s costs and schedule by deliverable,  such as hardware or software components.", "Moreover, although various assumptions were factored into the cost  estimate for the Customer Relationship Management investment, the  basis for the assumptions was not documented and, as a result, their  reasonableness could not be determined. For the remaining three  investments, where information was limited and judgments had to be  made, the estimates did not contain cost-influencing ground rules and  assumptions.", "Well-documented. The four investments did not develop well- documented cost estimates because none were supported by detailed  documentation that described how the estimate was derived and how the  expected funding would be spent. This characteristic\u2019s best practices  were minimally met by all of the investments. In discussing the estimating  methodologies used to develop the estimates, HUD officials reported  using analogy, expert opinion, parametric, and other methods; however,  the department did not document the specific methodologies used for any  of the investments.", "Specifically, HUD did not adequately document for each estimate the  sources of data used, any assessments of data accuracy and reliability,  and other circumstances affecting the data, such as the details related to  calculations performed. The estimating information for the investments  also was not captured in a way that the data used could be easily  replicated and updated. Further, the documentation did not sufficiently  discuss the technical baseline\u2014which is intended to serve as the basis  for developing an estimate by providing a common definition of the  investment\u2014or how the data were normalized.", "In addition, while HUD officials reported briefing management on each of  the investments and on the high-level estimate for the Enterprise Voucher  Management System, the department did not brief management on the  ground rules and assumptions underlying the estimate. A cost estimate is  not considered valid until management has approved it, yet the  department did not provide documentation that any of the four cost  estimates had been reviewed and accepted by management.", "Accurate. Overall, the four estimates were not accurate because only  one estimate partially addressed the best practices associated with this  characteristic, two estimates minimally addressed the best practices, and  one estimate did not meet any of the associated practices. As such, we  could not determine whether the cost estimates provided results that were  unbiased and were not overly conservative or optimistic. More  specifically, the estimate for the Customer Relationship Management  investment partially addressed the best practices in that its calculations  did not contain errors and actual costs from existing programs or  historical data were used to develop the estimate. However, analyses had  not been performed for any of the investments to ensure that the cost  estimates were based on an assessment of most likely costs.", "In addition, none of the investments\u2019 estimates had been properly  adjusted for inflation to ensure that cost data were expressed in  consistent terms, which is important because doing so can help to  prevent cost overruns. For example, officials for the Federal Housing  Administration Automation and Modernization investment stated that the  cost data had not been adjusted for inflation or normalized to constant  year dollars to remove the effects of inflation. Further, the estimating  techniques used to determine costs were not documented, which  prevented an assessment of the accuracy of any calculations performed.  Finally, while HUD officials responsible for the investments stated that the  estimates were grounded in historical data, such as actual costs from  comparable investments, they did not provide evidence to support this  assertion for all four investments.", "Credible. Three of the investments minimally met the best practices  associated with developing a credible cost estimate and one investment  did not meet the practices. Specifically, the estimates did not fully discuss  limitations of the analyses because of uncertainty or biases surrounding  the data or assumptions. For example, none of the investments  conducted a sensitivity analysis, which is intended to reveal how the cost  estimate is affected by a change in a single assumption and allows for the  cost estimator to understand which variable most affects the cost  estimate.", "In addition, risk and uncertainty analyses were not conducted in a manner  that conformed to the practices in the Cost Guide. For example, while  HUD officials responsible for Enterprise Data Warehouse and Customer  Relationship Management investments stated that risks were evaluated,  evidence supporting these assertions was not provided. In addition, risk  documentation was provided for the Federal Housing Administration  Automation and Modernization investment, but the analysis was limited   to a portion of the investment and, therefore, did not provide a  comprehensive view of the level of risk and the degree of uncertainty  associated with the estimate.", "Moreover, department officials stated that cross checks were conducted  for three of the investments\u2019 estimates to determine whether applying  other methods produced similar results; however, evidence was not  provided to demonstrate how this was done. Lastly, an independent cost  estimate developed by a group outside of the acquiring organization was  not conducted to validate the reasonableness of the cost estimates  developed for the four investments.  (Additional details on our assessments of the four investments\u2019 cost  estimates can be found in appendix I.)", "The significant weaknesses in the cost estimates can largely be attributed  to the department\u2019s lack of established guidance for developing reliable  cost estimates, which is contrary to our prior work related to disciplined  processes. HUD officials responsible for the selected investments\u2019  estimates stated that department guidance had not yet been established  and that IT investments were not required to develop estimates that  exhibit the four characteristics of a reliable estimate. As a result,  according to these officials, cost estimating practices are inconsistently  implemented across the department and are decentralized because of the  reliance on the efforts and experience of various subject matter experts  and contractors.", "With regard to improving its cost estimating practices, in January 2014,  the department began efforts to develop cost estimating guidance by  conducting an internal review of approaches used for developing  estimates. Following this review, the department drafted guidance in June  2015 that was intended to conform to best practices in the Cost Guide. In  August 2016, officials from the Offices of Strategic Planning and  Management, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Information  Officer stated that HUD was in the process of further developing the  guidance to reflect cost estimating best practices. However, as of  December 2016, the guidance had not yet been established. According to  the officials, finalizing the guidance has been a challenge due to  competing priorities within the department, such as addressing  weaknesses in its governance structure and management processes.  Additionally, these officials stated that the department\u2019s focus has been  on establishing an infrastructure that is expected to enable  implementation of better cost estimating practices. Moving forward, the  officials stated that they expect to continue efforts to finalize and establish  the guidance in the future, although time frames for doing so had not  been determined.", "Until HUD establishes guidance that calls for the implementation of best  practices identified in the Cost Guide, the department is less likely to  develop reliable cost estimates for its IT investments that can serve as  the basis for informed investment decision making.
