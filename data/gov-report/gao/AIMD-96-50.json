The primary goal of OMB 2000 was to integrate OMB\u2019s budget analysis, management review, and policy development roles under a new structure to improve the decisionmaking process and oversight of executive branch operations. The objectives of our review were to describe (1) changes in OMB\u2019s organizational structure, responsibilities, and staffing as a result of OMB 2000; (2) changes to OMB\u2019s three statutory offices; (3) changes in the attention OMB gave to management issues in the budget formulation process before and after OMB 2000; and (4) the way OMB planned to evaluate OMB 2000.

However, because the interviews were not a random sample drawn from all components of OMB, the information obtained from them is not generalizable to all OMB employees. We reviewed budget documents that related to four executive departments and one agency: the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Labor, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency. To obtain access to OMB\u2019s internal budget review documents, we agreed to keep the information the documents contained confidential and to describe examples from them that illustrated the changes before and after OMB 2000 in a general manner.", "In contrast to our 1989 general management review of OMB, this review focused on a specific reorganization initiative. As agreed with your offices, our review was descriptive rather than evaluative in nature because, at the time we started our review, it was too early to evaluate this complex and significant reorganization of OMB. Moreover, it was very difficult to separate the influence of OMB 2000 from concurrent management reform initiatives, such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) or other components of NPR.

During the past 50 years, a number of presidential advisory groups have recommended changes designed to strengthen the Office\u2019s central management leadership. In response to the recommendations of one of these groups, the Bureau of the Budget was reorganized in 1970 and renamed OMB, thereby signaling the intent to heighten the management focus in the agency. However, the creation of OMB did not produce an institutionalized capacity for governmentwide management leadership. OMB\u2019s budget role continued to dominate management responsibilities, and its capacity to provide management direction for the executive branch remained a persistent concern. Observers have debated how to best ensure that management issues are not overwhelmed by budgeting pressures. Some observers have advocated integrating the two functions, while others have proposed the creation of dedicated offices, or even a separate agency to provide governmentwide management leadership.", "Previous OMB reorganizations have reflected these different points of view, alternating between integrating management into the budget review process and creating separate management offices. Proponents of integrating management into the budget review process believed doing so could increase the attention both OMB examiners and agencies give to management issues by linking these issues to budgetary consequences. However, budget issues have tended over time to squeeze out management issues and erode attempts to dedicate specific resources to management. On the other hand, proponents of creating separate management offices believed the separation of management and budget functions could help ensure a consistent level of attention to specific management issues. However, these offices may have marginal impact in leading changes at the agencies without the influence of potential budgetary consequences.", "Our 1989 report on OMB examined the agency\u2019s repeated reorganizations and management improvement efforts and concluded that OMB had been unable to coordinate its management and budget functions effectively and had not established a stable management capacity. We found that OMB\u2019s short-term, budget-driven focus often made it difficult for the agency to address long-term management problems. We recommended that OMB (1) establish a systematic process within the annual budget cycle for identifying and overseeing agency progress on key management issues, (2) give budget divisions the responsibility and resources to oversee agency implementation of management policy, (3) improve coordination between management and budget staff, and (4) consider creating the position of Deputy Director for Management (DDM).", "Congress has used its legislative power for the past two decades to help direct OMB\u2019s governmentwide management leadership. For example, the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 required OMB to help establish guidelines agencies could use to evaluate their internal control systems. To increase attention to certain management problems, Congress created three separate statutory offices in OMB focused on specific management areas: the Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) to guide the establishment of systems and controls needed for agencies\u2019 financial management; the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to provide overall direction for executive agencies\u2019 procurement policies, regulations, and procedures; and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to direct and oversee agencies\u2019 management of information resources and reduction of unnecessary paperwork. In addition, in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Congress established the DDM position to strengthen federal management in general. In 1993, Congress also required OMB to lead the implementation of GPRA, which was designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs by establishing in each agency a system for setting goals for program performance and measuring results. Congress did not create a separate office in OMB for GPRA, but OMB initially placed responsibility for that function in its General Management Division, where responsibility for other governmentwide management initiatives was housed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in OMB\u2019s Organizational Structure, Responsibilities, and Staffing", "paragraphs": ["OMB 2000 altered OMB\u2019s organizational structure and the responsibilities of units within that structure.

Each RMO consists of at least one division, with several branches in each division. OMB 2000 created new staff positions, moved staff to different units within the new structure, and made other staffing changes. Overall, the RMOs were assigned about 26 percent more staff than the former budget program areas had, although OMB\u2019s total fiscal year 1994 staffing allocation (556 full-time equivalents) was unchanged.

Before OMB 2000, OMB had separate management offices that examined agencies\u2019 implementation of management initiatives. OMB had a General Management Division prior to OMB 2000 that was responsible for, among other things, performance measurement, program evaluation, and federal personnel and property management issues. In addition, OMB has three management-related offices that were created by statute: OFFM, OFPP, and OIRA. OMB reassigned staff from both the former budget program areas and the management offices to the RMOs to examine agencies\u2019 specific management, budget, and policy issues. Figure 1 shows OMB\u2019s organization before OMB 2000.", "The National Security and International Affairs and the Natural Resources, Energy, and Science budget program areas became RMOs with comparable agency coverage. The Health budget program area became the Health and Personnel RMO and acquired responsibility for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of Personnel Management, the Executive Office of the President, and the Postal Service. Some of the Human Resources budget program area\u2019s examining responsibilities (such as responsibility for the Department of Veterans Affairs) were moved elsewhere. Coincident with these changes, the Human Resources budget program area became an RMO. Finally, the Economics and Government budget program area became the General Government and Finance RMO, maintaining responsibility for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Treasury; and federal financial institutions; and adding responsibility for the General Services Administration. (The RMOs\u2019 organizational structure and examining responsibilities are illustrated in app. III in figs. III.1 through III.5.)

For example, OMB made the RMOs responsible for examining agencies\u2019 audited financial statements and for assessing agencies\u2019 high-risk, procurement, and information resources management (IRM) issues. OMB eliminated OFFM\u2019s Credit and Cash Management Branch and the Special Studies Divisions that had been associated with three of the five budget program areas. The Special Studies Divisions, which had originally been established to provide management expertise within the budget program areas, had most recently focused on longer term policy analysis.", "The General Management Division was eliminated when two of its three branches (the Federal Services and Federal Personnel Policy Branches) were moved to RMOs and the third branch (Evaluation and Planning) was eliminated. The movement of the Division\u2019s responsibilities for examining the other two central management agencies (the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management) reversed a previous initiative to give the General Management Division some budget examining responsibilities.", "OMB assigned most of the responsibilities and staff from these units to the RMOs. For example, the two staff members who coordinated OMB Circular A-76 activities and credit and cash management responsibilities were moved from the General Management Division and OFFM, respectively, to the General Government and Finance RMO. The staff member who coordinated GPRA responsibilities was transferred initially from the General Management Division to the Human Resources RMO. In May 1995 OMB relocated the individuals responsible for coordinating GPRA and OMB Circular A-76 initiatives from the RMOs to its Budget Review Division, because it determined that these crosscutting issues could be better handled centrally.", "OMB attempted to reassign staff with specific expertise from the pre-OMB 2000 management offices to areas where they could continue to use their skills. For example, OMB assigned two former OFPP staff to an RMO branch that works on Department of Defense procurement issues and a former OFFM staff member to an RMO branch that works on housing loan issues.", "However, competing priorities prevented OMB from assigning some staff to areas related to their expertise and also prevented some RMO branches from receiving any new staff. Following the initial OMB 2000 staff reassignments, it was up to each branch chief to determine what, if any, technical skills the branch needed to fulfill its new responsibilities and to develop those skills within given staffing allocations. No specific guidance or technical support was provided toward this end, and we observed no organized assessment on OMB\u2019s part to identify required skills or any deficiencies.", "The branches within the RMOs were given discretion to decide how they would address management issues, and the methods they used varied. Some RMO branches used former management staff primarily as management specialists, while others assigned them program examiner responsibilities to examine specific agency accounts. For example, the Housing and Urban Development/Federal Emergency Management Agency Branch of the General Government and Finance RMO assigned two former management staff a lighter load of agency examining responsibilities than other examiners in the branch, allowing them to spend at least half of their time on management issues.

As a result of OMB 2000, OMB replaced its budget examiner positions with program examiner positions and reassigned staff from the budget program areas, the General Management and Special Studies Divisions, and the statutory offices to fill those positions in the RMOs. Program examiners are employed in the RMOs as federal General Schedule (GS) employees in grades GS-9 through GS-15, with GS-15 the full performance level. Program examiners\u2019 position descriptions were expanded from those of budget examiners to more explicitly include responsibility for management issues. For example, before OMB 2000, budget examiners were to assist General Management Division staff in analyzing reorganization proposals; after OMB 2000, the program examiners were made responsible for conducting those reviews on their own. Program examiners were also given responsibility for planning and conducting studies on financial management and procurement. However, the position description does not explicitly mention IRM responsibilities. (See fig. IV.1 in app. IV for a comparison of examiners\u2019 major duties before and after OMB 2000.)", "OMB also developed a new set of performance standards to cover all of its professional staff, including RMO and statutory office staff. Before OMB 2000, standards were individually tailored to particular positions. For example, previous performance standards for a budget examiner were focused specifically on budget formulation and review responsibilities. OFFM policy analyst standards included analyzing, coordinating, and monitoring financial systems issues; General Management Division policy analyst standards included analyzing the implementation of management initiatives, program evaluation, and long-range planning. OMB revised its performance standards to make them more uniform, to simplify them, and to encompass broader responsibilities, but the standards no longer identify specific responsibilities, including management responsibilities.

However, OMB also offered (but did not require) some formal training for the new responsibilities given to program examiners as a result of OMB 2000. For example, OMB offered training primarily on budget concepts, laws, and procedures for new program examiners who transferred from the management offices. OMB also invited all its staff to attend an OMB-wide \u201cdialogue\u201d on the fiscal year 1996 budget process and gave them the option of attending sessions designed for new OMB staff. The training included 1- to 2-hour sessions on such topics as the budget process; streamlining plans and the use of performance information (crosscutting issues that were emphasized in the fiscal year 1996 budget cycle); legislation; and initiatives related to certain statutory office responsibilities (e.g., procurement reform). OMB officials told us that 80 to 90 percent of OMB\u2019s program examiners and statutory office staff attended these sessions.

They said the RMO branches differed in both whether and how they treated management issues for which the statutory offices or the General Management Division were formerly responsible. RMO staff said that the particular management focus an RMO takes depends on the kinds of activities and issues at the agencies being examined. For example, procurement issues may be more prominent in OMB\u2019s examination of agencies that do a lot of purchasing, such as the Department of Defense.", "One of the goals of OMB 2000 had been to realign resources so that program examiners could do more long-term \u201cmid-range\u201d analysis. However, RMO staff frequently said there had been an increase in their responsibilities as a result of OMB 2000, and their workload increased in response to such initiatives as reinventing government and congressional agency restructuring proposals. They also said they had not been told to eliminate any responsibilities or tasks as a result of OMB 2000. Because they had to balance competing responsibilities, several program examiners said that less emphasis had been placed on certain management issues\u2014those that lacked a clear budgetary impact, did not require an immediate response to a short-term deadline, or did not reflect the administration\u2019s priorities. In particular, they said the short-term pressures of the budget process left little time for long-term analysis.", "Although they felt more responsible for agency management issues, some program examiners said that they did not know how to address all of these issues. They also said that the reduction of centralized management expertise in the statutory offices and the elimination of the General Management Division left them with fewer sources of expertise and assistance. Because program examiners had little time to spend looking for the expertise that was available, they said that certain management issues were not addressed or received less attention. OMB staff were not always sure how various management issues related to each other and to the budget process. According to OMB\u2019s Director and DDM, OMB is working to develop a unified framework to bring together the various management-related laws and initiatives with a performance focus."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OMB Has Not Formally Evaluated OMB 2000", "paragraphs": ["OMB initially planned to assess the OMB 2000 effort. However, the Associate Director for Administration said that OMB decided not to evaluate OMB 2000 in the spring of 1995 because the unprecedented pace of the fiscal year 1996 budget process left insufficient time to perform any evaluation. He said OMB no longer planned any formal assessment of the personnel and organizational changes in OMB 2000. However, a Special Assistant to the DDM said OMB intends to assess the effectiveness of OMB as a whole in response to GPRA requirements. Part of this assessment will be an evaluation of the integration of OMB\u2019s management and budget responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The changes associated with OMB 2000 should be viewed in the context of OMB\u2019s perennial challenge of carrying out its central management leadership responsibilities in an environment in which its budgetary role necessarily remains a vital mission. Previous congressional and OMB attempts to elevate the status of management and protect it from budgetary pressures by creating separate management units within OMB sought to ensure that a consistent level of effort was focused on management issues. However, these efforts were widely acknowledged to have been only marginally successful in affecting budget decisions and sustaining attention to OMB\u2019s role of leading management improvement in the agencies. Sustained attention to management issues often remained subordinated to budget concerns and perspectives, and the leverage the budget could offer to advance management efforts was not directly available to the management units.", "OMB 2000 represents another OMB approach to try to strengthen its management leadership capacity and influence. Although policy development responsibilities were retained within its separate management offices, OMB attempted to elevate the importance of management by linking its management oversight and budget preparation responsibilities within newly created RMOs. In decentralizing responsibility for management issues throughout the RMOs, OMB 2000 increased reliance on the commitment of RMO managers and staff and coordination of their activities with the statutory offices. OMB\u2019s initial experience with this approach during the 1996 budget process showed the clear support of top OMB officials and staff to enhance the treatment of certain management issues in the budget. Even though this was a particularly difficult budget cycle, there was a noticeable increase in the attention given to management issues that transcended immediate budgetary concerns. However, given the many issues competing for the attention of RMO officials and staff, top leadership direction will continue to be an important factor in ensuring consistent guidance across RMOs and continued concern for governmentwide management issues. At the time of our review only one budget cycle had elapsed since the inception of OMB 2000, so it remains an open question whether the heightened attention to management issues will be sustained after the current leadership leaves OMB.", "In addition, sustained congressional oversight of both management policies and reform initiatives will continue to play a vital role in ensuring a consistent focus on management issues within OMB. Some recent statutory management initiatives have, in fact, provided a new set of tools that may aid the integration of management issues in the budget process. The Chief Financial Officers Act requires agencies to produce, for the first time, audited financial data that can be used in the budget process to better measure the actual costs of programs and promote improved financial management of scarce resources by federal agencies. Under GPRA, agencies are required to generate performance measures and information that may help OMB better assess the management of program resources and achievement of program goals.", "A critical question facing OMB is whether its new approach toward integrating management and budgeting as well as its implementation of statutory management responsibilities can be sustained over the long term. Sustaining a management focus in budgeting relies on the capacity and expertise of the program examining staff to address management issues. These issues warrant continued attention and periodic assessment by OMB itself to help promote the organization\u2019s long-term capacity to achieve an integrated approach to management as part of the budget process.", "OMB needs to periodically assess how well its RMOs and statutory offices are working together to address management issues. Such an assessment should most appropriately be undertaken as part of a broader assessment of OMB\u2019s performance in formulating and implementing management policies for the government that address a larger range of issues affecting the effectiveness of OMB\u2019s management role. This assessment could also inform the ongoing debate on how best to protect management from being overwhelmed by budgetary pressures\u2014specifically, whether a separate office of management is needed. The most effective evaluation would be one where all stakeholders reached mutual agreement on the particular elements of the evaluation and the indicators used to measure performance. The GPRA strategic planning process offers an excellent opportunity for OMB to evaluate its own institutional capacity and to identify opportunities to strengthen leadership of management issues.", "Our review suggested a number of possible areas to consider for evaluation. For example:", "Although the OMB staff we spoke with were generally positive about the reorganization, they expressed some concerns about whether program examiners had sufficient time and expertise to adequately address certain management issues during their agency budget reviews. OMB could examine whether on-the-job training and a decentralized staffing approach are appropriate to develop the skills and abilities needed by RMOs to carry out management oversight responsibilities.", "OMB used three different approaches during the first year of OMB 2000 to structure RMOs\u2019 relationships with statutory offices and to provide program examiners with access to management expertise: (1) direct transfer of responsibilities and resources to RMOs, as used in reorganizing certain general and financial management activities; (2) joint assignment of staff, as used in matrixing federal procurement policy and oversight responsibilities; and (3) use of \u201cbest practices\u201d guidance, as developed for information resources management. OMB could evaluate each of these approaches to determine whether any of them are more effective than the others, or whether changes are needed in the way they have been implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["OMB 2000 has clearly affected how the agency addresses management issues, but a broader assessment of OMB\u2019s management strategies and approaches is the most appropriate context in which to consider how to best ensure the integration of management and budgeting. Accordingly, as part of its planned broader assessment of its role in formulating and implementing management policies for the government, OMB should consider the lessons learned from OMB 2000. Such a review should focus on specific concerns that need to be addressed to promote more effective integration, including (1) the way OMB currently trains its program examiners and whether this is adequate given the additional management responsibilities assigned to these examiners, and (2) the effectiveness of the different approaches taken by OMB in the statutory offices to coordinate with RMOs and provide program examiners with access to expertise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report for review by OMB officials.
