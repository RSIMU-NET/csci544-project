In July 2008 and March 2009, GAO reported on substantial vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse in the HUBZone application and monitoring process. GAO also found 10 HUBZone firms in the Washington, D.C., area and 19 firms in four other metropolitan areas in Alabama, California, and Texas that made fraudulent or inaccurate representations to get into or remain in the HUBZone program. Given the Committee's continued concern over fraud and abuse in the HUBZone program, GAO (1) performed additional proactive testing of SBA's HUBZone certification process, and (2) determined whether SBA has taken any actions against the 29 case study firms GAO identified in its prior work. Using publicly available resources to fabricate documents, GAO proactively tested SBA's application process by applying for HUBZone certification for four bogus businesses with fictitious owners and employees. GAO also interviewed SBA officials and reviewed SBA data about the 29 case study firms. GAO did not attempt to project the extent of fraud and abuse in the program nor systematically assess HUBZone program controls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The HUBZone program remains vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Using falsified documents and employee information, GAO obtained HUBZone certification for three bogus firms using the addresses of the Alamo in Texas, a public storage facility in Florida, and a city hall in Texas as principle office locations. A simple Internet search by SBA could have revealed these as phony applications. While the agency has required more documentation in its application process since GAO's July 2008 report, GAO's testing shows that SBA does not adequately authenticate self-reported information and, for these cases, did not perform site visits to validate the addresses. Further, the changes have significantly increased the time it takes SBA to process applications. Specifically, SBA took 7 or more months to process each of the bogus applications--at least 6 months longer than for GAO's previous investigations. SBA continually lost documentation for GAO's fourth application, and eventually withdrew it after GAO failed to resubmit the same materials for the fourth time. On its Web site, SBA reported that applicants are experiencing delays during the application process. SBA has taken some action on most of the 29 firms that GAO previously reported did not meet HUBZone program requirements. The SBA decertified 16 firms from the HUBZone program, and another 8 firms voluntarily withdrew. While GAO maintains all 29 firms did not meet requirements at the time of its review, SBA stated that the other 5 firms were in compliance at the time of its own review and so remain certified. Since GAO's March 2009 report, 17 of the 29 companies have received more than $66 million in federal obligations for new contracts. GAO recently reported that one firm has also defrauded the SBA 8(a) program. Because the SBA did not promptly debar the firm from federal contracts, it was able to fraudulently receive an additional $600,000 in noncompetitive 8(a) federal contracts since GAO's last report. SBA recently proposed debarring this firm.

Administered by the Small Business  Administration (SBA), this program is meant to spur economic growth in  underdeveloped areas by helping qualified small businesses secure federal  contracts. Qualified businesses located in HUBZones\u2014economically  distressed areas with low income levels or high unemployment rates\u2014are  eligible to bid on federal prime contracts and subcontracts available  exclusively to program participants, in addition to benefiting from other  contracting preferences. The SBA must certify that a small business meets  the following criteria to qualify for the program: the firm must be owned  and controlled by one or more U.S. citizens; at least 35 percent of full-time  (or full-time equivalent) employees live in a HUBZone; and the principal  office, where most qualifying employees work, must be in a HUBZone.  According to the SBA\u2019s Dynamic Small Business Web site, as of March  2010, 9,300 firms were participating in the program.", "In July 2008, we testified that the SBA\u2019s lack of an effective fraud  prevention program meant its application process could not provide  reasonable assurance that only eligible firms were being certified to  participate in the program. Using fictitious employee and owner  information and fabricated documentation, we easily obtained HUBZone  certification for four bogus firms. We also identified 10 firms from the  Washington, D.C., metro area that participated in the program even though  they did not meet eligibility criteria. In March 2009, we reported on 19  additional HUBZone firms from Alabama, California, and Texas that were  not eligible for the program.", "Because you expressed concerns about continued fraud and abuse in the  program, we (1) performed additional proactive testing of the SBA\u2019s  HUBZone certification process and (2) determined what actions, if any,  the SBA has taken against the 29 case study firms we identified in our  prior work.", "To proactively test the SBA\u2019s HUBZone certification process, we created  four new bogus firms and applied for HUBZone certification using false  information and fabricated documents to meet the SBA\u2019s certification  requirements. Our applications contained fictitious employee information  and bogus principal office addresses. We used publicly available guidance  provided by the SBA to create the applications. When necessary, we  fabricated documents to support our applications using commercially  available hardware, software, and materials. To determine what actions, if  any, the SBA has taken against the 29 firms that we found misrepresented  their HUBZone status, we made inquiries on our referrals with SBA  officials from the HUBZone Program Office, and the SBA\u2019s Suspension and  Debarment Official (SDO). To identify federal obligations received by the  firms subsequent to our referral to SBA, we analyzed data from the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation. We also reviewed the  SBA\u2019s Dynamic Small Business Web site to determine the current  HUBZone status of the 29 firms. To identify firms that represented  themselves as HUBZone certified, where they may possibly receive  benefits from improperly being associated with the program, even after  they were decertified by the SBA, we reviewed the Web sites of all 29  firms. We did not review SBA records to confirm actions on the 29 firms or  the firms\u2019 actions to comply with HUBZone requirements.", "Our work was not designed to systematically assess HUBZone program  controls or to determine the legal sufficiency of any actions SBA took  against the selected firms we referred for investigation.

To be certified, in general, firms must  meet the following criteria: 1) the company must be small by SBA size  standards; 2) the company\u2019s principal office\u2014where the greatest number  of employees perform their work\u2014must be located in a HUBZone; 3) the  company must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by U.S.  citizens; and 4) at least 35 percent of the company\u2019s full-time (or full-time  equivalent) employees must reside in a HUBZone. As of March 2010,  approximately 9,300 firms were listed in the SBA\u2019s Dynamic Small  Business database as participating in the HUBZone program.", "A certified HUBZone firm is eligible for a variety of federal contracting  benefits, such as sole source contracts and set-aside contracts.  Contracting officers may award a sole source contract to a HUBZone firm  if, among other things, the officer does not have a reasonable expectation  that two or more qualified HUBZone firms will submit offers and the  anticipated award price of the proposed contract, including options, will  not exceed $5.5 million for manufacturing contracts or $3.5 million for all  other contracts. Once a qualified firm receives a HUBZone contract, the  firm is required to spend at least 50 percent of the personnel costs of the  contract on its own employees. The company must also represent, as  provided in the application, that it will \u2018\u2018attempt to maintain\u2019\u2019 having 35  percent of its employees reside in a HUBZone during the performance of  any HUBZone contract it receives.", "The SBA must ensure that both applicant and participant firms meet and  maintain eligibility criteria at the time of application and, if they are  granted certification, throughout their tenure in the program. During the  application process, firms attest to the authenticity of the information that  they submit to the SBA regarding their eligibility. Subsequent to  certification, SBA regulations require firms to immediately notify the  agency if any material changes occur that affect their eligibility, such as  changes to the number of employees residing in a HUBZone or the  location of the firm\u2019s principal office. Moreover, certified HUBZone firms  competing for government contracts must verify in the government\u2019s  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) that there  have been \u201cno material changes in ownership and control, principal office,  or the percentage of employee\u2019s living in a HUBZone since it was certified  by the SBA.\u201d Firms and individuals who misrepresent their eligibility  during the application process or while participating in the program are  subject to civil and criminal penalties; decertification from the HUBZone  program; or debarment from all federal contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA\u2019s HUBZone Certification Process Remains Vulnerable to Fraud and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["The SBA continues to struggle with reducing fraud risks in its HUBZone  certification process despite reportedly taking steps to bolster its controls.  The agency certified three of our four bogus firms based on fraudulent  information, including fabricated explanations and supporting  documentation. The SBA lost documentation for our fourth application on  multiple occasions, forcing us to abandon our application. Our testing  revealed that the SBA does not adequately authenticate self-reported  information\u2014especially as it pertains to information regarding whether a  firm\u2019s principal office location meets program requirements. For example,  for our successful firms, we used the addresses of the Alamo, a public  storage facility in Florida, and a city hall in Texas as our principal office  locations\u2014locations that a simple Internet search could have revealed as  ineligible for the program. While ensuring that a HUBZone applicant\u2019s  principal office is legitimately located in a HUBZone is a complicated  process, the SBA\u2019s failure to verify principal office locations leaves the  program vulnerable to firms misrepresenting the locations of their  principal offices and thus, benefits of the program not going to areas that  are economically disadvantaged. Figure 1 below shows one of the  acceptance letters we received.", "In contrast to our last test of the HUBZone certification process, the SBA  considerably increased the amount of documentation it requested to  support each application and its attempts to contact and communicate  with the owners we represented in our applications. However, the SBA  also increased the amount of time it takes to certify firms and, by all  indications, suspended the use of agency processing time guidelines as  indicated by an e-mail that we received from an SBA official and  information that the agency posted on its Web site. The SBA took at least  7 months to process each of the three applications from our bogus  companies that it certified. In our previous test, the SBA certified our firms  in as little as 2 weeks, with minimal requests for documentary evidence.  SBA\u2019s increased processing times failed to prevent our fraudulent firms  from being certified.", "As we indicated in our March 2009 report, the SBA initiated a process of  reengineering the HUBZone program in response to our findings and  recommendations. Though we did not assess the effectiveness of the  actions that the SBA undertook to strengthen its internal controls, we  were still able to exploit those weaknesses in order to obtain program  certification for our bogus firms.", "Specific details about each of our fraudulent applications are reported  below.", "Fictitious Application 1: We received HUBZone certification about 7  months after submitting this application to the SBA. For the principal  office location, we used the address of the Alamo, a National Historic  Landmark in Texas. We claimed that both the firm\u2019s employees were  HUBZone residents. Nearly 3 months after submission, we received an e- mail from the SBA requesting a copy of the HUBZone maps that we used  to verify the residency of our employees, birth certificates, copies of tax  returns for the last 3 years, corporate documents, and a copy of our firm\u2019s  rental agreement and a recent utility bill. We fabricated these documents  using publicly available materials and software and submitted them to the  SBA. The SBA then requested a copy of the firm\u2019s most recent official  payroll records and sought clarification between the number of employees  who worked at our firm\u2019s principal office and those who worked off site.  We were also required to provide additional payroll records and  corresponding banking statements with the line-by-line transactions that  supported the payments that we claimed to make to our fictitious  employees. After all of the requested information was provided, we were  approved for HUBZone certification. Figure 2 provides a timeline  highlighting the major interactions that occurred with the SBA during the  processing of this application.", "Fictitious Application 2: The SBA certified this bogus company 14  months after our investigators applied for HUBZone certification. The  address we used for our principal office was the same as a rental storage  unit in Florida. We claimed the firm was a partnership that employed two  individuals who both resided in a HUBZone. To substantiate our firm\u2019s  principal address, the agency requested that we submit a lease, a recent  utility and telephone bill, and a copy of our firm\u2019s business registration. To  verify the firm\u2019s business activity and ownership, the SBA requested  copies of our firm\u2019s federal business income tax returns for the last 3 years  and birth certificates of the two owners, and a copy of our firm\u2019s  partnership agreement. To verify employee information, the SBA  requested copies of each of the HUBZone resident employees\u2019 driver\u2019s  licenses or voter registration cards, a copy of our firm\u2019s quarterly  unemployment tax filings, and certified copies of the firm\u2019s quarterly  payroll. SBA also requested tax information and a copy of our firm\u2019s most  recent payroll documents, which we fabricated and provided to the SBA.  Several months thereafter, our bogus firm was granted HUBZone  certification.", "Fictitious Application 3: After 7 months of processing, SBA approved  this bogus firm for HUBZone participation. The address of this firm\u2019s  principal office was a city hall in Texas. We indicated that two of the firm\u2019s  employees who worked for the bogus firm lived in a HUBZone. Several  months after processing our application, the SBA requested documentary  evidence of the firm\u2019s location, business activity, ownership, and employee  information. After the SBA deemed the fabricated information that we  submitted regarding payroll as insufficient to determine our employee  information, the agency put our application on hold until we provided  further documentation. We then provided SBA with a sworn statement to  support information regarding payroll. SBA requested clarification about  the frequency that our bogus employees worked from the principal office  and granted HUBZone certification soon after.", "Fictitious Application 4: After 4 months of processing, the SBA  withdrew this application after we abandoned it. We abandoned this  application because the SBA claimed that it did not receive supplementary  documentation that we repeatedly provided. Two months after the initial  submission of this application, we followed up with the SBA to inquire  about its status. At the point of inquiry, SBA indicated that our application  was being assigned to an analyst for processing. Two months after our  inquiry, we received a request for supporting documentation that was  similar to those we received in our previous applications. We provided the  requested information 3 days after receiving the request. Two weeks later,  we followed up to confirm receipt of our documents. The SBA indicated  that it did not receive the information that we provided, so we resent the  information and requested that the agency confirm receipt. Three weeks  later, after failing to receive confirmation on the receipt of our  documentation, we inquired about the status of our application. Again, the  agency told us that it did not receive the documentation and subsequently  gave us one day to resubmit it. If not provided, the agency indicated, our  application would be withdrawn.

Not all of these obligations are necessarily  improper, and some do not relate to HUBZone contracts.
