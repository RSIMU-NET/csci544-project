Among the 23 stakeholders we interviewed representing a range of perspectives, most reported that plan affordability played a major role in exchange enrollment\u2014both attracting and detracting from enrollment. In 2018, total premiums increased more than expected, and, as a result, plans may have been less affordable for consumers, which likely detracted from enrollment. However, most consumers receive tax credits to reduce their premiums, and stakeholders reported that plans were often more affordable for these consumers because higher premiums resulted in larger tax credits, which likely aided exchange enrollment. Stakeholders had mixed opinions on the effects that other factors, such as the impact of reductions in federal advertising and the shortened open enrollment period, might have had on enrollment.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which manages healthcare.gov enrollment, reduced consumer outreach for the 2018 open enrollment period:", "HHS spent 90 percent less on its advertising for 2018 ($10 million) compared to 2017 ($100 million).

The lack of quality data may affect HHS's ability to effectively manage the navigator program.", "Unlike in prior years, HHS did not set any numeric targets related to 2018 total healthcare.gov enrollment; officials told us that they instead focused on enhancing the consumer experience for the open enrollment period. Setting numeric targets would allow HHS to monitor and evaluate its overall performance, a key aspect of federal internal controls. Further, while HHS reported meeting its goal of enhancing the consumer experience, such as by improving healthcare.gov availability, it did not measure aspects of the consumer experience it had identified as key in 2017, such as successful outreach events. Absent a more complete assessment, HHS may not be able to fully assess its progress toward its goal of enhancing the consumer experience and may miss opportunities to improve other aspects of the consumer experience."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to HHS, including that it ensure the data it uses for determining navigator organization awards are accurate, set numeric enrollment targets, and assess other aspects of the consumer experience.

Each year the exchanges offer an open  enrollment period during which eligible consumers may enroll in or  change their coverage. Consumers enroll in the federally facilitated  exchange though HHS\u2019s healthcare.gov website, and some state-based  exchanges have chosen to also use healthcare.gov for enrollment. HHS  facilitates enrollment for states that use the healthcare.gov website and is  required to perform outreach and education activities to educate  consumers about the exchanges and to encourage enrollment.", "Some health policy and insurance industry experts assert that the long- term stability of the exchanges will require sufficient levels of enrollment,  including enrollment among young or otherwise healthy individuals who  might be less likely to purchase health insurance. Specifically, bringing  these younger, healthier individuals into the exchanges would reduce  adverse selection\u2014where less-healthy individuals who expect or plan for  high use of health care services disproportionately enroll in coverage  leading to higher premiums that can ultimately discourage healthy  individuals from enrolling. Some experts have also asserted that  consumer outreach plays a key role in reducing adverse selection. For  example, while sick individuals may be motivated to enroll in exchange  coverage to obtain their needed treatment, healthier individuals may need  to be reminded and encouraged to do so\u2014which these experts contend is  the role of effective outreach.", "Beginning with the open enrollment period for 2014 coverage\u2014the  exchanges\u2019 first open enrollment period\u2014HHS conducted broad public  relations and advertising outreach to familiarize the public with the  availability of exchange coverage.

For  example, it suspended certain planned marketing and advertising during  the final week of the 2017 open enrollment period and scaled back its  outreach efforts for the 2018 open enrollment period. In addition, the  agency reduced the length of the 2018 open enrollment period for states  using healthcare.gov for enrollment, from about 13 weeks to about 6  weeks. These changes led to questions among various stakeholders,  such as certain research and advocacy organizations, about whether the  number and health needs of those enrolled in the exchanges would meet  expectations or present challenges to the long-term stability of health  insurance markets. However, other research and advocacy organizations  contend that these and other changes collectively helped to simplify or  reduce unnecessary costs of the program. For the 2018 open enrollment  period, for example, HHS emphasized the availability of agents and  brokers that could assist consumers with enrollment and simplified its  enrollment process by allowing consumers to enroll in healthcare.gov  coverage through certain partner websites.", "You asked us to examine how 2018 open enrollment period outcomes  compared to those for 2017 and to review how HHS\u2019s outreach efforts  affected 2018 enrollment.

To be eligible for premium tax credits, enrollees must  generally have household incomes of at least 100, but no more than  400, percent of the federal poverty level. The amount of the  premium tax credit varies based on enrollees\u2019 income relative to the  cost of premiums for their local benchmark plan\u2014which is the second  lowest cost silver plan available\u2014but consumers do not need to be  enrolled in the benchmark plan in order to be eligible for these tax  credits.", "Cost-sharing reductions. Enrollees who qualify for premium tax  credits, have household incomes between 100 and 250 percent of the  federal poverty level, and enroll in a silver tier plan may also be  eligible to receive cost-sharing reductions, which lower enrollees\u2019  deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments.", "To reimburse issuers for reduced cost-sharing from qualified enrollees,  HHS made payments to issuers (referred to as cost-sharing reduction  payments) until October 2017, when it discontinued these payments.  Despite HHS\u2019s decision to discontinue cost-sharing reduction payments,  issuers are still required under PPACA to offer cost-sharing reductions to  eligible enrollees. Since consumers who receive these reductions are  generally enrolled in silver plans, insurance commissioners in most states  instructed the issuers in their states to increase 2018 premiums for silver  plans offered on the exchanges to reflect the discontinued federal  payments. This has been referred to as \u201csilver-loading\u201d and resulted in  substantial increases in exchange-based silver plan premiums for 2018. (See fig.1.) Because the amount of an eligible enrollee\u2019s premium tax  credit is based on the premium for the enrollee\u2019s local benchmark plan  (the second lowest cost silver plan available to an enrollee), the value of  this form of financial assistance also increased significantly for 2018.", "As we have previously reported, the number and type of plans available  in the health insurance exchanges varies from year to year.

HHS officials told us that  they did not want to speculate on the specific factors that affected  enrollment this year, but noted that the exchanges are designed for  consumers to utilize as needed, which includes degrees of fluctuation  from year to year.

In 2018, premiums across  all healthcare.gov plans increased an average of 30 percent\u2014more than  expected given overall health cost trends. As a result of these premium  increases, plans were less affordable in 2018 compared to 2017 for  exchange consumers without advance premium tax credits (15 percent in  2018). One driver of these premium increases was the elimination of  federal cost-sharing reduction payments to issuers in late 2017, which  resulted in larger premium increases for silver tier plans (the most popular  healthcare.gov metal tier). For example, among enrollees who did not use  advance premium tax credits, the average monthly premium amount paid  for silver plans increased 45 percent (from $424 in 2017 to $614 in 2018).  Average premiums for these enrollees also increased for bronze and gold  plans, but not by as much\u201422 percent for bronze plans (from $374 in  2017 to $455 in 2018) and 23 percent for gold plans (from $509 in 2017  to $628 in 2018). Most stakeholders we interviewed told us the decreased  affordability of plans likely resulted in lower enrollment in exchange plans  for these consumers. Some stakeholders we interviewed reported  personally encouraging consumers who were not eligible for premium tax  credits to purchase their coverage off of the exchanges, where they could  often purchase the same health insurance plan for a lower price.", "However, despite overall premium increases, plans became more  affordable for the more than 85 percent of exchange consumers who  used advance premium tax credits, because the value of the premium tax  credits increased significantly in order to compensate for the higher  premiums of silver plans. For example, the average value of monthly  advance premium tax credits for those enrolled in any exchange plan  increased 44 percent, from $383 in 2017 to $550 in 2018\u2014the largest  increase in the program\u2019s history. As a result, enrollees who used  advance premium tax credits faced lower net monthly premiums on  average in 2018 than they had in 2017\u2014specifically, enrollees\u2019 average  net monthly premiums across all plans decreased 16 percent from $106  in 2017 to $89 in 2018. According to most stakeholders we interviewed,  the enhanced affordability of net monthly premiums among consumers  who used advance premium tax credits likely encouraged enrollment  among this group. (See fig. 3).", "Stakeholders we interviewed also noted that plan affordability likely  played a major role in enrollees\u2019 plan selection, including the metal tier of  their coverage. This finding is consistent with our prior work which  showed that plan cost\u2014including premiums\u2014is a driving factor in  exchange enrollees\u2019 selection of a plan. Specifically, we found that while  silver plans remained the most popular healthcare.gov metal tier,  covering 65 percent of all enrollees in 2018, this proportion decreased 9  percentage points from 2017 as more enrollees selected bronze and gold  plans. (See fig. 4.)", "Stakeholders reported that consumers using advance premium tax credits  benefitted from enhanced purchasing power in 2018 due to the impact of  silver loading, which likely served as a driving factor in these consumers\u2019  plan selections. Specifically, they noted that the increased availability of  free bronze and low-cost gold plans (after tax credits were applied) for  such consumers likely explained why many enrollees moved from silver  to bronze or gold plans for 2018. While average monthly net premiums  paid by these consumers decreased overall from 2017 to 2018 due to the  tax credits, the changes were most pronounced for those enrolled in  bronze or gold plans (which decreased 36 and 39 percent, respectively),  compared to silver plans (which decreased 13 percent). Separately, the  enhanced affordability of gold plans, along with the richer benefits they  offer, likely led some consumers to move from silver to gold plans in  2018. While the average monthly net premium amount paid for gold plans  in 2018 ($207) remained higher than that for less generous silver plans  ($88) among those using advance premium tax credits, it was nearly 40  percent lower than the average net premium for gold plans in 2017  ($340). Stakeholders also reported that consumers in some areas were  able to access gold plans for a lower cost than silver plans. The  proportion of enrollees in gold plans using advance premium tax credits  increased from 49 percent to 74 percent\u2014signaling that many enrollees  used their higher tax credits to enroll in richer gold plan coverage.", "As the proportion of enrollees with silver plans declined for 2018, so too  did the proportion of enrollees with cost-sharing reductions\u2014which are  generally only available to those with silver plans.

Some of these stakeholders attributed  consumers\u2019 confusion about the exchanges to efforts to repeal and  replace PPACA. In addition, many stakeholders attributed consumer  confusion to the Administration\u2019s negative statements about PPACA.  Further, many stakeholders reported that as a result of the public debate  during 2017 over whether to repeal and replace PPACA many consumers  had questions about whether the law had been repealed and whether  insurance coverage was still available through the exchanges. However,  other stakeholders reported that this debate likely did not affect  enrollment and consumers who were in need of exchange-based  coverage were likely able to find the information they required to enroll. In  addition, many stakeholders noted that consumer understanding and  enrollment was aided through increased outreach and education events  conducted by many groups, including some state and local governments,  hospitals, issuers, and community groups.

HHS officials told us that the agency elected to  reduce funding for paid advertising to better align with its spending on  paid advertising for the Medicare open enrollment period. According to  the officials, HHS targeted its reduced funding toward low-cost forms of  paid advertising that HHS studies showed were effective in driving  enrollment, and that could be targeted to specific populations, such as  individuals aged 18 to 34 and individuals who had previously visited  healthcare.gov.

Agency officials said they focused some of their paid  advertising on individuals aged 18 to 34 because in the prior open  enrollment period many individuals in this age range enrolled after  December 15\u2014the deadline for the 2018 open enrollment period. HHS  officials said they did not use paid television advertising because it was  too expensive and because it was not optimal for attracting young  enrollees\u2014although a 2017 HHS study found this was one of the most  effective forms of paid advertising for enrolling new and returning  individuals during the prior open enrollment period. See appendix V for  HHS\u2019s expenditures for paid advertising for the 2017 and 2018 open  enrollment periods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Reduced Navigator Funding and Used a Narrower Approach and Problematic Data to Allocate It", "paragraphs": ["HHS reduced navigator funding by 42 percent for 2018, spending $37  million compared to the $63 million it spent for 2017. According to HHS  officials, the agency reduced this funding due to a shift in the  Administration\u2019s priorities. For the 2018 open enrollment period, HHS  planned to rely more heavily on agents and brokers\u2014another source of  in-person consumer assistance, who, unlike navigator organizations that  are funded through federal grants, are generally paid for by the issuers  they represent. HHS took steps to highlight their availability to help  consumers and enable consumers to enroll through them. For example,  for the 2018 open enrollment period, HHS made a new \u201cHelp on Demand\u201d  tool available on healthcare.gov that connected consumers directly to  local agents or brokers. HHS also developed a streamlined enrollment  process for those enrolling through agents and brokers.", "HHS also changed its approach for allocating the navigator funding to  focus on a narrower measure of navigator organization performance than  it had used in the past. According to HHS officials, in prior years, HHS  awarded funding based on navigator organizations\u2019 performance on a  variety of tasks, such as the extent to which navigator organizations met  their self-imposed goals for numbers of public outreach events and  individuals assisted with applications for exchange coverage and  selection of exchange plans. HHS officials said the agency previously  also took state-specific factors, such as the number of uninsured  individuals in a state, into account when awarding funding. HHS  calculated preliminary navigator funding awards for 2018 using this  approach. However, according to HHS officials, the agency later  decided to change both its budget and approach for allocating navigator  funding for 2018 to hold navigator organizations more accountable for the  number of individuals they enrolled in exchange plans. In its new funding  allocation approach, rather than taking into account navigator  organization performance on a variety of tasks, HHS only considered  performance in achieving one goal\u2014the number of individuals each  navigator organization planned to assist with selecting or enrolling in  exchange plans for 2017 coverage. In implementing this new approach,  HHS compared the number of enrollees whose 2017 exchange coverage  applications included navigator identification numbers with each navigator  organization\u2019s self-imposed goal. For navigator organizations that did not  appear to meet their goals, HHS decreased their preliminary 2018 award  amounts proportionately. For navigator organizations that appeared to  meet or exceed their goals, HHS left their preliminary 2018 award  amounts unchanged. Based on this change in approach, HHS offered 81  of its 98 navigator organizations less funding for 2018, with decreases  ranging from less than 1 percent to 98 percent of 2017 funding levels.  HHS offered 4 of the 98 navigator organizations increased funding and 13  the same level of funding they received for 2017 (see fig. 6).", "We found that the data HHS used for its revised funding approach were  problematic for multiple reasons. In particular, prior to using the 2017  consumer application data as part of its 2018 funding calculations, HHS  had acknowledged that these data were unreliable, in part because  navigators were not consistently entering their identification numbers into  applications during the 2017 open enrollment period. Specifically, HHS  stated in a December 9, 2016, email to navigator organizations that the  application data were unreliable and thus could not be used. Over 4  million individuals had enrolled in 2017 coverage by December 10, 2016,  so it is likely that many of the applications that HHS used in its 2018  funding calculation included incomplete or inaccurate information with  respect to navigator assistance. HHS provided guidance to navigator  organizations in the December 2016 email on the importance of, and  locations for, entering identification numbers into applications to help  improve the reliability of the data. However, some data reliability issues  may have remained throughout the 2018 open enrollment period, as two  of the navigator organizations we interviewed reported ongoing  challenges entering navigator identification numbers into applications  during this period. For example, representatives from one navigator  organization reported that the application field where navigators enter  their identification number was at times pre-populated with an agent or  broker\u2019s identification number. Consumer application data may therefore  still be unreliable for use in HHS navigator funding decisions that would  be expected later this year for 2019.", "Moreover, the 2017 goal data that HHS used in its funding calculation  were also problematic because HHS described the goal in an unclear  manner when it asked navigator organizations to set their goals. As a  result, HHS\u2019s interpretation of the goal was likely different than how it was  interpreted and established by navigator organizations. Specifically, in  its award application instructions, HHS asked navigator organizations to  provide a goal for the number of individuals that they \u201cexpected to be  assisted with selecting/enrolling in  (including re- enrollments)\u201d but HHS did not provide guidance to navigator  organizations on how it would interpret the goal. HHS officials told us  that they wanted to allow navigator organizations full discretion in setting  their goals, since the organizations know their communities best. In its  funding calculation, HHS interpreted this goal as the number of  individuals navigator organizations planned to enroll in exchange plans.  However, as written in the award application instructions, the goal could  be interpreted more broadly, because not all individuals whom navigators  assist with the selection of exchange plans ultimately apply and enroll in  coverage. Representatives from one navigator organization we spoke  with said they did interpret this goal more broadly than how it was  ultimately interpreted by HHS\u2014and thus set it as the number of  consumers they planned to assist in a variety of ways, not limiting it to  those they expected to assist through to the final step of enrollment in  coverage. The navigator organization therefore set a higher goal than it  otherwise would have, had it understood HHS\u2019s interpretation of the goal,  and ultimately received a decrease in funding for 2018.", "As a result, we found that two of the three inputs in HHS\u2019s calculation of  2018 navigator organization awards were problematic (see fig. 7).", "HHS\u2019s reduced funding and revised funding allocation approach resulted  in a range of implications for navigator organizations. According to HHS  officials, eight of the navigator organizations that were offered reduced  funding for 2018\u2014with reductions ranging from 50 to 98 percent of 2017  funding levels\u2014declined their awards and withdrew from the program.  HHS reported asking the remaining navigator organizations to focus on  re-enrolling consumers who had coverage in 2017 and resided in areas  where issuers reduced or eliminated plan offerings for 2018, and  informing consumers about the shortened open enrollment period for  2018 coverage. Representatives of the navigator community group we  interviewed reported that many navigator organizations did focus their  resources on enrollment and cut back on outreach efforts, particularly in  rural areas. According to self-reported navigator organization data  provided by HHS, navigator organizations collectively reported conducting  68 percent fewer outreach events during the 2018 open enrollment period as compared to the 2017 period. Representatives from the navigator  organizations we interviewed also reported making changes to their  operations; for example, officials from one of the navigator organizations  reported cutting staff and rural office locations. Officials from another  navigator organization said that they focused their efforts on contacting  prior exchange enrollees to assist them with re-enrollment, instead of  finding and enrolling new consumers, and de-prioritized assistance with  Medicaid enrollment. The three navigator organizations we spoke with  that had funding cuts for 2018 also reported that their ability to perform  the full range of navigator duties during the rest of the year would be  compromised because they needed to make additional cuts in their  operations\u2014such as reducing staff and providing less targeted assistance  to underserved populations\u2014in order to reduce total costs. One of the  three navigator organizations reported that it may go out of business at  the end of the 2018 award year.", "HHS\u2019s narrower approach to awarding funding; lack of reliable, complete  data on the extent to which navigator organizations enrolled individuals in  exchange plans; and lack of clear guidance to navigator organizations on  how to set their goals could hamper the agency\u2019s ability to use the  program to meet its objectives. Federal internal control standards state  that management should use quality information to achieve the agency\u2019s  objectives, such as by using relevant, reliable data for decision-making.  Without reliable performance data and accurate goals, HHS will be  unable to measure the effectiveness of the navigator program and take  informed action as necessary. Further, because HHS calculated awards  using problematic data, navigator organizations may have received  awards that did not accurately reflect their performance in enrolling  individuals in exchange plans. Additionally, HHS\u2019s narrow focus on  exchange enrollment limited its ability to make decisions based on  relevant information. Moving forward, this may affect navigator  organizations\u2019 interests and abilities in providing a full range of services to  their communities, including underserved populations. This, in turn, could  affect HHS\u2019s ability to meet its objectives, such as its objective of  improving Americans\u2019 access to health care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Did Not Set Numeric Enrollment Targets for 2018, and Instead Focused on Enhancing Certain Aspects of Consumers\u2019 Experiences", "paragraphs": ["HHS did not set any numeric enrollment targets for 2018 related to total  healthcare.gov enrollment, as it had in prior years. In prior years, HHS  used numeric targets to monitor enrollment progress during the open  enrollment period and focus its resources on those consumers that it  believed had a high potential to enroll in exchange coverage. For  example, HHS established a target of enrolling a total of 13.8 million  individuals during the 2017 open enrollment period and also set numeric  enrollment targets for 15 regional markets that the agency identified as  presenting strong opportunities for meaningful enrollment increases,  partly due to having a high percentage of eligible uninsured individuals.  HHS used these regional target markets to focus its outreach, travel, and  collaborations with local partners. According to agency officials, during  prior open enrollment periods, HHS monitored its performance with  respect to its targets and revised its outreach efforts in order to better  meet its goals.", "According to federal internal control standards, agencies should design  control activities to achieve their objectives, such as by establishing and  monitoring performance measures. HHS has recognized the importance  of these internal controls by requiring state-based exchanges to develop  performance measures and report on their progress. Without developing  numeric targets for healthcare.gov enrollment, HHS\u2019s ability to both  perform high level assessments of its performance and progress and to  make critical decisions about how to use its resources is hampered. HHS  may also be unable to ensure that it meets its objectives\u2014including its  current objective of improving Americans\u2019 access to health care, including  by stabilizing the market and implementing policies that increase the mix  of younger and healthier consumers purchasing plans through the  individual market.", "HHS leadership decided against setting numeric enrollment targets for  the 2018 open enrollment period and instead focused on a goal of  enhancing the consumer experience, according to HHS officials.  Specifically, HHS officials measured the consumer experience based on  its assessment of healthcare.gov availability and functionality, and call  center availability and customer satisfaction. HHS officials told us that  they selected these measures of the consumer experience because  healthcare.gov and the call center represent two of the largest channels  through which consumers interact with the exchange. HHS reported  meeting its goal based on consumers\u2019 improved experiences with these  two channels, some of which had been problematic in the past. (See fig.  8.)", "Healthcare.gov. According to HHS officials, the healthcare.gov  website achieved enhanced availability and functionality for the 2018  open enrollment period, continuing a trend in improvements over prior  years. While HHS scheduled similar periods of healthcare.gov  downtime for maintenance in 2017 and 2018, the website had less  total downtime during the 2018 open enrollment period because the  agency needed to conduct less maintenance. HHS officials  attributed the increased availability in part to an operating system  upgrade and comprehensive testing of the website that they  conducted before the 2018 open enrollment period began. In addition,  unlike prior years, HHS officials said that the agency published  scheduled maintenance information for 2018 to reduce scheduling  conflicts for consumers and groups providing enrollment assistance.  HHS also reported enhancing the functionality of the website for the  2018 open enrollment period, including by adding new tools, such as  a \u201chelp on demand\u201d feature that links consumers with a local agent or  broker willing to assist them, as well as updated content that included  more plain language. Many stakeholders we interviewed told us that  healthcare.gov functioned well during the open enrollment period and  was more available than it had been in prior years.", "Call Center Assistance. According to HHS officials, the call center  reduced wait times and improved customer satisfaction scores in  2018, continuing a trend in improvements over prior years. HHS  officials reported average wait times of 5 minutes, 38 seconds for the  2018 open enrollment period\u2014almost four minutes shorter than the  average wait time experienced during a comparable timeframe of the  2017 open enrollment period. HHS officials attributed this reduction  in wait times to improvements in efficiency, including scripts that used  fewer words and generated fewer follow-up questions. In addition,  there was a modest reduction in call center volume during similar  timeframes of the 2017 and 2018 open enrollment periods. Officials  from many stakeholders we interviewed reported that call center  assistance was more readily available this year than it had been in  prior years. HHS officials also reported an average call center  customer satisfaction score of 90 percent in 2018 compared to 85  percent in 2017, based on surveys conducted at the end of customer  calls.", "Although HHS officials reported that the agency met its goal of enhancing  specific aspects of the consumer experience for the 2018 open  enrollment period, HHS narrowly defined its goal and excluded certain  aspects of the consumer experience that it had identified as key as  recently as 2017. More specifically, in 2017, HHS reported that successful  outreach and education events and the availability of in-person consumer  assistance, such as that provided by navigators to help consumers  understand plan options, were key aspects of the consumer experience.  However, HHS did not include these key items when measuring progress  toward their 2018 goal of enhancing the consumer experience. Federal  internal control standards state that agencies should identify risks that  affect their defined objectives and use quality information to achieve  these objectives, including by identifying the information required to  achieve the objectives and address related risks. By excluding key  aspects of the consumer experience in its evaluation of its performance,  HHS\u2019s assessment of the consumer experience may be incomplete. For  example, as noted above, some stakeholders we interviewed told us that  consumer confusion likely detracted from enrollment for 2018, and some  linked this outcome to HHS\u2019s reduced role in promoting exchange  enrollment, including navigator support, which may have resulted in less  in-person consumer assistance through navigators. HHS\u2019s assessment of  the consumer experience, which focused only on consumers who used  the website or reached out to the call center during open enrollment, did  not account for the experiences of those who interacted with the health  insurance exchanges through other channels, such as through navigators  or agents and brokers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Some experts have raised questions about the long-term stability of the  exchanges absent sufficient enrollment, including among young and  healthy consumers. To encourage exchange enrollment, HHS has  traditionally conducted a broad outreach and education campaign,  including funding navigator organizations that provide in-person  enrollment assistance. For the 2018 open enrollment period, HHS  reduced its support of navigator organizations and changed its approach  for allocating navigator funding to focus on exchange enrollment alone.  HHS allocated the funding based on performance data that were  problematic for multiple reasons, including because some of the  underlying data were unreliable. As a result, navigator organizations  received funding that reflected a more limited evaluation of their  performance than HHS had used in the past, and that may not have  accurately reflected their performance. This raises the risk that navigator  organizations will decrease the priority they place on fulfilling a range of  other duties for which they are responsible, including providing assistance  to traditionally underserved populations, which some navigator  organizations we interviewed reported they had either decreased or  planned to decrease due to reduced funding. HHS\u2019s lack of complete and  reliable data on navigator organization performance hampers the  agency\u2019s ability to make appropriately informed decisions about funding.  Moreover, its focus on enrollment alone in awarding funding may affect  navigator organizations\u2019 ability to fulfill the full range of their  responsibilities, which could in turn affect HHS\u2019s ability to use the  program as a way to meet its objective of enhancing Americans\u2019 access  to health care.", "In addition, the lack of numeric enrollment targets for HHS to evaluate its  performance with respect to the open enrollment period hampers the  agency\u2019s ability to make informed decisions about its resources. HHS  reported achieving a successful consumer experience for the 2018 open  enrollment period based on enhancing its performance in areas that had  been problematic in the past. However, the agency\u2019s evaluation of its  performance did not include aspects of the consumer experience that it  identified in 2017 as key, and for which stakeholders reported problems in  2018. As a result, its assessment of its performance in enhancing the  consumer experience was likely incomplete.

In its comments  on our draft report, HHS stated that it had notified navigator organizations  that their funding would be linked to the organizations\u2019 self-identified  performance goals and their ability to meet those goals. On July 10, 2018,  HHS issued its 2019 funding opportunity announcement for the navigator  program, which required those applying for the award to set performance  goals, including for the number of consumers assisted with enrollment  and re-enrollment in exchange plans, and also states that failure to meet  such goals may negatively impact a recipient\u2019s application for future  funding. In its comments, HHS also noted that it is in the process of  updating the healthcare.gov website so that individual applications can  hold the identification numbers of multiple entities, such as navigators,  agents or brokers, and will work to ensure that the awards align with  agency objectives.", "HHS also concurred with our recommendation that the agency assess  other aspects of the consumer experience, such as those it previously  identified as key, to ensure it has quality information to achieve its goal.

Specifically, HHS  noted that there are numerous external factors that can affect a  consumer\u2019s decision to enroll in exchange coverage that are outside of  the control of HHS, including the state of the economy and employment  rates. HHS stated that it does not believe that enrollment targets are  relevant to assess the performance of a successful open enrollment  period related to the consumer experience. Instead, it believes a more  informative performance metric would be to measure whether everyone  who utilized healthcare.gov, who qualified for coverage, and who desired  to purchase coverage, was able to make a plan selection.", "We continue to believe that the development of numeric enrollment  targets is important for effective monitoring of the program and  management of its resources. Without establishing numeric enrollment  targets for upcoming open enrollment periods, HHS\u2019s ability to evaluate  its performance and make informed decisions about how it should deploy  its resources is limited. We also believe that these targets could help the  agency meet its program objectives of stabilizing the market and of  increasing the mix of younger and healthier consumers purchasing plans  through the individual market. Furthermore, HHS has previously  demonstrated the ability to develop meaningful enrollment targets using  available data. For example, in prior years, HHS developed numeric  enrollment targets based on a range of factors, including the number of  exchange enrollees, number of uninsured individuals, and changes in  access to employer-sponsored insurance, Medicaid, and other public  sources of coverage. In addition, the agency set numeric enrollment  targets for regional markets that took these and other factors into  account.
