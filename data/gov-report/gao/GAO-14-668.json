Although DOD is not statutorily required to report on all elements of the assessment, the submission that it provided to Congress was lacking key information. A key principle for information quality indicates that information presented to Congress should be clear and sufficiently detailed; however, neither the Defense Strategic Guidance nor the Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review included sufficiently detailed information about certain key elements of the roles and missions assessment.

However, Congress has raised  concerns with both of the Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review  submissions that DOD has issued to date. DOD provided its first  submission in January 2009, which the House Armed Services  Committee found was lacking in completeness. Specifically, the  committee urged the Secretary of Defense to take a more comprehensive  approach, instead of focusing only on the department\u2019s planned  investments to meet asymmetric challenges. In July 2012, DOD provided  its second submission. In the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s  report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2014, the committee stated that the 2012 Quadrennial Roles and  Missions Review submission also did not meet expectations and was  late.

For our review of DOD\u2019s submission, three GAO  analysts independently compared DOD\u2019s July 2012 submission for the  Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review with the statutory requirements  for the assessment. A fourth analyst reviewed the results of these  independent comparisons to confirm that consensus had been reached  by the other analysts. In addition, we used this kind of methodology to  compare the information in DOD\u2019s submission with the key principle that  the information be sufficiently detailed when reporting information for use  by Congress and other decision makers, which we derived from GAO and  DOD guidance. For additional context, these analysts also  independently conducted a similar analysis of DOD\u2019s 2009 Quadrennial  Roles and Missions Review report. For our review of DOD\u2019s specific  processes, we compared DOD\u2019s processes for the assessment with key  principles for conducting similar reviews, which we derived from a broad  selection of principles GAO has previously established, and other federal agency guidance related to conducting department-wide assessments.Specifically, we distilled the key principles from relevant guidance from  the Office of Management and Budget for conducting strategic reviews  and plans and from DOD for providing high-quality information; desirable  characteristics for developing an effective national strategy; guidance for  conducting studies; and relevant principles for reporting on and  conducting other types of assessments such as risk and cost  assessments. Of the documents we reviewed, the principles we chose  were found in multiple documents and were applicable to comprehensive  assessments such as the Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review. We  discussed these principles with DOD officials, who agreed they were  reasonable to use to evaluate the assessment process. We also  interviewed officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy, Office of Director of Administration and Management, Department  of the Army, Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force, and  U.S. Marine Corps about the process that DOD used for the most recent  Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review, the extent to which DOD\u2019s  process for conducting and reporting on the review was comprehensive,  and any thoughts on how future reviews might be improved based on  lessons learned from the most recent review. Finally, we interviewed eight  defense experts selected on the basis of their prior involvement with the  Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review and authorship of recent  publications about the roles and missions of the armed services.

DOD is also required to conduct two reviews on a regular basis that relate to the Quadrennial Roles and  Missions Review: the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Biennial  Review of DOD Agencies and Field Activities. The timing requirements for  the Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review and the Quadrennial  Defense Review result in each Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review  occurring 2 years before and 2 years after a Quadrennial Defense  Review. In December 2010, DOD also reissued its internal DOD Directive  5100.01, which establishes the functions of DOD and its major  components, and, in September 2011, released an update of the Unified  Command Plan, which allocates responsibilities among the combatant  commands. In addition to these recurring strategy reviews,  comprehensive assessments, and updates to DOD guidance, DOD has  recently completed two other reviews: the Defense Strategic Guidance,  which identified the strategic interests of the United States, and the  Strategic Choices Management Review, initiated by the Secretary of  Defense in 2013 to inform DOD\u2019s planning for declining future budgets.", "The Defense Strategic Guidance, released in January 2012, was directed  by the President to identify the strategic interests of the United States.

However, this earlier review  was not intended to assess all elements the statute required of the roles  and missions review and, as a result, by relying on it DOD does not have  the assurance that its resulting assessment was comprehensive. We  recognize that there were some benefits to this approach, as the Defense  Strategic Guidance did identify primary missions of the armed services,  which were then provided as the core missions required for the  Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review. In addition, the Defense  Strategic Guidance provided several principles to guide the force and  program development necessary to achieve these missions.

As part of a comprehensive process, the  involvement of key internal stakeholders helps ensure that the  information obtained during the review is complete. According to  officials from the armed services, the Joint Staff, and the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, officials from those offices had  a limited role in the development and review of the roles and missions  assessment. For example, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  did not conduct an independent assessment of the roles and missions  assessment prior to the broader, department-wide assessment.", "According to officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and  Joint Staff, this decision was made because the Joint Chiefs of Staff  had provided substantial input to, and had endorsed, the recently  completed Defense Strategic Guidance. According to Joint Staff  officials, the Chairman had agreed with the approach proposed by the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to rely on the review that  resulted in the Defense Strategic Guidance as the primary basis for  the Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review. The Joint Staff reviewed  the submission prepared by the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy and the Chairman then cosigned the submission  with the Secretary of Defense.

According to an official from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, internal  stakeholder involvement was incorporated from the prior, senior-level  review that resulted in the Defense Strategic Guidance. However, the  Office of the Director of Administration and Management was not  involved in that prior review. By not considering ways to build more  opportunity for stakeholder input, DOD was not well-positioned to  obtain and incorporate input from across the armed services,  agencies, offices, and commands within the department.", "Identification and involvement of appropriate external stakeholders:  DOD had limited input from appropriate external stakeholders, such  as Congress and federal agencies, with related national security  goals. Input from Congress could have provided more specific  guidance and direction for what it expected of the roles and missions  assessment. According to DOD officials, they briefly discussed the  assessment with some congressional staff early in the process. In  addition, the 2012 Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review report did  provide specific information about Information Operations as well as  detention and interrogation, as requested by Congress. This  information was collected in addition to information leveraged from the  review for the Defense Strategic Guidance. However, DOD officials  told us that they would benefit from additional clarification of  Congress\u2019s expectations when performing subsequent roles and  missions assessments. For example, these officials noted that it  would be helpful if Congress highlighted which specific roles and  responsibilities areas were of concern so that more detailed  information might be provided about these areas in the next report.  According to a DOD official, the White House was involved with the  review for the Defense Strategic Guidance, but consultation with  interagency partners was limited and occurred late in the process.  While other federal agency partners were not involved with the latest  Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review assessment, the  involvement of other federal agency partners\u2014such as the  Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Office of  the Director of National Intelligence\u2014provides an opportunity to enlist  their ideas, expertise, and assistance related to strategic objectives  that are not solely the responsibility of DOD\u2014such as homeland  security and homeland defense. In assessing the capabilities and  competencies, but not obtaining input from appropriate external  stakeholders, DOD did not have additional support and input for the  assessment of its roles and missions, or input as to what these  stakeholders expected as an outcome of the assessment.", "Time frames: DOD did not develop a schedule to gauge progress for  conducting the assessment and completing the report. Developing a  schedule with time frames is useful to keep the overall review on track  to meet deadlines and to produce a final product. However, aside  from tracking the final review of the report in tracking sheets used by  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Joint Staff,  DOD did not have planning documents that outlined specific time  frames with milestones associated with conducting the assessment\u2014 including time allotted for conducting the assessment itself, soliciting  input from internal and external stakeholders, and drafting the report  prior to circulation for final review. The lack of such a schedule may  have been a contributing factor to the delay in DOD\u2019s submission. The  report was required to be submitted to the congressional defense  committees no later than the date in which the President\u2019s budget  request for the next fiscal year was provided to Congress, which was  February 13, 2012; however, the report was submitted on July 20,  2012.", "DOD\u2019s approach for the latest Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review  also differed from the department\u2019s approach for preparing the 2009  Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review.

However, no similar document  was developed for the 2012 roles and missions assessment. According to  officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the  2009 Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review occurred before DOD had  to address the challenges of the current fiscal climate, and as a result  there might have been more interest in conducting the review.

DOD officials stated that identifying core missions as well as core  competencies and capabilities is also mirrored in the requirements for the  Quadrennial Defense Review.

However,  developing a schedule with time frames would have been useful to  keep the roles and missions assessment on track and aid the  department in submitting its report by the statutory deadline.", "Developing a comprehensive process for its roles and missions  assessment\u2014a process that outlined the department\u2019s planned approach  for addressing all statutory requirements, involved key internal  stakeholders, offered an opportunity for Congress and other key external  stakeholders to provide input, and set clear time frames to gauge  progress for the assessment\u2014would have helped provide DOD with  reasonable assurance that its resulting assessment was comprehensive.  The department\u2019s approach resulted in a report that was insufficiently  detailed, therefore, we continue to believe the recommendation is valid to  guide future roles and missions reviews.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretaries of the  Army, of the Navy, and of the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine  Corps; DOD\u2019s Director of Administration and Management; and the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
