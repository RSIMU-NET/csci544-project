For Internet applications, limited automated controls were in place to verify a registrant's identity. However, there was no independent verification of the identity of those who applied for disaster assistance via the telephone. GAO demonstrated the vulnerability inherent in the call-in applications by using falsified identities, bogus addresses, and fabricated disaster stories to register for IHP. FEMA's automated system frequently identified potentially fraudulent registrations, such as multiple registrations with identical social security numbers (SSN) but different addresses. However, the manual process used to review these flagged applications did not prevent EA and other payments from being issued. Other control weaknesses include the lack of any validation of damaged property addresses for both Internet and telephone registrations. Given these weak or nonexistent controls, it is not surprising that GAO's data mining and investigations showed substantial potential for fraud and abuse of EA. Thousands of registrants misused IHP by applying for assistance using SSNs that were never issued or belonged to deceased or other individuals. GAO's case study investigations of several hundred registrations also indicate the use of bogus damaged property addresses. Visits to over 200 of these damaged properties in Texas and Louisiana showed that at least 80 of these addresses were bogus--including vacant lots and nonexistent apartments. FEMA also made duplicate EA payments to about 5,000 of the nearly 11,000 debit card recipients--once through the distribution of debit cards and again by check or electronic funds transfer. In addition, while debit cards were used predominantly to obtain cash, food, clothing, and personal necessities, a small number were used for adult entertainment, bail bond services, and weapons purchase, which do not appear to be items or services required to satisfy disaster-related needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On February 13, 2006, we testified before the Senate Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on the initial results of our  ongoing forensic audits and related investigations of assistance provided  by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and  households affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Individuals and  Households Program (IHP), a major component of the federal disaster  response efforts established under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief  and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), is designed to provide  financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a direct result of  a major disaster, have necessary expenses and serious needs that cannot be  met through other means.  In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,  FEMA provided $2,000 in IHP payments to affected households via its  Expedited Assistance (EA) program. Victims who received EA may qualify  for up to $26,200 in IHP assistance. As of mid-December 2005, IHP  payments totaled about $5.4 billion, with $2.3 billion provided in the form  of EA. These payments were made via checks, electronic fund transfers,  and a small number of debit cards. Our initial work focused on whether (1)  controls are in place and operating effectively so that expedited assistance  payments are only made to qualified registrants, (2) indications exist of  fraud and abuse in the registration for and receipt of expedited assistance  and other payments, and (3) controls are in place and operating effectively  over debit cards to prevent duplicate payments and improper usage. This  report summarizes our testimony, which is reprinted in Appendix I, and  makes specific recommendations for corrective actions. These  recommendations relate only to the limited scope of work completed for  our testimony and will therefore not prevent all improper and fraudulent  IHP payments.  In the future, we will continue to audit and investigate the  assistance provided by FEMA in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and  Rita, and we will issue further recommendations designed to create a more  comprehensive fraud prevention program for IHP.", "Overview of Testimony In our testimony, we stated that weaknesses in the process that FEMA used  to review registrations for disaster relief and approve assistance payments  left the government vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Our work indicated that  FEMA put in place limited procedures designed to prevent, detect, and  deter certain types of duplicate and potentially fraudulent disaster  registrations. Specifically, individuals could apply for disaster assistance  via the Internet or telephone. FEMA subjected the Internet registrations to  a limited verification process whereby a FEMA contractor used credit and  other information to validate the identity of registrants. Those who failed  the Internet verification process were advised to contact FEMA via  telephone to reregister. However, FEMA did not apply the identity  validation process to telephone registrations.  Of the more than 2.5 million  registrations recorded in FEMA\u2019s database as of mid-December 2005, 60  percent (more than 1.5 million) were exempt from any identity verification  because they were submitted via the telephone. Our data mining and  investigations confirmed FEMA\u2019s representation. For example, using  falsified identities, bogus addresses, and fabricated disaster stories, we  applied for disaster assistance over the telephone and obtained $2,000  expedited assistance payments.", "Other control weaknesses further increased the government\u2019s exposure to  fraud and abuse. For example, we found that FEMA instituted automated  checks that flagged hundreds of thousands of potentially duplicate  registrations in the computer system FEMA used to process and approve  IHP registrations for payments. FEMA officials informed us that these  flagged registrations were subjected to additional reviews to conclude  whether they were, in fact, duplicates. However, while the additional  review process may have prevented some potentially fraudulent and  improper payments, it did not prevent other potentially fraudulent and  improper payments based on duplicate registrations. We also found that  FEMA did not implement procedures to validate whether damaged  addresses used to register for assistance were bogus, for either Internet or  telephone registrations.", "With limited or nonexistent validation of registrants\u2019 identities and  damaged addresses, it is not surprising that our data mining and  investigations found substantial indicators of potential fraud and abuse  related to false or duplicate information submitted on disaster  registrations. For example, according to Social Security Administration  (SSA) data, FEMA made millions of dollars in payments to thousands of  registrants who submitted Social Security Numbers (SSN)  that have not  been issued or belonged to deceased individuals. Our data mining also  detected that FEMA made tens of thousands of payments to registrants  who provided other false or duplicate information on their registrations.  Specifically, we investigated 20 case studies with multiple registrations. A  majority of these registrations\u2014165 of 248\u2014contained SSNs that,  according to the SSA, were never issued, belonged to deceased individuals,  or did not match the name provided. In addition, about 80 of the over 200  alleged disaster addresses that we attempted to validate were bogus  addresses. Also, our case study registrants did not live in many of the  remaining valid addresses. In one specific case example, 17 individuals,  some of whom shared the same last name and current addresses, used 34  different SSNs that did not belong to them and addresses that were either  bogus or were not their residences to receive more than $103,000 in FEMA  payments. In addition, because the hurricanes had destroyed many homes,  we could not determine if approximately 15 of the alleged disaster  addresses had ever existed.", "Similar to the control weaknesses over expedited assistance payments  distributed through checks and electronic funds transfers, we found that  FEMA did not validate the identities of debit card recipients at three relief  centers in Texas who registered via the telephone. Consequently, FEMA  issued $2,000 debit cards to over 60 registrants who provided SSNs that  were never issued or belonged to deceased individuals. We also found that  FEMA made multiple expedited assistance payments to over 5,000 of the  11,000 debit card recipients. That is, FEMA provided the registrant both a  $2,000 debit card and a $2,000 check or electronic fund transfer. Further, at  the time of debit card issuance, unlike the recipients who received  expedited assistance payments via checks or EFTs, FEMA did not issue  specific instructions to debit card recipients on the use of the cards. We  found that debit cards were used predominantly to obtain cash and thus are  unable to determine how the money was actually used. The majority of the  remaining debit card purchases were for food, clothing, and personal  necessities. However, in isolated instances, a few debit cards were used to  pay for items or services that, on their face, do not seem essential to satisfy  disaster related needs. For example, these debit cards were used in part to  purchase adult entertainment, a .45 caliber hand gun, jewelry, bail bond  services, and to pay for prior traffic violations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has a substantial challenge in balancing the need to get money out  quickly to those who are actually in need and sustaining public confidence  in disaster programs by taking all possible steps to minimize fraud and  abuse. Nevertheless, FEMA could reasonably be expected to have mature,  fully tested processes, along with business partners in the federal, state,  and private sector, that can provide it with real time access to the data  required to validate identities and addresses for those seeking disaster  assistance. Once fraudulent registrations are made and money is disbursed,  detecting and pursuing those who committed fraud in a comprehensive  manner is costly and may not result in recoveries. Further, many of those  fraudulently registered in the FEMA system already received expedited  assistance and will likely receive more money, as each registrant can  receive as much as $26,200 per registration.", "Another key element to preventing fraud in the future is to ensure there are  consequences for those that commit fraud. We are referring the fraud cases  that we are investigating to the Katrina Fraud Task Force for further  investigation and, where appropriate, prosecution. We believe that  prosecution of individuals who have obtained disaster relief payments  through fraudulent means will send a message for future disasters that  there are consequences for defrauding the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) direct the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  to take six actions to address the weaknesses we identified in the  administration of IHP.  These six recommendations relate only to the  limited scope of work that we have completed to date and will not prevent  all types of improper and fraudulent IHP payments.  Consequently, we will  continue to audit and investigate the assistance provided by FEMA in the  aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita and we will issue further  recommendations designed to create a more comprehensive fraud  prevention program for IHP.  To address the concerns raised in our  February 13, 2006, testimony, we recommend that DHS and FEMA do the  following:  Establish an identity verification process for Individuals and  Households Program (IHP) registrants applying via both the Internet  and telephone, to provide reasonable assurance that disaster assistance  payments are made only to qualified individuals.  Within this process  establish detailed criteria for registration and provide clear  instructions to registrants on the identification information required,  create a field within the registration that asks registrants to provide  their name exactly as it appears on their Social Security Card in order  to prevent name and Social Security Number (SSN) mismatches,  fully field test the identity verification process prior to   ensure that call center employees give real-time feedback to  registrants on whether their identities have been validated, and   establish a process that uses alternative means of identity  verification to expeditiously handle legitimate applicants that are  rejected by identity verification controls.", "Develop procedures to improve the existing review process of duplicate  registrations containing the exact same SSN and to identify the reasons  why registrations flagged as invalid or as potential duplicates have been  overridden and approved for payment.", "Establish an address verification process for IHP registrants applying  via both the Internet and telephone, to provide reasonable assurance  that disaster assistance payments are made only to qualified individuals.  Within this process   create a uniform method to input street names and numbers and  apartment numbers into the registration,  institute procedures to check IHP registration damaged addresses  against publicly available address databases so that payments are not  made based on bogus property addresses,  fully field test the address verification process prior to   ensure that call center employees can give real time feedback to  registrants on whether addresses have been validated, and  establish a process that uses alternative means of address  verification to expeditiously handle legitimate applicants that are  rejected by address verification controls.", "Explore entering into an agreement with other agencies, such as the  Social Security Administration, to periodically authenticate information  contained in IHP registrations.", "Establish procedures to collect duplicate expedited assistance  payments or to offset these amounts against future payments. Such  duplicate payments include  the payments made to IHP recipients who improperly received the  $2,000 debit cards and an additional $2,000 EA check or Electronic  Funds Transfer (EFT) and  the thousands of duplicate EA payments made to the same IHP  registration number.", "Ensure that any future distribution of IHP debit cards includes  instructions on the proper use of IHP funds, similar to those instructions  provided to IHP check and EFT recipients, to prevent improper usage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in  appendix II, DHS and FEMA made a number of observations that were not  related to any specific recommendation, concurred fully with four of our  six recommendations, and partially concurred with the remaining two  recommendations. In general comments, FEMA and DHS stated that they  could benefit more from the report if information sharing between GAO  and FEMA had been reciprocal.  We believe that we employed such an  arrangement throughout this engagement. We regularly briefed DHS and  FEMA concerning the progress of the audit.  For example, we notified  FEMA management immediately after we detected that duplicate EA  payments were made to individuals who had received debit cards, and  worked closely with FEMA\u2019s Disaster Finance Center to resolve other  issues related to payments that appeared to exceed the $26,200 limit for  specific recipients.", "DHS and FEMA also expressed concern over the objectivity and fairness of  our report.  Specifically, DHS and FEMA noted that our selection of 248  registrations was not a representative sample and was geared specifically  toward identifying and reporting on registrations that had problems.  Our  testimony clearly states that the case studies we used were intended to  demonstrate the type of fraud and abuse that occurred because of weak or  nonexistent controls over the registration process and did not represent a  statistical sample of registrations.  The primary findings of our work relate  to weak or nonexistent controls that leave the government vulnerable to  substantial fraud and abuse in the IHP.  Furthermore, as represented at the  February 13, 2006, hearing, we are continuing our work in this area.   Specifically, we have taken a statistical sample of IHP payments so that we  can statistically estimate the magnitude of improper and potentially  fraudulent claims.  We have nearly completed this work and plan to report  our findings later this month.", "FEMA and DHS also found problems with our assertion that EA payments  were the gateway to future IHP payments.  Specifically, FEMA and DHS  noted that future IHP payments are subjected to additional scrutiny.  We  did not test this additional scrutiny as part of our February 13, 2006,  testimony.  However, we continue to believe that accepting registrations for  individuals using invalid identity and damaged property information  subjects the federal government to a high risk of fraud and abuse beyond  EA payments.  We believe that our ongoing audit and investigative work  sheds further light on whether the additional scrutiny that FEMA asserts  does in fact prevent fraudulent and improper payments related to rental  assistance and other covered losses.", "FEMA and DHS further noted that we made several references to isolated  incidents where debit cards were used for purchases that did not appear to  be for disaster needs, and FEMA questioned whether highlighting those  examples was appropriate.  We specifically noted in each reference to  these purchases that they were isolated and were not representative of the  general breakdown of known debit card usage.  We also clearly stated that  over 60 percent of debit card transactions were used to obtain cash and  could not be tracked further to identify the final use of the IHP funds.  We  identified the non-disaster-related purchases to highlight the fact that  FEMA did not provide any instruction to debit card recipients on the  appropriate use of IHP funds.", "With regard to specific recommendations, FEMA and DHS concurred fully  that FEMA (1) improve procedures to review registrations containing the  same SSNs and other duplicate information; (2) subject all registration  addresses to verification during the registration process; (3) explore  entering into agreements with other agencies, such as the Social Security  Administration, to periodically authenticate IHP information; and (4) issue  proper instructions to any future debit card recipients.  FEMA and DHS  stated that they have already taken actions to address these  recommendations.  These actions include instituting an Internet  application process that will prevent all duplicate registrations from the  Internet, implementing procedures so that call centers will no longer  accept duplicate registrations with the same SSN in the same disaster, and  conducting conference calls and conducting data sharing tests with SSA.   In addition, DHS and FEMA stated that, starting in June 2006, all  registration addresses (even phone-in) will be subjected to an online  verification during the registration process.  While these are steps in the  right direction, we will follow up on whether the actions taken fully  address our recommendations.", "FEMA and DHS partially concurred with our recommendation concerning  duplicate payments.  FEMA and DHS took exception with our  categorization of some payments as being potential duplicates, and with  our assessment that they should initiate actions to collect duplicate EA  payments or offset these amounts in the future, stating that it was unclear  whether some of the of the payments were in fact valid due to the  \u201cseparated households\u201d policy instituted for hurricanes Katrina and Rita.   With respect to duplicate registrations, we maintain that these registrations  are very likely duplicates because the payments were made to several  individuals with the same last names, same damaged addresses, and the  same current addresses; FEMA\u2019s own database clearly indicates that these  were not separated households.  For all our case study examples, we  conducted further investigative work to confirm that the payments were  made to actual duplicates, not covered by the separated household policy,  and were therefore improper payments.", "As for initiating actions to collect duplicate payments, DHS and FEMA  stated that they had processed for recoupment nearly all the payments they  believed were duplicates as of April 1, 2006.  While we have not assessed  the effectiveness of FEMA\u2019s recoupment process, we continue to believe  that FEMA should attempt to recoup as many dollars of improper payments  as possible, including those duplicate payments that we identified that  FEMA questioned.", "FEMA also stated that many of what we identified as duplicate payments  effectively will be offset because the registrant will ultimately be eligible  for more than the amount of the duplicate payments, up to a maximum of  $26,200 that a single household can receive.  We believe that FEMA\u2019s  position is shortsighted because it does not reflect the likelihood that some  individuals are not entitled to, and will not receive, additional funds  regardless of the cap limitations.  Thus, FEMA should not use $26,200 as  the aggregate dollar test.  Rather, FEMA should follow its own policy of  limiting EA to $2,000; adhere to the statutory caps that are allowed for  specific categories of aid; and promptly recover the amounts that exceed  the category limits.  Therefore, we continue to believe that FEMA should  review all the registrations we identified as potential duplicates to access  whether collection is necessary.", "We also disagree with FEMA\u2019s statement that its \u201cmanagement was keenly  aware\u201d that a recipient could receive more than one EA payment, and that  it knowingly issued these duplicate payments partly because individuals in  shelters did not have access to their banking institution (and thus their EA  payments) and therefore were in need of immediate assistance in the form  of debit cards.  While we recognize that providing individuals access to  immediate funds was a priority following the hurricanes, FEMA\u2019s data and  its representations made to us months ago do not support its claim that it  knowingly made those payments.  For example, when we questioned the  official responsible for managing FEMA\u2019s national disaster assistance  processing center about the more than duplicate 5,000 EA payments to  individuals who had already received debit cards, he told us that he was  unaware of the magnitude of the duplicate payments.  After researching the  issue, he informed us that the duplicate payments in question were made as  a result of a \u201csystem glitch\u201d and not as a result of a deliberate action on the  part of FEMA management.  In addition, the more than 5,000 duplicate  payments in question were all made within the span of several hours  roughly a week after FEMA completed issuing all the debit cards. An  analysis of the more than 5,000 duplicate payments indicates that there was  no apparent reason why only about half of the roughly 10,000 debit card  recipients received the duplicate payments.  Using FEMA\u2019s rationale, all  10,000 registrants who received a debit card should have received a  duplicate EA payment.", "FEMA and DHS partially concurred with our recommendation to establish  identity verification processes for IHP registrants applying via the phone  and Internet.  FEMA and DHS stated that they had implemented identity  proofing on call center applications.  As noted in our report, FEMA  instituted identity proofing for Internet registrants at the time of the two  hurricanes, and FEMA and DHS response to our report indicates that  FEMA instituted identity proofing for call center registrants.  In future  work, we will follow up on whether these actions fully address our  recommendations. FEMA and DHS additionally commented that they did  not see the necessity of requiring registrants to also provide their name  exactly as it appears on their Social Security Card, noting that their data  contractor is able to use logic to find aliases and nicknames. While we do  not object to FEMA collecting the nicknames or aliases of registrants  applying for disaster assistance, we continue to believe that registrants  should be instructed to provide their name as it appears on their Social  Security Card to prevent name and social security mismatches.  Instructing  registrants to provide the name that appears on their Social Security Card  can only help\u2014not hinder\u2014the registrant verification process.", "FEMA and DHS\u2019s responses indicate that they are attempting to address  some of the systemic problems we identified in the IHP program.  Going  forward it will be important for FEMA to establish effective controls to  prevent fraudulent and improper payments before they occur, because  fraud prevention is a far more effective control than detecting improper  and potentially fraudulent payments after they are made.  Our experience  with organizations that rely on a process that attempts to detect improper  and potentially fraudulent payments after they are made is that the  organization recovers only a fraction of the payments that should not have  been made.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security, and the Director of Federal Emergency Management  Agency.
