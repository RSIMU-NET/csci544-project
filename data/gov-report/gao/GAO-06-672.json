Recent cyber and physical incidents have caused localized or regional disruptions but have not caused a catastrophic Internet failure. Federal laws and regulations addressing critical infrastructure protection, disaster recovery, and the telecommunications infrastructure provide broad guidance that applies to the Internet, but it is not clear how useful these authorities would be in helping to recover from a major Internet disruption. Specifically, key legislation on critical infrastructure protection does not address roles and responsibilities in the event of an Internet disruption. Other laws and regulations governing disaster response and emergency communications have never been used for Internet recovery. DHS has begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill its responsibility for developing an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery, but these efforts are not complete or comprehensive. Specifically, DHS has developed high-level plans for infrastructure protection and incident response, but the components of these plans that address the Internet infrastructure are not complete. In addition, the department has started a variety of initiatives to improve the nation's ability to recover from Internet disruptions, including working groups to facilitate coordination and exercises in which government and private industry practice responding to cyber events. However, progress to date on these initiatives has been limited, and other initiatives lack time frames for completion. Also, the relationships among these initiatives are not evident. As a result, the government is not yet adequately prepared to effectively coordinate public/private plans for recovering from a major Internet disruption. Key challenges to establishing a plan for recovering from Internet disruptions include (1) innate characteristics of the Internet (such as the diffuse control of the many networks making up the Internet and private sector ownership of core components) that make planning for and responding to disruptions difficult, (2) a lack of consensus on DHS's role and when the department should get involved in responding to a disruption, (3) legal issues affecting DHS's ability to provide assistance to restore Internet service, (4) reluctance of many in the private sector to share information on Internet disruptions with DHS, and (5) leadership and organizational uncertainties within DHS.

It is used by  governments, businesses, research institutions, and individuals around the  world to communicate, engage in commerce, do research, educate, and  entertain. While most Americans are familiar with Internet service  providers\u2014such as America Online and EarthLink\u2014that provide  consumers with a pathway, or \u201con-ramp,\u201d to the Internet, many are less  familiar with how the Internet was developed, the underlying structure of  the Internet, and how it works.", "In the late 1960s and the 1970s, the Department of Defense\u2019s Advanced  Research Projects Agency developed a network to allow multiple  universities to communicate and share computing resources. In the  ensuing decades, this project grew to become a large network of networks  and was joined with an array of scientific and academic computers funded  by the National Science Foundation. This expanded network provided the  backbone infrastructure of today\u2019s Internet. In 1995, the federal  government began to turn the backbone of the Internet over to a  consortium of commercial backbone providers. From that point on, the  Internet infrastructure was owned and operated by private  companies\u2014including telecommunications companies, cable companies,  and  Internet service providers.", "Today\u2019s Internet connects millions of small, medium, and large networks.  When an Internet user wants to access a Web site or to send an e-mail to  someone who is connected to the Internet through a different Internet  service provider, the data must be transferred between networks. Transit  across the Internet is provided by either national backbone providers,  regional network operators, or a combination of both. National backbone  providers are companies that own and operate high-capacity, long-haul  backbone networks. These providers transmit data traffic over long  distances using high-speed, fiber-optic lines. Because national backbone  operators do not service all locations worldwide, regional network  providers supplement the long-haul traffic by providing regional service.  Data cross between networks at Internet exchange points\u2014which can be  either hub points where multiple networks exchange data or private  interconnection points arranged by transit providers. At these exchange  points, computer systems called routers determine the optimal path for the  data to reach their destination. The data then continue their path through  the national and regional networks and exchange points, as necessary, to  reach the recipient\u2019s Internet service provider and the recipient (see fig. 1).", "The networks that make up the Internet communicate via standardized  rules called protocols. These rules can be considered voluntary because  there is no formal institutional or governmental mechanism for enforcing  them. However, if any computer deviates from accepted standards, it risks  losing the ability to communicate with other computers that follow the  standards. Thus, the rules are essentially self enforcing. One critical set of  rules is the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol suite. These  protocols define a detailed process that a sender and receiver agree upon  for exchanging data. They describe the flow of data between the physical  connection to the network and on to the end-user application. Specifically,  these protocols control the addressing of a message by the sender, its  division into packets, its transmission across networks, and its reassembly  and verification by the receiver. This protocol suite has become the de  facto communication standard of the Internet because many standard  services (including mail transfer, news, and Web pages) are available on  systems that support these protocols.", "Another critical set of protocols, collectively known as the Domain Name  System, ensures the uniqueness of each e-mail and Web site address. This  system links names like www.senate.gov with the underlying numerical  addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. It  translates names into addresses and back again in a process invisible to the  end user. This process relies on a system of servers, called domain name  servers, which store data linking names with numbers. Each domain name  server stores a limited set of names and numbers. They are linked by a  series of 13 root servers, which coordinate the data and allow users to find  the server that identifies the sites they want to reach. Domain name servers  are organized into a hierarchy that parallels the organization of the domain  names. For example, when someone wants to reach the Web site at  www.senate.gov, his or her computer will ask one of the root servers for  help. The root server will direct the query to a second server that knows  the location of names ending in the .gov top-level domain. If the address  includes a subdomain, the second server refers the query to a third  server\u2014in this case, one that knows the addresses for all names ending in  senate.gov. The third server will then respond to the request with a  numerical address, which the original requester uses to establish a direct  connection with the www.senate.gov site. Figure 2 illustrates this example.", "Another critical set of rules is called the Border Gateway Protocol\u2014a  protocol for routing packets between autonomous systems. This protocol  is used by routers located at network nodes to direct traffic across the  Internet. Typically, routers that use this protocol maintain a routing table  that lists all feasible paths to a particular network. They also determine  metrics associated with each path (such as cost, stability, and speed), so  that the best available path can be chosen. This protocol is important  because if a certain path becomes unavailable, the system will send data  over the next best path (see fig. 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Internet Is a Critical Information Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["From its origins in the 1960s as a research project sponsored by the U.S.  government, the Internet has grown increasingly important to both  American and foreign businesses and consumers, serving as the medium  for hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce each year.
