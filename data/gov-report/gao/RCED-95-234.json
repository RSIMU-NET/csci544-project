Later that year, the Department of Energy (DOE) and representatives of the electric utility industry agreed to work together with the consortium.", "The consortium began with a 4-year budget of $262 million to fund research and testing by battery companies and DOE\u2019s national laboratories.

Subsequently, similar legislation was passed in several northeastern states. However, the automobile companies believed that without suitable advanced batteries, EVs would be expensive and limited in performance and therefore difficult to sell in the quantities mandated by the states.", "To address this need for advanced batteries by jointly sponsoring research, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors established the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) in early 1991. Because EVs could help reduce mobile-source air pollution while allowing electric utilities to utilize excess capacity during off-peak hours, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), along with several individual utility companies, agreed to participate in the consortium in mid-1991. Then, responding to a legislative mandate to pursue the benefits of EVs, DOE agreed to cooperate with the consortium\u2019s research effort in late 1991.", "The relationship between DOE and the three automotive partners in the USABC is governed by a cooperative agreement. This agreement requires DOE to be substantially involved in managing the program and explains how it should be involved. (App. I provides information on DOE\u2019s role in managing the consortium.) In addition, the cooperative agreement spells out the details of other important issues, such as the ownership of new technology developed under the program and the potential recoupment, or repayment, of DOE\u2019s investment in the program. (App. II provides information on repayment provisions applicable to both DOE and the three USABC partners.)", "The consortium carries out its work through contracts with seven battery firms and through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA) with five of DOE\u2019s national laboratories. In some instances, the consortium has selected two battery developers to work on the same technology to encourage competition, enhance the chances for success, and potentially provide the automobile companies with multiple battery suppliers. The five DOE national laboratories were generally selected on the basis of past experience with promising technologies and/or their ability to objectively test battery hardware. (App. IV provides details on the consortium\u2019s contracts and CRADAs.)", "According to USABC\u2019s original budget proposal, the consortium hoped to obtain about 28 percent of the total program budget, or about $74 million, from the battery developers through cost-sharing provisions in their contracts. However, the cost-sharing percentages vary for each developer, and some developers may eventually join or leave the program. Therefore, the exact cost-sharing percentages for the industry participants will not be known until the end of the program. DOE\u2019s national laboratories did not provide any more funding beyond the 50-percent share committed by DOE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Feasibility of Long-Term Goals for Advanced Batteries Is Uncertain, While More Achievable Mid-Term Goals Offer Limited Benefits", "paragraphs": ["On the one hand, advanced batteries meeting USABC\u2019s long-term goals have not yet been proven technically feasible. On the other hand, batteries meeting the consortium\u2019s mid-term goals, while potentially achievable, will not enable EVs to offer performance or costs comparable to those of gasoline-powered vehicles and therefore offer limited market potential. (Information on the consortium\u2019s long-term and mid-term goals can be found in app. V.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USABC\u2019s Long-Term and Mid-Term Goals Represent the Combined Thinking of the Automobile Companies and DOE", "paragraphs": ["The automobile companies established USABC because they believed that existing battery technologies would result in EVs with limited driving range\u2014generally well under 100 miles and sometimes as short as 30 miles, depending upon the terrain and weather conditions. Moreover, existing batteries would have to be replaced frequently, greatly increasing the operating cost of EVs. According to DOE and consortium officials, the automakers did not believe such vehicles would be acceptable to consumers and therefore originally proposed that the consortium set its sights strictly on long-term goals. Batteries meeting these goals would store enough energy and power to give EVs the driving range and acceleration of gasoline-powered vehicles at approximately the same lifetime costs. Such EVs would be fully competitive with conventional vehicles.", "However, during early discussions with DOE officials in charge of this program, it became clear to the automobile companies that long-term batteries were unlikely to become practical in time to help address the states\u2019 EV mandates. In fact, DOE officials who had considerable experience with advanced battery research convinced the automobile companies that considerable uncertainty existed as to whether long-term batteries could be successfully developed. DOE suggested that it would be prudent to also pursue a second set of more readily achievable mid-term goals. DOE stated that (1) mid-term batteries were worth pursuing in their own right because they are significantly better than current technology; (2) developing a successful mid-term battery could help reestablish a strong domestic battery industry; and (3) mid-term batteries could enable the automakers to gather data on the performance of EVs that would apply to long-term batteries if and when they are developed.", "As a consequence, the consortium adopted both the long-term goals originally championed by the automobile companies and a more readily achievable set of mid-term goals recommended by DOE. At that time, consortium officials believed that the mid-term goals could be reached within the 1990s, making mid-term batteries available within the approximate time frame when the states\u2019 EV mandates would take effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Benefits of Long-Term Batteries Are Clear, but Their Feasibility Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["EVs with long-term batteries are expected to be competitive with gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of performance and cost. If that goal is achieved, such EVs could significantly penetrate the consumer vehicle market. Significant EV sales could reduce petroleum use and increase energy security by replacing imported and domestic petroleum fuels used by conventional vehicles with electricity, which is generated mostly with domestically produced fuels. In addition, the air quality benefits that could follow from replacing petroleum would support important national environmental objectives. The emissions from a relatively small number of stationary electricity generating plants can be more easily controlled than the emissions from a large number of conventional vehicles.", "However, it remains unclear whether the feasibility of a long-term battery will be demonstrated. The consortium\u2019s original goal was to demonstrate the design feasibility of a long-term battery pack by 1994. Had this goal been achieved, pilot-plant production could potentially have begun several years later, leading to full-scale production early in the next decade. As of mid-1995, long-term battery research still involved small cells with about 1,000 times less energy than a vehicle-size battery pack. However, under the best-case scenario, if breakthroughs are achieved, a battery pack for one type of long-term battery could be proven feasible by 1998. This scenario could lead to pilot-plant production by 2000 and to full production by the middle of the next decade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Benefits of Mid-Term Batteries Are Unclear, but Feasibility Has Largely Been Demonstrated", "paragraphs": ["According to USABC officials, batteries that achieve the mid-term goals are likely to be feasible but vehicles with them will have a much shorter driving range than gasoline-powered vehicles and are likely to cost more. The officials added that while such performance may help in meeting the states\u2019 mandates, they do not believe these vehicles will perform well enough to have wide appeal to large numbers of consumers. Consequently, they do not believe that sales in excess of the state-mandated quantities are likely.", "The driving range of EVs with mid-term batteries is expected to be about 100 miles under realistic conditions that require extra power for such things as heating, cooling, and climbing hills. According to officials of the consortium\u2019s Management Committee, this range will be acceptable only to a limited number of consumers.", "Also, automobile companies\u2019 market research indicates that consumers will be unwilling to pay a high premium for EVs with limited range. According to the consortium\u2019s cost estimates, during the early years of commercialization, before full-scale production is achieved, a mid-term battery pack alone would cost from $9,000 to $15,000. Even after full-scale production is achieved, the consortium\u2019s latest estimate is that such batteries would cost about $7,000. This figure exceeds the mid-term cost goal by about $2,500.", "Therefore, particularly during these early years, the automobile companies believe that large subsidies will be needed to sell even the mandated quantities of EVs. Furthermore, according to consortium officials, government and industry have so far been unable or unwilling to offer adequate subsidies. The only currently available federal subsidy, provided under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, is limited to a $4,000 tax credit per vehicle and may be reduced below that amount for several reasons. Consortium officials also contend that state and local governments have not stepped forward to offer significant subsidies for EVs.", "DOE officials in charge of the program are more optimistic than consortium officials about the prospects for EVs with mid-term batteries. In commenting on our draft report, DOE stated that light-duty vans and passenger cars with mid-term batteries can achieve a reliable range from 70 to over 100 miles, respectively, on a single charge. They believe these vehicles will satisfy the needs of many fleet operators as well as private consumers whose daily driving distances are relatively short. For example, DOE officials believe that electric vehicles with mid-term batteries might be successful in niche markets, such as electric utility fleets. They also believe that full-scale production and lower cost can be achieved relatively quickly through such strategies as developing other customers for mid-term batteries in the recreational vehicle and foreign EV markets. Using this approach, DOE officials have estimated that with the federal incentive, an EV with a mid-term battery will exceed the cost of a gasoline-powered vehicle by only about $2,500. They believe sales incentives from the automobile companies themselves would be sufficient to address this remaining cost increment.", "Despite DOE\u2019s estimates, consortium officials doubt that EVs with mid-term batteries can achieve any significant market penetration. While mid-term batteries would extend the range of EVs beyond that provided by using existing batteries, the consortium and DOE both agree that these EVs would not be comparable in performance to gasoline-powered vehicles and would cost more. Both the consortium and DOE also believe that significant market penetration would be required to achieve any widespread benefits in terms of energy security or environmental improvement.", "Despite their concerns about the market\u2019s acceptance of mid-term batteries, USABC officials concluded that they are a necessary step toward the ultimate goal of commercializing long-term batteries. Therefore, the consortium has continued to pursue the mid-term goals and has made progress toward developing a workable mid-term battery.", "The consortium originally planned to demonstrate the feasibility and begin the pilot-plant production of mid-term batteries by 1994; full commercial production (over 10,000 battery packs a year) could then have begun by approximately 1998. As of mid-1995, most aspects of technical feasibility had been demonstrated for one mid-term battery technology. However, the developers needed more time to demonstrate that the battery could meet the goal of lasting 5 years. The consortium now expects that the pilot-plant production of this battery will begin in 1996 and that full production will begin in 2000 or 2001. Hence, existing lead-acid batteries are likely to be used during the first few years of the states\u2019 EV mandates that will begin in 1998.", "DOE and USABC officials attributed their inability to meet the original target dates for both mid-term and long-term batteries to two factors. First, lengthy contract and CRADA negotiations delayed the start of some work for as much as a year. For example, negotiations with battery companies were delayed because of their reluctance to agree to consortium-required cost-sharing provisions and DOE-required patent provisions that threatened companies\u2019 ownership of previously developed background technology.", "Second, technical challenges proved to be more difficult than anticipated, causing delays of a year or more. Each of the technologies under development has presented significant technical barriers, including the high cost of certain materials, the difficulty of fabricating battery components to meet demanding specifications, and a shortened battery life caused by corrosive materials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USABC Believes It Can Stretch Current 1995 Budget Through 1997, Then Seek $38 Million More", "paragraphs": ["Phase I of the USABC program began in 1991 and has included research on both mid-term and long-term batteries. Consortium officials believe that the budget originally planned for Phase I can carry the program through 1997, during which time most of the work on mid-term batteries would be completed. The consortium has also formulated a Phase II plan that would focus primarily on continuing research on long-term batteries through 1999.", "The consortium\u2019s original budget was $262 million for 1991 through 1995. However, as explained above, progress has been delayed because of difficulties in negotiating agreements and contracts and greater-than-expected technical barriers. Consequently, spending has been slower than anticipated. As of March 1995, about $123 million, or less than half the total budget, had been paid out by the consortium for all expenses.", "Meanwhile, through June 1995, planned expenditures included a total of about $181 million of Phase I funds that have been obligated through contracts and CRADAs, of which about 45 percent was allocated to mid-term projects and 55 percent to long-term projects. Additionally, in-kind contributions and general and administrative expenses in connection with these obligations were expected to total about $11 million by the end of Phase I. (App. VI contains information on appropriations received by DOE to cover its 50-percent share of these expenditures.)", "USABC officials hope to extend the cooperative agreement beyond 1995 to complete the development effort. The consortium believes the original $262 million will be sufficient to continue the work through 1997. During this period, Phase I, including most of the work on mid-term battery development, would be completed, and Phase II would begin, focusing primarily on the continued development of long-term batteries. During 1998 and 1999, the consortium hopes to continue Phase II to complete the work on long-term batteries. Phase II would require a total of about $81 million in additional funds for those 2 years. The consortium plans to ask DOE to provide almost half of that amount\u2014about $38 million\u2014or about $19 million a year. DOE is aware of this plan but has not yet endorsed it, pending a more detailed explanation from consortium officials of how these funds would be used by the battery developers.", "According to USABC officials, Phase II of the program depends upon fully funding Phase I, which is now somewhat in jeopardy. The consortium\u2019s original budget called for the battery development companies to share a portion of the program\u2019s total costs. However, early in the program, the consortium decided to significantly increase the amount of testing and battery development work to be performed by DOE\u2019s national laboratories, thereby reducing the amount of work to be done by the battery companies. Since the laboratories do not contribute any share of the costs beyond DOE\u2019s 50-percent share, this change has resulted in a shortfall of about $19.6 million that would have been provided by battery companies, had they done the work now being performed by the laboratories. When combined with lost matching funds that would have come from DOE, the $19.6 million shortfall becomes about $39 million, dropping the program\u2019s total funding from the planned $262 million to only $223 million.", "Consortium officials stated that the automobile companies are willing to increase their contribution enough to restore full funding for Phase I if the government makes a commitment to Phase II. However, they indicated that the automobile companies may be unwilling to commit these extra funds if Phase II is not approved. Consortium officials also stated that they will need a clear signal by approximately October 1995 as to whether the Congress intends to provide funding for Phase II, or they will have to begin cutting back on existing contracts to avoid jeopardizing their ability to complete any of them. However, they believe that cutting back on work by specific battery developers this year would require decisions based on expert opinion rather than on actual test results, which are not yet available. As a result, companies that might develop a viable advanced battery, given more time, might be prematurely eliminated from the program. Without funding for Phase II, consortium officials expect that, at best, just one of the three current long-term contracts could be continued. They believe such a cutback would seriously diminish the chances for success in the long-term program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Active Role in USABC Management, but Greater Attention to Lessons Learned Could Improve the Program", "paragraphs": ["According to DOE and industry officials, DOE program officials have made valuable contributions to the management of the consortium.

Ensuring that only allowable costs are submitted is important in order to avoid reimbursing the USABC partners or the developers for costs that should be covered by their own contributions.", "During the course of our review, we raised a potential concern about the adequacy of the audit coverage of the costs claimed by the consortium and the battery developers. DOE contracting officials told us that an audit to determine the allowability of costs claimed by the consortium is not required but that one might be done at the conclusion of the program. The DOE officials also said that USABC is responsible for determining the allowability of costs claimed by the battery developers, with technical input from DOE\u2019s program manager. USABC Management Committee officials said that the primary responsibility for ensuring the allowability of the developers\u2019 costs lies with the individual USABC program managers, who are primarily automobile company employees. They also said they were not certain whether the consortium would conduct formal close-out audits of the battery developers.", "At the conclusion of our review, the DOE contracting officer responsible for the USABC program told us that there would definitely be a close-out audit of the consortium and that this audit would include a review of the costs claimed by the battery developers and reported to the consortium. The contracting officer also said that DOE would initiate individual audits of the developers\u2019 books, if necessary. In addition, the contracting officer said that the consortium is required by the regulations governing the cooperative agreement to conduct close-out audits of battery developers\u2019 costs and, if necessary, to request DOE\u2019s assistance in conducting such audits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned Have Not Received Adequate Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Greater attention to lessons learned during the USABC program could improve cooperative efforts between DOE and the industry. After a meeting of industry and government officials initiated by DOE in July 1993, the problems encountered and recommended actions to address them were compiled by a consultant in a \u201clessons learned\u201d document. Most of the problems identified involved industry\u2019s perceptions of barriers created by DOE or overall government policies and procedures.", "Many of the 17 items discussed in the document concerned delays. For example, the document pointed out that the program was delayed by the lengthy negotiation of contracts. Contributing to these delays was the reluctance on the part of battery developers to agree to certain DOE-required provisions, such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights that enable DOE to take ownership of technology if it is not commercialized by the developer within a suitable time period. In addition, industry officials attributed delays to DOE\u2019s policy of avoiding direct involvement in contract negotiations but subsequently insisting on reviewing and approving each contract provision and modification. In the case of CRADAs, industry officials contended that multiple levels of review and approval by several DOE field offices and by DOE headquarters resulted in additional delays in the program.", "The lessons learned document included several industry-recommended actions to be taken by DOE to eliminate or minimize these causes of delays, including (1) developing a new approach to issues involving the ownership and use of technology that would be specifically applicable to cooperative agreements; (2) allowing DOE contracting officers to actively participate in negotiations with contractors; and (3) streamlining the process of reviewing and approving contracts and agreements.", "DOE officials who participated in a meeting devoted to the lessons learned agreed with some of the recommendations, such as one that called for DOE to develop a model CRADA to standardize the process of negotiating CRADAs with the various DOE national laboratories. Subsequently, a model CRADA was developed. However, these DOE officials also argued that some of the recommended actions were unnecessary or inappropriate. For example, they did not agree that provisions about the government\u2019s ownership and use of technology were the main reason for delays in negotiating contracts, nor did they believe that a new approach to these provisions was imperative. Also, the DOE officials argued that it would be a conflict of interest for contracting officers, who are responsible for approving contracts, to also take part in negotiating those contracts.", "In subsequent discussions with us, however, several DOE officials endorsed certain of the recommendations in the lessons learned document. For example, the patent attorney overseeing USABC\u2019s affairs in DOE\u2019s Chicago Operations Office agreed with the assertion that there is a need for new rules governing the government\u2019s ownership and use of technology for programs like the USABC program. Also, the director of DOE\u2019s Office of Procurement, Assistance, and Property stated that industry\u2019s call for greater involvement in negotiations by DOE contracting officers contained some logic and was worth considering. In addition, the director of DOE\u2019s Electric and Hybrid Propulsion Division told us that new procurement rules, such as those recommended in the lessons learned document, are needed to provide greater flexibility for cooperative agreements.", "According to DOE program officials, implementing many of the recommendations would require action by other DOE offices, such as those responsible for procurement and patent rights. They said they had sent copies of the lessons learned document to these offices and encouraged them to implement changes where feasible. However, when we contacted officials of these other offices, they indicated that the document\u2019s recommendations had not received serious consideration. The procurement official cited above told us that program officials had not built a convincing enough case for the changes they sought by merely distributing copies of the lessons learned document.", "Thus, it appears that uncertainties and/or disagreements within DOE about the utility or appropriateness of some recommendations in the lessons learned document were not addressed, and others were not carefully evaluated by DOE officials in a position to effect changes. Consequently, it is uncertain which, if any, of the recommendations would have been practical to implement or what improvements to the USABC program might have resulted from their implementation.

Ovonic has sold licenses to other companies to use its technology in small consumer batteries. Earlier, Ovonic had charged that several Japanese electronics firms had violated its patents, and Ovonic filed patent infringement claims with the International Trade Commission. However, in December 1994, the dispute was amicably resolved, and Ovonic signed licensing agreements with these firms. In the case of the USABC program, Ovonic\u2019s officials are concerned that if Saft America eventually produces a commercial nickel metal hydride battery, some of Ovonic\u2019s patented technology may be used in this battery. They have stated that they might file suit against Saft America if this occurs and a satisfactory licensing agreement cannot be worked out.", "Saft America, Inc., is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a large French battery manufacturer and the largest manufacturer of nickel cadmium batteries in the United States. Saft officials maintain that the approach they are taking to nickel metal hydride technology is significantly different from that taken by Ovonic. Therefore, they believe it is possible that any battery they ultimately produce may not use technology patented by Ovonic. However, they also stated that if it does turn out that they use Ovonic\u2019s technology, they are willing to pay Ovonic a reasonable licensing fee for such use. They believe that Ovonic\u2019s existing licensing agreements will provide precedents for determining appropriate licensing fees. Thus they believe litigation will not be necessary. In the meantime, they point out that before commercial production begins, there are no restrictions on conducting research on already patented technologies. Therefore, they are free to use Ovonic\u2019s technology in their experiments if they wish to do so.", "DOE and USABC officials are aware of this potential problem, but they do not expect a real problem to develop because of the differences in the technological approaches being taken by the two firms. Moreover, they believe that any dispute that may occur down the road can be resolved by negotiating a licensing agreement, thereby avoiding litigation. However, if litigation does occur, they believe the terms of the cooperative agreement and USABC\u2019s contracts protect DOE and the consortium from any liability. Overall, they believe that this situation is unlikely to cause a delay in the availability of nickel metal hydride batteries in the United States.
