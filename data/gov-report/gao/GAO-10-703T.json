However, for homeland security and other purposes, the FBI is notified when a firearm or explosives background check involves an individual on the terrorist watchlist. This statement addresses (1) how many checks have resulted in matches with the terrorist watchlist, (2) how the FBI uses information from these checks for counterterrorism purposes, and (3) pending legislation that would give the Attorney General authority to deny certain checks. GAO's testimony is based on products issued in January 2005 and May 2009 and selected updates in March and April 2010. For these updates, GAO reviewed policies and other documentation and interviewed officials at FBI components involved with terrorism-related background checks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From February 2004 through February 2010, FBI data show that individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 1,225 times; 1,116 (about 91 percent) of these transactions were allowed to proceed because no prohibiting information was found--such as felony convictions, illegal immigrant status, or other disqualifying factors--and 109 of the transactions were denied. In response to a recommendation in GAO's January 2005 report, the FBI began processing all background checks involving the terrorist watchlist in July 2005--including those generated via state operations--to ensure consistency in handling and ensure that relevant FBI components and field agents are contacted during the resolution of the checks so they can search for prohibiting information. Based on another recommendation in GAO's 2005 report, the FBI has taken actions to collect and analyze information from these background checks for counterterrorism purposes. For example, in April 2005, the FBI issued guidance to its field offices on the availability and use of information collected as a result of firearm and explosives background checks involving the terrorist watchlist. The guidance discusses the process for FBI field offices to work with FBI personnel who conduct the checks and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to obtain information about the checks, such as the purchaser's residence address and the make, model, and serial number of any firearm purchased. The guidance states that any information that FBI field offices obtain related to these background checks can be shared with other counterterrorism and law enforcement agencies. The FBI is also preparing monthly reports on these checks that are disseminated throughout the FBI to support counterterrorism efforts. In April 2007, the Department of Justice proposed legislative language to Congress that would provide the Attorney General with discretionary authority to deny the transfer of firearms or explosives to known or suspected \"dangerous terrorists.\" At the time of GAO's May 2009 report, neither the department's proposed legislative language nor related proposed legislation included provisions for the development of guidelines further delineating the circumstances under which the Attorney General could exercise this authority. GAO suggested that Congress consider including a provision in any relevant legislation that would require the Attorney General to establish such guidelines; and this provision was included in a subsequent legislative proposal. If Congress gives the Attorney General authority to deny firearms or explosives based on terrorist watchlist concerns, guidelines for making such denials would help to provide accountability for ensuring that the expected results of the background checks are being achieved. Guidelines would also help ensure that the watchlist is used in a manner that safeguards legal rights, including freedoms, civil liberties, and information privacy guaranteed by federal law and that its use is consistent with other screening processes. For example, criteria have been developed for determining when an individual should be denied the boarding of an aircraft."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the government\u2019s use of the  terrorist watchlist to screen individuals who are attempting to purchase a  firearm or obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit, and related  actions to determine if the person poses a threat to homeland security.  Under current federal law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a  person from possessing firearms or explosives because the individual  appears on the terrorist watchlist. Rather, there must be a disqualifying  factor (i.e., prohibiting information) under federal or state law, such as a  felony conviction or illegal immigration status. Questions about how well  the government is using and sharing terrorism-related information in order  to identify potential threats that individuals may pose were also raised as a  result of the November 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, and the  December 25, 2009, attempted airline bombing.", "In January 2005, we reported that from February through June 2004,  individuals on the terrorist watchlist were allowed to proceed with firearm  transactions 35 times because the background checks revealed no  prohibiting information. As a result of that review, we identified  opportunities for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to ensure that  background checks initiated by state agencies are consistently and  properly handled and that the maximum amount of allowable information  from background checks is consistently shared with counterterrorism  officials. We made recommendations aimed at addressing these issues,  which the FBI implemented. We updated this work in a May 2009 report,  which included both firearm and explosives background checks. The  number of transactions involving individuals on the watchlist that were  allowed to proceed had increased to 865 through February 2009. We also  discussed the potential implications of then pending proposed legislation  that would give the Attorney General discretionary authority to deny such  transactions if he reasonably believes that the person may use a firearm or  explosives in connection with terrorism. We suggested that in any relevant  legislation, Congress consider requiring the Attorney General to establish  guidelines on how he would exercise this discretion\u2014delineating under  what circumstances transactions could be denied\u2014and this provision was  included in a subsequent legislative proposal.", "My testimony today updates our prior work and discusses (1) the number  of times firearm and explosives background checks have been a match to  the terrorist watchlist and related outcomes, (2) actions the FBI has taken  to use information from these background checks to support  investigations and other counterterrorism activities, and (3) pending  legislation that would give the Attorney General authority to deny firearms  and explosives transactions based on terrorist watchlist concerns and  related issues.", "My statements are based on reports GAO issued in January 2005 and May  2009. In conducting our prior work, we reviewed documentation obtained  from and interviewed officials at FBI components and state agencies with  responsibilities for conducting background checks on individuals  attempting to purchase firearms or obtain a firearm or explosives license  or permit. Our previously published reports were conducted in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards and contain  additional details on the scope and methodology for those reviews. In  addition, my testimony contains updated information on firearms and  explosives background checks involving individuals on the terrorist  watchlist. For the updates, we reviewed documentation obtained from and  interviewed officials at relevant FBI components to discuss efforts to  collect, analyze, and share information related to these checks with  counterterrorism officials. We also obtained data on firearm and  explosives background checks that resulted in valid matches with  individuals on the terrorist watchlist from February 2004 (when the FBI  first started checking against terrorist watchlist records) through February  2010. We discussed the sources of data with FBI officials as well as the  policies and procedures that FBI officials used to maintain the integrity of  the data, and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this review. We conducted our updated work in March and  April 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and  implementing regulations, the FBI and designated state and local criminal  justice agencies use NICS to conduct checks on individuals before federal  firearms licensees (gun dealers) may transfer any firearm to an unlicensed  individual. Also, pursuant to the Safe Explosives Act, in general, any  person seeking to (1) engage in the business of importing, manufacturing,  or dealing in explosive materials or (2) transport, ship, cause to be  transported, or receive explosive materials must obtain a federal license or  permit, respectively, issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  and Explosives (ATF). To assist ATF, in February 2003, the FBI began  conducting NICS background checks on individuals seeking to obtain a  federal explosives license or permit. Persons prohibited by federal law  from possessing firearms or explosives include convicted felons, fugitives,  unlawful controlled-substance users and persons addicted to a controlled  substance, and aliens (any individual not a citizen or national of the United  States) who are illegally or unlawfully in the United States, among others.", "One of the databases that NICS searches is the FBI\u2019s National Crime  Information Center (NCIC) database, which contains criminal justice  information (e.g., names of persons who have outstanding warrants) and  also includes applicable records from the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s  (TSC) consolidated terrorist screening database. In general, individuals  who are reasonably suspected of having possible links to terrorism\u2014in  addition to individuals with known links\u2014are to be nominated for  inclusion on the consolidated terrorist watchlist by the FBI and other  members of the intelligence community. One of the stated policy  objectives of the government\u2019s consolidated watchlist is the coordinated  collection of information for use in investigations and threat analyses.  Terrorist watchlist records in the NCIC database are maintained in the  Known or Suspected Terrorist File (formerly the Violent Gang and  Terrorist Organization File), which was designed to provide law  enforcement personnel with the means to exchange information on known  or suspected terrorists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About 90 Percent of NICS Transactions Involving Individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist Have Been Allowed to Proceed Because There Was No Legal Basis Identified to Deny the Transactions", "paragraphs": ["In May 2009, we reported that from February 2004 through February 2009,  a total of 963 NICS background checks resulted in valid matches with  individuals on the terrorist watchlist. Of these transactions,  approximately 90 percent (865 of 963) were allowed to proceed because  the checks revealed no prohibiting information, such as felony  convictions, illegal immigrant status, or other disqualifying factors. Two of  the 865 transactions that were allowed to proceed involved explosives  background checks. The FBI does not know how often a firearm was  actually transferred or if a firearm or explosives license or permit was  granted, because gun dealers and explosives dealers are required to  maintain but not report this information to the NICS Section. About 10  percent (98 of 963) of the transactions were denied based on the existence  of prohibiting information. No transactions involving explosives  background checks were denied.", "For today\u2019s hearing, we obtained updated statistics from the FBI through  February 2010. Specifically, from March 2009 through February 2010, FBI  data show that 272 NICS background checks resulted in valid matches  with individuals on the terrorist watchlist. One of the 272 transactions  involved an explosives background check, which was allowed to proceed  because the check revealed no disqualifying factors under the Safe  Explosives Act. According to FBI officials, several of the 272 background  checks resulted in matches to watchlist records that\u2014in addition to being  in the FBI\u2019s Known or Suspected Terrorist File\u2014were on the  Transportation Security Administration\u2019s \u201cNo Fly\u201d list. In general, persons  on the No Fly list are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or national  security and therefore should be precluded from boarding an aircraft.  According to FBI officials, all of these transactions were allowed to  proceed because the background checks revealed no prohibiting  information under current law.", "In total, individuals on the terrorist watchlist have been involved in  firearm and explosives background checks 1,228 times since NICS started  conducting these checks in February 2004, of which 1,119 (about 91  percent) of the transactions were allowed to proceed while 109 were  denied, as shown in table 1.", "According to the FBI, the 1,228 NICS transactions with valid matches  against the terrorist watchlist involved about 650 unique individuals, of  which about 450 were involved in multiple transactions and 6 were  involved in 10 or more transactions.", "Based on our previous work, the NICS Section started to catalog the  reasons why NICS transactions involving individuals on the terrorist  watchlist were denied. According to the NICS Section, from April 2009  through February 2010, the reasons for denials included felony conviction,  illegal alien status, under indictment, fugitive from justice, and mental  defective.", "In October 2007, we reported that screening agencies generally do not  check against all records in TSC\u2019s consolidated terrorist watchlist because  screening against certain records (1) may not be needed to support the  respective agency\u2019s mission, (2) may not be possible due to the  requirements of computer programs used to check individuals against  watchlist records, or (3) may not be operationally feasible. Rather, each  day, TSC exports applicable records from the consolidated watchlist to  federal government databases that agencies use to screen individuals for  mission-related concerns. We raised questions about the extent to which  not screening against TSC\u2019s entire consolidated watchlist during NICS  background checks posed a security vulnerability. According to TSC  officials, not all records in the consolidated watchlist are used during  NICS background checks. The officials explained that in order for terrorist  information to be exported to NCIC\u2019s Known or Suspected Terrorist File,  the biographic information associated with a record must contain  sufficient identifying data so that a person being screened can be matched  to or disassociated from an individual on the watchlist. The officials noted  that since not all records in TSC\u2019s consolidated watchlist contain this level  of biographic information required for this type of screening, not all  records from the watchlist can be used for NICS background checks.  According to TSC officials, the majority of records that do not contain  sufficient identifying data are related to foreign nationals who would not  be prospective purchasers of firearms or explosives within the United  States and therefore would not be subject to NICS checks.

After verifying the accuracy of the  match, the Counterterrorism Division will advise the FBI case agent that  the individual attempted to purchase a firearm or obtain a firearm or  explosives license or permit. The division will also provide the agent with  contact information for the NICS Section and advise the agent to contact  the section to answer additional questions.

Specifically, such transactions could be denied when a  background check on an individual reveals that the person is a known or  suspected terrorist and the Attorney General reasonably believes that the  person may use the firearm or explosives in connection with terrorism.

Such a  provision would help DOJ and its component agencies provide  accountability and a basis for monitoring to ensure that the intended goals  for, and expected results of, the background checks are being achieved.

Because  individuals are nominated to the terrorist watchlist based on a \u201creasonable  suspicion\u201d standard, the government generally has not used their inclusion  on the watchlist to automatically deny certain actions, such as  automatically prohibiting an individual from entering the United States or  boarding an aircraft. Rather, when an agency identifies an individual on  the terrorist watchlist, agency officials are to assess the threat the person  poses to determine what action to take, if any, in accordance with  applicable laws or other guidelines. For example, the Immigration and  Nationality Act, as amended, establishes conditions under which an alien  may be deemed inadmissible to the United States. Also, the former White  House Homeland Security Council established criteria for determining  which individuals on the terrorist watchlist are deemed to be a threat to  civil aviation or national security and, therefore, should be precluded from  boarding an aircraft. Subsequent to the December 25, 2009, attempted  terrorist attack, the President tasked the FBI and TSC to work with other  relevant departments and agencies\u2014including the Department of  Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Central Intelligence  Agency\u2014to develop recommendations on whether adjustments are  needed to the watchlisting nominations guidance, including the No-Fly  criteria.
