Depot-level repairs are the most complex, requiring the capabilities and technical skills of naval or private shipyards. During fiscal year 1997, the Navy employed about 22,000 personnel at its four naval shipyards. The shipyards are the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire; the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia; the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington; and the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The shipyards are not directly funded, but are paid by their customers\u2014primarily the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets. The fleets are provided depot maintenance funds from the Navy\u2019s operations and maintenance appropriation. Funding for the Navy\u2019s depot-level ship maintenance and repair program in fiscal year 1998 is $2.1 billion.", "The Navy schedules its planned ship repair work for a 7-year period and updates this schedule annually. In developing the schedule, the Navy considers various factors, including (1) its policy to perform work of  6 months or less in the ship\u2019s homeport, (2) statutory requirements regarding the public/private sector workload distribution, (3) the capabilities and capacity of each shipyard, and (4) expected funding and personnel levels. The published schedule shows the depot-level ship repair work assigned to each naval shipyard and the workload to be performed by the private sector. The Navy also develops an historically derived estimate of the direct labor staff-days each naval shipyard will expend on unscheduled (emergent) ship repair work and adds it to the schedule to arrive at the planned shipyard workload. The final schedule includes both scheduled and unscheduled work that requires temporary duty (TDY) assignments. For fiscal years 1995-97, about 70 percent of the total work assigned to naval shipyards was for scheduled repair work.", "The Navy uses TDY assignments primarily to perform work at homeports not located near a naval shipyard. The Navy considers shipyard personnel temporarily excess when they are required for planned future requirements and the time and cost of reducing and reacquiring needed personnel justifies retention. In some cases, personnel are considered temporarily excess for more than a year. Since private sector repair capabilities may be available at these locations, questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of sending naval shipyard personnel TDY to perform the work. During fiscal years 1995-97 naval shipyards spent an estimated 580,000 direct labor staff-days, valued at an estimated $134.1 million, on TDY assignments. TDY travel, per diem, and other related travel costs amounted to an additional $59 million. About 5.5 percent of the shipyards\u2019 total direct labor staff-days were spent on TDY assignments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy\u2019s Rationale for TDY Assignments", "paragraphs": ["The Navy cites two reasons for using TDY assignments. First, such assignments are required to perform work at locations where no local public or private sector shipyards have the required ship repair capabilities. Second, the Navy believes that using temporarily excess shipyard workers on temporary duty assignments is cost-effective, even when there is a local private sector capability. The Navy performs work at locations without a naval shipyard to comply with its homeporting policy and when it is not practical to perform the work at public or private shipyards. The amount of TDY assignments depends on several interrelated factors, including a shipyard\u2019s proximity to homeported ships, the number and types of ships assigned to each homeport, the type of repair or maintenance needed, the ability of private shipyards at or near the homeport to perform required repairs, and the number of temporarily excess naval shipyard personnel. The naval shipyards\u2019 financial and management information systems do not identify the purpose for specific TDY assignments, and the Navy could not provide the data needed to identify the exact number of TDY assignments for each reason."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Local Capability Rationale", "paragraphs": ["The Navy performs ship repair TDY work at locations where it believes the necessary capability to perform the work is not locally available. The Navy performs work at these locations primarily to comply with its homeporting policy and also when it is not practical to bring ships to the shipyard. For example, a substantial amount of TDY has been for nuclear submarine repair work at San Diego, where there is no local naval shipyard or private sector nuclear repair capability. Also, local capability is usually not considered when naval shipyard warranty work is involved and for advanced planning prior to a ship going to a naval shipyard for repairs. Because of data limitations, we could not identify the exact number of TDY assignments, but available data supports Navy officials\u2019 judgments that most TDY assignments are performed because there is no local capability. For example, because San Diego does not have nuclear repair capability, all nuclear submarine repair work is performed by naval shipyard workers at San Diego. The total submarine work of 145,000 staff-days represents about 25 percent of the total TDY staff-days for fiscal years 1995-97."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness Rationale", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, the Navy believes it is cost-effective to send shipyard workers that are considered temporarily excess on TDY assignments to locations where there is a local private sector capability. The Navy reasons that the excess workers would have to be paid whether or not they are working and that the cost of travel and per diem is the only additional cost of using the excess workers. The travel and per diem costs are generally less than local private sector labor rates.", "Shipyard workers become temporarily excess when there is a reduction in the naval shipyards\u2019 originally scheduled and budgeted workload for such reasons as ship deployment extensions, reductions in the scope of the projected ship repairs, force level changes, and funding reductions. In some cases, expected future workloads are used to justify retaining some excess shipyard personnel. Excess personnel are retained when the Navy determines that the excess is temporary and that the time and cost of reducing and reacquiring the needed personnel justifies retention. This is especially true when workload reductions take place during the fiscal year in which the work is scheduled to be performed. In such cases, naval shipyard personnel levels are set for the year, and according to the Navy, it is very difficult to make major adjustments to personnel levels due to Civil Service regulations. For example, during the latest reductions in force at the four naval shipyards, the reductions took about 12 months to complete, from initial planning to the time the employees were actually removed from the shipyards\u2019 payrolls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy\u2019s Homeporting Policy Impacts TDY Assignments", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s policy to perform all ship repair work of 6 months or less at the ship\u2019s homeport substantially increased the amount of TDY ship repair work performed in locations without a naval shipyard. Because crews remain with their ships when the ships need maintenance and repairs, the policy is to improve crew retention and the quality of life by reducing time away from homeports. Since many of the Navy\u2019s 23 ship homeports are not located near one of the four naval shipyards, the work is often performed by naval shipyard personnel on TDY assignments. Figure 1 shows the location of the four naval shipyards and some U.S. homeports. The number and type of ships located at each of the Navy\u2019s 23 homeports is shown in appendix I.", "As shown in table 1, a large number of ships are homeported at or near the Norfolk and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyards and provide each with a large potential workload for which temporarily excess shipyard personnel can be effectively used. The temporarily excess personnel can work on ships homeported in the area without being on TDY status. The two shipyards, however, also use the personnel to do some work that requires TDY assignments. On the other hand, relatively few ships are homeported near the Portsmouth and Puget Sound Naval Shipyards. As a result, these shipyards perform more work that requires TDY.", "Table 2 shows, by shipyard, the percent of total direct labor staff-days each naval shipyard spent on TDY assignments during fiscal  years 1995-97. As table 2 shows, Portsmouth and Puget Sound Naval Shipyards used about 480,000 direct labor staff-days, or about 83 percent of the estimated 580,000 direct labor staff-days naval shipyards used on TDY assignments during fiscal years 1995-97.", "Table 3 shows, by shipyard, the reported direct labor costs of TDY assignments and the related travel costs for fiscal years 1995-97. Portsmouth and Puget Sound Naval Shipyards expended about $164.6 million of the $193.1 million, or about 85 percent of the total TDY costs (direct labor costs plus travel costs)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness of TDY Assignments", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, available data indicates that most TDY assignments are based on the rationale that no local capability exists. In those cases where there is a local private sector capability, the cost-effectiveness rationale for TDY assignments is valid to the extent that naval shipyard personnel are temporarily excess. There is excess capacity and personnel in some naval shipyards. The Navy is retaining the excess personnel to meet anticipated future requirements.

In these cases, the Navy reasons that cost-effectiveness is not an issue because there is no practical alternative. As noted earlier, the Navy cites the use of TDY assignments to perform nuclear submarine repairs at San Diego as an example where no local private shipyard has nuclear repair capability. We agree that there may not be a practical alternative to some TDY assignments, but the Navy does not identify the rationale for each of its TDY assignments or provide the basis for any determination that there is no other practical alternative. In the case of San Diego, we found no basis to question the Navy\u2019s statement that no local private shipyard has the necessary nuclear repair capabilities; however, there may be other practical alternatives that are not being considered. For example, Newport News Shipbuilding, a nuclear repair capable private shipyard in Virginia, has established a presence in San Diego through its recent purchase of Continental Marine Industries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness of TDY Assignments When Local Private Capability Exists", "paragraphs": ["TDY assignments to locations with a private sector capability are likely to be cost-effective when shipyard personnel are temporarily excess. When naval shipyard personnel are temporarily excess, their cost is considered fixed and will be paid whether or not the personnel are performing repair work. We have reported that when labor costs are fixed, the only added costs to the government for the TDY assignments are travel, per diem, and other related costs. To determine the cost-effectiveness of TDY assignments, these travel-related costs would have to be compared to the average private shipyard staff-day rate for performing ship repairs. We examined several private shipyard staff-day rates and naval shipyard TDY costs and found that when the private shipyards\u2019 staff-day rates were compared only to the naval shipyards\u2019 TDY costs, the private shipyards\u2019 costs were always higher, usually substantially higher. For example, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard estimated that its average daily travel cost per worker for scheduled TDY work in San Diego in 1997 was about $116, while the average daily rate per private shipyard worker in San Diego was about $330. Assuming the productivity of both the public and private sector personnel are fairly comparable, it would be cost-effective from a cost and operational standpoint to perform the work using temporarily excess personnel.", "TDY assignments are not likely to be cost-effective when the naval shipyards\u2019 projected long-term workloads do not support existing personnel levels and local private shipyards are willing and capable of doing the work. In this case, both the naval shipyards\u2019 direct labor costs and travel costs should be considered in making cost-effectiveness determinations. To illustrate, in the earlier example, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard\u2019s staff-day rate of $474 for fiscal year 1997 would have to be added to the $116 daily travel and per diem costs and the resulting $590 staff-day rate compared to the private sector\u2019s rate of about $330 per day. Clearly, it would not be cost-effective for TDY shipyard personnel to do the work.

Table 4 shows the percent of expected excess capacityreported for each naval shipyard for fiscal years 1998-2001.", "Included in the reported excess capacity calculations are workloads such as several major nuclear submarine refuelings that were later canceled. Such cancellations further increase excess capacity and personnel. Also, the calculations include shipyard workloads that require TDY assignments. Without these workloads, the reported excess capacity and the availability of shipyard personnel would be higher. Unless additional workloads are identified, the personnel will be excess to the shipyard."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Navy Management of Excess Capacity and Personnel", "paragraphs": ["Excess naval shipyard capacity exists even though the Navy closed four naval shipyards through the Base Realignment and Closure process and reduced the personnel levels at the four remaining naval shipyards during fiscal years 1991-97 from about 36,000 to 22,000, a 38-percent reduction. The Navy believes that it needs to retain its current shipyard capacity and associated personnel levels to meet anticipated future requirements. Meanwhile, the Navy is using TDY assignments and is reallocating work from the private sector to more effectively use its excess capacity and personnel. For example, when three nuclear attack submarine refuelings scheduled for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard were canceled, the Navy, rather than further reducing personnel, decided to provide the shipyard with ship repair workload either previously located in other naval shipyards or in the private sector. For fiscal years 1997-99, this workload included work associated with the repair of submarines homeported in Groton, Connecticut. In the past, part of this work was performed by Electric Boat, a private nuclear-capable shipyard located in Groton, and part was done by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard personnel on TDY assignments. However, for the last 3 years, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has been assigned all the depot-level workload at Groton. The Navy believes this assignment of TDY workload to Portsmouth is cost-effective because it needs to retain skilled personnel to perform planned submarine refuelings from fiscal year 1999 to 2005. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the Navy plans to return part of the Groton workload to the private sector.", "The Navy\u2019s plan to use TDY assignments and reallocate private sector workloads to the naval shipyards to make effective use of excess shipyard capacity and temporarily excess personnel appears reasonable.

Each refueling requires about 300,000 staff-days of work and costs about $215 million. If these refuelings are done as scheduled, the number of excess personnel available for TDY will be reduced. For example, at Portsmouth, about 32 percent of the fiscal  year 1998 planned workload will require TDY assignments, but only  22 percent of the fiscal year 1999 planned workload will require TDY assignments because a nuclear attack submarine refueling is scheduled.", "If the refuelings are not done and shipyard capacity and associated personnel reductions are not made, TDY assignments are likely to increase. Since fiscal year 1993, the Navy has reduced planned submarine refuelings. For example, although the Navy planned to refuel 32 nuclear attack submarines during fiscal years 1993-2005, it has canceled 17 refuelings. Of the remaining 15 refuelings, four have been completed and the remaining 11 have been scheduled. Because the Navy reduced the number of refuelings, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard personnel were assigned to perform submarine repair work at the Groton and San Diego homeports.

Stennis, the first nuclear carrier scheduled to be homeported in San Diego. The work entails operating a nuclear repair facility currently under construction as well as performing depot-level nuclear propulsion plant work and integrating it with nonpropulsion plant work done by local private contractors and ship personnel. The Navy said that this work would enable the shipyard to maintain the skilled workforce required to support Pacific Fleet aircraft carrier maintenance and that the cyclical nature of the nuclear workload makes it uneconomical to maintain more than a skeletal workforce of skilled Puget Sound shipyard personnel needed for engineering and for quality and radiological controls in San Diego.", "Under current Navy plans, Puget Sound personnel will use about 112,000 direct labor staff-days for nuclear work on the Stennis. Not all of the Navy\u2019s work would be done at San Diego: planning, some engineering work, and some assembly would be done at Puget Sound. San Diego private shipyards would use about 53,000 direct labor staff-days for nonnuclear work.

The statement is to be forwarded to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics by October 1998.
