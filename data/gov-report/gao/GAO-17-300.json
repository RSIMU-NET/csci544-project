Twenty-three tasks were in progress and no action had yet been taken on 2 tasks. The 44 tasks aim to address three core CVE objectives: community outreach, research and training, and capacity building. Implemented tasks include, for example, DOJ conducting CVE outreach meetings to communities targeted by violent extremism and DHS integrating CVE content into law enforcement counterterrorism training. Tasks in progress include, for example, DHS building relationships with the social media industry and increasing training available to communities to counter violent extremists online. Tasks that had not yet been addressed include, implementing CVE activities in prisons and learning from former violent extremists. Federal CVE efforts aim to educate and prevent radicalization before a crime or terrorist act transpires, and differ from counterterrorism efforts such as collecting evidence and making arrests before an event has occurred.", "The federal government does not have a cohesive strategy or process for assessing the overall CVE effort. Although GAO was able to determine the status of the 44 CVE tasks, it was not able to determine if the United States is better off today than it was in 2011 as a result of these tasks. This is because no cohesive strategy with measurable outcomes has been established to guide the multi-agency CVE effort. Such a strategy could help ensure that the individual actions of stakeholder agencies are measureable and contributing to the overall goals of the federal government's CVE effort. The federal government also has not established a process by which to evaluate the effectiveness of the collective CVE effort. The CVE Task Force was established in part to evaluate and assess CVE efforts across the federal government, but has not established a process for doing so.

Extremist attacks of all kinds can have perilous effects on the  perceived safety of our nation. It is therefore imperative that the United  States employ effective means for preventing and deterring violent  extremism and related attacks. To help confront this critical need, in 2011  the President issued a CVE strategy and corresponding implementation  plan. However, over 5 years have passed and the federal government  has not developed a cohesive strategy among stakeholder agencies that  provides measurable outcomes to guide the collaborative implementation  of CVE activities. While the CVE Task Force provided a forum for  coordination and led the effort to develop a new SIP, the plan does not  provide stakeholder agencies with specific direction and measures to  identify successes and gaps in the implementation of their activities. In  the absence of a cohesive strategy, DHS has developed its own strategy,  while no such roadmap is in place for the collaborative implementation of  activities by all stakeholder agencies. As the entity responsible for the  synchronization and integration of CVE programs across the government,  the CVE Task Force is well positioned to develop a cohesive strategy that  provides all stakeholder agencies with a clear path forward in achieving  the federal CVE effort\u2019s desired outcomes.", "The CVE Task Force, established in part to assess and evaluate CVE  programs, has also not established an approach for assessing overall  progress. Without consistent measures and methodologies for evaluating  CVE as a whole, the federal government lacks the necessary information  needed to assess the extent to which stakeholder agencies are achieving  their goals. Without this information, stakeholders will not be able to  identify successes and gaps and allocate or leverage resources  effectively. When dealing with programs and activities that are designed  to keep Americans safe from the threat of violent extremism, agency  leaders and policy makers need to be able to know how well the federal  government is doing in implementing these activities.

The FBI was treated as a lead agency for reporting purposes  because it was listed as a lead agency in the SIP. These four agencies  were responsible for domestic CVE activities and were collectively  responsible for implementing 44 out of the 47 tasks in the SIP. We did not  analyze the implementation of 3 of the 47 tasks because they were  international in scope and led by an agency outside of the four agencies  responsible for domestic CVE. Specifically, we did not analyze the  Department of Treasury\u2019s efforts to address terrorism financing, the  Department of Defense\u2019s effort to provide training to military personnel,  and the State Department\u2019s international exchange program. GAO asked  for information from each lead agency on actions taken from December  2011 through December 2016 to address their assigned activities in the  2011 SIP. Based on information provided, one analyst analyzed each  agency\u2019s action(s) to determine whether each task in the SIP had been  implemented, was still in progress, or had not been addressed. A  separate analyst independently reviewed each assessment and narrative.  If there was disagreement on a rating, a third analyst reviewed that  information and made a determination on the final rating. Upon  preliminary completion of the appendix table, GAO sent the table to DHS,  DOJ, FBI, and NCTC and incorporated technical comments as  appropriate.

Specifically, we reviewed  these documents to identify whether measurable outcomes and  associated metrics had been defined. We interviewed officials from the  stakeholder agencies including DHS, DOJ, the Department of Education,  the Department of Health and Human Services, FBI, and NCTC to  discuss their approaches to CVE and their roles and responsibilities as  part of the federal CVE effort. We compared the practices of the Task  Force to selected leading practices of multi-agency collaborative efforts  identified in prior GAO work as well as selected practices in the GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010. Practices were selected for comparison  based on their applicability to the CVE Task Force. For context and  perspectives on how CVE activities were implemented in local areas we  interviewed a non-generalizable group of community organizations  selected based on their location in the three pilot cities that have adopted  CVE frameworks: Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and  Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2015 to April 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
