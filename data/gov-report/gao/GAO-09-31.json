GAO was required to report on personality disorder separations and examined (1) the extent that selected military installations complied with DOD's separation requirements and (2) how DOD ensures compliance with these requirements. GAO reviewed a sample of 312 servicemembers' records from four installations, representing the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, that had the highest or second highest number of Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom servicemembers separated because of a personality disorder. The review is generalizable to the installations, but not to the services. GAO also reviewed 59 Navy servicemembers' records, but this review is not generalizable to the installation or the Navy because parts of the separation process could have been completed at multiple locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's review of enlisted servicemembers' records found that the selected military installations GAO visited varied in their documented compliance with DOD's requirements for personality disorder separations. DOD has requirements for separations because of a personality disorder, which is defined as an enduring pattern of behavior that deviates markedly from expected behavior and has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood. The three key requirements established by DOD are that enlisted servicemembers (1) must be notified of their impending separation because of a personality disorder, (2) must be diagnosed with a personality disorder by a psychiatrist or psychologist who determines that servicemembers' personality disorder interferes with their ability to function in the military, and (3) must receive formal counseling about their problem with functioning in the military. For the four installations, compliance with the notification requirement was at or above 98 percent. The compliance rates for the requirement related to the personality disorder diagnosis ranged from 40 to 78 percent. For the requirement for formal counseling, compliance ranged from 40 to 99 percent. GAO's review of the documentation in the enlisted Navy servicemembers' records found that compliance varied by requirement. Ninety-five percent of enlisted Navy servicemembers' records had documentation indicating that enlisted servicemembers had been notified of their impending separation because of a personality disorder. Eighty-two percent had documentation that indicated compliance with the requirement that enlisted servicemembers must be diagnosed with a personality disorder by a psychiatrist or psychologist who determines that the personality disorder interferes with servicemembers' ability to function in the military. Seventy-seven percent had documentation indicating compliance with the requirement for formal counseling. DOD does not have reasonable assurance that its key personality disorder separation requirements have been followed. DOD policy directs the military services to implement and ensure consistent administration of DOD's requirements for separating enlisted servicemembers because of a personality disorder. According to military service officials, the military services delegate to commanders with separation authority at military installations sole responsibility for ensuring that the separation requirements are followed for enlisted servicemembers under their command. When asked about the low rates of compliance for some of the separation requirements that GAO found, military officials responsible for reviewing the servicemembers' records with whom GAO spoke could not explain why these separations were approved if compliance with the separation requirements was not documented in the servicemembers' records. The military services have not established a way to determine whether the commanders with separation authority are ensuring that DOD's key separation requirements are met, and DOD does not have reasonable assurance that its requirements have been followed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) requires that all servicemembers,  including those who serve in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and  Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), be physically and psychologically suitable  for military service. Enlisted servicemembers who fail to meet this  standard may be separated from the military. One psychological condition  that can render a servicemember unsuitable for military service is a  personality disorder, which is defined as a long-standing, inflexible pattern  of behavior that deviates markedly from expected behavior, has an onset  in adolescence or early adulthood, and leads to distress or impairment.  Such a condition may make one unable to work within a military  environment. DOD data show that from November 1, 2001, through   June 30, 2007, about 26,000 enlisted servicemembers were separated from  the military because of a personality disorder. Of these 26,000, about 2,800  had deployed at least once in support of OEF/OIF.", "Accurately diagnosing OEF/OIF servicemembers with a personality  disorder can be challenging. Specifically, some of the symptoms of a  personality disorder\u2014irritability, feelings of detachment or estrangement  from others, and aggressiveness\u2014are similar to the symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition for which some OEF/OIF  servicemembers may also be at risk. However, according to mental health  experts and military mental health providers, one important difference  between a personality disorder and PTSD is that a personality disorder is a  long-standing condition, whereas PTSD is a condition that follows  exposure to a traumatic event. Although servicemembers with personality  disorders may have symptoms that first appear during their military duty,  DOD does not consider this to be a condition caused by military service. A  separation from the military because of a personality disorder can be  stigmatizing and can have adverse consequences for servicemembers,  such as limiting employment opportunities after servicemembers leave the  military.", "DOD has established three key requirements that the military services\u2014 Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps\u2014must follow when separating  enlisted servicemembers because of a personality disorder. Specifically,  before they are separated because of a personality disorder, enlisted  servicemembers    must receive notification of their impending separation because of a    must receive, prior to the notification, a diagnosis of personality disorder  by a psychiatrist or psychologist who determines that the personality  disorder interferes with servicemembers\u2019 ability to function in the military;  and   must receive formal counseling about their problem with functioning in  the military.", "Typically, an enlisted servicemember\u2019s commander initiates the separation  process. This commander, as well as a psychiatrist or psychologist, must  follow the requirements established by DOD when separating a  servicemember because of a personality disorder. Additionally,  servicemembers undergoing the separation process have various  protections available to them. For example, servicemembers may meet  with a military attorney to discuss their rights during the separation  process.", "Congress included provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2008 that require us to review and report on OEF/OIF  servicemembers\u2019 separations from military service because of a  personality disorder, and 11 senators also expressed interest in this work.  For our review, we examined (1) the extent to which selected military  installations complied with DOD requirements for separating enlisted  servicemembers because of a personality disorder, (2) how DOD ensures  compliance by the military services with personality disorder separation  requirements, and (3) the extent to which enlisted servicemembers  selected the protections available to them.", "To determine the extent to which selected military installations complied  with DOD\u2019s personality disorder separation requirements, we reviewed  DOD and the military services\u2019 separation regulations and instructions to  identify the key requirements for separating enlisted servicemembers  because of a personality disorder. We included only enlisted  servicemembers because officers generally are able to resign at any time  rather than be involuntarily separated. We obtained DOD data for enlisted  OEF/OIF servicemembers separated because of a personality disorder  from November 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007, which we determined to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes by corroborating these data with  information in the servicemembers\u2019 personnel records. We analyzed these  data to determine which installations across the military services had the  highest number of enlisted OEF/OIF servicemembers separated because of  a personality disorder. We selected four installations to visit\u2014Fort Carson  (Army), Fort Hood (Army), Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (Air Force),  and Camp Pendleton (Marine Corps)\u2014because these installations  accounted for the highest or second highest number of enlisted OEF/OIF  servicemembers separated because of a personality disorder from  November 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007, among their military service\u2019s   installations. For three of the installations we visited, we obtained and  reviewed personnel records for a random sample of enlisted  servicemembers whose certificates of release indicated that they were  separated from these installations because of a personality disorder. For  the fourth installation, we obtained and reviewed personnel records for all  of the enlisted servicemembers whose certificates of release indicated that  they were separated from that installation because of a personality  disorder. We reviewed all of these enlisted servicemembers\u2019 records  because the total number of servicemembers separated from this  installation was too small to draw a random, generalizable sample. Our  findings based on our compliance review can be generalized to each of the  four installations but cannot be generalized to the military services.", "In addition to the four military installations from the Army, Air Force, and  Marine Corps, we visited Naval Base San Diego. We obtained and reviewed  personnel records for enlisted Navy servicemembers whose certificates of  release indicated that they were separated because of a personality  disorder. During the course of our review, Navy officials at this base told  us that enlisted Navy servicemembers selected for our review were  transferred to the transient personnel unit at Naval Base San Diego from a  Navy ship at various points in the separation process. According to a  Navy official, most enlisted Navy servicemembers were diagnosed,  formally counseled, and notified of their impending separation while on  board a Navy ship and were transferred to the transient personnel unit at  Naval Base San Diego to receive their certificates of release. Other enlisted  Navy servicemembers were diagnosed, formally counseled, and notified of  their impending separation while at Naval Base San Diego. We could not  generalize our findings to Naval Base San Diego because some of the  elements of the separation process could have been completed while these  servicemembers were on board a Navy ship. We also could not generalize  to the Navy. Therefore, we have reported the results of our review of  enlisted Navy servicemembers\u2019 records separately from our presentation  of findings based on our review of the other four military installations.", "For our compliance review, we examined 312 personnel records for  enlisted servicemembers from the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps  installations and 59 records for enlisted servicemembers from the Navy\u2014 371 records in total. We obtained these records from each military  service\u2019s central repository, where the personnel records of  servicemembers who have been separated from the military are stored. In  each of these records, we reviewed what is known as a separation packet,  which is required to contain documents related to a servicemember\u2019s  separation. According to military service officials responsible for the  separation policy, the separation packet is required to include  documentation demonstrating that DOD\u2019s three key requirements for a  personality disorder separation have been met.", "To complete our compliance review, we reviewed servicemembers\u2019  separation packets first to see if the packets contained documentation that  servicemembers had been notified of their impending separation because  of a personality disorder. If the servicemembers\u2019 separation packets  lacked such documentation, we did not assess compliance for the other  two key separation requirements. If the packets did include such  documentation, we reviewed the packets to determine whether they  contained documentation required by the military services demonstrating  that the other two key requirements had been met. Table 1 describes the  criteria we used to determine compliance.", "To determine how DOD ensures compliance with its personality disorder  separation requirements by the military services, we reviewed DOD  regulations and interviewed officials from DOD and the military services.  To determine the extent to which enlisted servicemembers selected the  protections available to them, such as consulting legal counsel prior to  being separated, we reviewed the same 371 enlisted servicemembers\u2019  separation packets as we reviewed to determine compliance with DOD\u2019s  personality disorder separation requirements\u2014312 separation packets for  enlisted servicemembers from the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps  installations and 59 separation packets for enlisted servicemembers from  the Navy. For the 371 enlisted servicemembers whose separation packets  we reviewed, we also obtained information from the military services to  determine whether any of these servicemembers appealed the reason for  their separation. Appendix I provides more detailed information on our  methodology. We conducted this performance audit from May 2007  through August 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Enlisted servicemembers can be separated from the military when they are  found to be unsuitable for continued military service. According to DOD  regulations, enlisted servicemembers can be separated for reasons such as  misconduct, failure to overcome substance abuse, and certain mental  health conditions, including a personality disorder. A personality disorder  by itself does not make enlisted servicemembers unsuitable for military  service. DOD requires that the disorder be severe enough that it interferes  with an enlisted servicemember\u2019s ability to function in the military.", "DOD and the military services require that to diagnose a personality  disorder a psychiatrist or psychologist use criteria established in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which  was developed by the American Psychiatric Association. Similarly, in the  private sector, clinicians use criteria in the DSM to diagnose a personality  disorder, but in some instances, clinicians other than psychiatrists or  psychologists, such as licensed clinical social workers, may make this  diagnosis.", "Diagnosing a personality disorder in a servicemember who has served in  combat can be complicated by the fact that some symptoms of a  personality disorder may be similar to symptoms of combat-related mental  health conditions. For example, both personality disorder and PTSD have  similar symptoms of feelings of detachment or estrangement from others,  and irritability. According to the American Psychiatric Association and the  American Psychological Association, the only way to distinguish a  personality disorder from a combat-related mental health condition, such  as PTSD, is by getting an in-depth medical and personal history from the  servicemember that is corroborated, if possible, by family and friends.", "According to DOD officials, the three key requirements that the military  services must follow when separating an enlisted servicemember are  designed to help ensure that enlisted servicemembers are separated for  the appropriate reason. Documentation of compliance with these  requirements is to be included in the separation packet found in the  enlisted servicemember\u2019s personnel record, as required by the military  services. The separation packet is required to contain other documents  related to the enlisted servicemember\u2019s separation. According to officials  from the military services, the servicemember\u2019s immediate commander  gives the separation packet to an installation official who is to review the  packet to verify that the requirements for the personality disorder  separation have been met. If this review verifies that the requirements  have been met, the separation packet is then sent to a commander at the  installation who has authority for approving a personality disorder  separation for that enlisted servicemember. This commander is a higher- level officer than the enlisted servicemember\u2019s immediate commander. A  military installation may have more than one commander who has the  authority to approve separations because of a personality disorder.  However, each commander with separation authority approves  separations only for enlisted servicemembers under his or her command.", "Once enlisted servicemembers have been separated from military service,  they receive certificates of release from the military, which include  information on the reason for separation and an official characterization  of their time in the service. For enlisted servicemembers separated  because of a personality disorder, their certificates of release would state  that the reason for their separation was a personality disorder. Employers  may request to see separated servicemembers\u2019 certificates of release to  verify their military service, and employers may make employment  decisions based on the information they see on servicemembers\u2019  certificates of release.", "Enlisted servicemembers have protections available to them when going  through the separation process. All enlisted servicemembers can submit  statements on their own behalf to the commander with separation  authority, consult with legal counsel prior to separation, and obtain copies  of the separation packet that is sent to the commander with separation  authority. In addition, enlisted servicemembers with 6 or more years of  military service are eligible to request a hearing before an administrative  board. An administrative board hearing allows enlisted servicemembers  to have legal representation, call witnesses, and speak on their own behalf  in defending against the recommended separation. The board includes at  least three members who, following a hearing, make a recommendation to  the commander with separation authority as to whether the enlisted  servicemember should be separated.", "Enlisted servicemembers also have protections available to them after  they have been separated. They may challenge the reasons given for their  separations after they have been separated from the military. Within 15  years after separation from the military, enlisted servicemembers may  appeal their separation to a discharge review board. Further, enlisted  servicemembers may appeal the discharge review board\u2019s decision by  applying to a board for the correction of military records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Military Installations\u2019 Compliance with Three Key Personality Disorder Separation Requirements Varied", "paragraphs": ["The four military installations we visited varied in their compliance with  DOD\u2019s three key requirements for personality disorder separations.

For our review, we examined (1) the extent to which  selected military installations complied with DOD requirements for  separating enlisted servicemembers because of a personality disorder,   (2) how DOD ensures compliance with personality disorder separation  requirements by the military services, and (3) the extent to which enlisted  servicemembers who are separated because of a personality disorder  selected protections available to them.", "For this review, we included enlisted servicemembers from the Army, Air  Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. We included only enlisted  servicemembers because officers are able to resign at any time rather than  be involuntarily separated. We included enlisted servicemembers who  deployed at least once in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)  or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The Coast Guard was excluded because  it is under the direction of the Department of Homeland Security and  represents a very small portion of servicemembers deployed in support of  OEF and OIF. For this review, enlisted servicemembers are those in the  active duty component and Reserve component\u2014reservists and National  Guard members\u2014who were discharged or released from active duty from  November 1, 2001\u2014the first full month of combat operations for OEF\u2014 through June 30, 2007\u2014the latest date for which data were available from  DOD at the time of our review.", "We obtained data from DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) on  the number of enlisted servicemembers who had been separated from the  military because of a personality disorder from November 1, 2001, through  June 30, 2007. These data came from DMDC\u2019s Active Duty Military  Personnel Transaction File and DMDC\u2019s Reserve Components Common  Personnel Data Transaction File, which are databases that contain  servicemember-level data, such as Social Security number, education  level, date of birth, pay grade, separation program designator code, and  reenlistment eligibility. The Active Duty Military Personnel Transaction  File contains a transaction record for every individual entrance,  separation, or reenlistment in the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine  Corps within a specific time frame. The Reserve Components Common  Personnel Data Transaction File contains this information for every  individual entrance, separation, or reenlistment in the Army National  Guard, Army Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Navy  Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve within a specific time frame. We also  asked that DMDC indicate, from its Contingency Tracking System  Deployment File, if any enlisted servicemembers who were separated  because of a personality disorder were also deployed, for at least one tour  of duty, in support of OEF or OIF. The Contingency Tracking System  Deployment File is a database that includes data elements for all  servicemembers deployed in support of OEF/OIF. A contingency tracking  system deployment is defined as a servicemember being physically located  within the OEF or OIF combat zones/areas of operation, or specifically  identified by the military service as directly supporting the OEF/OIF  mission outside of the designated combat zone. We determined that the  DMDC data were sufficiently reliable because we corroborated these data  with information in the enlisted servicemembers\u2019 personnel records.", "Based on our analysis of the data provided by DMDC, we selected four  military installations across the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps to visit  based on whether the installation had the highest or second highest  number of enlisted OEF/OIF servicemembers separated because of a  personality disorder for that service. We selected one installation each  from the Air Force and the Marine Corps. We selected two Army  installations because at the time of our review, the Army had the majority  of servicemembers deployed in support of OEF/OIF when compared with  the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Among Marine Corps installations, we  selected Camp Pendleton, in California, which had the second highest  number of enlisted servicemembers separated because of a personality  disorder during this time period. This installation was selected because the  Marine Corps installation with the highest number of enlisted  servicemembers separated because of a personality disorder was in the  midst of a deployment cycle and requested that we not visit. The other  military installations we selected were Fort Carson (Army), Colorado; Fort  Hood (Army), Texas; and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (Air Force),  Arizona.", "In addition to the four military installations we visited, we visited Naval  Base San Diego. We selected Naval Base San Diego based on DMDC\u2019s data,  which identified this naval base as having the second highest number of  enlisted OEF/OIF Navy servicemembers separated because of a  personality disorder from November 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007.  During the course of our review, Navy officials at this base told us that  enlisted Navy servicemembers selected for our review were transferred to  the transient personnel unit at Naval Base San Diego from a Navy ship at  various points in the separation process. According to a Navy official,  most enlisted Navy servicemembers were diagnosed, formally counseled,  and notified of their impending separation while on board a Navy ship and  were transferred to the transient personnel unit at Naval Base San Diego  to receive their certificates of release. Other enlisted Navy  servicemembers were diagnosed, formally counseled, and notified of their  impending separation while at Naval Base San Diego. We could not  generalize our findings to Naval Base San Diego because some of the  elements of the separation process could have been completed while these  servicemembers were on board a Navy ship. Therefore, we have reported  the results of our review of enlisted Navy servicemembers\u2019 records  separately from our presentation of findings based on our review of the  other four military installations.", "To determine the extent to which the four military installations and  enlisted Navy servicemembers\u2019 records that we reviewed complied with  DOD personality disorder separation requirements, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  and the military services\u2019 enlisted administrative separation regulations  and instructions to identify the key requirements for separating enlisted  servicemembers because of a personality disorder. We also interviewed  officials at each of the military services\u2019 headquarters who are responsible  for overseeing separation policy. We interviewed additional officials at  each of the four selected installations and at Naval Base San Diego,  including mental health providers, staff judge advocates, legal counsel  with defense services, unit commanders, administrators of the Medical  Evaluation Board, and officials in the transition/separation offices, to  understand the administrative separation process.", "Additionally, to determine whether the selected installations and enlisted  Navy servicemembers\u2019 records that we reviewed complied with DOD\u2019s  requirements for separating servicemembers because of a personality  disorder, we obtained and reviewed the personnel records of selected  servicemembers to verify that their certificates of release indicated that  they were separated because of a personality disorder. We obtained these  records from each military service\u2019s central repository, where the  personnel records of servicemembers who have been separated from the  military are stored. According to military service officials responsible for  separation policy, the separation packet, which is found in the enlisted  servicemember\u2019s personnel record, is required to contain documents  related to the separation, including documents indicating that DOD\u2019s three  key requirements have been met.", "For three of the installations we selected, we reviewed the personnel  records of a random, generalizable sample of enlisted servicemembers  who deployed at least once in support of OEF/OIF and who were  separated from that installation because of a personality disorder from  November 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007. For the other installation we  selected, we reviewed the personnel records of all enlisted  servicemembers who deployed at least once in support of OEF/OIF and  who were separated from that installation because of a personality  disorder from November 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007, because the  number of servicemembers separated from that installation was too small  to draw a random, generalizable sample. In total, we included 343 enlisted  servicemembers\u2019 personnel records across the four installations. Of these  343 records, 312 enlisted servicemembers\u2019 personnel records were  included in our documentation review because their personnel records  contained separation packets, which we needed to review to determine  compliance. Of the 31 servicemembers\u2019 personnel records that were  excluded from our review, 3 had separation packets that were illegible.  The remaining 28 servicemembers\u2019 personnel records did not have  separation packets available for our review.", "We also obtained 94 enlisted Navy servicemembers\u2019 personnel records  from the Navy\u2019s central repository, where the personnel records of  servicemembers who have been separated are stored after they leave the  Navy. We reviewed the personnel records of all enlisted Navy  servicemembers who deployed at least once in support of OEF/OIF and  who were separated from Naval Base San Diego because of a personality  disorder from November 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007, because the  number of enlisted servicemembers separated from Naval Base San Diego  was too small to draw a random, generalizable sample. We reviewed these  personnel records to determine if they contained separation packets,  which are required by the Navy. Of the 94 enlisted Navy servicemembers,  59 servicemembers\u2019 personnel records were included in our review  because their records contained separation packets, which were needed  for us to determine compliance. We excluded 35 enlisted Navy  servicemembers\u2019 personnel records from our evaluation of compliance.  One enlisted servicemember\u2019s separation packet was illegible and   34 enlisted servicemembers\u2019 separation packets were not available for  review.", "In our review, we determined compliance for each of the three key  personality disorder separation requirements by reviewing the  documentation in the enlisted servicemembers\u2019 separation packets to see  if it indicated compliance with that requirement. If the enlisted  servicemember\u2019s separation packet did not include documentation that  the servicemember had been notified of the impending separation because  of a personality disorder\u2014one of the key requirements for a personality  disorder separation\u2014we did not assess compliance with the other two key  requirements. Table 2 describes the criteria we used to determine  compliance.", "Our review of compliance can be generalized to each of the four  installations we visited, but not to the military services. For enlisted Navy  servicemembers whose separation packets we reviewed, we cannot  generalize to Naval Base San Diego or to the Navy.", "To determine how DOD ensures compliance by the military services with  requirements for separating enlisted servicemembers because of a  personality disorder, we reviewed DOD regulations and interviewed DOD  and the military services\u2019 officials responsible for separation policy.  Additionally, we interviewed military officials responsible for legal  services at the installations we visited and at Naval Base San Diego about  how they ensure compliance with DOD\u2019s key requirements for personality  disorder separations.", "To determine the extent to which enlisted servicemembers at the four  installations we visited and enlisted Navy servicemembers selected the  protections available to them during the separation process, we reviewed  the same 371 enlisted servicemembers\u2019 separation packets as we reviewed  to determine compliance with DOD\u2019s personality disorder separation  requirements\u2014312 separation packets for enlisted servicemembers from  the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps installations and 59 separation  packets for enlisted servicemembers from the Navy. Enlisted  servicemembers are given a list of the protections available to them and  select protections from this list, which are included in servicemembers\u2019  separation packets. From our review of the separation packets, we  determined whether enlisted servicemembers selected the protections  available, but did not determine whether servicemembers received the  protections that they selected. To determine the extent to which enlisted  servicemembers selected protections available after being separated, we  obtained information from each military service\u2019s discharge review board  and board for the correction of military records. Using this information,  we determined whether the same 371 enlisted servicemembers, whose  separation packets we reviewed to determine compliance with DOD\u2019s  personality disorder separation requirements, challenged the reason for  their separation.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 through August 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Mary Ann Curran, Assistant  Director; Sarah Burton; Christie Enders; Krister Friday; Becky  Hendrickson; Martha R.W.
