The nutritional value of these foods is largely unregulated, and students can often purchase these foods in addition to or instead of school meals. In our April 2004 report on competitive foods (GAO-04-673), we reported that several states had enacted competitive food policies that were more restrictive than federal regulations. However, these policies differed widely in the type and extent of restrictions. In addition, it was unclear how and to what extent states were monitoring compliance with these policies. GAO was also asked to provide a national picture of competitive foods in schools, as well as strategies that districts and schools themselves are taking to limit the availability of less nutritious competitive foods. This report provides information from two nationally representative surveys about the prevalence of competitive foods in schools, competitive foods restrictions and groups involved in their sale, and the amounts and uses of revenue generated from the sale of competitive foods. It also provides information about strategies schools have used to limit the availability of less nutritious competitive foods, based on visits to a total of six school districts in California, Connecticut, Mississippi, Missouri, and South Carolina."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 9 out of 10 schools sold competitive foods to students in school year 2003-2004, and the availability of competitive foods sold in middle schools and through a la carte lines has increased over the last 5 years. Schools often sold these foods in or near the cafeteria and during lunch, and the competitive foods available ranged from nutritious items such as fruit and milk to less nutritious items such as soda and candy. High and middle schools were more likely to sell competitive foods than elementary schools. Many different people made decisions about competitive food sales, but no one person commonly had responsibility for all sales in a school. In a majority of schools, district officials made competitive food policies, while school food authority directors and principals made decisions about specific sales. Other groups, such as student clubs and booster groups, also made competitive food decisions through their direct involvement in sales. Many schools, particularly high schools and middle schools, generated substantial revenues through competitive food sales in 2003-2004. Specifically, the nearly 30 percent of high schools generating the most revenue from these sales raised more than $125,000 per school. Food services, responsible for providing federal school meals, generally spent the revenue they generated through a la carte sales on food service operations. Other school groups often used revenues for student activities. The six school districts visited all recently took steps to substitute healthy items for less nutritious competitive foods. In each district, committed individuals took actions to initiate and lead change while also involving those affected. However, districts faced several barriers to change, including opposition due to concerns about revenue losses. In the districts visited, the effects of changes on revenues were often unclear because of limited data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Increasing child obesity rates have recently focused attention on children\u2019s  health and nutrition and have raised concerns about foods available in  schools that compete nutritionally and financially with federally regulated  school meal programs. The number of children who are overweight has  more than doubled, and the number of adolescents who are overweight  has more than tripled since 1980, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC). These changes are related, in part, to poor  nutrition. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, more  than 60 percent of young people eat too much fat and less than 20 percent  of the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables. In addition to  having negative health outcomes, children with poor nutrition may have a  harder time concentrating and succeeding in school than other children.  The Surgeon General\u2019s 2001 call to action identified schools as one of the  key settings for public health strategies to address child nutrition. Since  children spend a large portion of their day in school, providing them with  healthful food options throughout the school day can be an important step  toward good child nutrition.", "The key school meal programs, the National School Lunch Program and  the School Breakfast Program, provide millions of children with nutritious  meals each school day. USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service administers  these programs through local school food authorities (SFA) and subsidizes  the meals served in local schools as long as meals meet certain nutritional  guidelines. However, other foods not provided through these programs,  typically referred to as competitive foods, are often available to children at  school. Competitive food sales can take place at a variety of venues in  schools, including vending machines, school stores, and a la carte lines in  the cafeteria, through which the SFA sells individually priced food and  beverage items. Federal restrictions concerned with the nutritional value  of competitive foods are limited. Specifically, federal regulations require  that one segment of competitive foods, defined as foods of minimal  nutritional value, not be sold to students during the breakfast and lunch  periods in food service areas.", "In recent years, federal, state, and local governments have increasingly  focused on the role that competitive foods play in children\u2019s diets. In our  April 2004 report on competitive foods, we reported that increasing  numbers of state legislatures have enacted and proposed legislation to  restrict the availability of competitive foods in schools. In addition, school  districts and schools themselves are taking steps to limit the availability of  competitive foods.", "Because of your interest in further understanding issues related to  competitive foods in schools, you asked us to answer the following  questions: (1) How prevalent is the sale of competitive foods in schools  across the country, and has this prevalence changed over time? (2) Who  makes decisions about competitive food sales in schools? (3) What  amount of revenue is generated from the sale of competitive foods, and for  what purposes is the revenue used? (4) What strategies have schools used  to limit the availability of less nutritious competitive foods, what obstacles  did they face, and how have these strategies affected sales revenue?", "To answer your first three questions, we obtained information through two  Web surveys, one of school principals and the other of district-level SFA  directors. To conduct our surveys, we selected a stratified random sample  from the 80,000 public schools nationwide that participate in the National  School Lunch Program, which allowed us to provide national estimates  based on school level. The surveys were administered between October  19, 2004, and February 11, 2005, with 65 percent of principals and 70  percent of SFA directors responding. The surveys asked respondents  about conditions in their schools during specific school years, primarily  2003-2004, and therefore, all years cited refer to school years. In addition,  all estimates presented from the surveys have margins of error of plus or  minus 15 percent or less, unless otherwise noted. To answer the fourth  question, we conducted site visits to 6 school districts in California  (Oakland), Connecticut (New Haven), Mississippi (McComb), Missouri  (Independence and Fort Osage), and South Carolina (Richland One),  including visits to a total of 10 schools. Our site visit localities were  selected from a group of approximately 100 districts and schools  recognized as making efforts to limit access to less nutritious competitive  foods. The 6 districts visited were also selected because it appeared that  they used different strategies to restrict competitive foods, and when  viewed as a group, they provided variation across characteristics such as  geographic location, district size, and socioeconomic status.

The NSLP, established in 1946, provides nutritionally balanced low-cost or  free lunches in participating schools to more than 28 million children each  school day, as well as reimbursement for snacks served to those through  age 18 in after-school educational and enrichment programs. Similarly, the  School Breakfast Program, permanently established in 1975, provides free  or reduced price breakfasts to more than 8 million schoolchildren daily.  At the federal level, these programs are administered by USDA\u2019s Food and  Nutrition Service (FNS). As part of its strategic goal to improve the  nation\u2019s nutrition and health, the department has laid out plans to increase  access to, and utilization of, these school meal programs.", "In fiscal year 2004, the federal government spent over $8 billion on the  NSLP and the School Breakfast Program. FNS provides reimbursement in  the form of cash subsidies and donated commodities based on the number  of lunches and breakfasts served that meet certain federal requirements.  The meals must adhere to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which  include limits on total fat and saturated fat and call for diets moderate in  sodium. The meals must also meet standards for the recommended daily  allowances of calories, as well as nutrients such as protein, calcium, iron,  and vitamins A and C. Compliance with the standards is determined by  averaging the nutritional content of the meals offered over a school week.  USDA reimburses states, usually through the state departments of  education, which in turn reimburse local SFAs that operate the programs  in one or more schools.", "SFAs function as the governing entities responsible for the local  administration of the federal meals programs. They are often, but not  always, responsible for school meals in an entire school district. SFAs  have some flexibility in operating their school meal programs. For  example, they may operate the programs themselves or contract with food  service management companies to perform functions such as planning and  preparing menus and selecting and buying food. All or some food  preparation may occur at on-site school kitchens or at central kitchens,  which then distribute food to satellite schools. In addition, SFAs may  select among different menu-planning approaches to comply with the  federal nutritional requirements.", "SFAs receive a significant portion of their funding from federal  reimbursements that are based on the number of meals served to students  in their schools. In addition, SFAs also receive some funding from states  for program operations, and they may generate revenues by selling  competitive foods or by offering fee-based catering services. Further, SFAs  are permitted to combine costs and revenues for reimbursable meals and  nonreimbursable offerings, such as competitive foods, as long as they  maintain their nonprofit status. Therefore, if revenues from reimbursable  meals are less than the costs of producing these meals, SFAs may use  competitive food revenues to support the cost of reimbursable meals.  Likewise, if revenues from reimbursable meals are more than the costs of  producing these meals, SFAs may use these funds to support competitive  food sales."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minimal Federal Restriction of Competitive Foods", "paragraphs": ["Competitive foods are those foods sold in schools, during the school day,  that are not part of the federal school meal programs\u2014that is, they  compete with the nutritionally regulated school meal programs. These  foods can range from candy and soda to pizza and popcorn to apples and  milk and are typically available in cafeteria a la carte lines, vending  machines, and school stores.", "Unlike federally subsidized school meals, the sale and nutritional content  of competitive foods are largely unregulated by the federal government.  Federal regulations prohibit the sale of certain competitive foods, known  as foods of minimal nutritional value (FMNV), during meal periods in  school cafeterias and other food service areas. FMNV, as defined by  USDA, include soda, chewing gum, and hard candy, for example (see fig.  1). Other than this restriction, federal regulations do not prohibit or limit  the sale of any other competitive foods anywhere on school grounds at  any time. In contrast, from 1980 to 1983, federal regulations prohibited the  sale of FMNV anywhere in the school from the beginning of the school day  until the last meal period. In National Soft Drink Ass\u2019n v. Block, 721 F. 2d  1348 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  overturned this regulation and construed a 1977 amendment to the Child  Nutrition Act as allowing USDA to regulate the sale of competitive foods  only in food service areas during meal periods. Following this decision,  USDA amended its regulation to limit the prohibition of these foods to  food service areas during meal periods.", "According to federal regulations, states and SFAs may impose further  restrictions on all foods sold at any time throughout their schools. As of  April 2005, 28 states have made efforts to restrict the sale of competitive  foods beyond USDA regulations (see fig. 2). Five state policies do not  restrict particular food items, but instead typically address the competitive  food environment more broadly. For example, some of these states have  created committees to develop policies concerning competitive foods in  schools or have encouraged schools to find ways to improve their  competitive food environments. The remaining 23 of these state policies  place some form of specific restrictions on competitive foods, though they  differ in the type and extent of restrictions.

These illnesses can result in substantial long- term costs to society. In response, USDA has recently developed initiatives  to support school efforts to provide a healthy nutrition environment,  including competitive food sales. Beginning in 1995, USDA introduced the  School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children in an effort to improve the  nutritional quality of meals served through the NSLP and the School  Breakfast Program. That same year, in order to assist with implementation  of the School Meals Initiative, USDA launched Team Nutrition to focus on  schools and promote the nutritional health of the nation\u2019s children. Team  Nutrition provides schools with nutrition education materials for children  and families, technical assistance materials for school food services, and  materials to build school and community support for healthy eating and  physical activity. Since 1995, USDA has also created additional resources  to help schools improve student nutrition, address competitive foods, and  foster long-term health, sometimes in collaboration with other federal  agencies (see table 1).", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has also focused on  the school nutrition environment through various initiatives by CDC.

Among other things, the institute recommended that the current federal  funding structure of school meals and the policies and practices of selling  competitive foods in schools be examined for improvements that would  encourage students to consume nutritious foods and beverages, and that  nutritional standards be developed and implemented for all competitive  foods sold or served in schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On the Horizon: School Wellness Policies and Research on Nutritional Standards", "paragraphs": ["The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 requires school  districts that participate in the federal meal programs to establish local  wellness policies by the first day of the 2006-2007 school year.

According to our survey of SFA directors, in  2003-2004, food services in 40 percent of schools earned less revenue than  they spent, generating a loss, and food services in an additional 20 percent  of schools broke even. Food services in the remaining 40 percent of  schools generated more revenue than they spent in 2003-2004, yielding a  gain. From the data we collected, it is not clear what proportion of this  food service revenue came from federal reimbursement for meals served  and what proportion came from revenue generated through competitive  food sales. In our previous work, we found that food services in some  states had a small but increasing shortfall in total revenue compared with  expenses between school years 1996-1997 and 2000-2001 and that a la  carte sales had become an increasingly important source for augmenting  total food service revenue. Moreover, some SFA directors told us in  survey comments for this study that they sold competitive foods in order  to maintain balanced budgets. For example, one food service director  commented that the food service would not be able to maintain a balanced  budget without the substantial revenue generated through a la carte sales.  Another commented that the district food service generated nearly half of  its revenue through competitive food sales."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other School Groups", "paragraphs": ["Other school groups raised more revenue through exclusive beverage  contracts than through any other type of competitive food sales.

However, it is important to note that 15 percent of high school principals  did not know how much revenue exclusive beverage contracts generated  for their schools in 2003-2004.", "Exclusive beverage contracts also provided some schools with noncash  benefits\u2014goods and services such as athletic scoreboards and in-kind  support of school events. In particular, nearly 30 percent of schools of all  levels selling competitive foods through exclusive beverage contracts  received noncash benefits. Nearly one-third of those schools received  athletic equipment, facilities, or uniforms, and a small number of schools  also received support for assemblies and programs, scholarships, and  personal items for students and school staff, such as cups and coolers. The  value of those items was sometimes considerable: in one-quarter of those  schools receiving noncash benefits through exclusive beverage contracts  in 2003-2004, the benefits were worth more than $5,000 per school.", "School groups other than food services most commonly used their  competitive food revenues to support student activities such as field trips  and assemblies, as shown in figure 10.

Concerning the effects of changes on sales revenues, none  of the districts we visited had sufficient data to examine these effects, and  few had planned for these effects before implementing changes.

Further, rather than just remove less  nutritious competitive foods from their schools, these districts continued  to offer competitive foods to students by substituting healthy fare for the  items removed. In addition, these districts all took steps beyond current  federal and state competitive food regulations, and while there were  differences in the details of changes, most districts\u2019 changes had similar  characteristics. Specifically, most, if not all, of the districts we visited    made changes to competitive foods in all of the schools in their  districts, rather than changes only to certain schools, such as  elementary;    made changes to the availability of competitive foods throughout the  entire school day, rather than limiting availability only during certain  hours of the day;    made changes to the availability of competitive foods in each of the  venues through which they were sold, including fund-raising;and,    made simultaneous changes to foods served through school meal  programs.", "Regarding districts\u2019 efforts to increase the availability of healthy  competitive foods, as they defined them, all of the districts we visited  recently took steps to make water and juice more available to students in  their schools. For example, districts and schools often replaced soda in  their vending machines with bottled water and juices with higher  concentrations of real fruit juice. Further, several districts also replaced  fried potato chips with baked potato chips, and packaged desserts with  granola bars or similar items. Several districts also increased the variety of  flavored milk available in schools to encourage milk consumption.", "All of the districts we visited also took steps to restrict less nutritious  items. The specific types of competitive foods restricted varied by district,  with two of the districts limiting the availability of primarily soda and  candy, and four districts limiting the availability of competitive foods high  in sugar and fat. In these districts, different criteria were used by each  district to define foods high in sugar and fat. For example, in Fort Osage,  all competitive foods must be low-fat (no specified percentage) and  cannot have sugar listed as the first ingredient, while in Richland One, all  competitive foods must contain less than 40 percent sugar (or other  sweeteners) and less than 8 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving. In the other  two districts, New Haven and Independence, formulating specific nutrition  criteria has been an ongoing process.", "In addition to making changes to the types of competitive foods sold in  schools, all of the districts we visited also made similar changes to  increase healthy foods available through school meals. For example, SFAs  in both Independence and Oakland recently removed deep fryers from  school cafeterias, and they now bake all foods. In Richland One, the SFA  decided to implement stricter standards for school meals than those  required by the federal government. Specifically, Richland One requires  school meal menus to meet the federal requirements for nutrients, fat, and  sugar intake on a daily basis, rather than averaging the nutritional value of  meal components over the course of a week. In addition, several SFA  directors stated that they would like to introduce a greater variety of fresh  fruits and vegetables into school meal menus. However, they also  expressed their opinion that the federal school meal reimbursement is  insufficient to provide these items more frequently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individuals Who Initiated and Led Change Also Obtained the Support of Multiple Groups", "paragraphs": ["While the characteristics of the six districts we visited differed, as well as  the process of change in each, districts typically noted several key  components to their success. These key components included an  enthusiastic initiator of change, leadership by dynamic and committed  individuals, and support from groups directly affected by changes, such as  teachers, parents, and students. Overall, those involved in the process of  change agreed on the importance of improving student nutrition and  health and directing resources and energy toward achieving this goal. As  shown in table 5, the types of individuals and groups involved in the  process of change varied across the districts visited and often included  individuals from the district, school, and community.", "As shown in table 5, in the districts we visited, initiators of change  sometimes came from within the ranks of district staff and sometimes  from the community, while leaders of change often were district or school  staff. In some districts, one person or group acted as both the initiator and  leader of change, while in other cases, the initiator pushed the idea of  changing competitive foods forward and then the leader took over  implementation of the changes. For example, in several districts, the  superintendent or SFA director initiated and led changes to competitive  foods because of concerns about both student nutrition and competition  with the school food service. In another district, changes were initiated  and led largely by a middle school principal and a physical education  teacher. In contrast, in New Haven, a local pediatrician who was also the  district\u2019s medical adviser initiated change to competitive foods, and then a  committee of district staff, school staff, and community members took  over leadership of changes. In all of the districts we visited, a strong leader  helped formulate new policies, reached out to parties affected by changes,  and ensured that policies were implemented.", "While competitive food changes were often initiated and led by a few  individuals, all six districts realized that changes would be successful only  with the involvement of a variety of people in the process in order to  ensure their support for the changes and help sustain changes. To address  this need, some districts, such as Oakland and New Haven, convened  formal committees to provide recommendations on school nutrition and  health issues. In other districts, leaders took steps to reach out  individually to those parties affected by changes, such as school  principals, teachers, and students, to obtain support before their  enactment. This support was also instrumental to sustaining changes. For  example, the McComb superintendent noted that successful  implementation of the district\u2019s coordinated school health program  required both leadership as well as substantial community involvement,  including input from school officials and teachers, parents, and health  providers in the community. The involvement of these groups in  formulating changes helped ensure continued commitment and support of  the changes.", "In addition to obtaining the support of a variety of groups before  implementing changes, many districts noted that obtaining student  acceptance of the changes was particularly important to the success of  change. To that end, some districts held nutrition and health fairs to  distribute related information to students and the broader community, and  others involved students in taste testing and voting on the foods they  preferred. For example, middle school students and parents in Fort Osage  taste-tested healthy competitive foods during parents\u2019 night and the  school\u2019s open house. In other districts, student feedback on policy  changes was sought by officials before their implementation, sometimes  by consulting the district\u2019s student advisory council."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Districts Faced Several Barriers to Changing Competitive Foods, Including Schools\u2019 Concerns about Revenue Losses", "paragraphs": ["While the districts we visited all noted several key components to  successful change, they also cited several barriers to implementing  changes to competitive foods that they had commonly faced. In particular,  officials in almost all of the districts visited cited opposition because of  concerns about future revenue losses as a barrier to changing the  availability of competitive foods. In these cases, school principals most  frequently expressed these concerns because competitive food revenues  often provided discretionary money that was otherwise unavailable to  fund a variety of projects and needs at the school level.", "In addition, a lack of information on other districts\u2019 efforts to make  changes to competitive foods and a lack of nutritional guidelines for these  foods were also barriers to change in the districts we visited. While a  majority of the districts visited implemented their own changes to  competitive foods without knowledge of the steps taken by other districts  to make such changes, officials in Richland One and Oakland conducted  their own research on other state and district competitive food policies in  order to learn from the experiences of others. Related to this, officials in  Independence, Fort Osage, and New Haven noted that the lack of agreed- upon nutrition guidelines for competitive foods was an obstacle to change  because they had to independently develop their own nutrition standards.  From our observations during these visits, the absence of a clear set of  standards defining healthy and less nutritious foods can create a problem  for districts making changes to competitive foods as continual debates and  disagreements on such standards may slow the process of policy  formation, particularly when many groups are involved in the process.", "Several districts mentioned additional barriers to making changes, such as  determining the full extent of competitive food sales in schools and the  groups involved in sales. For example, the SFA director in Independence  noted that the district\u2019s delay in developing nutrition standards for  competitive foods was largely due to the difficulty of compiling a full  picture of all competitive food sales occurring in schools. Related to this,  given the number of groups that can be involved in these sales in each  school, and the lack of clear roles and responsibilities in this environment,  she noted that it has been difficult to determine the full extent of groups  involved in sales across the district. She emphasized that it is important  for the groups that have a stake in the revenues generated by these sales to  be involved in discussions concerning competitive food policy in order to  obtain support for the policy and successful implementation of changes.", "Some districts also noted that the need to continually monitor  implementation of competitive food changes at the school level can be an  obstacle to change. Officials in both Oakland and Richland One stated that  monitoring adherence to their competitive food policies at the school level  has been difficult but is necessary to effective implementation. Even when  school-level groups were involved in the process of developing changes,  monitoring policy implementation was difficult because of the  involvement of many groups in competitive food sales. In Richland One,  the SFA director noted that she often relies on observances by food  service staff working in the schools to ensure that the policy is being  followed by all groups selling competitive foods. Our own observations of  the school food environment during our visits to schools support the  conclusion that districts have difficulty monitoring the implementation of  policies, as we noticed a few deviations from district competitive food  policies in some schools. Even though school officials often seemed  devoted to the goal of improving the nutritional quality of foods available  in their schools, they typically faced many competing priorities during the  school day. Further, in many schools, it was unclear who was responsible  for ensuring that policies were effectively implemented.", "Food service staff in Fort Osage and New Haven stated that the difficulty  of finding healthy foods that both meet district nutrition goals and appeal  to students was also a barrier to making changes to competitive foods.  They noted that some healthy foods students found appealing were  unavailable from vendors, while in other instances, the healthy foods  available were too expensive to sell to students. This sentiment was  echoed by students in several districts, as they expressed their opinions  that some of the newly introduced healthy foods, such as bottles of  flavored milk or juice, were too costly to purchase as part of their lunch.  In contrast to districts that mentioned problems obtaining new healthy  products from vendors, several districts noted that they were able to work  within their exclusive beverage contracts to obtain healthier beverages to  serve to students. However, at least one mentioned that the major soft  drink company with whom the district had a contract offered few nonsoda  options.", "In addition, districts also faced the challenge of educating students about  healthy eating and encouraging students to change their behavior by  choosing healthy foods. In several of the districts, schools reported  providing students with nutrition information and education, sometimes  through classroom lessons, posters, and programs and activities to  promote healthy eating. During our visits, students we spoke with  frequently demonstrated their understanding of the importance of healthy  eating, and some noted that they would like to see the addition of certain  healthy foods to school offerings, such as a greater variety of fresh fruits  and vegetables. In addition, several middle school students in Fort Osage  and New Haven explained that after changes were made to competitive  foods and they began to learn more about good nutrition in their schools,  they went home and talked to their parents about these issues. However,  experts agree that it is more difficult to change behavior than to educate  individuals. Related to this, high school students in most of the districts  we visited mentioned that some students continue to purchase less  nutritious foods before school and after school from neighborhood stores  and restaurants. In addition, during our visits to schools, we observed  students eating a wide range of both healthy and unhealthy items during  lunch, with younger students being more likely to eat healthy foods than  high school students.", "As part of their role in helping districts develop wellness policies that  address, among other things, school nutrition, USDA has recently taken  several steps that may help districts overcome some of these barriers. In  March 2005, USDA, in partnership with HHS/CDC and the Department of  Education, sent a letter to state superintendents, district superintendents,  and SFA directors describing the wellness policy requirements. Through  this letter, the agencies offered to provide technical assistance to districts,  and they also provided information on online resources available at the  federal level to help districts develop their policies. Specifically, these  agencies, in collaboration with several food and nutrition organizations,  have begun to compile resources that will provide districts with  information on state and local efforts to make changes to the school health  and nutrition environment, including examples of nutrition standards used  by states and localities that have already developed competitive food  policies. In addition to online resources, these three agencies recently  released Making it Happen! School Nutrition Success Stories, a  publication that describes local efforts to address the school nutrition  environment, in order to assist districts as they move forward with their  own changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Effects of Changes to Competitive Foods on Revenues Were Often Unclear because of Limited Data; Nonetheless, Many Officials Expressed Concerns about Revenue Losses", "paragraphs": ["In the districts we visited, reliable data on how changes to competitive  food sales affected revenues were typically unavailable. Schools and  districts often did not maintain detailed revenue records to enable the type  of analyses needed to parcel out the direct effects of competitive food  changes on revenues. Nonetheless, most schools and districts were able to  provide partial data on revenue changes for specific venues, and these  limited data suggest that districts experienced mixed revenue effects.  Several schools we visited appear to have lost revenue from competitive  food sales after they made changes, while at least one may have increased  revenue. For example, after increasing the availability of healthy a la carte  foods and restricting less nutritious items, SFA directors in both  Independence and Richland One recorded decreases in a la carte sales. In  contrast, a middle school in McComb reported that after removing soda  from beverage vending machines and changing the policy regarding the  times sales were allowed, vending revenues increased. However, these  data did not account for other factors that may also have affected  revenues.", "While the limited data available suggest that school districts experienced  mixed revenue effects after implementing competitive food changes, they  also illustrate the difficulty of tracking these effects. Because the  competitive food environment is complex, sometimes involving many  sales and many groups, the effects of changes on revenues are often  complicated and may differ for each group involved in sales. Some groups  may benefit from changes, others may lose. For example, in Fort Osage,  when the middle school decided to remove all less nutritious competitive  foods available in the school and replace them with healthy items, it also  simultaneously decided to stop using outside vendors to supply its vending  machines. Subsequently, the district SFA took over operation of the  middle school\u2019s vending machines, and as a result, vending revenue began  to accrue to the SFA instead of school administrators. While the SFA  director was unable to compare the revenue before changes with that  generated after changes, she reported that the machines were self- supporting. In this instance, because of the changes made to competitive  foods and their sale, school administrators lost a source of revenue while  the SFA gained one.", "In addition to the challenge of understanding the revenue effects of  competitive food changes on different groups in schools, the relationship  between changes in a la carte sales and school meal participation adds  complexity. Although food service programs rely on reimbursement for  school meal participation as a primary source of funding, officials often  cite the importance of using additional revenue from a la carte sales to  balance their budgets. Therefore, officials take risks when they make  changes to the competitive foods available in schools, because changes  may affect revenues from these sales and they may also affect school  meals participation. In the districts we visited, competitive food changes  were often accompanied by increased school meals participation. In four  districts, federal reimbursements for meals subsequently increased,  benefiting the SFA, and in at least one instance, this increase more than  made up for food service losses in competitive food sales. While Richland  One reported losing approximately $300,000 in annual a la carte revenue  after implementing changes, school lunch participation and subsequent  federal reimbursements increased by approximately $400,000 in the same  year.", "Despite the lack of conclusive data on revenue effects, district and school  officials often expressed strong concerns about potential revenue losses.  Because food services often operate on tight budgets and use competitive  food revenues to support their operations, they take the risk of losing  important revenues when they make changes to these foods. In addition,  principals frequently stated that competitive food revenues are used at the  school level as discretionary funding, and they do not typically have other  sources of flexible funding available to use for the wide variety of  purposes toward which competitive food revenues are directed.  Therefore, when making changes to competitive foods, principals also risk  losing what is an oftentimes important source of funding. For example, in  the schools we visited, many principals reported using competitive food  revenues for student activities and classroom supplies, and some reported  using these revenues to support school dances and assist needy students.", "Although data on revenue effects were limited and complicated by the  complex competitive food environment in the districts we visited, some  districts tried to lessen adverse revenue effects by the process through  which changes to competitive foods were implemented. Specifically, a few  districts and schools reported taking incremental steps to change  competitive foods in order to mitigate the severity of the effects on  revenue. For example, in one Independence high school, incremental  changes were being made to beverage vending machines to phase in juice  and water and phase out soda over a span of several years. The high  school principal reported that the school was conducting this change  slowly in order to avoid surprising students with sudden changes and to  maintain revenue. In addition, a few schools noted that their efforts to  include students in decisions about changing food offerings may have  helped ensure that the new foods would be accepted by students and  mitigate the effects on revenues. However, many of the districts we visited  did not fully plan for the effects on sales revenues when they were  considering changes to competitive food policy, and several recognized  that efforts to do so would have likely eased the implementation of  policies. Moreover, some principals reported that their schools were able  to find ways to support projects previously funded with competitive food  sales after changes were implemented. For example, in several districts,  principals reported that after restrictions on fund-raiser food sales were  implemented, groups sold nonfood items like wrapping paper and candles,  and also raised funds by providing services, such as car washes.", "In the publication Making it Happen! School Nutrition Success Stories,  key contacts in selected schools reported similar mixed revenue results  from their efforts to improve the school nutrition environment. Of the  group of schools that reported on revenue changes, some experienced  increases in revenue while others reported decreases or no change. These  schools used approaches similar to those in the schools we visited, such as  replacing less nutritious food with more nutritious choices, obtaining  input from the students, and using marketing to encourage students to  make healthy choices. In addition, several of the schools reported  increases in school meal participation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Our nation\u2019s schools are uniquely positioned to positively influence the  eating habits of children, yet almost all schools sell readily available foods  that are largely unregulated by the federal government in terms of  nutritional content. While not all of these competitive foods are unhealthy,  many are. Although schools cannot be expected to solve the current  problems with child nutrition and growing obesity alone, many states and  districts have begun efforts to improve the nutritional environments in  their schools.", "As districts across the country develop their required wellness policies by  school year 2006-2007, they will likely face decisions and challenges  similar to those of the districts we studied and may benefit from their  lessons learned. Although each district took a different approach, all of  them recognized the value of including those parties affected by the  changes, such as parents, teachers, and other community members, when  developing new policies. In addition, they recognized that students are the  ultimate consumers of competitive foods and took steps to consider their  opinions.", "Because districts reported they typically lacked a source of recommended  nutrition standards for competitive foods in schools, officials were faced  with difficult decisions about the criteria they would use to determine  which foods were considered adequately nutritious to offer. The technical  assistance available from FNS, including multiple examples of nutrition  standards developed by other districts, as well as the Institute of  Medicine\u2019s forthcoming recommendations on nutritional standards for  foods in schools, should help district efforts to address this issue.", "In addition, given the multiple groups that rely on sales of competitive  foods for revenue, districts may choose to consider the possible revenue  effects of changes in food offerings as they develop and implement new  policies. Since competitive food revenues are often critical to food service  operations and provide principals with flexible funds relied on for a  multitude of discretionary purposes, making changes to competitive foods  entails risks for both groups. Districts we visited took varied steps that  may mitigate potential revenue changes, such as substituting healthy foods  for less healthy ones instead of removing all competitive foods, asking  students to taste and approve the more nutritious foods, offering alternate  means for fund-raising, or implementing change gradually. Lack of support  from the groups that use revenue from competitive food sales can scuttle  policy changes. Furthermore, the lack of a single person responsible for  the presence and sale of competitive foods in schools complicates efforts  to ensure that new policies will be implemented as intended and  maintained over time. Despite the complex food environment in schools,  new wellness policy requirements and USDA\u2019s efforts to provide technical  assistance to districts will provide an opportunity for districts to plan and  implement changes that recognize the needs of the various groups and  assign individuals with responsibility for consistent and sustained  implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the U.S. Department of Agriculture  for review and comment.

In addition,  the officials reiterated that the 1983 court decision in National Soft Drink  Ass\u2019n v. Block is significant because they believe it severely limits USDA\u2019s  ability to restrict the sale of competitive foods. FNS officials pointed out  that prior to this ruling, USDA regulations prohibited the sale of FMNV  anywhere in the school from the beginning of the school day until the last  meal period. Following the decision, USDA restricted the sale of FMNV  only in food service areas during meal periods. We agree that this ruling  limited USDA\u2019s ability to regulate competitive food sales as to time and  place. However, we believe the department has the authority to expand  the definition of FMNV to include additional foods with limited nutritional  value. Doing so could further limit the types of these foods available in the  cafeteria during meal times.", "Second, officials discussed what is known about the use of revenue from  competitive food sales and reimbursable meals compared to their costs.  We did not determine if revenues generated by competitive food sales  were sufficient to cover the actual cost of the competitive foods sold.  The  officials stressed that the 1994 School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study,  the last definitive study of cost and revenue in the NSLP and the School  Breakfast Program, found that regardless of size, most school food  authorities failed to generate enough revenue to cover the reported costs  of nonreimbursable food sales. The mean reported revenue-to-cost ratio  was 71 percent for the study period. The officials noted that this would  equate to a loss of 41 cents for every dollar received from the sale of  nonreimbursable foods. Further, this revenue-to-cost ratio did not include  all costs for school food service operations, such as uncharged labor costs,  indirect costs, and utilities. If these were included, the revenue to cost  ratio would generate even higher losses. FNS informed us that they are in  the process of contracting for a new school meal cost study.", "We agree with FNS that our report focused on revenues generated by  competitive food sales and that we did not determine if revenues  generated by competitive food sales were sufficient to cover the actual  cost of the foods sold. However, our report and others have shown that  the availability of competitive foods, and particularly a la carte items, has  increased over time. In addition, the Cost Study\u2019s definition of  nonreimbursable meals included food sales such as adult meals and  special functions, as well as competitive foods, and therefore, it is unclear  how each of these types of sales contributed to the mean reported  revenue-to-cost ratio. Absent more current information on the actual costs  and revenues of providing competitive foods and reimbursable school  meals, we believe it is difficult to know whether the results of the 1994  study are applicable today.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you release the report's contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from its issue  date.

We stratified by school level,  census region, and rural status, and we produced estimates by school  level. With this probability sample, each school in the population had a  known, nonzero probability of being selected. Each selected school was  subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the  schools in the population, including those that were not selected. Because  each school was randomly chosen, some SFA directors had more than one  school under their responsibility selected for our study, and they were  therefore asked to complete a separate survey for each school.", "Because we surveyed a sample of schools, our results are estimates of a  population of schools and thus are subject to sample errors that are  associated with samples of this size and type. Our confidence in the  precision of the results from this sample is expressed in 95 percent  confidence intervals, which are expected to include the actual results in 95  percent of the samples of this type. We calculated confidence intervals for  this sample based on methods that are appropriate for a stratified  probability sample.", "Through a telephone survey of the schools selected in our sample, we  determined the number of schools selected in our sample that participated  in the NSLP. We estimate that 80,245 (94 percent) schools in our  population participated in the NSLP. All estimates produced from the  sample and presented in this report are for the estimated target population  of 80,245 schools that participated in the NSLP. All percentage and  numerical estimates included in this report have margins of error of plus  or minus 15 percentage points or less, except for those shown in table 6.", "We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors that are not accounted for  through statistical tests, like sampling errors. Nonsampling errors could  figure into any data collection effort and involve a range of issues that  could affect data quality, including variations in how respondents interpret  questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses.", "In developing the Web surveys, we conducted several pretests of draft  instruments. We held pretest discussions of the principals\u2019 survey with  staff and members of the National Association of Elementary School  Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals.  We pretested the SFA survey with members of the American School Food  Service Association (now known as the School Nutrition Association). In  addition, both surveys were also pretested during a preliminary visit to the  SFA and an elementary school in Fairfax County, Virginia. All pretests  were conducted between July and September 2004.", "For the survey pretests, we were generally interested in the clarity of the  questions and the flow and layout of the surveys. For example, we wanted  to ensure definitions used in the surveys were clear and known to the  respondents, categories provided in closed-ended questions were  complete and exclusive, and the ordering of the survey sections and the  questions within each section was appropriate. On the basis of our  pretests, the Web instruments underwent some slight revisions.", "After the survey was closed, we also made comparisons between select  items from our competitive food Web-based survey data and other  national-level data sets. Our comparisons found our survey data were  reasonably consistent with the external sources. Of the basis of our  comparisons, we believe our survey data are sufficient for the purposes of  our work.", "Using Web-based surveys also helped remove error in our data collection  effort. By allowing respondents to enter their responses directly into an  electronic instrument, this method automatically created a record for each  respondent in a data file and eliminated the need for and the errors (and  costs) associated with a manual data entry process.

We administered the surveys to those groups, and we  received completed surveys from 70 percent of the SFA directors and 65  percent of the principals who received the surveys. The response rates for  our sample of 656 schools, including those officials we were unable to  contact, were 51 percent for both principals and SFA directors, excluding  the 26 non-NSLP schools.

Specifically, the amount of  revenue earned from each competitive food venue within a school was  reported by SFA directors and principals in multiple ranges. For example,  SFA directors reported revenue generated by food services through  competitive food sales, such as a la carte sales, and principals reported  revenue generated by all other competitive food sales in the school. To  estimate the combined competitive food revenue for a school, we defined  the minimum for each of the school\u2019s venues as the lower bound of the  revenue range reported by SFA directors and principals.

We performed this analysis for all schools and separately for each school  level (high, middle, and elementary). For each set of survey respondents,  the population value for all of the characteristics we examined fell within  the 95 percent confidence intervals for the estimates.

At the schools, we interviewed principals, food  service staff, and health and physical education teachers, as well as others  involved with the school food environment. From these interviews, we  gathered information on the district and school food environment,  strategies used to restrict competitive foods, individuals and groups  involved in implementing changes, facilitators and barriers to change,  revenues generated by competitive foods, ongoing efforts, students\u2019  reactions to changes, and opinions on the school wellness policies  mandated in the 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act. In  addition to our interviews with district and school officials, we also met  with students to collect their opinions regarding nutrition and healthy  eating, competitive foods in schools, and school meals.
