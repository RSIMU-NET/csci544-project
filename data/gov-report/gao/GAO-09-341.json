In particular, methadone-associated overdose deaths--those in which methadone may have caused or contributed to the death--have risen sharply. Before the late 1990s, methadone was used mainly to treat opioid addiction but has since been increasingly prescribed to manage pain. Taken too often, in too high a dose, or with other drugs or alcohol, methadone can cause serious side effects and death. Methadone-associated overdose deaths can occur under several different scenarios, including improper dosing levels by practitioners, misuse by patients who may combine methadone with other drugs, or abuse--using the drug for nontherapeutic purposes. This report examines the regulation of methadone, factors that have contributed to the increase in methadone-associated overdose deaths, and steps taken to prevent methadone-associated overdose deaths. GAO reviewed documents, laws and regulations, data, and research from relevant state and federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). GAO also interviewed federal officials, officials in five selected states, officials from professional associations and advocacy groups, and experts in pain management, addiction treatment, and forensic sciences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Methadone is regulated as a controlled substance, under federal and state laws and regulations, when used for pain management and addiction treatment. When methadone is used for pain management, it is regulated under federal and state laws and regulations that apply to controlled substances generally and that do not impose requirements unique to methadone. For addiction treatment, however, federal and state laws and regulations impose additional requirements that are specific to the use of methadone in opioid treatment programs (OTP), which treat and rehabilitate people addicted to heroin or other opioids. GAO, however, only reviewed relevant state laws and regulations for five selected states. Although information on methadone-associated overdose deaths is limited, available data suggest that methadone's growing use for pain management has made more of the drug available, thus contributing to the rise in methadone-associated overdose deaths. Methadone prescriptions for pain management grew from about 531,000 in 1998 to about 4.1 million in 2006--nearly eightfold. Methadone has unique pharmacological properties that make it different from other opioids, and as a result, a lack of knowledge about methadone among practitioners and patients has been identified as a factor contributing to these deaths. DEA data suggest that abuse of methadone diverted from its intended purpose has also contributed to the rise in overdose deaths as the number of methadone drug items seized by law enforcement and analyzed in forensic laboratories increased 262 percent, from 2,865 in 2001 to 10,361 in 2007. Nonetheless, data and research from five states GAO reviewed suggest that the specific circumstances of these deaths are variable because of drug combinations and unknown sources of methadone. GAO identified selected efforts to prevent methadone abuse and overdose deaths that focused on education, safety, and monitoring. For example, to educate practitioners about using methadone for pain management and addiction treatment, SAMHSA is establishing a physician clinical support system for methadone. To improve safety, in 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a revised label for methadone tablets that included new safety information regarding the use of methadone for pain and modified dosage instructions for those beginning pain management treatment with methadone. Additionally, to prevent diversion and abuse of controlled substances such as methadone, DEA reports that as of February 2009, 31 states have established prescription monitoring programs. Some officials and experts cautioned that any prevention efforts focused on methadone alone might unintentionally shift similar problems to a different drug. GAO received comments from the Department of Health and Human Services stating that FDA recently notified manufacturers of certain opioid drug products, such as methadone, that they must take certain steps to ensure that the benefits of these drugs continue to outweigh the risks. The Department of Justice provided GAO with technical comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drug abuse is a serious and growing public health problem.  Drug overdoses, including those from prescription drugs, are the second  leading cause of unintentional injury deaths in the United States, exceeded  only by motor vehicle fatalities, according to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC). Of particular concern is the sharp rise in  methadone-associated overdose deaths\u2014in which methadone may have  caused or contributed to the death. CDC data show that from 1999 to  2005, the number of these deaths increased more than fivefold, from 786 to  4,462, a rate higher than overdose deaths associated with other  prescription narcotics, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl.", "Methadone has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) for the treatment of opioid addiction and pain, and it is relatively  inexpensive compared to other opioids. Methadone\u2019s unique  pharmacologic properties make it different from other opioids, so it must  be carefully administered. Particular vigilance is needed when starting  treatment and increasing dosages, regardless of whether methadone is  being used for addiction treatment or pain management. FDA reports that  side effects can include slow or shallow breathing, dangerous changes in  heartbeat, and death.", "Until recently, methadone was primarily used in opioid treatment  programs (OTP) to treat and rehabilitate people addicted to such opioids  as heroin or certain prescription drugs. It works as a replacement for such  drugs by preventing withdrawal symptoms. Its slow onset allows patients  to be monitored as the drug takes effect, and its 24- to 36- hour duration of  action suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms with one daily dose. When  used for addiction treatment, methadone cannot be dispensed by a  practitioner outside of an OTP.", "Since the late 1990s, methadone has been increasingly prescribed by  practitioners to treat their patients\u2019 pain. However, while a single dose  suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms for a day or more, it generally  relieves pain for 4 to 8 hours despite remaining in the body much longer.  Further, it may take 3 to 5 days to achieve full pain relief, so dosage  increases must be done more slowly than with other opioids. As a result,  patients may feel the need to take more methadone before the previous  dose has left the body. However, if taken too often, in too high a dose, or  with certain other medicines or supplements, it may build up in the body  to a toxic level. Variability in methadone\u2019s absorption, metabolism, and  relative pain relief potency among patients requires a highly individualized  approach to prescribing. When used for pain management, methadone  may be prescribed by appropriately licensed and registered practitioners  and obtained through licensed and registered retail pharmacies.", "Like many drugs, methadone can also be abused\u2014that is, used for  nontherapeutic purposes or for purposes other than those for which it was  prescribed, and dangerous side effects or death can occur when  methadone is combined with other drugs or alcohol. Because of its  accepted medical use as well as its high potential for abuse and for severe  psychological or physical dependence, methadone is classified as a  Schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.", "Questions have been raised about the regulation of methadone for both  pain management and addiction treatment, as well as the factors  contributing to the increase in methadone-associated overdose deaths.  Such deaths can occur in a number of ways, including intentional  overdoses, or suicide, and accidental overdoses due to improper dosing  levels, abuse, or patient misuse, such as by combining methadone with  other drugs. While CDC collects limited information on overdose deaths  from state death certificates, there is no standard, nationwide method to  document detailed information about each death, such as the form or  source of the drug, nor is there a standard definition for a methadone- associated overdose death, so state medical examiners and coroners  investigating these deaths may define and report them differently. Defining  methadone\u2019s role in a death is difficult because of inconsistencies in  determining and reporting causes of death, the presence of other drugs in  the deceased person\u2019s system, and a lack of information about the  deceased person\u2019s level of opioid tolerance. CDC has also reported that it  has been difficult to determine the extent to which increases in  methadone-associated overdose deaths have resulted from specific  prescribing practices, misuse by patients, diversion of the drug such as by  illegal sale, or other means.", "To explore these issues, you asked that we further examine methadone- associated overdose deaths. Specifically, we examined (1) the regulation  of methadone for pain management and addiction treatment, (2) the  factors contributing to the increase in methadone-associated overdose  deaths, and (3) the steps taken to prevent methadone-associated overdose  deaths.", "To examine the regulation of methadone for pain management and  addiction treatment, we reviewed relevant provisions of the Controlled  Substances Act, implementing regulations, and federal case law. We  interviewed officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)  and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (SAMHSA), and we reviewed relevant agency policies. We also  interviewed officials and examined relevant codified statutes and  regulations in five selected states\u2014Florida, Kentucky, Maine, New Mexico,  and West Virginia\u2014to determine how these states regulate the use of  methadone for both pain management and addiction treatment. We chose  these states based on their meeting four of five criteria we selected,  including whether the state had one of the top 10 highest rates of increase  in methadone-associated overdose deaths from 1999 through 2004 and  whether there was research on methadone-associated overdose deaths in  that state. The findings from our review of these five states cannot be  generalized to any other state.", "To determine the factors contributing to the increase in methadone- associated overdose deaths, we interviewed officials from CDC, DEA,  FDA, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and SAMHSA.  We also interviewed officials from relevant professional associations and  experts in pain management, addiction treatment, and forensic science. In  addition, we interviewed researchers and officials in our five selected  states regarding their views on what factors were contributing to the  increases in methadone-associated overdose deaths in their states, and  reviewed state data and studies. We reviewed methadone poisoning death  data from CDC\u2019s National Vital Statistics System and relevant DEA data,  including DEA data on methadone drug items seized by law enforcement  and analyzed in forensic laboratories. We interviewed CDC and DEA  officials to obtain information about the reliability of their data, including  quality control such as edit checks, and any limitations of these databases.  We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for use in this  report, and identified any limitations.", "To identify steps taken to prevent methadone-associated overdose deaths,  we interviewed officials from CDC, DEA, FDA, ONDCP, and SAMHSA. We  also interviewed officials from relevant professional associations and  experts in pain management, addiction treatment, and forensic science.

When starting treatment, individuals go to an  OTP daily to take their methadone dose under observation, although  patients may receive a single take-home dose for a day that the clinic is  closed for business. After a few months, they may become eligible for  unsupervised take-home doses.

Buprenorphine and levomethadyl acetate (LAAM) are also  FDA-approved medications for treating opioid addiction. When used for  addiction treatment, methadone must be dispensed by an OTP that is  certified by SAMHSA and registered with DEA.

In the mid-1990s, various national pain-related organizations  began to issue guidelines for treating and managing pain, including using  opioids to treat both cancer and noncancer pain. For example, the practice  guidelines issued by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research  informed physicians and other health care professionals about the  management of acute pain in 1992 and cancer pain in 1994. In 2001,  health care providers and hospitals were required to ensure that their  patients received appropriate pain treatment when the Joint Commission,  a national health care facility standards-setting and accrediting body,  implemented pain standards for hospital accreditation. At first,  methadone was prescribed more for the treatment of cancer pain, but it  has been increasingly prescribed for the treatment of chronic noncancer  pain.

Schedule  II controlled substances\u2014which include opioids such as morphine,  oxycodone, and methadone\u2014have a currently accepted medical use and a  high potential for abuse, and may lead to severe psychological or physical  dependence. DEA\u2019s regulation of the manufacturing, distribution,  dispensing, and prescribing of controlled substances, including Schedule II  drugs, encompasses the following:    Manufacturing. DEA limits the quantity of Schedule II controlled  substances that may be produced by each manufacturer in the United  States each year. DEA determines these quotas based on a variety of  factors, including disposal and inventories. DEA also sets aggregate  production quotas that limit the production of bulk raw materials used to  manufacture Schedule II controlled substances.", "Distribution. DEA regulates transactions involving the sale and  distribution of Schedule II controlled substances by manufacturers and  wholesale distributors. Manufacturers and distributors are required to  report their inventories of controlled substances to DEA, and these data  are available for monitoring the distribution of controlled substances  throughout the United States and identifying retail registrants that  received unusual quantities of controlled substances.", "Dispensing and prescribing.

The agency reviews new drug  applications to determine whether they provide sufficient evidence that  the drug is safe and effective for the proposed use. In approving a drug,  FDA may require that the drug be dispensed only by a prescription by a  licensed practitioner. Because some risks may not become known until  after a drug\u2019s approval and use in a wider segment of the population, FDA  has certain postmarket oversight responsibilities once a drug is approved,  such as assessing sponsors\u2019 compliance with requirements for adverse  event reporting. The agency compiles data from sponsor reports on  adverse events, and voluntary reports submitted to its MedWatch program,  a voluntary reporting program through which health professionals and  consumers can report adverse reactions and other problems related to  FDA-approved drugs. In addition, as of 2008, if FDA identifies postmarket  safety concerns, the agency may take specific actions such as requiring  drug manufacturers to make safety-related changes to a drug\u2019s labeling  and requiring drug manufacturers to implement a Risk Evaluation and  Mitigation Strategy when necessary to ensure that the benefits of a  particular drug outweigh the risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overdose Death Investigation and Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Death investigations in the United States are typically conducted by a  county, district, or state coroner system or a medical examiner system.

The Controlled Substances Act and  implementing regulations also require that Schedule II controlled  substances, including methadone, only be dispensed by pharmacists upon  a written prescription, which must be issued for a legitimate medical  purpose by registered practitioners acting in the usual course of  professional practice. In addition, DEA uses its data on the distribution of  methadone and other controlled substances to identify retail-level  registrants, such as pharmacies, that receive and dispense unusual  quantities of these drugs. Under these authorities, DEA may take action  against practitioners that fail to prescribe or dispense controlled  substances, including methadone, for legitimate medical purposes, one  sanction of which is suspension or revocation of DEA registration.", "The use of methadone for pain management is also regulated under state  law and regulations that apply to controlled substances generally. In the  states we reviewed, some of these requirements were similar to provisions  of the federal Controlled Substances Act. For example, these states  require, in general, that Schedule II controlled substances may only be  dispensed by pharmacists upon a written prescription of a practitioner.  States also may impose requirements beyond what is required under the  federal Controlled Substances Act.

Similarly,  pharmacists must be licensed by their state boards of pharmacy in order to  engage in the practice of pharmacy, which includes the dispensing of  prescription drugs. Under this authority, the state medical boards and  state boards of pharmacy oversee the regulation of the practice of  medicine and pharmacy, respectively.

Under the act, OTPs must register with DEA in order to  dispense or administer methadone for addiction treatment, and there are  three conditions for this registration. Under the first condition of this  registration, DEA must determine that the OTPs will appropriately secure  stocks of methadone and maintain appropriate records. DEA officials  informed us that they also inspect OTPs in order to ensure that OTPs are  maintaining proper security, safety, and storage of methadone and other  narcotic drugs used for addiction treatment. DEA officials said that  inspections are conducted every 3 years, and there are a series of  graduated penalties if OTPs are not in compliance, including suspension or  revocation of OTP registration. If DEA suspends or revokes a registration,  that OTP would be unable to purchase, administer, or dispense methadone  to OTP patients for addiction treatment.", "As a second condition of DEA registration for OTPs, SAMHSA must  determine that OTPs are qualified to engage in methadone maintenance  treatment for addiction. Federal opioid treatment regulations define  SAMHSA\u2019s standards for determining whether OTPs are qualified.  Specifically, such standards include requiring OTPs to obtain a current,  valid certification from SAMHSA to dispense methadone for addiction  treatment. To obtain certification, an OTP must have a current, valid  accreditation by an accreditation body, such as the Joint Commission or  other entity designated by SAMHSA. An OTP also must comply with a  number of other requirements for certification established by SAMHSA.  These other requirements include maintaining a diversion control plan that  contains specific measures to reduce the possibility of diversion of  methadone from legitimate treatment to illicit use and ensuring that all  licensed professional care providers comply with the credentialing  requirements of their respective professions.", "The third condition of DEA registration for OTPs requires SAMHSA to  determine that OTPs will comply with standards regarding unsupervised  take-home doses of methadone. SAMHSA has established specific criteria  for unsupervised take-home doses of methadone under federal regulations  for OTPs. (See table 1.) These criteria were established to limit the  potential for diversion of methadone to illicit uses. OTPs are also required  to maintain procedures for take-home doses of methadone that will allow  identification of the theft or diversion of these doses, such as by labeling  containers with the OTP\u2019s name, address, and telephone number.

Some experts we spoke with advocated a \u201cstart low  and go slow\u201d approach with methadone. Additionally, some pain  management specialists we interviewed warned that practitioners  following conversion tables, which are commonly used to switch patients  to methadone from other drugs, may start some patients on too high a  dose. The specialists explained that using these conversion tables for  patients who have already developed a tolerance for other opioids may be  lethal, because tolerance for other opioids is not equivalent to tolerance  for methadone.", "Several sources have also cited inadequate training among some  practitioners. NDIC reported in 2007 that some general practitioners and  novice pain management specialists may lack the training to adequately  monitor patients to whom they prescribe methadone. A 2005 survey by the  National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found less than half of  surveyed physicians (48 percent) received instruction in pain management  while in medical school. DEA also noted that several of the top prescribers  of methadone have been practitioners with specialties not generally  associated with extensive training in pain management. Reports based on  SAMHSA\u2019s 2003 National Assessment of Methadone-Associated Mortality  and 2007 Reassessment recommended that practitioners needed better  training in how to manage pain and addiction. Many experts,  representatives of national associations, and state officials we spoke with  agreed that more training in both pain and addiction treatment and about  methadone\u2019s unique properties is needed for medical professionals.  However, opinions varied about whether such training should be optional  (e.g., offered for continuing education credit) or mandatory (e.g., required  for license renewal).", "Insufficient patient education has also been cited as contributing to  methadone-associated overdose deaths. Patients may not understand how  methadone works, including that it can stay in the body long after the pain  returns. As a result, these patients might take methadone more frequently  than prescribed to manage their recurring pain, risking overdose as the  drug builds to toxic levels in their bodies. Unaware of potentially lethal  drug combinations, patients might also take methadone with other drugs,  including antianxiety drugs and other opioids, or alcohol."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Abuse of Diverted Methadone Is an Additional Contributing Factor to Methadone- Associated Overdose Deaths", "paragraphs": ["Data suggest that abuse of diverted methadone is also contributing to the  rise in methadone-associated overdose deaths. Increased thefts as well as  seizures of methadone by law enforcement indicate that more diverted  methadone is available for potential abuse. DEA tracks drug abuse,  including the diversion of legally manufactured drugs such as methadone  into the illegal market, through its National Forensic Laboratory  Information System, which collects the results of state and local forensic  laboratories\u2019 analyses of drugs seized as evidence by law enforcement  agencies. The DEA data on national estimates of the most frequently  analyzed drugs seized by law enforcement from 2001 through 2007 showed  that the number of methadone drug items analyzed by state and local labs  increased 262 percent, though the estimated number was smaller than that  of some of the other drugs (see table 3). In 2007, DEA reported that per  prescription, methadone was more likely to be diverted and abused than  either hydrocodone or oxycodone based on its analysis of data from the  National Forensic Laboratory Information System and IMS Health.", "Likewise, DEA data on drug theft and loss showed that methadone thefts  nationwide more than doubled, from 176 in 2000 to 393 in 2007. For the  five states we reviewed, the data showed that most thefts were reported  from pharmacies, while no thefts were reported from OTPs in four of  these states during the same time period.", "Federal and state officials told us that abuse of prescription drugs,  including methadone, has become more of a problem in recent years than  abuse of illicit drugs, such as heroin or cocaine. Officials from ONDCP  said that overall opioid drugs are being increasingly diverted and abused,  while abuse of illicit drugs is decreasing. SAMHSA\u2019s National Survey on  Drug Use and Health provides some additional information about where  those who are abusing prescription pain relievers, such as methadone,  obtain their drugs. According to the 2007 survey, among the estimated 5.2  million persons aged 12 or older who reported using prescription pain  relievers nonmedically in the past 12 months, 56.5 percent said they got  the drugs from a friend or relative, another 18.1 percent reported that they  got the drug from just one doctor, 4.1 percent reported that they got the  pain relievers from a drug dealer or other stranger, and 0.5 percent  reported buying the drug on the Internet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Data and Research Support That Lack of Knowledge and Abuse of Diverted Methadone Contribute to Deaths, but Death Circumstances Are Variable", "paragraphs": ["Data and research regarding methadone-associated overdose deaths in the  five states we reviewed support the idea that lack of knowledge and abuse  of diverted methadone contributed to deaths, but also suggest that the  circumstances under which people are dying are variable. Specifically,  state data and research show that death circumstances, such as the source  of the drug and the most commonly detected other drugs, may vary by  state. Furthermore, participants at SAMHSA\u2019s 2007 Methadone-Associated  Mortality Reassessment concurred that the circumstances of methadone- associated overdose deaths vary by state. While research suggests that the  source of methadone for those who die from overdose deaths is often  unknown, available information indicates that there are three distinct  populations who are dying: individuals with a prescription for methadone;  individuals undergoing methadone maintenance treatment in OTPs; and  individuals who obtained methadone from some other source, such as  diversion. However, generally more of those who died had a prescription  for methadone or obtained it through diversion rather than receiving  methadone for addiction treatment in an OTP. For example, a Kentucky  study of deaths from 2000 to 2004 found that of the 95 deaths for which  coroners documented methadone use, 48 percent of those who died had a  physician\u2019s prescription for methadone, 20 percent obtained methadone  through illicit means, 22 percent obtained methadone through unknown  means, and 10 percent had received treatment in OTPs. Coroners\u2019  investigations also documented that one-third of the victims had been  undergoing pain management. A New Mexico study of unintentional  methadone-associated overdose deaths from 1998 to 2002 found that  although a much larger percentage of deaths were related to methadone  maintenance treatment than in the other states we reviewed, more deaths  overall were linked with prescriptions for methadone. Specifically, of the  79 methadone-associated overdose deaths for which a source of  methadone was available, 39 percent had methadone because they were  undergoing methadone maintenance treatment, while 47 percent had a  prescription for methadone.

The Kentucky study found that only 6 percent of the 176  methadone-associated overdose deaths were caused by methadone alone;  other frequently detected drugs included antidepressants,  benzodiazepines, and other opioids. The New Mexico study showed  somewhat different results, and found that of the 143 methadone- associated overdose deaths, 22 percent were due to methadone alone,   24 percent were due to methadone and prescription drugs (no illicit  drugs), 50 percent were due to methadone and illicit drugs, and 4 percent  were due to methadone and alcohol."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education, Safety, and Monitoring Efforts to Prevent Methadone- Associated Overdose Deaths Have Been Implemented by Government Agencies and Other Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Education, safety, and monitoring efforts have been implemented to  prevent methadone abuse and methadone-associated overdose deaths\u2014 either specifically or as part of broader efforts to prevent prescription drug  abuse and deaths\u2014by various federal agencies, states, and other  organizations.

In addition, SAMHSA is working with two work groups  that include experts from academia, medical associations, medical  researchers, and other federal agencies, such as FDA, to develop  additional methadone-specific guidelines. One work group is reviewing  available information to develop best practices on methadone and cardiac  issues. The guidance will help practitioners identify patients at risk for  cardiac arrhythmias that may be exacerbated by methadone, and provide  information on how to monitor those patients for ongoing risks. Another  work group is reviewing methadone interactions with other common  drugs, including HIV drugs.

DEA officials told us that the agency formed a methadone  mortality working group in 2006 to review information related to the  increases in methadone-associated overdose deaths, including DEA  methadone distribution data and data from other federal agencies, such as  FDA and CDC. The data showed that methadone 40 mg diskettes had been  increasingly prescribed for pain, despite only being FDA approved for  addiction treatment in OTPs\u2014a practice described as off-label  prescribing. Some experts said that if prescribed for pain to a person  without a tolerance to opioid drugs, an initial dose of 40 mg could  potentially be deadly. DEA data show that distribution of the methadone  40 mg diskettes to retail pharmacies increased almost sixfold from about  350,000 grams in 2002 to about 2 million grams in 2007. At the same time,  distribution to OTPs fell slightly from about 1.4 million grams to 1.2 million  grams. Following their review, DEA officials told us that they became  concerned about the diskette\u2019s increased use for pain management. DEA  then worked with methadone manufacturers, which agreed to voluntarily  restrict distribution of the diskettes to only OTPs and hospitals. Because  the restriction began January 1, 2008, it is too soon to determine any effect  on methadone-associated overdose deaths. DEA reported that it would  continue monitoring methadone distribution and prescription data to  evaluate the impact of the initiative.", "In November 2006, FDA approved a revised label for methadone 5 mg and  10 mg tablets that included new safety information regarding using  methadone for pain, such as warnings about life-threatening adverse  events and modified dosage instructions. The revised label states that  methadone can cause slow or shallow breathing and dangerous changes in  heartbeat that may not be felt by the patient. The new dosage instructions  for methadone prescribed for pain state that the usual initial dose should  be 2.5 mg to 10 mg taken every 8 to 12 hours, or a maximum daily dose of  30 mg, slowly adjusted for effect. The previous instructions allowed initial  total daily doses up to 80 mg a day, which several experts said could be  hazardous or even deadly. As FDA approved the revised methadone label,  it also issued a public health advisory for health care professionals and  patients, stating that prescribing methadone is complex and that it should  only be prescribed for patients with moderate to severe pain when their  pain is not improved with other non-narcotic pain relievers. The advisory  noted that FDA had received reports of life-threatening side effects and  death in patients taking methadone, both those newly starting methadone  for pain control and those who have switched to methadone after being  treated for pain with other strong narcotic pain relievers.", "Additionally, in February 2009, FDA sent letters to manufacturers of  certain opioid drugs, including methadone, indicating that these drugs will  be required to have a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to ensure  that the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks. In the first of  a series of meetings, FDA invited those companies that market the  affected opioid drugs to a meeting with the agency in March to discuss  strategy development.

Furthermore, while DEA reports that several states\u2019 programs have the  capability of generating reports on out-of-state prescribers or patients,  they do not routinely disseminate this information to other states.  Another limitation of prescription drug monitoring programs mentioned  by state officials was the lack of patient data on methadone dispensed in  OTPs and from federal facilities such as Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019  hospitals or Indian Health Service facilities.
