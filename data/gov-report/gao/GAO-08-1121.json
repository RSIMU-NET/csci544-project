Deamonte had health coverage through Medicaid, a joint federal and state program that provides health care coverage, including dental care, for millions of low-income children. Deamonte had extensive dental disease and his family was unable to find a dentist to treat him. GAO was asked to examine the extent to which children in Medicaid experience dental disease, the extent to which they receive dental care, and how these conditions have changed over time. To examine these indicators of oral health, GAO analyzed data for children ages 2 through 18, by insurance status, from two nationally representative surveys conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). GAO also interviewed officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and dental associations and researchers.

Nationally representative data from the 1999 through 2004 NHANES surveys--which collected information about oral health through direct examinations--indicate that about one in three children in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay, and one in nine had untreated decay in three or more teeth. Projected to 2005 enrollment levels, GAO estimates that 6.5 million children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay. Children in Medicaid remain at higher risk of dental disease compared to children with private health insurance; children in Medicaid were almost twice as likely to have untreated tooth decay. Receipt of dental care also remains a concern for children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid. Nationally representative data from the 2004 through 2005 MEPS survey--which asks participants about the receipt of dental care for household members--indicate that only one in three children in Medicaid ages 2 through 18 had received dental care in the year prior to the survey. Similarly, about one in eight children reportedly never sees a dentist. More than half of children with private health insurance, by contrast, had received dental care in the prior year. Children in Medicaid also fared poorly when compared to national benchmarks, as the percentage of children in Medicaid who received any dental care--37 percent--was far below the Healthy People 2010 target of having 66 percent of low-income children under age 19 receive a preventive dental service. Survey data on Medicaid children's receipt of dental care showed some improvement; for example, use of sealants went up significantly between the 1988 through 1994 and 1999 through 2004 time periods. Rates of dental disease, however, did not decrease, although the data suggest the trends vary somewhat among different age groups. Younger children in Medicaid--those aged 2 through 5--had statistically significant higher rates of dental disease in the more recent time period as compared to earlier surveys. By contrast, data for Medicaid adolescents aged 16 through 18 show declining rates of tooth decay, although the change was not statistically significant."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, concerns have been raised about the adequacy of dental  care for low-income children.

Even though Deamonte was  entitled to dental care from his Medicaid managed care organization,  Deamonte\u2019s family had experienced significant difficulties in obtaining  needed dental care, including finding a dentist in their Maryland  neighborhood who would accept Medicaid patients.", "May 2007 and February 2008 congressional hearings investigated the  effectiveness of federal oversight of state Medicaid dental programs by the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that oversees state Medicaid  programs at the federal level. Concerns raised at the hearings about low- income children\u2019s oral health, including the extent that children in  Medicaid experience dental disease and receive dental care, are not new.  Our reports dating back to 2000 highlighted the problem of chronic dental  disease and the factors that contribute to low use of dental care by low- income populations, including children in Medicaid.", "You asked us to examine two aspects of children\u2019s oral health: the extent  to which children in Medicaid experience dental disease and the extent to  which they receive dental care. You also asked us to assess how these  conditions have changed over time. This report presents information from  national health surveys on key indicators of the oral health status of  children in Medicaid, specifically, the rate of dental disease and their  receipt of dental care, and changes in these indicators over time. To  determine the extent to which children in Medicaid experience dental  disease, we analyzed data from a survey conducted by HHS\u2014the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES\u2014 administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC)  National Center for Health Statistics\u2014obtains nationally representative  information on the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population  through direct physical examinations, including dental examinations, and  interviews. The dental examinations include a dentist\u2019s assessment of  tooth decay and the presence of dental sealants, and the interviews  include questions on various health and demographic characteristics,  including information on insurance status. We grouped NHANES survey  data from 1999 through 2004 (the most recent data based on direct oral  examinations by dentists available) in order to include a sufficient  number of examinations to provide a reliable basis for assessing the extent  of dental disease in the Medicaid population of children aged 2 through  18. To assess how the rate of dental disease experienced by children in  Medicaid has changed over time, we compared NHANES data from 1999  through 2004 with NHANES data from 1988 through 1994. We analyzed  results from three different groups based on their health insurance status:  children with Medicaid, children with private health insurance, and  uninsured children. The group of children with private insurance included  both children with dental coverage and children without dental coverage,  while the group of uninsured was children who had neither health  insurance nor dental insurance.", "To assess children\u2019s receipt of dental care, we analyzed data from another  HHS survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). MEPS\u2014 administered by HHS\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  (AHRQ)\u2014obtains nationally representative information on Americans\u2019  health insurance coverage and use of health care, including information on  receipt of dental care, such as how often participants see a dentist and  whether they have experienced problems accessing needed dental care.  Our MEPS analysis was based on surveys conducted in 2004 and 2005 (the  most recent data available); to assess how receipt of dental care has  changed over time, we compared the data from 2004 and 2005 with the  earliest available MEPS data, from 1996 and 1997. We analyzed the MEPS  data using the same three insurance groups we used for the NHANES data.  To estimate the number of children in each Medicaid category with a given  condition, we applied certain proportions from NHANES or MEPS data to  an estimate of the 2005 average monthly Medicaid enrollment of children  aged 2 through 18 (20.1 million children). Similar to NHANES, the  Medicaid category included children enrolled in the State Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) for the later time period (2004 through  2005 for MEPS). To assess the reliability of NHANES and MEPS data, we  spoke with knowledgeable agency officials, reviewed related  documentation, and compared our results to published data. We  determined these data to be reliable for the purposes of this report.  Appendixes I and II contain more information on our NHANES and MEPS  analyses. Finally, we obtained information on oral health and the Medicaid  population from CDC and from dental associations and experts including  the Children\u2019s Health Dental Project and the Medicaid/SCHIP Dental  Association.

Left untreated, the pain and  infections caused by tooth decay may lead to problems in eating, speaking,  and learning. Tooth decay is almost completely preventable, and the pain,  dysfunction, or on extremely rare occasion, death, resulting from dental  disease can be avoided (see fig. 1). Preventive dental care can make a  significant difference in health outcomes and has been shown to be cost- effective. For example, a 2004 study found that average dental-related  costs for low-income preschool children who had their first preventive  dental visit by age 1 were less than one-half ($262 compared to $546) of  average costs for children who received their first preventive visit at age 4  through 5.", "The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that  each child see a dentist when his or her first tooth erupts and no later than  the child\u2019s first birthday, with subsequent visits occurring at 6-month  intervals or more frequently if recommended by a dentist. The early initial  visit can establish a \u201cdental home\u201d for the child, defined by AAPD as the  ongoing relationship with a dental provider who can ensure  comprehensive and continuously accessible care. Comprehensive dental  visits can include both clinical assessments, such as for tooth decay and  sealants, and appropriate discussion and counseling for oral hygiene,  injury prevention, and speech and language development, among other  topics. Because resistance to tooth decay is determined in part by  genetics, eating patterns, and oral hygiene, early prevention is important.  Delaying the onset of tooth decay may also reduce long-term risk for more  serious decay by delaying the exposure to caries risk factors to a time  when the child can better control his or her health behaviors.", "Recognizing the importance of good oral health, HHS in 1990 and again in  2000 established oral health goals as part of its Healthy People 2000 and  2010 initiatives. These include objectives related to oral health in children,  for example, reducing the proportion of children with untreated tooth  decay. One objective of Healthy People 2010 relates to the Medicaid  population: to increase the proportion of low-income children and  adolescents under the age of 19 who receive any preventive dental service  in the past year, from 25 percent in 1996 to 66 percent in 2010.", "Medicaid, a joint federal and state program which provides health care  coverage for low-income individuals and families; pregnant women; and  aged, blind, and disabled people, provided health coverage for an  estimated 20.1 million children aged 2 through 18 in federal fiscal year  2005. The states operate their Medicaid programs within broad federal  requirements and may contract with managed care organizations to  provide Medicaid benefits or use other forms of managed care, when  approved by CMS. CMS estimates that as of June 30, 2006, about   65 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received benefits through some form  of managed care. State Medicaid programs must cover some services for  certain populations under federal law.

This information includes demographic  characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services,  provider charges, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance  coverage, income, and employment. We analyzed responses to questions  on the use of dental care as well as responses to questions on the difficulty  accessing needed dental care. As with the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we analyzed results from children  aged 2 through 18 and divided children into three categories on the basis  of their health insurance status. Similar to NHANES, the Medicaid  category included children enrolled in the State Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program (SCHIP) for the later time period (2004 through 2005  for MEPS). The privately insured category included children with private  health insurance, some of whom had dental coverage and others who did  not, while the uninsured category comprised children who had neither  health insurance nor dental insurance.", "To determine the reliability of the MEPS data, we spoke with  knowledgeable agency officials and reviewed related documentation and  compared our results to published data. We determined that the MEPS  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our engagement.", "We analyzed data according to four different questions asked by the MEPS  survey (see tables 6 through 9). The questions asked (1) whether the child  had seen or talked to any dental provider in a given time period; (2) how  often the child got a dental checkup; (3) whether the child had trouble  accessing needed dental care; and (4) if the respondent answered yes to  the third question, then what the reasons were for having trouble  accessing needed dental care. Using sampling weights, we estimated the  percentage of children in each category as well as a lower and upper limit  of this percentage, calculated at the 95 percent confidence interval. We  also used standard errors to calculate if changes from the 1996 through  1997 time period to the 2004 through 2005 time period were statistically  significant at the 95 percent level.", "To estimate the number of children ages 2 through 18 in Medicaid not  receiving dental care in the previous year, we calculated the percentage  that had not received dental care in the previous year (62.6 percent) and  applied this percentage to an estimate of the 2005 average monthly  enrollment of children ages 2 through18 in Medicaid (20.1 million  children). We estimated the 2005 average monthly enrollment of children  ages 2 through 18 in Medicaid using CMS statistics, by age group, for  children ages 1 through 18 (we reduced this number using Census data to  account for children age 1).", "Our analysis of the MEPS data was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards from December 2007  through September 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Katherine M.
