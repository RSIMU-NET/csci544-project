This report highlights (1) a systemic problem that GAO identified in the internal controls of the military services' requisition-processing systems and (2) a potential best practice that GAO identified in one service that provides an additional safeguard over foreign military sales of classified and controlled parts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At the time GAO conducted its reviews, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force were not testing their automated requisition-processing systems to ensure that the systems were accurately reviewing and approving blanket order requisitions for compliance with restrictions on the sale of classified and controlled spare parts and operating in accordance with foreign military sales policies. Blanket order requisitions are based on agreements between the U.S. government and a foreign country for a specific category of items for which foreign military sales customers will have a recurring need. GAO's tests of the services' requisition-processing systems showed that classified and controlled spare parts that the services did not want to be released to foreign countries under blanket orders were being released. GAO's internal control standards require periodic testing of new and revised software to ensure that it is working correctly, while the Office of Management and Budget's internal control standards require periodic reviews to determine how mission requirements might have changed and whether the information systems continue to fulfill ongoing and anticipated mission requirements. DOD either concurred or partially concurred with GAO's recommendations for testing the requisition-processing systems. The department, however, does not have a plan specifying the remedial actions to be taken to implement these recommendations. Internal control standards requiring testing also will be applicable to the Case Execution Management Information System, an automated requisition-processing system that DOD and the military services are developing to replace the existing individual military service systems. The Army's automated requisition-processing system incorporates a potential best practice that helps to prevent the release of classified or controlled parts that are not authorized under blanket orders to foreign countries. The automated systems used by the Navy and the Air Force allow country managers to override system decisions not to release to foreign countries classified or controlled parts that are requisitioned under blanket orders. GAO found instances where Navy and Air Force country managers overrode the systems' decisions without documenting their reasons for doing so. In contrast, the Army's system automatically cancels requisitions that are made under blanket orders for classified or controlled parts. Because the requisitions are automatically canceled, country managers do not have an opportunity to override the system's decisions. Compared with the Navy's and the Air Force's systems, the Army's system provides more stringent protection against releasing classified or controlled parts that are not authorized under blanket orders to foreign countries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to a request from Senator Tom Harkin, we issued a series of  reports in which we analyzed Army, Navy, and Air Force internal controls  over foreign military sales of classified and controlled cryptographic parts  requisitioned under blanket order cases. Under Department of Defense  (DOD) and service policy, the export of classified and controlled parts  must be managed to prevent their release to foreign countries that may use  them against U.S. interests. We assessed and tested whether key internal  controls, including the automated systems used by the services to process  requisitions received under blanket orders, adequately restricted blanket  order sales of classified and controlled spare parts to foreign countries,  and we determined whether periodic tests were conducted to ensure that  the services\u2019 systems were working as intended. During these reviews, we  identified weaknesses in the military services\u2019 internal controls, which  resulted in the release of parts that were not authorized for release under a  blanket order to foreign countries, and made a number of  recommendations to improve the services\u2019 internal controls. The purpose  of this report is to highlight (1) a systemic problem that we identified in  the internal controls of the military services\u2019 requisition-processing  systems and (2) a potential best practice that we identified in one service  that provides an additional safeguard over foreign military sales of  classified and controlled parts.", "For this report, we analyzed the findings and recommendations of our  prior reviews. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s written comments on our prior  reports. In general, we concentrated our prior work on classified and  controlled spare parts that foreign countries requisitioned under blanket  orders. As part of our previous work, we verified whether the systems  approved and released requisitioned parts in accordance with DOD\u2019s and  the services\u2019 foreign military sales policies. Our prior reports provide a  detailed explanation of the scope and methodology we used to conduct  each review. For this report, we did not conduct new audit work. We  conducted this review in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards from July through September 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The sale or transfer of U.S. defense items to friendly nations and allies  is an integral component of both U.S. national security and foreign  policy. The U.S. government authorizes the sale or transfer of military  equipment, including spare parts, to foreign countries either through  government-to-government agreements or through direct sales from  U.S. manufacturers. The Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign  Assistance Act of 1961 authorize the DOD foreign military sales program.  From 1993 through 2002, DOD delivered over $150 billion worth of  services and defense articles to foreign countries through foreign military  sales programs administered by the military services. The articles sold  include classified and controlled cryptographic spare parts.", "The Department of State sets overall policy concerning which countries  are eligible to participate in the DOD foreign military sales program. DOD  identifies military technology that requires control when its transfer to  potential adversaries could significantly enhance a foreign country\u2019s  military or war-making capability. Various agencies such as the  Department of State and DOD are responsible for controlling, in part, the  transfer or release of military technology to foreign countries.", "The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, under the direction of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, has overall responsibility for  administering the foreign military sales program, and the military services  generally execute the sales agreements with the individual countries.  A foreign country representative initiates a request by sending a letter to  DOD asking for such information as the price and availability of goods and  services, training, technical assistance, and follow-on support. Once the  foreign customer decides to proceed with the purchase, DOD prepares a  Letter of Offer and Acceptance stating the terms of the sale for the items  and services to be provided. After this letter has been accepted, the foreign  customer is generally required to pay, in advance, the amounts necessary  to cover the costs associated with the services or items to be purchased  from DOD and then is allowed to request spare parts through DOD\u2019s  supply system.", "Generally, the military services use separate automated systems to process  requisitions from foreign countries for spare parts. While the Air Force has  retained responsibility for its system, responsibility for the Army\u2019s and the  Navy\u2019s systems was transferred to the Defense Security Assistance  Development Center in October 1997. The Center, which is part of the  Defense Security Cooperation Agency, has overall responsibility for  providing system information technology maintenance support, such as  testing the system. For blanket orders, the systems use various codes and  item identifiers to restrict the spare parts available to the countries. In  cases where the systems validate a requisition, the requisition is sent to a  supply center to be filled and shipped. In cases where the systems reject a  requisition, the requisition is sent to a country manager for review. The  country manager will either validate the requisition and forward it to the  supply center to be filled and shipped or reject the requisition, in which  case the requisition is canceled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing of the Requisition- Processing Systems Is Needed to Improve Internal Controls for Foreign Military Sales", "paragraphs": ["Our reviews showed that the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force were not  testing their automated systems to ensure that the systems were  accurately reviewing and approving blanket order requisitions for  compliance with restrictions and operating in accordance with foreign  military sales policies. Our tests of the services\u2019 automated systems used  to manage foreign countries\u2019 requisitions for spare parts made through  blanket orders showed that classified and controlled spare parts that the  services did not want released were being released to countries. For  example, we identified 5 out of 38 blanket order requisitions for which the  Navy\u2019s system approved and released 32 circuit card assemblies\u2019  controlled cryptographic spare parts to foreign countries. According to  Defense Security Assistance Development Center officials, who are  responsible for this portion of the Navy\u2019s system, the system was not  programmed to review the controlled cryptographic items codes, and as a  result, the system automatically approved and released the parts requested  by the foreign countries. Navy and DOD officials were unaware that the  system was not reviewing controlled cryptographic parts prior to their  release to foreign countries.", "For another example, the Air Force\u2019s system used controls that were  based on supply class restrictions and that were ineffective and resulted in  erroneously approving requisitions for shipment. Included in an item\u2019s  national stock number is a four-digit federal supply class, which may be  shared by thousands of items. The national stock number also contains a  nine-digit item identification number that is unique for each item in the  supply system. We found that countries requisitioning parts under the Air  Force\u2019s system could obtain a classified or controlled spare part by using  an incorrect, but unrestricted, supply class with an item\u2019s correct national  item identification number. The Air Force was unaware of this situation  until our test of the system identified the problem. In response to our  work, the Air Force corrected the problem.", "GAO\u2019s internal control standards require periodic testing of new and  revised software to ensure that it is working correctly, while the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s internal control standards require periodic  reviews to determine how mission requirements might have changed and  whether the information systems continue to fulfill ongoing and  anticipated mission requirements. The importance of testing and  reviewing systems to ensure that they are operating properly is highlighted  in the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. The act  requires periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information  security controls and techniques. Moreover, the act requires agencies, as  part of their information security program, to include a process for  planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to  address deficiencies. Under guidance from the Office of Management and  Budget, agencies are to develop a Plan of Actions & Milestones to report  on the status of remediation efforts. This plan is to list information  security weaknesses, show estimated resource needs or other challenges  to resolving them, key milestones and completion dates, and the status of  corrective actions.", "In commenting on our prior reports, DOD either concurred or partially  concurred with our recommendations for testing the services\u2019 requisition- processing systems. The department, however, does not have a plan  specifying the remedial actions to be taken to implement these  recommendations. If actions are not taken to implement testing and  reviews, the potential benefits of these controls in preventing the  inadvertent release of classified or controlled spare parts may not be  realized.", "Regarding our recommendation to periodically test the Army\u2019s system,  DOD concurred and stated that testing of the Army system and its logic  would occur, given the funding and guidance required to do so.  In response to our recommendation to periodically test the Navy\u2019s system,  DOD concurred.", "Concerning our recommendation to periodically test the Air Force\u2019s  system, DOD partially concurred and stated that a program was being  developed to test new modifications to the Air Force\u2019s system and that  testing of old modifications would be an ongoing effort. Testing only the  modifications to the Air Force\u2019s system, as DOD commented, will not  necessarily ensure that the system\u2019s logic is working correctly.  Subsequently, the Air Force concurred with our recommendation and  reported that it had modified its system and would be conducting annual  tests of the system\u2019s logic.", "The Defense Security Cooperation Agency and the military services are  developing a new automated system, the Case Execution Management  Information System, to process foreign military sales requisitions. The new  system will replace the services\u2019 existing legacy systems with a standard  DOD system. DOD expects to deploy the new system in fiscal year 2007.

We identified instances where Navy and Air Force country  managers overrode the systems\u2019 decisions without documenting their  reasons for doing so. For example, of the 123 Air Force requisitions we  reviewed, the Air Force\u2019s system identified 36 requisitions for country  manager review. For 19 of the requisitions, the managers overrode the  system\u2019s decisions and shipped classified and controlled spare parts  without documenting their reasons for overriding the system. The  managers we queried could not provide an explanation for overriding  the system.", "In 1999, the Army modified its system to reject requisitions that are made  under blanket orders for classified or controlled parts.

Had the services conducted periodic  tests of their systems, the instances of releasing spare parts that DOD did  not want released that we identified in our reports could have been  significantly reduced, if not eliminated. Developing effective corrective  action plans is key to ensuring that remedial action is taken to address  significant information-system internal control deficiencies. We believe the  department could demonstrate its commitment to addressing this systemic  weakness by providing specific information on its planned remedial  actions.", "Documenting country managers\u2019 decisions to override system decisions is  a control that could help prevent the release of classified or controlled  parts that are not authorized for release under blanket orders to a foreign  country. However, modifying systems, as the Army did, to reject  requisitions that are made under blanket orders for classified or controlled  parts and to preclude country managers from manually overriding system  decisions would provide more stringent protection against releasing  classified or controlled parts that are not authorized for release under  blanket orders to a foreign country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the likelihood of releasing classified and controlled spare parts  that DOD does not want to be released to foreign countries, we  recommend that you take the following three actions:    Direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, in conjunction with the  Secretaries of the Army and the Navy, and direct the Secretary of the Air  Force to develop an implementation plan, such as a Plan of Actions &  Milestones, specifying the remedial actions to be taken to ensure that  applicable testing and review of the existing requisition-processing  systems are conducted on a periodic basis.", "Direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, in conjunction with the  Secretaries of the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy, to determine  whether current plans for developing the Case Execution Management  Information System call for periodic testing and, if not, provide for such  testing.", "Direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, in conjunction with the  Secretary of the Navy, and direct the Secretary of the Air Force to  determine if it would be beneficial to modify the Navy\u2019s and the Air  Force\u2019s requisition-processing systems so that the systems reject  requisitions for classified or controlled parts that foreign countries make  under blanket orders and preclude country managers from manually  overriding system decisions, and to modify their systems as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency provided  written comments on a draft of this report for DOD and partially  concurred with one recommendation and concurred with two  recommendations.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to develop a Plan of  Actions & Milestones specifying the remedial actions to be taken to  ensure that applicable testing and review of the existing requisition- processing systems is conducted on a periodic basis.
