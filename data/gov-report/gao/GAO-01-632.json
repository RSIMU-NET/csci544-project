Their efforts have focused on developing new equipment and technologies as well as new tactics, training, techniques, and other solutions.", "In particular, DOD and the military services have been working toward developing a group, or family, of systems that can effectively work together to improve the military\u2019s ability to prevent friendly fire. These range from systems that can query and identify a specific target as \u201cfriendly\u201d or \u201cunknown,\u201d to situational awareness systems that rely on periodic updates of position data to help users locate friendly forces. They would be used in surface-to-surface, air-to-surface, air-to-air, and surface- to-air operations. And they would be equipped on aircraft, surface vehicles, air traffic control stations, as well as weapon systems carried by ground troops.", "Effectively managing such a large and complex endeavor requires, among other things, a well-defined and enforced blueprint for operational and technological change, commonly referred to as an enterprise architecture.

Sixty-one percent of these incidents involved ground-to-ground incidents, while air-to-ground and ground-to-air incidents accounted for 36 and 3 percent, respectively. A more recent notable incident is the 1994 friendly forces\u2019 shootdown of two Blackhawk helicopters over Iraq during Operation Provide Comfort. Such incidents may be caused by command and control failures, navigation failures, or target misidentification.", "A key aspect of DOD\u2019s effort to prevent friendly fire is the development of new combat identification systems. Some of these systems will \u201ccooperate\u201d to identify friendly targets through queries and answers. Others will identify targets as friendly or unknown with the help of data sources, such as radio emissions or acoustic signals. And others, known as situational awareness systems, will rely on periodic updates of position data to help users locate friendly forces. The cost of such systems is significant. For example, the Army\u2019s efforts to develop, field, and maintain cooperative combat identification systems alone are expected to cost more than $1 billion.", "Successfully developing and implementing these systems is a major challenge for DOD. The systems themselves will be developed and managed by many different entities within DOD and the military services. They will be involved in a wide range of military operations and installed on a broad array of equipment. At the same time, however, these systems will need to be compatible and interoperable. They will also need to fit in with DOD\u2019s long-term goals for achieving information superiority over the enemy. DOD defines this as \u201cthe capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting or denying an adversary\u2019s ability to do the same.\u201d Additionally, it is important that these systems be able to work with systems belonging to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other allies in order to help preclude friendly fire incidents during coalition operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Architecture for Combat Identification", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not yet have a complete enterprise architecture to guide its efforts to develop a family of combat identification systems and past attempts to establish an architecture were not comprehensive or adopted by the services.

Further, such an architecture describes the enterprise\u2019s operations in both (1) logical terms, such as interrelated functions, information needs and flows, work locations, and system applications, and (2) technical terms, such as hardware, software, data, communications, and security attributes and performance standards.", "If defined properly, enterprise architectures can assist in optimizing interdependencies and interrelationships among an organization\u2019s operations and the underlying technology supporting these operations. Our experience with federal agencies has shown that attempting to define and build major systems without first completing an enterprise systems architecture often results in systems that are duplicative, not well integrated, unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and do not effectively optimize mission performance.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has recognized the importance of agency enterprise architectures. OMB has issued guidance that, among other things, requires agency information system investments to be consistent with agency architectures. More recently, the Chief Information Officers Council produced guidance for federal agencies in initiating, developing, using, and maintaining enterprise architectures.", "DOD has also issued architecture policy, including a framework defining an architecture\u2019s structure and content. Specifically, in February 1998,DOD directed its components and activities to use the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Architecture Framework, Version 2.0. DOD\u2019s framework is comprised of three components: (1) an operational architecture\u2014that is, the operational elements, activities, tasks, and information flows required to accomplish or support a mission, (2) a systems architecture\u2014that is, the systems and interconnections supporting the functional mission, and (3) a technical architecture\u2014that is, the minimum set of standards and rules governing the arrangement, interaction, and interdependence of systems applications and infrastructure.", "According to DOD, the C4ISR Architecture Framework is a critical tool for achieving its strategic direction and all DOD components and activities should use the framework for all functional areas and domains within the Department. The C4ISR Architecture Framework is recognized in the Federal Chief Information Officers Council\u2019s A Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture as a model architecture framework for developing enterprise architectures. Appendix I provides more detailed information on the C4ISR Architecture Framework.", "DOD has also recognized the importance of architectures in its recently revised acquisition guidance, DOD Directive 5000.1 and Instruction 5000.2.

The first effort began in 1994 with the creation of a Combat Identification Task Force. Among other things, such as identifying promising combat identification technologies for a planned demonstration, the Task Force sought to develop an overall architecture for combat identification through an architecture working group. However, this effort only focused on specific systems and how they would work together. It did not define the operational elements and activities required to support a future warfighting vision or technical standards. Both views are integral to an overall architecture. According to DOD, for example, the operational view is useful for facilitating a number of actions across DOD, such as defining operational requirements to be supported by physical resources and systems. The technical view enables interoperability and compatibility of systems, by providing the standards, criteria, and reference models upon which engineering specifications are based, common building blocks are established, and applications are developed.", "The work of the architecture working group also excluded elements integral to the battlefield, such as dismounted soldiers, ships, air defense sites, and air-to-ground missions other than close-air support. Additionally, the architecture developed only dealt with the need to identify forces as being either friendly or hostile. It did not address the need to further distinguish targeted systems by class (e.g., \u201ctank\u201d vs. \u201ctruck\u201d), platform (e.g., MIG 29 vs. T-72 Main Battle Tank) or intent (e.g., a defecting vs. an attacking platform). More critically, the architecture was never adopted by the services.", "Subsequent work began in January 2000 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s Combat Identification Assessment Division began planning draft guidance on an effort to analyze alternative current and evolving combat identification technologies to support development of an operational architecture. The analysis is expected to take over 2 years to complete at an estimated cost of $10 million. However, this effort is to focus on surface-to-surface and air-to-surface military operations and not to include air-to-air or surface-to-air operations. While the draft guidance for the analysis indicated that the Army should lead the effort with support from the other services, thus far, only the Air Force has budgeted funds\u2014 $2 million\u2014toward accomplishing this task. Similarly, in January 2001, the Assessment Division described efforts to develop the operational architecture itself. However, this effort is currently unfunded. According to DOD officials, the reasons for the current lack of funding include the difficulty of reflecting such efforts in DOD\u2019s budgets in a timely manner and addressing competing service funding priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of an Architecture Poses Significant Risks", "paragraphs": ["Architectures enable organizations to know their portfolio of desired systems and to develop a clear understanding of how these systems will collectively support and carry out their objectives. Moreover, they help ensure that systems are interoperable, function together effectively, and are cost-effective over their life cycles. Our previous reviews at the Federal Aviation Administration, Customs Service, Department of Education, Internal Revenue Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have shown that while the absence of a complete architecture does not guarantee the failure of system modernization efforts, it does greatly increase the risk that agencies will spend more money and time than necessary to ensure that systems are compatible and in line with business needs.", "Our previous work reviewing DOD\u2019s combat identification efforts has shown that DOD is confronting such risks. In 1993, we reported on the Army\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop its Battlefield Combat Identification System (see fig. 1)\u2014a system designed to provide a ground-to-ground and potentially an air (helicopter)-to-ground cooperative identification capability. We found that the Army planned to spend up to $100 million on a near-term combat identification system even though the system might eventually be discarded if it could not be integrated into a long-term solution. We also reported that the Army planned to eventually buy 1,520 of the near-term systems to equip some forces even though that number would not be sufficient for a larger-scale operation.", "Additionally, absent the understanding provided by an enterprise architecture, the services risk being unable to effectively define and develop weapon system requirements (e.g., system characteristics, functions, and performance parameters). As mentioned earlier, developing an enterprise architecture provides further understanding of (1) the operational elements, activities, tasks, and information flows needed to accomplish a mission, (2) the systems needed and their interconnections to support that mission, and (3) the minimum set of standards and rules needed to govern their arrangement, interaction, and interdependence. As a result, systematically reviewing specific systems\u2019 requirements within the context of such an architecture can help ensure the development of cost-effective systems to provide needed capabilities.", "DOD has already identified some broader needs for combat identification. Specifically, in 1992 and again in 1998, DOD defined its overall mission needs for combat identification systems and it defined the capabilities it expected from these systems, including  positive, timely, and reliable identification of friends, foes, and neutrals;classification of foes by platform, class/type, and nationality; and friend-from-friend discrimination.", "More recently, the U.S. Joint Forces Command developed a Capstone Requirements Document that defines overarching requirements for the combat identification family of systems.", "Lastly, without having a complete architecture for combat identification, DOD may not be able to ensure that its own operational, systems, and technical requirements are aligned with those of NATO allies. NATO is currently developing both an operational architecture and a systems architecture in all mission domains (air-to-air, surface-to-air, air-to-surface, and surface-to-surface). It plans to complete these architectures by the end of 2001 and the end of 2002, respectively. If DOD\u2019s efforts to develop an enterprise architecture for combat identification occur in a timely manner, they could be more closely aligned with NATO\u2019s efforts and possibly improve coalition interoperability.

In 1995, we issued a report on Army and Navy-led efforts to develop cooperative identification systems. We found that the Army and Navy were pursuing development of systems without having developed a cohesive management plan and organizational structure and made recommendations to strengthen those efforts.", "Given the size and complexity of the project, it is important for DOD to have a plan that lays out the current combat identification capabilities, desired capabilities, and specific initiatives, programs, and projects intended to get DOD and the services to that vision. Such plans, or roadmaps, are often developed as part of an enterprise architecture. To facilitate the implementation of these plans, it is also necessary for DOD to define the organizational structure, responsibilities, and procedures for such things as defining system requirements, developing and procuring systems, and funding specific efforts. Together, these structures and processes can help ensure that combat identification projects are not duplicative or disparate and that they receive adequate priority and funding.", "Lastly, it is important that DOD define performance measures to assess the progress of combat identification improvements. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires federal agencies and activities to clearly define their missions, set goals, link activities and resources to goals, prepare annual performance plans, measure performance, and report on their accomplishments.", "Performance measures can be particularly helpful in ensuring that services and components are effectively coordinating their development efforts. For example, DOD could measure the progress associated with planning and successfully conducting joint, cross-service, and allied demonstrations of interoperable systems.

The agreement stated that combat identification encompasses widely varying requirements, policies, platforms, mission areas, and technologies. Among other things, the agreement created a General Officer Steering Committee to serve as a primary focal point for all DOD combat identification activities; a Joint Combat Identification Officer under that committee to provide lower-level coordination on all DOD efforts and develop a master plan for combat identification efforts; three supporting committees; and two acquisition-related groups.", "Following the agreement, DOD published a joint master plan for its \u201ccooperative identification\u201d system development efforts (that is, systems that identify friendly or unknown through queries and answers).

Moreover, according to a DOD official, the Joint Master Plan for cooperative systems development is no longer in use because the services\u2019 efforts did not evolve into joint programs as originally envisioned.", "In 1996, the services developed another master plan that represented their strategic vision for developing, maintaining, and enhancing their combat identification capability. This plan went beyond the 1993 plan by including noncooperative and situational awareness system development efforts. The plan was to serve as the focal point for coordination of joint and service-unique initiatives during the budget process. However, it was updated only once in 1998 and that revision was never adopted by the department.", "Since then, the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s Combat Identification Assessment Division has developed and updated an annual action plan. Many of the plan\u2019s tasks are designed to address known deficiencies that can be corrected in the near term. The plan does not define management structures and procedures for guiding system development. And, while it does call for a semiannual report on progress, it does not define specific measures to be used in assessing that progress. Moreover, the Assessment Division does not have authority to direct the services to implement its plan nor does it have funding authority of its own to carry out the plan\u2019s tasks.

A Marine Corps official told us that the recent approval of a NATO Standardization Agreement for battlefield identification systems mandating the use of the same technology employed in the Army\u2019s system and the development of the recently approved combat identification Capstone Requirements Document negate the need for a separate agreement to address interoperability between Army and similar Marine Corps systems. Complying with the NATO agreement and the Capstone Requirements Document may enable the Marines to build systems that can interact with those built to NATO\u2019s standards and that have the capabilities that DOD has envisioned.
