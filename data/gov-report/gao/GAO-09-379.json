While enrollments have rebounded, the U.S. image has declined in the Muslim world and elsewhere. To improve global attitudes toward America, the U.S. government funds higher education for international students to facilitate exchanges, promote understanding among peoples in different countries, and build capacity in developing nations. To provide insight on how higher education is used to advance public diplomacy and development assistance goals, we examined (1) the objectives the United States and selected peer governments seek to advance through higher education for international students and the approaches they employ to attract international students, and (2) the characteristics of major U.S. and peer government programs that fund higher education for international students to support public diplomacy and development goals. GAO collected information from the United States, Australia, China, the European Commission, Germany, and the United Kingdom."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The United States and peer governments we reviewed use higher education for international students to advance diplomatic, development assistance, economic, and other objectives, often concurrently. For example, German officials said that international students studying in science and technology help advance German research and innovation goals while also advancing public diplomacy goals by returning to their home countries as unofficial ambassadors for Germany. Germany as well as other governments we reviewed use a number of approaches to reach and attract overseas students, including marketing their higher education to the international community much as a business would promote a product. For example, many countries promote their higher education systems through national branding, using logos and slogans, such as Australia's \"Study in Australia\" and the United Kingdom's \"Education UK\" marketing campaigns. Several countries have also taken steps to improve the quality of the study abroad experience. China, for example, has invested significant resources to modernize its schools and added additional academic programs that are aligned with workforce needs. The scholarship programs we reviewed that support public diplomacy and development assistance goals typically select recipients using merit-based criteria, offer graduate-level study, and cover the cost of tuition and other expenses, such as travel and living expenses. However, programs vary widely in the countries and regions they target, funding levels, and number of scholarships awarded. For example, scholarships for public diplomacy programs tended to be dispersed to a wider area to maximize their geographic reach. In contrast, development assistance programs tend to be more targeted to particular developing countries and regions. In administering and implementing these programs, government officials cited several strategies they believe facilitate program implementation and contribute to successful program outcomes. For example, some told us that offering preparatory courses or program orientation to all scholarship recipients enhances the students' chance of success at the host university, and is particularly useful for students who require additional language, cultural, or academic skills. For development assistance programs, some countries align the course of study paid for by their programs with the human resource and capacity-building needs of the sending country. For example, in Australia, officials work with sending governments to identify the most acute development needs and consider these with the applicant's proposed field of study when awarding scholarships."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After decades of growth in international student enrollment in higher  education, the total number of international students studying in the  United States leveled off and even dropped slightly between 2002 and  2006, the first decline in over 30 years.

By funding higher education, the  United States seeks to improve global attitudes by facilitating student  exchanges that help promote mutual understanding among people in  different countries (referred to as public diplomacy) and by providing  assistance to developing nations to build their economic, social, and  technological capacities (development assistance). To address your  interest in how higher education is being used to advance public  diplomacy and development assistance goals in the United States and peer  nations and to provide Congress with relevant information as it considers  ways that higher education can be used to advance these goals, this report  examines (1) the objectives the United States and selected peer  governments seek to advance through higher education for international  students and the approaches they employ to attract international students,  and (2) the characteristics of major United States and peer government  programs that fund higher education for international students to support  public diplomacy and development goals.", "To conduct our study, we selected two U.S. agencies\u2014the Department of  State (State) and the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID)\u2014and five peer governments (Australia, China, the European  Commission, Germany, and the United Kingdom) for review. Though many  U.S. agencies are involved in promoting U.S. higher education to  international students, we limited our scope to State and USAID because  they are primarily responsible for funding programs aimed at public  diplomacy and development assistance. We selected peer governments  based on the following criteria: (1) strong market share of international  enrollment, (2) growth in market share of international enrollment, (3)  diversity of populations and countries targeted for higher education, and  (4) geographic diversity. We also conferred with embassy and government  officials and industry experts to obtain their recommendations on which  countries to review based on their knowledge of their programs. We  selected major scholarship programs of the United States and peer  countries for review based on program funding and participation levels, as  well as agency and peer government officials\u2019 recommendations. We  broadly defined public diplomacy programs as those that help to promote  mutual understanding among people from different countries, and  development programs as those that provide assistance to developing  nations to build their economic, social, and technological capacities.  During our exploratory work, we found that peer countries\u2019 programs  often are designed to achieve multiple goals and that these multiple goals  are not always clearly delineated. Thus, we selected programs that had  either a public diplomacy or development focus, but may also advance  other goals for the country, such as recruiting students who, after  completing their studies, will participate in the country\u2019s labor market.  Though many of the governments we reviewed may fund a number of  smaller scholarship programs, we limited our study to scholarship  programs that receive at least $8 million annually, or the equivalent in  local currency, and award at least 50 scholarship awards annually based  on the information we received.

Although the primary  source of funds for the vast majority of students that enter the United  States is not provided by the federal government, promoting study in the  United States can support a range of U.S. objectives in addition to the  public diplomacy and development goals supported by State and USAID  efforts.

According to Australian officials, international students  also help Australia meet its foreign relations and diplomatic goals. To  illustrate the diplomatic linkages that education can create, Australian  officials said that at one time nearly half of the Malaysian cabinet had been  educated in Australia. Australian officials reported that student exchange  is Australia\u2019s primary way of providing a contemporary understanding of  the country, building linkages between Australia and foreign nations,  forming the basis of business and cultural relationships, demonstrating the  quality of Australia\u2019s educational opportunities, and helping to dispel the  myth that Australia is a \u201cfar away land.\u201d The Australian government also  provides development assistance to Asian countries and Pacific Islands to  increase their access to high-quality education and training, which  supports growth in the region.

According to these officials,  providing international educational opportunities to foreign students is  part of their strategy for promoting cultural, scientific, and technological  exchanges between the East and the West. China develops exchanges with  other countries in the fields of education, science, and technology to  strengthen friendship and understanding between the Chinese people and  people around the world and to promote modernization in China.

These  marketing strategies include developing a national brand through the use  of logos and slogans to promote higher education systems among  international communities, much as a corporation would promote a  commercial brand, as shown in figure 3.", "For example, many of the higher education institutions in the United  Kingdom use the national brand \u201cEducation UK\u2013Innovative.Individual.  Inspirational.\u201d to distinguish United Kingdom higher educational  institutions from others. This United Kingdom national brand and its  associated logo are used for products, activities, events, and marketing  campaigns aimed at promoting United Kingdom education.

The  national brand is used in various promotion channels, including the Study  in Australia Web site, education exhibitions, student forums in target  markets, and traditional advertising media such as print, radio, and  television. See figure 4 for samples of promotion brochures from selected  countries.", "In addition, all of the governments we reviewed have developed Web sites  to inform potential students about their academic options, application  procedures, student support services, and lifestyles within that country;  and in the case of the European Commission, the Web site provides similar  information on 32 European countries. These Web sites are typically  provided in several languages and offer a range of information on issues  such as academic programs, visa requirements, higher education financing  options, and predeparture advice. For example, prospective students  accessing Australia\u2019s Study in Australia Web site can find a range of  information including language and academic requirements, study costs  and available scholarships, and listings of accredited Australian  institutions and available courses. The Web site also describes life and  culture in Australia as well as the benefits of study in Australia, such as the  types of student support services and the cultural diversity of the country.

Similarly, Germany  relies on a global network of 48 information centers to promote Germany\u2019s  higher education system. The United States has a network of more than  450 advising centers around the world, called EducationUSA Advising  Centers. Centers are staffed by professional advisers, many of whom  studied in the United States themselves and have received State  Department-approved training about U.S. higher education and the  advising process. While the reported levels of services and capabilities  offered by the overseas information centers vary from country to country,  government officials stressed that their network of offices is valuable  because its staff possess expertise in international education, understand  the education systems of the regions in which they operate, and have  essential contacts, including contacts at education ministries and local  higher education institutions.", "All governments we reviewed reported that ensuring that international  students receive a quality education and experience abroad is another key  component of their approach to outreach to international students. In the  face of growing domestic and international demand for higher education,  China has invested significant resources to enhance the institutional and  human resource capacities of its higher education institutions in the last  10 years. The steps taken to increase institutional capacity include  encouraging private funding for China\u2019s higher education and  modernization of schools\u2019 facilities and equipment. In addition, officials  said that China has consolidated specialized schools, such as engineering  and art schools, and added additional academic programs to create  institutions with more of a comprehensive breadth of curricula, making  them more adaptable to employment needs and improving the schools\u2019  resources through economies of scale. Further, education officials said  that China provides leadership training to its senior management staff  through international exchange programs with various Western countries  to enhance the human capacity of China\u2019s higher education institutions.", "European countries are also taking these steps to help ensure that their  higher education and research systems continuously adapt to changing  needs, society\u2019s demands, and advances in scientific knowledge, as well as  to gain a \u201cworldwide degree of attractiveness.\u201d For example, under the  Bologna Declaration of June 1999, European countries established a series  of reforms to make European higher education more compatible and  comparable across member states, including the adoption of comparable  undergraduate and graduate degrees and a system of credits. Currently, 46  European countries participate in the Bologna process. To increase the  quality and effectiveness of education and training programs in the  European Union, the European Commission has also established working  groups in 12 areas, including the education and training of teachers and  trainers.", "To ensure overseas students have a positive educational experience, the  UK Council for International Student Affairs, an education charity, acts as  the UK\u2019s national advisory body serving the interests of overseas students  and those who work with them, according to officials from the United  Kingdom.

For example, the Australian  Development Scholarships program selects high-achieving students,  mostly for graduate-level study, through a competitive selection process  that is coordinated between Australian officials and partner  governments. Selection criteria are usually established bilaterally  between the Australian government and the applicant\u2019s home government,  and students who are nominated must also be accepted by the receiving  higher education institution in Australia. The program awards 90 percent  of its scholarships for graduate-level study, making a small percentage  available to those wishing to pursue undergraduate or vocational study.  Australian Development Scholarship awards include tuition, travel, health  insurance, and allowances to cover study materials, living expenses, and  other participation-related costs. In addition, these awards may also cover  English-language training, tutorial assistance, and a mandatory 4- to 6- week course designed to prepare students for life and study in Australia.  According to program officials, approximately $45,000 in Australian  dollars (about $38,000 U.S. in dollars) is awarded to selected students in  tuition and other expenses per year.", "Although the European Union\u2019s Erasmus Mundus program has differing  objectives, it also awards scholarships on the basis of academic merit to  graduate students. In the past, the program offered scholarships only for  master\u2019s-level study for 1- to 2-year periods, but will also begin offering  scholarships for doctoral study for up to 3 years starting in 2010. Under  this program, individual courses of study are developed by consortia of  universities within the European Union and these consortia are given  considerable latitude in selecting applicants. The program\u2019s administering  agency recommends that each consortium assess the quality of eligible  applicants based on criteria such as academic record, exam results, and  letters of recommendation. Unlike other scholarship programs we  reviewed, the Erasmus Mundus program awards a fixed amount to  recipients annually, which was 21,000 euros in 2008 (about $31,000 in U.S.  dollars). While tuition and fees vary widely among European universities,  in most instances, the award amount is greater than the cost of  attendance, allowing recipients to use the balance of the award t other participation-related expenses, according to program officials.", "The U.S. Fulbright Foreign Student Program, which supports public  diplomacy goals, follows a similar approach in awarding merit-based  scholarships to graduate students. The program selects scholarship  recipients through a competitive process that considers input from a scholarship board, U.S. embassies, and other organizations. Applicatio are generally restricted to students who meet certain citizenship  requirements and who will have received the equivalent of a bach degree prior to the start of the grant period. In selecting scholarship  recipients, the program considers the applicant\u2019s academic record and research project proposal, among other factors. Once award recipients ar selected, the Fulbright Foreign Student Program allows them to  h.D.  matriculate in either degree-granting or nondegree master\u2019s and P programs, some of which may be renewed for up to 5 years; however,  most awards are for 1 or 2 years of study. Similar to other scholarship  programs we reviewed, the scholarships awarded by the program cove range of participation-related costs, including tuition, educational  st  materials, travel, housing, living allowances (which vary by U.S. ho location), orientation, and health coverage. According to program offi these scholarships are awarded in amounts up to $60,000 per recipient  annually, but on average total about $32,000 per year.", "Similarly, other scholarship programs we reviewed, such as the Chinese  Government Scholarships Program, the United Kingdom\u2019s Chevening  Programme, the U.S. Edmund S.

The agency administering the Erasmus Mundus strives to achieve a  wide geographic balance, in part by ensuring that no more than a quarter of  scholarships awarded by a particular consortium go to students from one  country. Scholarships offered by the U.S. Fulbright Foreign Student Program,  another public diplomacy program, also have a wide geographic reach,  awarding scholarships to recipients from 143 countries in 2008. However,  some public diplomacy programs have a more targeted reach. For example,  the Australia Endeavour Awards has a regional focus, with over 80 percent of  scholarships widely dispersed to students from Asian and Pacific countries.  Additionally, the U.S. Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Program targets its  scholarships exclusively to applicants from the countries that formerly  constituted the Soviet Union.", "In contrast, the development assistance programs we studied tend to have  a more targeted focus in order to better concentrate resources in  particular developing countries. For example, Australia\u2019s two largest  development assistance programs\u2014the Australian Development  Scholarships and the Australian Leadership Awards\u2014focus primarily on  the Asia and Pacific regions, though the Australian Development  Scholarships also awards approximately 9 percent of its scholarships to  applicants from Africa. Likewise, the U.S. Collaborative Research Support  Program also has some regional concentration, awarding nearly two-thirds  of its scholarships to students from Africa and Latin America. In 2007,  according to data provided by education officials, we estimate that China  awarded roughly 20 percent of its scholarships to students from Africa.  Some of the other development assistance programs we studied have an  even more targeted focus. The U.S. Cooperative Association of States for  Scholarships Program and its successor program, for example, have  awarded scholarships exclusively to students from seven countries in  Central America and the Caribbean during the past 5 years. A component  of the European Union\u2019s Erasmus Mundus program also targets its  scholarships to particular regions based on the political and development  assistance priorities of the European Union and of partner countries. See  appendix II for the percentage of scholarship recipients from each region  by scholarship program. Figure 6 provides an illustration of the differences  in geographic reach typically found between the public diplomacy and  development aid scholarship programs we reviewed.", "In addition to these differences, annual funding and participation levels  vary widely among the programs we studied and change from year to year,  though the largest programs we studied tend to have public diplomacy  goals, as shown in table 2. For example, the European Union\u2019s Erasmus  Mundus program and the U.S. Fulbright Foreign Student Program, both  public diplomacy programs, receive over $90 million in funding. One  exception was the Australian Development Scholarships Program, the  most well-funded development assistance program we reviewed, which  received over $101 million in Australian dollars in 2008 ($84 million in U.S.  dollars). However, most of the public diplomacy and development  assistance programs we reviewed received less than $50 million in U.S.  dollars in annual funding last year. Participation levels in 2008 also varied  widely among the programs we studied, with programs awarding  scholarships to as few as 67 recipients in the case of the U.S. Collaborative  Research Support Program to as many as 3,747 recipients in the case of  the Chinese Government Scholarships Program.", "According to foreign officials, some governments have revised scholarship  program funding and participation levels in recent years to reflect  changing national objectives, such as placing a greater emphasis on  making their higher education systems more visible. For example, over the  past 5 years, the European Union has increased funding levels for the  Erasmus Mundus program by more than tenfold to 93 million euros ($136  million in U.S. dollars) annually, and plans to spend 950 million euros  ($1.39 billion in U.S. dollars) on the program over the next 5 years.  Moreover, some program officials from Australia told us that they  anticipate funding and participation levels for the Endeavour Awards  scholarship programs to continue to increase in the coming years.  However, funding and participation for at least one major scholarship  program have been reduced in recent years. Specifically, the number of  scholarships offered by the United Kingdom\u2019s Chevening Programme core  scholarship scheme has declined from over 1,500 in 2004 to around 1,000  in more recent years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Highlighted Strategies They Say Are Key to the Successful Implementation of Scholarship Programs", "paragraphs": ["Officials that administer both public diplomacy and development  assistance programs cite several strategies that they say facilitate program  implementation and contribute to successful program outcomes.

For example, the  Australian Development Scholarships and Australian Leaderships Awards,  both managed by the Australia\u2019s Agency for International Development,  requires scholars to complete a 4- to 6-week introductory academic  program that covers information on life and study in Australia prior to the  commencement of formal academic studies. In addition to this program,  the Australian Development Scholarships also provides precourse English  classes. Further, the Chinese Government Scholarships Program requires  recipients who do not meet minimum language proficiency standards to  take up to a year of intensive Chinese-language training upon arrival in  China. Depending on the needs of the student, this language training may  continue once their academic program begins. Similarly, to aid students in  their transition to the United States, USAID requires all Cooperative  Association of States for Scholarships recipients to participate in  predeparture orientation training. During this training, participants also  receive program-required health exams, and they complete the steps  necessary to obtain their student visas.", "Some development assistance officials also highlighted the importance of  aligning the courses of study offered by their programs with the human  resource and capacity building needs of the sending country. For example,  USAID officials said that fields of study offered by the U.S. Cooperative  Association of States for Scholarships program are determined based on a  review of the development needs and employment trends of the country.  According to officials, this, along with the support of the sending  countries\u2019 governments and private business sectors, helps students to  obtain a job once they return to their country. In Australia, officials work  with sending governments to identify the most acute development needs  and consider these with the applicant\u2019s proposed field of study when  awarding scholarships.", "In keeping with their goal of advancing human resource capacity in  sending countries, development assistance programs typically seek to  return participants to their home country upon completing their program  of study. For example, recipients of all Australian Agency for International  Development scholarships are expected to return to their country of  citizenship for at least 2 years after completing their scholarship program.  To enforce this obligation, Australia requires development scholarship  recipients to sign a contract agreeing to return to their home country for 2  years. If they return to Australia before the 2-year period is up, they incur a  debt to the Australian government equal to the full value of the  scholarship. This operates as a strong disincentive for students to stay in  Australia after completing their study program, and it results in a student  return rate of 95 percent or better, according to Australian officials.  However, this does not guarantee that students will stay in their home  countries for 2 years. One official noted that many alumni choose to move  to another country shortly after returning home. All USAID exchange  visitors are required to sign a form in which they agree, among other  things, to return home immediately upon completion of their program.  Recipients of some USAID programs are also required to sign a contract  agreeing to return home within 3 days of completing their program.  According to USAID officials, this is effective in ensuring students return  home and fulfill program objectives. Officials said that 86 percent of  participants in its Collaborative Research Support Programs return to a  developing country after graduation.", "Finally, officials noted the importance of developing active alumni  networks. Officials told us that having strong alumni networks better  enables them to reach future applicants, track alumni, and assess their  careers and accomplishments as well as perceptions of their international  study experience. These networks also provide a means through which  alumni can receive support from their former host country and help  facilitate enduring relationships between students and the host country  once their tour of study has ended. For these reasons, State encourages  alumni of its exchange programs to connect through a central Web site  that allows members to find fellow alumni, search for job opportunities,  and participate in online discussion forums, among other activities.  Officials at the Australian Agency for International Development stated  that they are in the process of developing in-country alumni networks for  their programs. Australian officials also noted that maintaining  relationships with influential alumni may advance diplomatic and  development assistance objectives. Other scholarship programs, such as  the Erasmus Mundus program, have also created Web-based networks to  facilitate contact with scholarship program alumni."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of State and USAID  for review and comment.

To capture recent  trends in student mobility, we also considered each country\u2019s growth in  international enrollments, comparing the 2008 data to 2000 base year data  from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD). Further, to ensure a more global perspective of the international  education landscape, we reviewed a geographically diverse set of  governments that, collectively, attract students from a wide range of  countries. We also conferred with embassy and government officials as  well as industry experts to obtain their recommendations on which  countries to visit and review based on their knowledge of international  education.
