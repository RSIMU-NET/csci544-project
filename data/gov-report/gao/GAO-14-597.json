Using a different methodology that includes additional causes of overpayments not considered in GAO's analysis, SSA estimated it made $3.3 billion in SSI overpayments in fiscal year 2010. The majority (70 percent) of the estimated overpayment amount GAO identified showed indications of possible Social Security number (SSN) misuse, such as employers reporting wages for recipients in multiple locations during the same quarter. For example, GAO determined that wages for 2,399 SSI recipients were reported solely by employers outside the recipient's state of residence. As the figure below shows, one individual in California had wages reported from 11 different employers in seven other states during the same quarter of calendar year 2010. This suggests that multiple individuals may be using the SSI recipient's SSN and name for work. The exact number of individuals who received overpayments and the exact amount of overpayments made to those individuals cannot be determined without detailed case investigations by SSA. GAO analyzed five recipient cases and provided the results to SSA.", "GAO analyzed employers with wages for SSI recipients from outside the recipient's state and found nine employers who reported wages for 15 or more SSI recipients during the same quarter who lived in different states from the employer's location. For example, a plant located in one state reported wages for 22 SSI recipients who lived in six other states, indicating possible SSN misuse. SSA has previously reported that privacy and disclosure issues have limited its ability to routinely share information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is responsible for enforcing employer compliance with immigration laws through its work-site enforcement strategy. Reviewing SSI wages at a summary level can provide information on certain employers that have high incidences of inaccurate wage reports.

SSA accesses  the NDNH by means of routine file matches to verify eligibility and  payment amounts under the SSI program.  During SSA\u2019s income- verification process, SSA systems generate an alert when a match  between the SSA record and the verified quarterly wage file shows there  are significant overreported or underreported wages. SSA uses  established criteria, such as tolerances, to generate the alerts and post  them to the recipient\u2019s record for future review and development by field- office staff to determine whether the discrepancies affect SSI benefits.", "The NDNH database, administered by the Department of Health and  Human Services, contains employment data on newly hired employees  (form W-4), quarterly wage data on individual employees, and  unemployment insurance data.

April 2005, the SSA OIG also identified the top 100 employers in each of  the service, restaurant, and agriculture industries that contribute the most  reporting irregularities. Several of the employers and industry  associations that spoke with the SSA OIG for its April 2005 report stated  that unauthorized noncitizens contribute to SSN misuse.

We  determined that for our potential overpayment population of 10,187  recipients, wages for 2,399 SSI recipients were reported solely by  employers located outside the recipient\u2019s state of residence. Of those  2,399 individuals, 21 were reported as receiving wages by employers  from four or more different states than what was reported as their state of  residence on their SSA records during the same quarter.

For each of the five cases, wages  reported in the NDNH triggered alerts to SSI caseworkers for follow-up.  However, all five of the recipients had evidence in their case files of  wages being disclaimed. Under SSA\u2019s procedures for disclaiming wages,  recipients can provide SSA with a signed statement attesting that the  wages being reported for their SSN were not earned by them. One of the  recipients disclaimed wages as far back as 2004, and has repeatedly  disclaimed wages every year from 2009 to 2012. Once a recipient  disclaims wages, the SSI caseworker then is to take an additional step to  remove the disclaimed earnings from the Master Earnings File. According  to SSA, the agency had already referred four of the five recipients to  SSA\u2019s OIG for further investigation. SSA OIG stated that it reviewed the  four cases, but the cases were subsequently closed due to insufficient  details that hindered its ability to make a determination as to which  individual was possibly misusing the SSN.", "The five cases we reviewed also indicated possible SSN misuse. For  example, as shown in figure 2 below, one individual living in California  had wages reported in the NDNH from 11 different employers in seven  other states that were many miles away during the same quarter of  calendar year 2010. This suggests that multiple individuals may have  been using the SSI recipient\u2019s SSN and name for work purposes.

However, it is questionable that one person  could work for multiple employers simultaneously in different regions of  the country during the same quarter.", "Of the 10,187 individuals we identified as having received potential SSI  overpayments, we also identified another 582 SSI recipients with wages  reported from employers both outside and within their home state during  the same quarter. Wages reported for the remaining portion of our  overpayment population were solely from employers inside their state.  However, this subset of recipients also showed indications of possible  misuse. A total of 1,247 in-state recipients had multiple employers report  wages during the same quarter. For example, we identified one individual  who, according to SSA\u2019s records, lives in a border town in south Texas,  but had wages reported in the NDNH from four different employers during  the same quarter of calendar year 2010 located hundreds of miles away  in the Dallas / Fort Worth and Houston, Texas, areas.", "We recognize that it is possible for individuals that live near a state border  to work in the neighboring state or for individuals to change their  employer within a 3-month quarter for which wages are reported.  However, without a detailed case-file review that includes contacting the  recipient to determine if reported wages should be disclaimed, it is  impossible to determine whether the wages reported by employers in  other states that are many miles away are attributable to a single SSI  recipient or to other individuals misusing the recipient\u2019s SSN."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Employers Had High Incidence of Questionable Wage Reporting", "paragraphs": ["After determining the extent to which individuals had wages reported from  outside their state, we analyzed the employers that reported those wages.

For example, as shown in figure 3 below,  one meat plant with a single Indiana location reported wages for 22 SSI  recipients whose SSA records indicated that they lived in other states that  were many miles away: namely California, Louisiana, Massachusetts,  New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. According to SSA\u2019s records, none of  the SSI recipients we detected in the wages reported by this employer  actually lived in Indiana.

DHS is responsible  for granting aliens permission to work in the United States, and for  enforcing compliance of employers with immigration laws. Under the law,  employers who employ individuals who they know are not authorized to  work in the United States may face civil fines, or in some cases, criminal  penalties. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland  Security Investigations (HSI), has a three-pronged approach to address  work-site enforcement: enforcement (criminal arrests of employers);  compliance (employment-eligibility verification inspections, civil fines, and  suspension and debarment); and outreach (education and training).  According to HSI officials, HSI prioritizes its work-site enforcement  investigations by focusing on the most-egregious violators, such as  employers that knowingly hire unauthorized workers, utilize unauthorized  workers as a business model, mistreat or exploit their workers, aid in the  smuggling of their alien workforce into the United States, or create false  identity documents or facilitate document fraud. HSI officials further stated  that the agency continues to prioritize the protection of our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures and key resource sectors and industries by ensuring that  unauthorized workers do not have access to sensitive facilities or  information. As part of the effort to target unauthorized employment, a law  was established allowing SSA to share data with DHS on noncitizens who  have earnings recorded under a nonwork SSN. Under certain  circumstances, SSA may assign nonwork SSNs to noncitizens who are in  the United States but are not authorized to work. Individuals earning  wages under a nonwork SSN represent potential noncitizens who are  working without DHS authorization. Furthermore, DHS officials stated that  if the data on possible SSN misuse we identified could be routinely  shared with them, similar to sharing the nonwork SSN data, it may assist  them in their enforcement efforts. For example, they stated that the data  on possible SSN misuse we identified may add to the depth of DHS  investigations by identifying indicators of potentially egregious employers  who knowingly hire unauthorized workers, and support DHS\u2019s work-site  enforcement strategy efforts. Specifically, rather than identifying work  discrepancies on a case\u2013by-case basis, DHS officials agreed that our  summary analysis may provide useful information on certain employers  that have a high incidence of reporting inaccurate wages, indicating  possible SSN misuse.", "Although SSA is able to identify possible SSN misuse for SSI recipients  when alert notices are generated and wages are ultimately disclaimed by  the recipient, SSA has previously reported that privacy and disclosure  issues have limited its ability to combat SSN misuse. For instance,  according to SSA, data-sharing restrictions limit its ability to routinely  share information with DHS regarding employers who file large numbers  of wage statements with inaccurate SSNs. In 2001, SSA OIG  recommended that SSA reevaluate its application of existing laws or seek  legislative authority to remove barriers that would allow the agency to  share information regarding chronic problem employers who submit  duplicate or unassigned SSNs with DHS. At the time, SSA disagreed with  the recommendation, stating that it continued to provide appropriate  disclosure guidance within its existing authority. In addition, SSA stated in  its response to the SSA OIG\u2019s 2001 report that there was no need for the  agency to reevaluate its disclosure policies or to seek legislation in this  area because SSA\u2019s existing regulations authorized it to disclose  information for law-enforcement purposes, including requests for  investigation or prosecution purposes.", "Similarly, in February 2005 we recommended that the Secretary of  Homeland Security take steps to determine how DHS can best use SSA- supplied data on potential illegal work activity and specific industries  associated most frequently with such activity to support its work-site  enforcement efforts. In its response to our 2005 report, DHS had stated that it was taking the necessary steps to determine the best use of SSA- provided listings of persons with earnings who lack work authorization. In  February 2006 we further concluded that coordination between DHS and  SSA to leverage usable and useful data is essential to ensure that limited  DHS work-site enforcement resources are targeted effectively. In 2005,  SSA OIG reiterated its support for the 2001 recommendation to seek  legislative authority that would allow SSA to share information regarding  employers who had the most reporting irregularities, such as invalid,  unassigned, and duplicate SSNs. In 2013, SSA OIG identified employers  who report wages with significant errors in the employee name and SSN  and also recommended that SSA continue working with DHS to develop a  coordinated strategy to reduce SSN misuse. In its written response to  the August 2013 SSA OIG report, SSA agreed with this recommendation  and stated it would continue to promote methods for employers to verify  employee names and SSNs that would result in fewer wage-reporting  irregularities. For example, DHS\u2019s E-Verify is a free, largely voluntary,  Internet-based system that allows employers to verify the employment  eligibility of newly-hired employees with the SSA database and DHS  immigration databases. Currently, DHS estimates that 9 percent of  employers utilize E-Verify with approximately 1,600 additional employers  enrolling every week.", "Both Congress and the executive branch have recognized the need for  improved collaboration across the federal government. In addition, in our  past work, we have concluded that collaboration is critical for achieving  meaningful results in efforts involving multiple federal agencies.  Following key practices for effective collaboration can help agencies  address a range of challenges, such as information sharing and  communication. One of these key practices is directly relevant to SSA\u2019s  efforts to collaborate with DHS: establishing compatible policies,  procedures, and other means to enhance information sharing and  communication across agency boundaries. We previously identified tools  that can facilitate such collaboration between agencies, such as shared  databases and web portals. Establishing a negotiated data-sharing  arrangement could be beneficial for effective collaboration between SSA  and DHS.", "As previously mentioned, a component of DHS\u2019s work-site enforcement  strategy includes focusing on employers who knowingly hire unauthorized  workers.

Such  information could be used by DHS to target unauthorized employment in  support of its work-site enforcement efforts.

We selected this employer  as an example of an employer who reported wages for SSI recipients in  distant states during the same quarter.", "To determine the reliability of the SSA disability records and NDNH data,  we reviewed documentation related to these databases and interviewed  officials responsible for compiling and maintaining relevant SSI and  NDNH data. In addition, we performed electronic testing to determine the  validity of specific data elements in the databases that we used to  perform our work. We also reviewed detailed SSA case files for the  nongeneralizable selection of five individuals selected for additional  analysis to corroborate SSA data. On the basis of our discussions with  agency officials, our review of related documentation, and our own  testing, we concluded that the data elements used for this report were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2013 to July 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

First, the quarterly amounts on the NDNH  represent 3 months of income; however, SSA calculates overpayments  based on monthly earnings amounts. To facilitate our analysis, we  calculated monthly income for each month in a quarter by dividing the  quarterly NDNH amount by three. For example, if the NDNH reported  quarterly income of $3,000 in the first quarter of 2010, we calculated the  monthly income to be $1,000 for January, February, and March of 2010.  This monthly computed income amount could differ from the actual  monthly income. For instance, using the previous example, the actual  monthly income in January 2010 could be $3,000, and actual income in  February or March could be $0. In addition, because we were limited to  SSI beneficiaries with income in the NDNH for fiscal year 2010, our  analysis may understate the extent of individuals receiving potential  overpayments due to possible SSN misuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSI Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the NDNH match file identified individuals who received  SSI payments in fiscal year 2010 and had computed monthly income that  exceeded the corresponding monthly threshold for the program. To  calculate the potential SSI overpayments for each month, we compared  the income to the maximum benefit amounts as specified by SSA by  subtracting the total countable income from the 2010 monthly SSI benefit  rate of $674. SSI has program rules for the exclusion of a certain amount  of income in considering whether the monthly SSI benefit rate should be  reduced. As such, we took these exclusions into consideration to capture  the amount of exclusion used and the remaining exclusion amount.  Specifically, we calculated countable unearned income, countable earned  income, and the total countable income. Since this population included  individuals with indications of expenses incurred or income set aside that  are typically excluded from countable income when calculating the SSI   individuals with these types of expenses were also  benefit amount,excluded from our overall population. About 0.25 percent of the SSI  recipients in our population had any indication of exclusions to income  present."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Social Security  Administration\u2019s (SSA) letter dated July 3, 2014.  1.", "In the report, we added a reference to SSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2011  Performance and Accountability Report as the source of the estimate.   Including SSA\u2019s own estimate of Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  overpayments shows that overpayments are a recognized issue with  the program.    2.  As mentioned in the report, we recognize that it is possible for  individuals that live near a state border to work in the neighboring  state or for individuals to change their employer within a 3-month  quarter for which wages are reported. However, without a detailed  case-file review that includes contacting the recipient to determine if  reported wages should be disclaimed, it is impossible to determine  whether the wages reported by employers in other states that are  many miles away are attributable to a single SSI recipient or to other  individuals misusing the recipient\u2019s Social Security number (SSN).   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers are reported in  the state of the physical location of their job.  Our report describes a  case where an SSI recipient that lives in California had wages  reported by 11 different employers in seven different states, none of  which bordered California, for the same 3-month period. We believe  this is an indication of potential SSN misuse.  3.  As mentioned in our report, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) stated that the data on possible SSN misuse we identified may  add to the depth of DHS investigations by identifying indicators of  potentially egregious employers who knowingly hire unauthorized  workers.  4.  We revised the report to clarify GAO had National Directory of New  Hires (NDNH) data that included fiscal year 2010.  5.  As mentioned in the report, we state that the exact number of  individuals who received SSI overpayments and the exact amount of  overpayments made to those individuals cannot be determined  without detailed case investigations by SSA.  Thus, we refer to  \u201cpotential overpayments\u201d throughout this report.  In addition, the report  states that approximately 70 percent of the total overpayment amount  showed indications of possible SSN misuse, such as individuals with  wages reported from employers in multiple states during the same  quarter, so we were unable to determine whether the recipients  actually received SSI overpayments.
