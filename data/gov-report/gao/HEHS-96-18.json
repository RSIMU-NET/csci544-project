Because some portion of this amount is likely to have been paid unnecessarily, you asked us to review (1) the nature and extent of fraud and abuse related to services and supplies provided to nursing facility patients, (2) the conditions that make the provision of services and supplies to nursing facility patients an attractive opportunity for wrongdoers, and (3) options for removing such opportunity.", "For this review, we interviewed officials at HCFA, Medicare claims processors, HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), and several national organizations representing the nursing home industry and providers of services and supplies. We also analyzed documents for ongoing and recently completed investigations by Medicare claims processors and OIG, and interviewed investigators working on those cases to identify factors leading to fraudulent and abusive billing situations.

The care in skilled nursing facilities that part A covers\u2014for which Medicare paid an estimated $6.6 billion in 1995\u2014is limited to relatively short stays for patients who need daily skilled care following hospitalization. Most elderly people in nursing facilities do not qualify for part A coverage.", "Medicare part B covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equipment, and various other health services. Although the vast majority of Medicare patients in nursing facilities do not require skilled nursing care, they are entitled to the full range of services and supplies covered by the Medicare part B program when part A does not pay for the nursing facility services themselves. This care is usually billed directly to Medicare by the providers who serve these patients. In 1995, Medicare paid an estimated $5.5 billion for services and supplies furnished to patients in nursing facilities.", "HCFA contracts with insurers, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Aetna, and The Travelers Insurance Company, to process and pay claims submitted by providers.

The act imposed requirements that nursing facilities provide those services and activities necessary to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident. Upon a patient\u2019s admission to a facility, a registered nurse must conduct or coordinate a comprehensive assessment of medical, nursing, mental, and psychosocial needs. The facility must then develop a comprehensive plan of care for the patient that includes measurable objectives and timetables to meet the patient\u2019s needs identified in the comprehensive assessment. Each assessment must be reviewed at least every 3 months; any revisions must be reflected in the corresponding plan of care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Instances of Wrongful Billing Suggest Widespread Activity", "paragraphs": ["Fraudulent and abusive practices by some providers who furnish services and supplies to nursing facility patients entail billing Medicare for unnecessary or undelivered services and supplies or misrepresenting a service or supply item to obtain Medicare reimbursement as the following examples show:", "A company billed Medicare for heart monitoring services provided to nursing facility patients.

Medicare overpaid this company an estimated $4.3 million.", "An optometrist filed Medicare claims for services either not medically necessary or not provided to nursing facility patients from 1991 through 1993.

The actual extent of the problem cannot be quantified, but the evidence suggests that it is widespread. Our review of ongoing and completed investigations by Medicare carriers and HHS OIG included cases encompassing at least 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Thirty of the providers in these cases operated in multiple states as these examples illustrate:", "A supplier currently under investigation for allegedly billing Medicare for surgical dressing kits and components that were not provided or medically necessary operates in at least 20 states.", "Another supplier with offices in at least seven states billed Medicare for incontinence supplies that were inflated in price, not provided, or not medically necessary.", "Another company under investigation for inappropriately billing Medicare for heart monitoring services operates in at least 11 states.", "Because data on fraud and abuse have not been accumulated based on place of service, investigators cannot quantify the extent of Medicare fraud and abuse involving the provision of services and supplies to nursing facility patients. Medicare carriers and OIG officials believe, however, that fraud involving services provided in nursing facilities is significant. In 1994, the Senate Special Committee on Aging reported a considerable number of cases involving the targeting of nursing facility patients by industries that supply products and services directly to them. Also in 1994, OIG reported on a completed investigation in which Medicare had paid over $7.4 million to a billing company (representing 70 nursing facilities in 7 states) that had billed for surgical dressings supplied to nursing facility patients who had had no surgery. And in February 1995 testimony before the House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Health, the Inspector General reported that about half of the $230 million Medicare approved in 1993 nationally for incontinence supplies was questionable.

HCFA\u2019s reimbursement system for part B services and supplies allows providers to bill Medicare without adequate confirmation that the care or items were necessary or were delivered as claimed. As a result, the program is highly vulnerable to exploitation. Also, despite the emphasis on patient care, the cases we reviewed demonstrate that nursing facilities often do not control provider access to records closely enough and opportunists are permitted to exploit Medicare.", "Nursing facilities generally do not have the in-house capability to provide all the services and supplies that patients need. Accordingly, outside providers market their services and supplies to nursing facilities to meet the needs of the facilities\u2019 patients. OIG has reported that provider representatives typically enter nursing facilities and offer to handle the entire transaction\u2014from reviewing medical records to identify those patients their products or services can help, to billing Medicare\u2014with no involvement by nursing facility staff. Some facilities allow providers or their representatives to review patient medical records despite federal regulations that prohibit such unauthorized review. These representatives gain access to records not because they have any responsibility for the direct care of those patients, but because they want to market their services or supplies. We found that unscrupulous providers can obtain all the information necessary to order, bill, and be reimbursed by Medicare for services and supplies that are in many instances not necessary or even provided. The following are two examples of this practice:", "A supplier obtained a list of Medicare patients at three nursing facilities together with their Medicare numbers from another supplier who had access to specific Medicare billing information for certain patients at these facilities. The first supplier billed Medicare for large quantities of supplies that were never provided to these patients and then paid the second supplier half of the approximately $814,000 it received in reimbursement.", "A group optometrical practice performed routine eye examinations on nursing home patients, a service not reimbursable by Medicare. The optometrist was always preceded by a sales person who targeted the nursing facility\u2019s director of nursing or its social worker and claimed the group was offering eye examinations at no cost to the facility or the patient. The nursing facility gave the sales person access to patients\u2019 records, and this person then obtained the information necessary to file claims. Nursing staff would obtain physicians\u2019 orders for the \u201cfree\u201d examinations, and an optometrist would later arrive to conduct the examinations. The billings to Medicare, however, were for services other than eye examinations\u2014services that were never furnished or were unnecessary.", "The OIG and HHS attorneys with whom we spoke agreed that granting providers of services and supplies unauthorized access to medical records contributes to fraud and billing abuse. They stated that except in specific cases in which a resident\u2019s safety is jeopardized as a result, HHS lacks clear authority to impose monetary or other penalties on nursing facilities solely for providing such access."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little Chance of Timely Detection of Excessive Medicare Reimbursements", "paragraphs": ["Although carriers employ a number of effective automated controls to prevent or remedy some inappropriate payments, such as suspending claims for further review that do not meet certain conditions for payment, our work shows that outlandish charges or very large reimbursements routinely escape the controls and typically go unquestioned. The carriers we reviewed had not put any \u201ctriggers\u201d in place that would halt payments when cumulative claims exceed reasonable thresholds.", "Our analysis showed that as a result, Medicare has reimbursed providers, who were subsequently found guilty of fraud or billing abuses, large sums of money over a short period without the carrier becoming suspicious. The following examples highlight the problem:", "A supplier submitted claims to a Medicare carrier for surgical dressings furnished to nursing facility patients. In the fourth quarter of 1992, the carrier paid the supplier $211,900 for surgical dressing claims. For the same quarter a year later, the contractor paid this supplier more than $6 million without becoming suspicious despite a 2,800-percent increase in the amount paid.", "A carrier\u2019s payments for a supplier\u2019s body jackets claims averaged about $2,300 per quarter for five consecutive quarters, then jumped to $32,000, $95,000, $235,000, and $889,000 over the next four quarters, with no questions raised by the carrier.", "In other instances, we found that providers subsequently investigated for wrongdoing billed and were paid for quantities of services or supplies that could not possibly have been furnished or necessary as these examples illustrate:", "A carrier reimbursed a clinical psychology group practice for individual psychotherapy visits lasting 45 to 50 minutes when the top three billing psychologists in the group were allegedly seeing from 17 to 42 nursing facility patients per day. On many days the leading biller of this group would have had to work more than 24 uninterrupted hours to provide the services he claimed.", "A carrier paid a podiatrist $143,580 for performing surgical procedures on at least 4,400 nursing facility patients during a 6-month period. For these services to be legitimate, the podiatrist would have had to serve on average at least 34 patients per day, 5 days per week.", "The Medicare carriers in these two cases did not become suspicious until they received complaints from family members, beneficiaries, or competing providers. In other cases, the carriers initiated their investigations because of their analysis of paid claims (a practice referred to as postpayment medical review), which focuses on those providers that appear to be billing more than their peers for specific procedures. One carrier, for instance, reimbursed a laboratory $2.7 million in 1991 for heart monitoring services allegedly provided to nursing facility patients and $8.2 million in 1992. The carrier was first alerted in January 1993 through its postpayment review efforts when it noted that this laboratory\u2019s claims for monitoring services exceeded the norm for its peers.", "In all these cases, the large increases in reimbursements over a short period or the improbable cumulative services claimed for a single day should have alerted carriers to the possibility that something unusual was happening and prompted an earlier review.

In all the cases cited previously, the carriers did investigate the providers, but by the time the investigations began, Medicare had already made millions of dollars in unwarranted payments. The risk to the Medicare program, as evidenced by the fraud cases we reviewed, is that relatively little of the money inappropriately paid out is recovered as the following examples show:", "The owners of a company that had received over $4.3 million from Medicare based on fraudulent claims for heart monitoring argued before the court that $250,000 was the most they could repay. In the settlement agreement, they agreed to reimburse Medicare $250,000, plus interest, and be excluded from the Medicare program for 5 years.", "The optometrist mentioned previously who billed for services never rendered and for undocumented consultations agreed, in a civil settlement, to refund $30,000 to Medicare over a 35-month period and to be excluded from the program for 3 years. Although Medicare had reimbursed this provider over $450,000 on the basis of false or misleading claims, the case was settled for less because the provider had no assets from which the overpayments could be recovered.", "Several companies under investigation since early 1993 for the submission of false claims for heart monitoring services have billed Medicare large sums over a 6- to 9-month period and then have gone out of business when Medicare began making billing inquiries. For example, within a month of Medicare\u2019s contacting one company for medical records, the company\u2014which had already been paid at least $1.4 million\u2014closed its operations making it unlikely that Medicare can recover inappropriate payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options for Reimbursing Part B Claims for Services Provided to Nursing Facility Patients", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that a major contributing factor to fraudulent and abusive billings for services and supplies provided nursing facility patients is that no one is ensuring that what is billed for is necessary or actually provided.

Each option would require a basic change in the way Medicare reimburses part B services and supplies provided to nursing facility patients:", "Unified billing by the nursing facility: Under this approach, the nursing facility would bill Medicare for all services it is authorized to furnish to patients, whether payment is sought from part A or B. This would be the case whether the facility provided the care itself or contracted for the services or supplies to be provided by someone else. Outside providers would be prohibited from billing Medicare directly and would, in effect, have to have agreements with nursing homes. Absent an agreement, the nursing facility could not bill Medicare because it would not be financially liable or medically responsible for the care. By contrast, under the current system, outside providers can bill Medicare directly, without scrutiny by anyone where the care is delivered. Unified billing by the nursing facility would make it easier for Medicare to identify all the services furnished to residents, which in turn would make it easier to control payments for those services.", "Capping payments: An alternative to paying on a fee-for-service basis as Medicare now does is to pay a fixed amount per beneficiary. This approach mirrors the payment method Medicare uses to reimburse most health maintenance organizations (HMO) serving Medicare beneficiaries.As with HMOs, Medicare would pay the nursing facility a fixed amount per month for all part B services and supplies provided to each resident beneficiary. A variant, one that would apply only to skilled nursing facilities, would mirror the way Medicare pays hospitals for inpatient care. As with hospitals, Medicare would pay nursing facilities a predetermined fixed amount per patient based on the type of case or diagnosis-related group into which the patient is classified. Both variants of the capped payment approach would, by definition, limit Medicare outlays for these services, eliminating providers\u2019 incentive to provide too many services. By the same token, the incentive for nursing facilities to profit from accepting fixed payments while providing fewer services than necessary would need to be addressed. A further difficulty in these approaches is in establishing reasonable rates given the wide range of services provided individual nursing facility patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Under Medicare neither the nursing facility nor the physician ensure that the services and supplies outside providers claim to have furnished to beneficiaries in nursing facilities are in fact necessary and actually provided. As a result, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries in nursing facilities offer a target of opportunity for the fraudulent schemes and billing abuses of the dishonest provider. To address the root cause of this accountability issue, Medicare needs to change the way it reimburses for services and supplies furnished patients in nursing facilities. Options range from those that can be implemented in the short term, such as allowing only nursing facilities to bill for all services and supplies provided to their patients, to the more difficult long-term solutions, such as capitation or prospective payment systems. All these options address the accountability issue, but more study is needed to assess the comparable costs and benefits of these options.", "Certain immediate actions would help stem losses. First, carriers could establish computerized payment controls that, before payment, would detect and automatically suspend for further review claims that exceeded established thresholds for charges and utilization. The thresholds need not be based on statistical averages, but they should be based on an assumption about what is reasonable activity for specific procedures, provider types, beneficiaries, and places of service. Such controls could provide timely warnings and trigger investigations of potentially fraudulent and abusive billings before large sums were paid out. Second, nursing facilities should be held accountable for the unauthorized disclosure of patient medical records. Giving providers or their representatives inappropriate access to patient medical records was a major contributing cause to the fraud and abuse cases we reviewed.

Another complaint was received from the daughter of a beneficiary residing in a nursing home. The daughter stated that she had only authorized an eye examination, but the charges submitted to Medicare were for multiple services provided for both eyes\u2014although her father had only one eye.

All the claims cited exactly the same procedure codes and diagnoses; the only differences were dates of service and beneficiary identification information. From this universe, the carrier randomly sampled 10 beneficiary records from two nursing homes and found that the nursing homes had no records documenting the services claimed by this optometrist. On May 21, 1992, the carrier summarized this information and referred the case to OIG.

Additionally, the carrier completed a postpayment review on this provider\u2019s billings and reported in January 1993 that medical necessity appeared questionable for many claims and that nursing home visits and consultation requests were not documented. The optometrist requested a hearing before the Medicare hearing officer to review the carrier\u2019s continuing reimbursement denials.

The owner would approach facility administrators and offer to provide supplies for Medicare patients at no cost to the facility. This was an attractive proposition to these facilities, which typically have limited financial resources. The facility administrators gave the provider complete access to patient medical records.

In one instance, the provider billed Medicare $2,790 for surgical dressing kits that were never provided; instead, the provider furnished the patient 62 gauze bandages costing less than $20.

The complaint concerned a wheelchair cushion that should have cost less than $100 but that was charged to Medicare as a $1,503 custom-fitted body jacket. After receiving several complaints from family members of other nursing home residents and nursing home staff, the carrier noted the increased billings by the supplier submitting this claim and started to review related nursing home records. Carrier medical staff determined that services the supplier billed Medicare for were not provided, beneficiaries were not measured for a custom fit, the beneficiaries\u2019 condition could not be improved by using the jackets, physical therapy was billed for but neither ordered nor received, and the physicians only signed prescriptions that had been prepared by someone else. By mid-May, the carrier had received 38 complaints against this supplier of which 34 pertained to body jackets. By mid-August, the inquiries concerning this supplier had increased to 50. The carrier referred this case to OIG on August 25, 1992.", "OIG\u2019s investigation revealed that this supplier actually started marketing wheelchair cushions with adjustable straps as Medicare-reimbursable custom-fitted body jackets in 1991. Sales representatives for the supplier would market the body jackets to the directors of nursing as fully Medicare covered and promise that no real attempt would be made to collect the co-payments from the beneficiaries. They would offer to go into the nursing facility files to obtain the patient information needed to prepare claims and certificates of medical necessity. Usually, the facility allowed such access; in other cases, the facility provided the necessary information. In some cases, the supplier gained access to nursing homes by providing kickbacks in the form of payments on insurance policies or to individuals to induce them to order exclusively from this supplier.", "The sales people obtained physicians\u2019 signatures on the certificates of medical necessity by assuring physicians that the director of nursing had requested the items and that the items would cost the patients nothing. The certificates would be sent to the supplier\u2019s headquarters, where employees would add or delete wording from the signed certificates to guarantee Medicare payment. By December 1992, Medicare had paid this supplier over $1.6 million for wheelchair cushions misrepresented as body jackets.", "Seven persons involved in this fraudulent scheme were indicted and pled guilty; all were sentenced in fall 1994. The owner of the company was sentenced to 33 months in jail followed by 3 years on supervised release and was ordered to make restitution to Medicare of $386,508. Two other principal defendants connected with the firm were placed on probation for 5 years and each was ordered to make restitution of $386,508. Two persons convicted of receiving kickbacks were each placed on probation for 5 years and fined $9,000 and $10,000, respectively.

The following month, the daughter of a third beneficiary wrote to the carrier complaining of a claim for a body jacket that her mother did not need or use. When she went to the nursing home, she learned that her mother and others had refused to accept the body jackets and the nursing home had put them in storage. After talking to the administrator and nurses at the home, the daughter learned that a representative of the supplier came to the nursing home, checked patients\u2019 records, and left forms to be completed for products the patients qualified for. This complainant stated that this supplier appeared to be operating out of a residence: there was no telephone listing for the company. In December, the daughter of another beneficiary wrote to the carrier complaining about the \u201cridiculous\u201d charge for a body jacket that was provided without her knowledge or consent.", "This supplier was established for the sole purpose of selling body jackets, which it sold primarily to nursing home patients. Company representatives went to nursing homes to sell wheelchair pads, which they asserted were reimbursable by Medicare. These representatives told nursing home personnel and beneficiaries that the beneficiaries would not be responsible for any costs not reimbursed by Medicare. The company representatives also prepared certificates of medical necessity for the wheelchair pads sold and obtained physicians\u2019 signatures. The company then billed Medicare for body jackets.

Nor had the services been ordered by the beneficiary\u2019s doctor or the nursing home where the beneficiary resided. The carrier reviewed the pertinent medical records for 15 beneficiaries in three nursing homes in two different states and found that none of the services were medically necessary. For 14 beneficiaries, there were no physician orders requesting the services, and for the remaining beneficiary, the diagnosis submitted with the claim was not documented. The carrier identified an overpayment of $10,520 for 19 claims paid during a 4-month period.", "On August 13, 1991, the carrier referred this case to OIG for further investigation. Following this referral, the carrier received several additional complaints against this laboratory. For example, a beneficiary\u2019s legal guardian learned that Medicare paid the laboratory $706 for the telephonic transmission of 21 electrocardiogram (EKG) rhythm strips over a 2-week period. She contacted the beneficiary\u2019s physician and learned that the physician did not authorize or have any prior knowledge of such tests. In another complaint, a former employee stated the laboratory\u2019s salespeople contacted doctors regarding its cardiac monitoring system. If doctors signed up for the service, they had to provide listings of their heart patients in nursing homes. The laboratory then sent people to the nursing homes to perform 21 EKGs on each patient over an 11-day period, with the series of tests to be repeated three more times during the year. The laboratory charged about $1,000 per patient for the 11-day study, or about $4,000 per year per patient. However, the doctors generally did not see the results of the studies. The laboratory operated all over the country; one doctor alone had 275 patients on this program.", "As a result of its investigation, OIG concluded that most of the laboratory\u2019s billings for these services were inappropriate. OIG found that the laboratory was billing Medicare for EKGs that were rendered as routine screening diagnostic tests, with no evidence of a physician evaluation and no indication that the patients were experiencing an arrhythmia, symptom, or complaint. OIG pursued the case as a civil false claims case because the diagnoses entered on the Medicare claim forms by the laboratory were false\u2014they did not accurately reflect the patients\u2019 conditions at the time the EKG services were ordered and rendered. OIG estimated that the actual Medicare overpayment in this case was about $6 million.", "On February 10, 1994, the laboratory and its three principal owners entered into an agreement to reimburse HHS $250,000 plus $16,118 in interest for inappropriate claims. In addition, the laboratory waived any future demands for $655,086 in payments (identified through a special prepayment review effort) that the Medicare carrier had withheld\u2014thus resulting in a total settlement of $921,204.

By the time the carrier referred the case to OIG on July 30, 1991, it had received 19 complaints against the group practice and 2 against the individual; 19 of these complaints involved beneficiaries in nursing homes. The complaints alleged that the providers had billed Medicare for services that were never furnished or that were not necessary.

Several days later, an optometrist would visit the nursing home and render services.", "After reviewing nursing home medical records for 20 beneficiaries, the carrier concluded that the services billed were not medically necessary or not documented.

He also enlisted the help of his patients to write to Medicare of his successes and to provide copies of those letters to their Congress Members and Senators.
