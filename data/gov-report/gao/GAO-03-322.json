In light of the importance of border security, GAO was asked to identify federal databases and systems that contain watch lists, the agencies that maintain and use them in protecting our nation's borders, the kind of data they contain, whether federal agencies are sharing information from these lists with each other and with state and local governments and private organizations, the structural characteristics of those lists that are automated, and whether opportunities exist to consolidate these watch lists."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Generally, the federal government's approach to using watch lists in performing its border security mission is decentralized and nonstandard, largely because these lists were developed in response to individual agencies' unique missions, including their respective legal, cultural, and systems environments. Specifically, nine federal agencies--which prior to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spanned the Departments of Defense, Justice, State, Transportation, and the Treasury--develop and maintain 12 watch lists. These lists include overlapping but not identical sets of data, and different policies and procedures govern whether and how these data are shared with others. As a general rule, this sharing is more likely to occur among federal agencies than between federal agencies and either state and local government agencies or private entities. Further, the extent to which such sharing is accomplished electronically is constrained by fundamental differences in the watch lists' systems architecture (that is, the hardware, software, network, and data characteristics of the systems). Two agencies identified opportunities to standardize and consolidate these lists, which GAO believes would improve information sharing. The President's homeland security strategy further recognizes the need to address the proliferation of these lists. While the Office of Homeland Security was reportedly pursuing consolidation as part of an effort to develop a border and transportation security blueprint, referred to as an enterprise architecture, the DHS Chief Information Officer told us that the department had recently taken responsibility for the blueprint.

It also acknowledges that  accomplishing these goals will require overhauling the border security  process. This will be no small task, given that the United States shares a  5,525 mile border with Canada and a 1,989 mile border with Mexico and has  95,000 miles of shoreline.

To this  end, these architectures include data models, or logical representations of  data types and their relationships, which are used to engineer physical data  \u201cstores,\u201d or repositories. When engineered properly, these data stores are  structured in a way that effectively and efficiently supports both shared  and unique enterprise applications, functions, and operations. The  structure of these data stores, whether they are paper records or  automated databases, can take many forms, employing varying degrees of  centralization and standardization. Associated with the structures being  employed are opportunities and limitations to effective and efficient  information exchange and use.", "Generally, these structures can be viewed along a continuum. At one  extreme, databases can be nonstandard, both in terms of metadata and  the technologies that manage the data, and they can be decentralized,  meaning that they were built in isolation from one another to support  isolated or separate, \u201cstovepiped\u201d applications, functions, and operations.  In this case, integrating the databases to permit information exchange  requires the development of unique, and potentially complex and costly,  point-to-point interfaces (hardware and software) that translate the data or  bridge incompatibilities in the technology. Further, the sheer number of  databases involved can exponentially increase the number of relationships,  and thus interfaces, that have to be built and maintained. Structuring  databases in this way can quickly evolve into an overly complex,  unnecessarily inefficient, and potentially ineffective way to support  mission operations.

If engineered properly, these database structures allow for greater use of  standards, in terms of both data definitions and technology, and are more  centralized, although the option exists to create subsidiary databases\u2014 known as data warehouses and data marts\u2014to permit more uniquely  configured and decentralized data sources to support specific and unique  mission needs. Further, since the core data in these subsidiary databases  are received from a corporate database(s), the need for interfaces to  translate data or connect incompatible technologies is greatly reduced.

Specifically, while federal agencies report that they are generally  sharing watch list data with each other, they also report that sharing with  organizations outside of the federal government is limited.

A simplified representation of the  number of watch list interfaces and the complexity of the watch list  environment is provided in figure 8.", "A key reason for the varying extent of watch list sharing is the cultural  differences among the government agencies and private-sector  organizations involved in securing U.S. borders. According to the  President\u2019s strategy, cultural differences often prevent agencies from  exchanging or integrating information. We also recently reported that  differences in agencies\u2019 cultures has been and remains one of the principal  impediments to integrating and sharing information from watch lists and  other information.", "Historically, legal requirements have also been impediments to sharing, but  recent legislation has begun addressing this barrier. Specifically, the  President\u2019s strategy and our past work have reported on legal  requirements, such as security, privacy, and other civil liberty protections,  that restrict effective information sharing. To address this problem,  Congress has recently passed legislation that has significantly changed the  legal framework for information sharing, which, when fully implemented,  should diminish the effect of existing legal barriers. In particular, Congress  has enacted legislation providing for agencies to have increased access to  other agencies\u2019 information and directing more data sharing among  agencies. For example, section 701 of the USA PATRIOT ACT broadened  the goals of regional law enforcement\u2019s information sharing to cover  terrorist activities. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform  Act expanded law enforcement and intelligence information sharing  about aliens seeking to enter or stay in the United States.

To address this impediment, the strategy proposes  developing a \u201csystem of systems\u201d that would allow greater information  sharing across federal agencies as well as among federal agencies, state  and local governments, private industry, and citizens.", "In order for systems to work more effectively and efficiently, each system\u2019s  key components have to meet certain criteria. In particular, their operating  systems and applications have to conform to certain standards that are  in the public domain, their databases have to be built according to  explicitly defined and documented data schemas and data models, and  their networks have to be connected. More specifically, critical system  components would have to adhere to common standards, such as open  systems standards, to ensure that different systems interoperate. One  source for open system standards is the International Organization for  Standardization. Also, these systems\u2019 data would have to have common\u2014 or at least mutually understood\u2014data definitions so that data could, at a  minimum, be received and processed, and potentially aggregated and  analyzed. Such data definitions are usually captured in a data dictionary.  Further, these systems would have to be connected to each other via a  telecommunications network or networks. When system components and  data do not meet such standards, additional measures have to be employed,  such as acquiring or building and maintaining unique system interfaces  (hardware and software) or using manual workarounds. These measures  introduce additional costs and reduce efficiency and effectiveness.", "The 12 automated watch list systems do not meet all of these criteria (see  table 2). For example, they use three different types of operating systems,  each of which stores data and files differently. Overcoming these  differences requires the use of software utilities to bridge the differences  between systems. Without such utilities, for example, a Windows-based  system cannot read data from a diskette formatted by a UNIX-based  system.", "Also, nine of the systems do not have software applications that comply  with open system standards. In these cases, agencies may have had to  invest time and resources in designing, developing, and maintaining unique  interfaces so that the systems can exchange data.", "Further, five of the systems\u2019 databases do not have a data dictionary, and of  the remaining seven systems that do have data dictionaries, at least one is  not sharing its dictionary with other agencies. Without both the existence  and sharing of these data dictionaries, meaningful understanding of data  received from another agency could require an added investment of time  and resources to interpret and understand what the received data mean.  Moreover, aggregation and analysis of the data received with the data from  other watch lists may require still further investment of time and resources  to restructure and reformat the data in a common way.", "Last, seven of the systems are not connected to a network outside of their  agencies or departments. Our experience has shown that without network  connectivity, watch list data sharing among agencies can occur only  through manual intervention. According to several of these agencies, the  manual workarounds are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and they  limit the timeliness of the data provided. For example, data from the  TIPOFF system are shared directly with the National Automated  Immigration Lookout System through a regular update on diskette. Those  data are then transferred from the National Automated Immigration  Lookout System to the Interagency Border Inspection System.", "The President\u2019 s strategy attributes these differences to the agencies\u2019  building their own systems to meet agency-specific mission needs, goals,  and policies, without knowledge of the information needs and policies of  the government as a whole.

However, this proliferation of systems, combined with the varying policies  and procedures that govern the sharing of each, as well as the architectural  differences among the automated lists, create strong arguments for list  consolidation.

Of the nine federal agencies that  operate and maintain watch lists, seven reported that the current state and  configuration of federal watch lists meet their mission needs, and that they  are satisfied with the level of watch list sharing. However, two agencies  supported efforts to consolidate these lists. The State Department\u2019s Bureau  of Consular Affairs and the Justice Department\u2019s U.S. Marshals Service  agreed that some degree of watch list consolidation would be beneficial  and would improve information sharing.

To determine and implement the appropriate level of watch list  consolidation and standardization, we further recommend that this  collaborative effort include 1. updating the watch list information provided in this report, as needed,  and using this information to develop an architectural understanding of  our nation\u2019s current or \u201cas is\u201d watch list environment; 2. defining the requirements of our nation\u2019s target or \u201cto be\u201d watch list  architectural environment, including requirements that address any  agency-unique needs that can be justified, such as national security  issues and civil liberty protections; 3. basing the target architecture on achievement of the mission goals and  objectives contained in the President\u2019s homeland security strategy and  on congressional direction, as well as on opportunities to leverage state  and local government and private-sector information sources; 4. developing a near-term strategy for implementing the target  architecture that provides for the integration of existing watch lists, as  well as a longer-term strategy that provides for migrating to a more  consolidated and standardized set of watch lists; 5. ensuring that these strategies provide for defining and adopting more  standard policies and procedures for watch list sharing and addressing  any legal issues affecting, and cultural barriers to, greater watch list  sharing; and 6. developing and implementing the strategies within the context of the  ongoing enterprise architecture efforts of each of the collaborating  departments and agencies.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary report to Congress by  September 30, 2003, and every 6 months thereafter, on the status and  progress of these efforts, as well as on any legislative action needed to  accomplish them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments And Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft this report, three of the six departments provided  either written (Justice and State) or oral (DHS) comments. The remaining  three departments (Defense, Transportation, and Treasury) said that they  had reviewed the draft but had no comments. The Office of Homeland  Security was also provided with a draft but said that it would not comment.  The departments that provided comments generally agreed with our  findings and recommendations. They also (1) provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate in the report, and  (2) offered department-unique comments, which are summarized and  evaluated below.", "In his oral comments, DHS\u2019s Chief Information Officer stated that the  department now has responsibility for watch list consolidation.  Additionally, the Chief Information Officer generally described DHS\u2019s plans  for watch list consolidation and agreed that our recommendations were  consistent with the steps he described. In light of DHS\u2019s assumption of  responsibility for watch list consolidation, we have modified our  recommendations to direct them to the DHS Secretary.", "In its written comments, Justice stated that, in addition to cultural  differences, there are other reasons why agencies do not share watch list  information, such as national security and civil liberty requirements, and  that these requirements complicate the consolidation of watch list  information. Justice also stated that, while it agrees that there is a need to  establish a common watch list architecture to facilitate sharing, this need  should not impede short-term efforts to improve sharing. We agree with  Justice\u2019s first point, which is why our recommendations provide for  ensuring that all relevant requirements, which would include pertinent  national security and civil liberty protections, are taken into consideration  in developing our nation\u2019s watch list architectural environment. To make  this more explicit, we have modified our recommendations to specifically  recognize national security and civil liberty requirements. We also agree  with Justice\u2019s second point, and thus our recommendations also provide  for pursuing short-term, cost-effective initiatives to improve watch list  sharing while the architecture is being developed. (Justice\u2019s comments are  reprinted in app. II.)", "In its written comments, State said that our report makes a number of  valuable points concerning the benefits of watch list consolidation,  enterprise architecture, and information sharing. However, State also said  that our report (1) attributed watch list differences solely to varying agency  cultures, (2) seemed to advocate a \u201cone size fits all approach,\u201d and (3) often  makes the assumption that software and systems architecture differences  necessarily obstruct information sharing. With respect to State\u2019s first point,  our report states clearly that watch list differences are attributable not only  to varying cultural environments, but also to each agency\u2019s unique mission  needs and its legal and technical environments as well. Concerning State\u2019s  second point, our report does not advocate a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution.  Rather, our recommendation explicitly calls for DHS to lead a  governmentwide effort to, among other things, determine the appropriate  degree of watch list consolidation and standardization needed and to  consider in this effort the differences in agencies\u2019 missions and needs.  Regarding State\u2019s last point, our report does not state or assume that  differences in software and system architecture categorically obstruct or  preclude information sharing. Instead, we state that those differences  requiring additional measures\u2014such as building and maintaining unique  system interfaces or using manual workarounds\u2014introduce additional  costs and reduce efficiency and effectiveness.

To develop this instrument, we  reviewed, among other things, past GAO and other reports on watch lists  and on the border security process, along with relevant guidance on such  topics as systems interoperability, enterprise architecture management,  database management, and information sharing. We used this research to  develop a series of questions designed to obtain and aggregate information  necessary to answer our objectives. We then incorporated these questions  into the questionnaire (see app. IV for a copy of the questionnaire). We  pretested the questionnaire at two federal agencies, made adjustments  based on the pretest, and then transmitted it to the agencies cited above on  July 29, 2002. Responses from agencies were received from August 2002  through October 2002. We did not independently verify agency responses.  However, we did contact agency officials when necessary to clarify their  responses.", "Next, we compiled the agencies\u2019 responses to determine the number of  watch lists being used, confirm the universe of agencies that have lists, and  determine the number of organizations that use the lists and the kinds of  data the lists contain. We also analyzed the agencies\u2019 policies and  procedures governing watch list sharing. In addition, we reviewed the  survey responses to determine the degree of sharing among federal, state,  local, and private-sector entities, and we compared the extent of sharing  with the sharing goals contained in the President\u2019s homeland security  strategy and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Moreover, we aggregated  the agencies\u2019 descriptions of their watch list systems architectures and  analyzed them to identify similarities and differences. We also analyzed the  architectural components of the watch list systems and compared them  with the standards required for systems to interoperate and share data  efficiently and effectively. Finally, we analyzed the agencies\u2019 responses on  watch list consolidation, to identify whether there were opportunities for  consolidating watch lists and, if so, what the benefits were of doing so.", "Additionally, we reviewed the President\u2019s homeland security strategy,  homeland security legislation and agency budget requests, and other public  documents to identify federal government efforts related to maintaining  and sharing watch lists. We also attended conferences and other public  events at which Office of Homeland Security officials spoke on homeland  security enterprise architecture and watch list standardization and  consolidation efforts.
