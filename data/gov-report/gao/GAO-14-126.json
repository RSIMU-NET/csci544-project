This report discusses (1) how OMB, GSA, and selected agencies have considered small businesses in their strategic sourcing efforts and (2) the extent to which data and performance measures are available on the inclusion of small businesses in strategic sourcing initiatives. GAO reviewed guidance and documentation from OMB, GSA, and five other agencies selected based on factors such as dollars awarded to small businesses.

(Small disadvantaged businesses are those unconditionally owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.) OMB and GSA have developed guidance on strategic sourcing that stresses the importance of including small businesses. GAO's review of documentation for three ongoing government-wide strategic sourcing initiatives showed that GSA considered the inclusion of small businesses in the strategic sourcing process. For example, when developing strategic sourcing initiatives for office supplies and print management, GSA identified the current market share of small businesses with these products and also set aside specific contracts for various categories of small businesses, such as service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. In addition, GAO's review of agency-wide strategic sourcing initiatives at each of five agencies--Departments of Defense (DOD), specifically Army and the Defense Logistics Agency; Homeland Security (DHS); Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)--showed that the agencies generally considered the inclusion of small businesses.", "Data and performance measures that would provide a more precise understanding of the inclusion of small and disadvantaged businesses in strategic sourcing initiatives are limited. Although GSA has collected baseline data on proposed government-wide initiatives, it has not developed a performance measure to determine changes in small business participation going forward. Further, DHS has collected some data on contracts awarded to small businesses under strategic sourcing initiatives, but it and the other agencies in GAO's review generally did not have baseline data and performance measures to determine how small businesses were affected by strategic sourcing. OMB guidance requires agencies to establish baselines for small business participation prior to implementing strategic sourcing and set goals for small business participation. In addition, federal internal control standards state that information is needed to determine whether the agency is achieving its compliance requirements under various laws and regulations. Without baseline data and performance measures, the effect of strategic sourcing initiatives on small businesses will be difficult to determine. Moreover, OMB has not monitored agencies' compliance in reporting baseline data and performance measures on the inclusion of small businesses in government-wide and agency-wide strategic sourcing initiatives. OMB required agencies to submit annual reports on the implementation of strategic sourcing from fiscal years 2005 through 2007 and prepare information for acquisition status sessions from fiscal years 2010 through 2012. (No reporting was in place for fiscal years 2008 or 2009.) However, virtually none of this information included baseline data or measures of the effect of strategic sourcing on small businesses. Federal internal control standards state that effective monitoring should assess the quality of performance over time. Without effective monitoring, it will be difficult for OMB to help ensure that agencies are tracking the impact of strategic sourcing on small businesses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes recommendations to GSA, selected agencies, and OMB to improve data collection and performance measures related to the inclusion of small businesses in strategic sourcing.

Strategic sourcing is a process\u2014 sometimes led by a central procurement organization\u2014that moves an  organization away from numerous individual procurements for the same  or similar products or services toward a broader aggregate approach. The  benefits of strategic sourcing can include cost savings and less  duplication of effort. However, because strategic sourcing can reduce the  number of available contracting opportunities, some members of the  small business community are concerned that small businesses may be  negatively affected.", "Given these views, you requested that we review how strategic sourcing  has affected small businesses. This report discusses (1) the ways in  which OMB and the General Services Administration (GSA) have  considered small businesses in their strategic sourcing guidance and  GSA and selected agencies have considered small businesses in their  strategic sourcing initiatives and (2) the extent to which data and  performance measures are available on the inclusion of small businesses  in government-wide and selected agencies\u2019 internal strategic sourcing  initiatives.

We also reviewed documentation on three  government-wide strategic sourcing initiatives managed by GSA  (domestic delivery services, office supplies, and print management) to  determine steps taken to consider small businesses. At selected  agencies, we reviewed guidance on strategic sourcing and  documentation on a sample of specific initiatives to determine how small  businesses were considered in the strategic sourcing process. The  selected agencies included in our review were the Departments of  Defense (DOD), specifically the Department of the Army (Army) and the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA); Homeland Security (DHS); Housing and  Urban Development (HUD); and the Interior (Interior) and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We selected these  agencies to ensure a range of agencies based on the dollars they  awarded to small businesses in fiscal year 2012, the extent to which they  had adopted strategic sourcing, scores on the Small Business  Administration\u2019s (SBA) procurement scorecards in fiscal years 2010 and  2011, and membership in the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council.  Finally, we interviewed officials from OMB, GSA, SBA, and selected  agency procurement offices and Offices of Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization about the extent to which the agencies have  considered small businesses in the implementation of strategic sourcing.", "To evaluate the extent to which data and performance measures were  available on the inclusion of small businesses in government-wide and  selected agencies\u2019 internal strategic sourcing initiatives, we reviewed the  data elements in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  (FPDS-NG) to determine if there were data on strategic sourcing. In  addition, we analyzed GSA data as of 2013 on government-wide strategic  sourcing initiatives. We also determined whether GSA had taken steps to  track the effect of recently proposed strategic sourcing initiatives on small  businesses by reviewing relevant documentation on these initiatives. In  addition, we reviewed documentation at the selected agencies to identify  any data and performance measures that track the inclusion of small  businesses. This documentation included a strategic sourcing dashboard  from DHS that contained data on its initiatives from fiscal year 2005  through the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. We assessed the reliability of  data from FPDS-NG, GSA, and DHS by interviewing knowledgeable  officials, reviewing documents about the sources of the data, and  comparing selected data to other sources and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting government-wide and  agency strategic sourcing spending. We compared available data and  performance measures to OMB\u2019s guidance and federal internal control  standards.

Spend analysis provides knowledge about how much is  being spent for which products and services, who the buyers are, who the  suppliers are, and where the opportunities are for leveraged buying and  other tactics to save money and improve performance. Data on spending  are analyzed on a continual basis to support decisions on strategic  sourcing and procurement management in areas such as cutting costs  and streamlining operations. Based on this analysis, organizations  evaluate and prioritize commodities to create a list of top products or  services to target for strategic sourcing. This list typically includes the  products or services on which most of the organization\u2019s spending is  focused. In addition to spending, criteria such as potential savings and  relative ease of implementation are considered. Once a product or  service is selected for strategic sourcing, a general process is followed  that includes steps such as developing, implementing, and managing the  sourcing strategy for that product or service. A strategic sourcing initiative  can involve multiple contracts.", "Recognizing the benefits of strategic sourcing, OMB issued a  memorandum in 2005 that directed federal agencies to develop and  implement a strategic sourcing effort to help control spending. This  memorandum defined strategic sourcing as the \u201ccollaborative and  structured process of critically analyzing an organization\u2019s spending and  using this information to make business decisions about acquiring  commodities and services more effectively and efficiently.\u201d According to  the memorandum, the process helps agencies optimize performance,  minimize price, increase achievement of socioeconomic acquisition goals,  evaluate total life-cycle management costs, improve vendor access to  business opportunities, and otherwise increase the value of each dollar.  The memorandum also stated that any strategic sourcing plan must be  balanced with goals for small businesses. Finally, the memorandum  required agencies to identify at least three commodities that could be  strategically sourced and develop agency-wide strategic sourcing plans to  implement their strategic sourcing programs.", "In subsequent memorandums, OMB offered further guidance on  implementing strategic sourcing. Most recently, in December 2012 OMB  issued a memorandum reiterating the importance of strategic sourcing  and emphasizing that to the extent practicable, all strategic sourcing  opportunities should seek to increase participation by small businesses.  In addition, the guidance created a new Strategic Sourcing Leadership  Council consisting of the seven largest procurement agencies and SBA.The council was charged with leading the government\u2019s efforts to  increase the use of strategic sourcing. OMB\u2019s guidance related to  strategic sourcing and small businesses is discussed in greater detail in  the next section of this report.", "In addition to individual agency efforts, a government-wide strategic  sourcing program known as the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative  (FSSI) was established in 2005 as a direct result of the OMB  memorandum.

The Office  of Federal Procurement Policy\u2014the office within OMB assigned to  oversee the FSSI program\u2014is ultimately responsible for providing  oversight and guidance, as well as ensuring the overall effectiveness of  FSSI. In addition, there is an FSSI Program Management Office located  within GSA. The mission of the FSSI program is to encourage agencies to  aggregate contract requirements, streamline processes, and coordinate  purchases of like products and services to leverage spending to the  maximum extent possible. Four government-wide initiatives had been  implemented as of fiscal year 2012: office supplies, print management,  telecommunications expense management services, and domestic  delivery services.

Officials at most of these agencies told us  that they generally limit their tracking of strategic sourcing initiatives to  what OMB specifically requested for the acquisition status sessions.  Officials at two agencies also cited the fact that their total small business  spending had increased since they started implementing strategic  sourcing as an indication that small businesses had not been negatively  impacted. However, the OMB memorandums require baseline data and a  measure of the change in small business spending for each individual  initiative. The absence of such data and measures makes it difficult to  determine the effect of strategic sourcing initiatives on small businesses.", "In addition, although OMB\u2019s memorandums state that agencies should  report baseline data and performance measures on the inclusion of small  businesses in strategic sourcing, OMB has not monitored agencies\u2019  compliance in reporting baseline data and performance measures.

As recently as  December 2012, OMB reiterated the importance of strategic sourcing and  stated that agencies should seek to increase participation by small  businesses. In addition, OMB guidance states that agencies must  develop the baseline data and performance measures necessary to  determine how strategic sourcing initiatives have affected small  businesses. Despite this guidance and federal internal control standards  stating that information is necessary to determine whether agencies are in  compliance with requirements under various laws and regulations, the  agencies in our review generally did not have baseline data and  performance measures to determine how small businesses had been  affected by strategic sourcing. GSA had collected baseline data on  proposed government-wide initiatives, but had not developed a  performance measure to track the change in small business participation  going forward. DHS had collected some data on contracts awarded to  small businesses under strategic sourcing initiatives, but it and the other  agencies in our review generally did not have baseline data and  performance measures to determine how small businesses were affected  by strategic sourcing. Without such data and measures, it is difficult to  determine the effect of strategic sourcing initiatives on small businesses.  Moreover, OMB has not monitored agencies\u2019 compliance with its  requirements to report baseline data and performance measures on the  inclusion of small businesses. Without effective monitoring, it will be  difficult for OMB to help ensure that agencies are tracking the impact of  strategic sourcing on small businesses.

The agencies\u2019 specific comments and our  responses are summarized below.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation to collect baseline data and  establish performance measures on the inclusion of small businesses  in strategic sourcing initiatives and acknowledged the lack of complete  baseline data on strategic sourcing initiatives and small business  utilization. The agency also mentioned examples of strategic sourcing  initiatives that have included 100 percent set-asides for small  businesses. To address our recommendation, DOD stated that  strategic sourcing teams will be required to begin building baseline  data for future initiatives to provide metrics on small business  participation. In one of its technical comments, DLA disagreed with  our statement that it could not provide data on small business  spending through its strategic sourcing initiatives, noting that it had  provided data on total small business spending over time. However,  as we noted in the report, the OMB memorandums require baseline  data and a measure of the change in small business spending for  each individual initiative. Therefore, we made no change to the report.", "DHS agreed with our recommendation to collect baseline data and  establish performance measures on the inclusion of small businesses  in strategic sourcing initiatives and stated that in addition to its current  collection of small business spend data and analysis performed on  strategic sourcing initiatives, the agency plans to review how it  collects baseline data and establishes performance measures and  intends to make changes to more clearly meet OMB\u2019s requirements.  DHS stated that it intends to complete this effort by March 31, 2014.  DHS also stated many of its strategic sourcing vehicles are set-aside  100 percent for small business or include substantial small business  tracks. As we noted in the report, from fiscal year 2005 through the  first quarter of fiscal year 2013, DHS implemented 72 strategic  sourcing initiatives, and 43 percent of the spending went to small  businesses.", "HUD agreed with our recommendation to collect baseline data and  establish performance measures on the inclusion of small businesses  in strategic sourcing initiatives and issued guidance on December 17,  2013, to document the process for collecting baseline data and  establishing metrics on small business participation in strategic  sourcing initiatives going forward. Implementing and following through  on this guidance should help in tracking the effects of HUD\u2019s strategic  sourcing initiatives on small businesses.", "GSA agreed with our findings and recommendation to establish  performance measures on the inclusion of small businesses in  strategic sourcing initiatives and commented that it would coordinate  internally to collect small business participation metrics against  baseline data for its government-wide strategic sourcing initiatives and  provide the results to OMB in order for OMB to monitor compliance  with its requirements.", "In an e-mail received on December 24, 2013, OMB staff stated that  OMB agreed with the recommendation to monitor agencies\u2019  compliance with the requirement to maintain baseline data and  performance measures on small business participation in strategic  sourcing initiatives.", "In an e-mail received on December 18, 2013, the audit liaison for the  Department of the Interior stated that Interior partially agreed with the   recommendation to collect baseline data and establish performance  measures on the inclusion of small businesses in strategic sourcing  initiatives. The agency acknowledged it does not currently collect data  that specifically track the impact of strategic sourcing on small  businesses and agreed with the need for effective planning and  monitoring of strategic sourcing initiatives, including establishing  performance measures and small business goals. Interior suggested  that a more effective approach would be to work with OMB and other  agencies similar to Interior to develop common approaches for  collecting baseline data and setting performance measures. We  believe such action would be consistent with the intent of the  recommendation.", "NASA disagreed with our recommendation to collect baseline data  and establish performance measures on the inclusion of small  businesses in strategic sourcing initiatives and stated it already tracks  small business spending for the entire agency. In addition, NASA  cited specific regulations that it follows in the Federal Acquisition  Regulation that are related to small business and stated that its  acquisition process allows for all contracting, including strategic  sourcing, to set small business goals. However, as we noted in the  report, the OMB memorandums require baseline data and a measure  of the change in small business spending for each individual initiative.  In addition, we concluded that such tracking will be increasingly  important as the use of strategic sourcing grows.

We  selected these agencies to ensure a range of agencies in terms of dollars  they awarded to small businesses in fiscal year 2012, the extent to which  they have adopted strategic sourcing, scores on the Small Business  Administration\u2019s (SBA) procurement scorecards in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and membership in the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council.Finally, we interviewed OMB, GSA, SBA, and selected agency officials  from procurement offices and Offices of Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization about the extent to which the agencies have  considered small businesses in the implementation of strategic sourcing.", "To evaluate the extent to which data and performance measures were  available on the inclusion of small businesses in government-wide and  selected agencies\u2019 internal strategic sourcing initiatives, we reviewed the  data elements in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  (FPDS-NG) to determine if there were data on strategic sourcing. In  addition, we analyzed GSA data as of 2013 on government-wide strategic  sourcing initiatives. We also determined whether GSA had taken steps to  track the effect of recently proposed strategic sourcing initiatives on small  businesses by reviewing relevant documentation on these initiatives. In  addition, we reviewed available documentation at the selected agencies,  including strategic sourcing reports provided to OMB and information  prepared for OMB\u2019s acquisition status sessions, to identify any data and  performance measures that track the inclusion of small businesses.
