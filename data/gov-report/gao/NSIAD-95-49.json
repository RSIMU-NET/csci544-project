Since the courts view due process as a concept that should be flexibly applied to fit the needs of a particular context, a body of case law has developed regarding the applicability of procedural due process protections to specific subgroups and particular settings. Due process protections are greater in criminal proceedings than in non-criminal proceedings (such as administrative hearings).", "Courts have established that students facing expulsion from tax-supported colleges and universities have constitutionally protected interests that require minimal due process protections and established standards for student disciplinary proceedings. While these standards and guidelines have been used in devising due process requirements for academy adjudicatory proceedings, courts have ruled that the government\u2019s interest in assuring the fitness of future military officers permits the academies greater freedom in providing due process protections than is accorded civilian institutions or authorities.", "We believe the due process protections and limitations applicable to academy adjudicatory proceedings can be best understood by comparing them with the broadest range of due process protections available in civilian proceedings. In reviewing judicial and administrative proceedings, we identified 12 categories of due process protections commonly used to ensure fairness in hearings.

One critic has stated that since the large-scale cheating scandals were not discovered until they had encompassed a fairly large number of students, the clause may not be that effective. Some have also suggested that the non-toleration clause could actually contribute to large-scale cheating scandals because students could be deterred from turning in their peers for fear that those whom they turn in could retaliate by reporting them for past violations of the code.

In some cases, a given act (such as taking a joyride in a government vehicle) was considered by academy officials to be a conduct violation rather than an honor offense. Other differences were the result of specific academy policies. For example, the Military Academy has a policy that instructors not give the same exam to different class sessions, which makes it permissible to ask a friend what was on the exam.", "Figure 3.4 shows the percentage of students at each academy who indicated that a specific scenario was either definitely or probably an honor violation.

For example, while a cadet/midshipman who is below the legal drinking age and who orders an alcoholic beverage could be seen by some as falsely implying that he/she is entitled to be served, as long as the individual did not verbally claim to be of age or present a false identification, many respondents saw no honor violation.", "Many academy students (from 23 percent at the Naval Academy to over 40 percent at the other two academies) saw toleration of an honor offense as much less serious than other offenses (see fig. 3.6).

As such, they are essentially similar to nonjudicial disciplinary proceedings for military personnel authorized under UCMJ Article 15. Military law provides for nonjudicial punishment as a means of imposing prompt punishment for minor violations and to correct, educate, and reform offenders in an efficient manner without subjecting them to the stigma that a court-martial would entail. A nonjudicial disciplinary proceeding is not a trial, and a determination of guilt does not constitute a court conviction.", "Despite the similarities between the objectives of the academy administrative adjudicatory systems and DOD-wide and service objectives regarding nonjudicial disciplinary proceedings, there are several key inconsistencies between the rights given service personnel and the rights accorded academy students under the administrative conduct and honor systems. The inconsistencies, with academy students having less protection, involve the right to be represented by counsel; the right to remain silent; the right to an independent appeal; the maximum length of the punishment of \u201crestriction;\u201d and, in the case of the Military and Air Force academies, the standard of proof used to determine guilt.", "One major difference between the academy administrative adjudicatory systems and DOD nonjudicial punishment policy involves the right to have counsel appear with the accused and present the case for the accused. The Manual for Courts-Martial states that before nonjudicial punishment may be imposed, the accused servicemember is entitled to appear personally before the administrative authority imposing the nonjudicial punishment. If the accused requests such a personal appearance, he/she is entitled to be accompanied by a spokesperson, who may be a lawyer. This spokesperson may speak for the accused, but may not necessarily question witnesses except as the nonjudicial punishment authority may allow as a matter of discretion. The presence of a lawyer as the personal representative does not make a nonjudicial hearing a formal adversary proceeding; it only gives the accused someone to advise and to speak up for him/her. At the academies, the accused is not entitled to be represented by a spokesperson or lawyer at any administrative conduct or honor hearing.", "A second difference concerns the right to remain silent. Rule 301 of the Manual for Courts-Martial makes UCMJ, Article 31 (the right to avoid self-incrimination) expressly applicable to nonjudicial punishment. Under the academy administrative conduct systems, students must answer a question that incriminates them, except when they are being charged under UCMJ.", "A third difference involves the right to an independent appeal. Under article 15, a servicemember who considers the punishment to be unjust or disproportionate to the offense may appeal to the next superior authority. When punishment has been imposed under delegation of a commander\u2019s authority to administer nonjudicial punishment, the appeal must be directed to someone other than the commander who delegated the authority. Since the administrative adjudicatory systems are a delegation of authority from the Superintendent, under the academy adjudicatory systems, only a decision to separate a student with the required review by the service secretary would appear to meet this definition of appeal.", "A fourth difference involves maximum punishments. UCMJ imposes limitations on article 15 punishments. One of those limitations involves the punishment of \u201crestriction.\u201d The maximum restriction allowed by UCMJ for nonjudicial punishment is 60 days, and then only if the punishment is imposed by an officer with general court-martial jurisdiction or a flag rank officer. At each academy, we found that restriction periods of longer than 60 days have been imposed on students under the administrative conduct systems.", "The last difference involves standard of proof. For Naval Academy midshipmen, the standard of proof for administrative conduct hearings is the same at the Academy as it is for nonjudicial punishment in the fleet, \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d However, the standard of proof used in Military and Air Force Academy administrative conduct hearings (preponderance of the evidence) is lower than that used for nonjudicial punishment in the active Army and Air Force. The Army has been using the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for its nonjudicial punishment cases since 1973. Similarly, Air Force Instruction 51-202, paragraph 3.3, states that the commander must consider whether proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d would be obtainable before initiating action under article 15; if not, it states that action under article 15 is generally not warranted.", "In its official comments, DOD stated that it saw no clear basis for concluding that protections provided under the administrative conduct systems must parallel nonjudicial disciplinary proceedings. DOD stated that a nonjudicial disciplinary proceeding is a quasi-judicial process established under the UCMJ and the rights that accrue to an offender under the UCMJ are quite specific. Disposition under the academy administrative honor and disciplinary systems, according to DOD are not subject to the same criteria. However, a defense attorney stated that he questions whether the academies have the authority to substitute an administrative disciplinary system that provides less protection for offenders in lieu of legislatively mandated disciplinary system that has the same objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cadet/Midshipman Perceptions and Attitudes Concerning the Conduct System", "paragraphs": ["We asked questions on our survey pertaining to the conduct rules and disciplinary systems at the academies.
