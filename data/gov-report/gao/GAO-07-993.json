GAO's report objectives are to (1) compare LSC's framework for corporate governance and accountability to others', (2) evaluate LSC's governance practices, and (3) evaluate LSC's internal control and financial reporting practices. We reviewed the LSC Act, legislative history, relevant standards and requirements, and LSC documentation and accountability requirements and interviewed board and staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although LSC has stronger federal accountability requirements than many nonprofit corporations, it is subject to governance and accountability requirements that are weaker than those of independent federal agencies and U.S. government corporations. Congress issued LSC's federal charter over 30 years ago. Established with governance and accountability requirements as they existed at the time, LSC has not kept up with evolving reforms aimed at strengthening internal control over an organization's financial reporting process and systems. Rigorous controls are important for the heavily federally funded LSC. During fiscal year 2007, LSC is responsible for the safeguarding and stewardship of $348.6 million of taxpayer dollars. Although no single set of practices exists for both private and public entities, current accepted practices of federal agencies, government corporations, and nonprofit corporations offer models for strengthening LSC's governance and accountability, including effective board oversight of management; its performance; and its use of federal funds and resources. The board members demonstrated active involvement in LSC through their regular board meeting attendance and participation in LSC oversight. Although LSC's Board of Directors was established with provisions in law that may have supported effective operation over 30 years ago, its practices fall short of modern board practices. The LSC board generally provides each new member an informal orientation to LSC and the board, but it does not have consistent, formal orientation and ongoing training with updates on new developments in governance and accountability standards and practice. The current board has four committees, but none are specifically targeted at providing critical audit, ethics, or compensation functions, which are important governance mechanisms commonly used in corporate governance structures. Because it has not taken advantage of opportunities to incorporate such practices, LSC's Board of Directors is at risk of not being able to fulfill its role of effective governance and oversight. A properly implemented governance and accountability structure may have prevented recent incidents of compensation rates in excess of statutory caps, questionable expenditures, and potential conflicts of interest. LSC also has not kept up with current management practices. Of particular importance are key processes in risk assessment, internal control, and financial reporting. Management has not formally assessed the risks to the safeguarding of its assets and maintaining the effectiveness and efficiency of its operation, nor has it implemented internal controls or other risk mitigation policies. LSC is also at increased risk that conflicts of interest will occur and not be identified because senior management has not established comprehensive policies or procedures regarding ethical issues that are aimed at identifying potential conflicts and taking appropriate actions to prevent them. Finally, management has not performed its own assessment or analysis of accounting standards to determine the most appropriate standards for LSC to follow."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Legal Services Corporation\u2019s (LSC) mission is to make federal funding  available to support the provision of legal assistance in civil matters to  low-income people throughout the United States on everyday legal  problems. LSC pursues this mission by making grants to legal service  providers (grant recipients) who serve low-income members of the  community who would otherwise not be able to afford legal assistance  (clients). Established by a federal charter in 1974 as a federally funded,  private nonprofit corporation, LSC is highly dependent on federal  appropriations for its operations. LSC received $348.6 million in  appropriations for fiscal year 2007. For fiscal year 2006, LSC received 99  percent of its funding from federal appropriations and approximately 1  percent from grants through the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "This report responds to your request that we review how LSC\u2019s Board of  Directors has been carrying out its fiduciary duties in overseeing LSC\u2019s  operations and use of appropriated funds and whether LSC has sufficient  governance and accountability structures and practices in place. The  specific objectives of this report are to (1) compare LSC\u2019s statutory  framework for corporate governance and accountability to those of other  organizations; (2) evaluate the governance practices that LSC has adopted,  including the board\u2019s operations and responsibilities; and (3) evaluate  LSC\u2019s internal control and financial reporting practices in comparison to  current practices of other organizations.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed information from a variety of  sources, including the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (LSC Act)  and LSC annual appropriations acts; the LSC Act\u2019s legislative history,  relevant legislative and regulatory standards and requirements for  financial reporting and internal control, and research and studies on  corporate governance.  We compared LSC\u2019s governance, accountability,  and oversight requirements with those for independent federal agencies  headed by a board or commission, U.S. government corporations, and  D.C. nonprofit corporations, including the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting (CPB), which, like LSC, was established by Congress and  receives federal appropriations. To obtain information on the current  policies and practices of LSC and its Board of Directors, we interviewed  current members of LSC\u2019s board, management, and staff, and staff in LSC\u2019s  Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the audit firm the OIG employs.  We also reviewed relevant documentation of the design and  implementation of LSC\u2019s and the LSC board\u2019s governance and  accountability practices and conducted a survey of all board members.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., from November 2006  through June 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["LSC is a private, nonprofit corporation that is federally funded for the  purpose of making federal resources available to support local providers  of civil legal services for low-income people, with the goal of providing  equal access to the justice system \u201cfor individuals who seek redress of  grievances\u201d and \u201cwho would be otherwise unable to afford adequate legal  counsel.\u201d Since LSC was federally chartered by statute over three decades  ago in the LSC Act, Congress has been making annual appropriations to  LSC to provide grants to eligible legal service providers to carry out the  purposes of the LSC Act\u2019s requirement \u201cto provide the most economical  and effective delivery of legal assistance.\u201d Since 1996, LSC has been  required to select its grant recipients through a competitive award  process. Today, LSC funds grant recipients in all 50 states, as well as the  District of Columbia and all five U.S. territories. In fiscal year 2006, LSC  reported distributing a total of $313.9 million in grants.", "Local legal service providers employ staff attorneys to assist eligible  clients in resolving their civil legal problems, often through advice and  referral. According to LSC, in a typical year the largest portion of total  cases (38 percent) concern family matters, followed by housing issues (24  percent), income maintenance (13 percent), and consumer finance (12  percent). LSC reported that most cases are resolved out of court. In 2007,  LSC reported that three out of four clients were women, most of them  mothers. Most clients were at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty  threshold, currently an income of approximately $25,000 a year for a  family of four. The type of legal assistance that LSC funding supports is  subject to certain legal restrictions. By law, for example, LSC cannot  provide funds for legal services for a proceeding related to a violation of  the Military Selective Service Act or participation in litigation related to  abortion or a criminal proceeding.", "In 1974, Congress enacted the LSC Act to transfer the functions of the  Legal Services Program from the Executive Office of the President into a  private corporation. Through the LSC Act, Congress chartered LSC in the  District of Columbia as a private, nonmembership, nonprofit corporation  that would not be considered a department, agency, or instrumentality of  the federal government. Under its federal charter (the LSC Act), LSC may  only pursue activities consistent with the corporate purpose of \u201cproviding  financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or  matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance.\u201d", "To direct the corporation, the LSC Act provides for a bipartisan Board of  Directors consisting of 11 voting members who are appointed by the  President of the United States with the advice and consent of the U.S.  Senate. Neither the President nor the Senate has the power to remove a  director. A director can only be removed for cause, such as a persistent  neglect of duties, by a vote of at least 7 directors. Although the LSC Act  does not require board members to possess management or financial  expertise, it does include some membership requirements: no director may  be a full-time U.S. government employee, a majority of the directors must  be attorneys belonging to the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state, and at  least one director must be from the legal service client community. The  LSC Act requires the board to meet at least four times each calendar year  and prohibits board members from participating in any decision, action, or  recommendation related to a matter that directly benefits the board  member or pertains specifically to any entity with which the board  member has been associated in the past 2 years. The LSC Act prohibits  LSC personnel and grant recipients from engaging in certain prohibited  activities, such as legal assistance related to a criminal proceeding or  participation in litigation related to an abortion, and the LSC Board of  Directors, which is charged with managing the affairs of the corporation,  is responsible for ensuring compliance with these restrictions.", "The LSC Act requires the Board of Directors to appoint the LSC President  and any other necessary officers, and provides that the LSC President  may appoint any employees necessary to carry out LSC\u2019s purposes. LSC  officers and employees can be fairly easily appointed and removed,  creating essentially at-will employment relationships. In addition to the  power to appoint and remove LSC employees and to serve as an ex- officio, nonvoting member of the Board of Directors, the LSC President,  who is the only officer specifically provided for in the LSC Act, is  authorized to make grants and enter into contracts that bind LSC.", "As a D.C. nonprofit corporation, LSC generally possesses all the powers  conferred on such corporations under the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act,  which includes a number of general corporate powers, such as the power  to sue and be sued in its corporate name, exercise a number of rights  related to real and personal property, enter into contracts, and borrow  money and issue debt obligations. Other corporate powers include  investing and lending money, appointing officers and agents and defining  their duties and fixing their compensation, making bylaws to administer  and regulate corporate affairs, and \u201chav and exercis all powers  necessary or convenient to effect any or all of the purposes for which the  corporation is organized.\u201d LSC\u2019s exercise of such corporate powers,  however, is restricted where inconsistent with the LSC Act. For example,  the LSC board\u2019s discretion in fixing its officers\u2019 and employees\u2019  compensation is limited by an LSC Act provision prohibiting LSC from  compensating its personnel at rates in excess of the rate of level V of the  Executive Schedule.", "Unlike most D.C. nonprofit corporations, LSC\u2019s exercise of its corporate  powers has received additional oversight since 1988 when Congress  subjected LSC to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act).", "As an independent office within LSC, the LSC OIG is authorized to carry  out audits and investigations of LSC programs and operations, recommend  policies to improve program administration and operations, and keep the  LSC board and Congress fully and currently informed about problems in  program administration and operations and the need for and progress of  corrective action. Also, unlike most D.C. nonprofit corporations, LSC is  subject to congressional oversight through the annual appropriations  process as well as responding to congressional inquiries and participating  in hearings. In its annual appropriation for LSC, Congress regularly  appropriates a specific amount for the OIG. For example, Congress  appropriated about $2.54 million for the LSC OIG in fiscal years 2006 and  2007. Because in fiscal year 2007 LSC received an increase in its annual  appropriation of about $17.78 million that was not allocated for a specific  purpose, LSC officials told us that LSC, consistent with congressional  guidance, used $430,000 of this amount to increase funding for the OIG  from about $2.54 million in fiscal year 2006 to $2.97 million in fiscal year  2007. (See fig. 1.)", "It has been three decades since LSC was last comprehensively reviewed  and reauthorized in the Legal Services Corporation Amendments Act of  1977, and LSC\u2019s statutory framework has undergone only limited changes  since then. Today LSC is governed by the powers and restrictions in its  federal charter (the LSC Act) and, where not inconsistent, the D.C.  Nonprofit Corporation Act, as well as the IG Act, the federal tax law  requirements for tax-exempt status for nonprofit corporations, and LSC\u2019s  annual appropriations acts, which since 1996 have included a number of  administrative provisions imposing additional grants management duties.", "Unlike most private, nonprofit corporations, the vast majority of LSC\u2019s  funding comes from annual federal appropriations, which originally were  authorized under the LSC Act. The LSC Act specifies that the appropriated  funds authorized under the act are available until expended and shall be  paid to LSC in one annual installment at the start of the fiscal year.  Although annual appropriations for LSC have not been authorized since  fiscal year 1980 under the LSC Act, Congress has continually enacted  annual appropriations to be paid to LSC to carry out the purposes of the  LSC Act. For fiscal year 2007, Congress appropriated almost $349 million  for LSC. The LSC Act permits LSC to receive and retain nonfederal funds,  but LSC\u2019s recent audited financial statements show that for fiscal years  1991 through 2006, approximately 99 percent of LSC\u2019s revenues came from  federal appropriations. In addition to direct funding through annual  appropriations, the LSC Act makes certain indirect federal support  available to LSC by providing that the President of the United States may  make support functions of the federal government available to LSC.", "For both governmental and nonprofit entities, governance can be  described as the process of providing leadership, direction, and  accountability in fulfilling the organization\u2019s mission, meeting objectives,  and providing stewardship of public resources, while establishing clear  lines of responsibility for results. Accountability represents the processes,  mechanisms, and other means\u2014including financial reporting and internal  controls\u2014by which an entity\u2019s management carries out its stewardship  and responsibility for resources and performance. To provide  accountability to Congress, the LSC Act provides for Senate advice and  consent on the selection of board members, annual appropriations that  constitute virtually all of LSC\u2019s annual revenues, and treatment of LSC as a  federal entity in limited situations either by directly subjecting LSC to  certain federal laws or indirectly by modeling provisions in the LSC Act  after provisions in laws existing in the 1970s.  For example, the LSC Act  makes LSC subject to provisions in the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) and the Government in the Sunshine Act, compensation limits  imposed on officers and employees at level V of the Executive Schedule,  and employer contribution requirements for participation in certain  employee benefits programs, as well as requiring LSC to engage in notice- and-comment rule making and to provide us with access to its records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LSC Is Subject to Weaker Governance and Accountability Requirements Than Federal Entities but More Federal Oversight Than Nonprofit Corporations", "paragraphs": ["Although LSC is subject to more statutory governance and accountability  requirements than most private, nonprofit corporations, it is subject to  governance and accountability requirements that are weaker than those of  most independent federal agencies headed by boards or commissions and  U.S. government corporations. In chartering a private, nonprofit  corporation to perform a public assistance role with federal funding,  Congress in the 1970s included certain provisions in the LSC Act to  provide for governance and accountability. The LSC Act includes  provisions providing that LSC shall be treated like a federal agency for  purposes of specified statutes that existed in the 1970s when the LSC Act  was first enacted and amended. In 1988, Congress created an OIG within  LSC. Therefore, LSC is subject to some governance and accountability  requirements that are comparable to those of federal entities, including the  presence of an OIG in the governance structure and submission of its  budget for the congressional appropriations process. Nonprofit  corporations typically are subject to limited federal requirements related  to governance and accountability; however, as discussed later, nonprofit  corporations have voluntarily chosen to incorporate many practices in  these areas.  In other respects, LSC is not subject to standard governance  and accountability requirements for federal entities including provisions  related to performance and financial reporting, internal controls, and  funds control.

For  example, the President appoints and the Senate confirms the members of  the boards of directors for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) (both U.S.  government corporations), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and  the Federal Housing Finance Board (both independent federal agencies),  as well as the commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) (both independent  federal agencies).", "The directors of LSC may only be removed for cause by a vote of seven  other directors. This level of statutory removal protection is unique in two  ways. First, it restricts the reasons for removal to only those listed in the  statute, and second, it precludes removal by the President of the United  States or Congress. In many cases, the board or commission members of a  federal entity have less tenure protection and serve at the will of the  President of the United States, such as the PBGC directors, who are the  Secretaries of Labor, the Treasury, and Commerce. Nonprofit corporations  incorporated in the District of Columbia are required to be managed by a  board of directors, consisting of at least three directors, who serve for the  terms specified in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. A director of a  D.C. nonprofit corporation may be removed by any procedure provided in  the articles of incorporation or bylaws. If not so provided, then removal  with or without cause is permitted upon a vote that would suffice for the  election of a director for the organization.", "No federal law specifically requires the board of directors of a U.S.  government corporation or a board of directors or commission of an  independent federal agency to designate audit or other committees, but  neither does any law prohibit the establishment of such committees. The  D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act expressly authorizes, but does not require,  boards of nonprofit corporations to designate and delegate authority to  committees. In certain instances, the statutes establishing federal entities  may authorize the designation and delegation of authority to committees,  such as the statute governing NSF (an independent federal agency).", "Since 1977, there has been only one governmentwide management law  that specifically included LSC as a covered entity and thus required a  change to LSC\u2019s governance structure. In 1988, Congress amended the IG  Act to add OIGs to additional entities receiving significant federal  funding, including \u201cdesignated federal entities\u201d (DFE), which are  statutorily defined. LSC was listed as a DFE, along with such other  entities as PBGC, SEC, and Amtrak, which are, respectively, a wholly  owned U.S. government corporation, an independent federal agency, and a  federally established private, for-profit corporation that receives some  federal funding. The only other private, nonprofit corporation included as  a DFE was CPB. Like the other OIGs of DFEs that are independent federal  agencies and U.S. government corporations, the LSC OIG was created as  an \u201cindependent and objective\u201d office to carry out audits and  investigations of LSC programs and operations, recommend policies to  improve program administration and operations, and keep the LSC board  and Congress fully and currently informed about problems in program  administration and operations and the need for and progress of corrective  action. In its annual appropriation for LSC, Congress regularly  appropriates a specific amount for the OIG. For example, Congress  appropriated about $2.54 million for the LSC OIG in fiscal years 2006 and  2007. Because in fiscal year 2007 LSC received an increase in its annual  appropriation of about $17.78 million that was not allocated for a specific  purpose, LSC officials told us that LSC, consistent with congressional  guidance, used $430,000 of this amount to increase funding for the OIG  from about $2.54 million in fiscal year 2006 to $2.97 million in fiscal year  2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funds Control and Budgeting", "paragraphs": ["Like other private, D.C. nonprofit corporations, LSC is not subject to  federal funds control laws that generally apply to independent federal  agencies and many U.S. government corporations, including the  Antideficiency Act, the Purpose Statute, and laws governing liability of  accountable officers for improper or illegal uses of funds; however, LSC is  required to submit an annual budget request to Congress. (See table 2.)", "Like many independent federal agencies and wholly owned government  corporations, most of LSC\u2019s annual revenues come from federal funds  made available through annual appropriations; however, LSC is not  required by law to control its use of those funds as are independent federal  agencies and wholly owned U.S. government corporations. The  Antideficiency Act, among other things, prohibits officers and employees  of the government from obligating or expending funds in advance of or in  excess of appropriations. This applies to the officers and employees of  independent federal agencies and wholly owned U.S. government  corporations, where personnel are officers and employees of the  government.   The Purpose Statute requires federal agencies and all U.S.  government corporations, both mixed ownership and wholly owned, to  use appropriated funds only for the purposes provided in law. Further,  for most federal agencies and some wholly owned U.S. government  corporations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Federal  Prisons Industries Incorporated, accountable officers are financially  liable for improper or illegal payments. None of these funds control  statutes apply to LSC or, in general, other nonprofit corporations that  receive federal funds. The LSC Act does contain a number of provisions  that restrict the use of LSC\u2019s appropriated funds for certain purposes, such  as an activity that would influence the passage or defeat of any legislation  at the local, state, or federal level or that would support any political party  or campaign of any candidate for public office.", "Unlike D.C. nonprofit corporations in general, and like independent  federal agencies and wholly owned U.S. government corporations, each  year LSC must prepare a new budget request as part of the annual  appropriations process. The LSC Act requires LSC to submit a budget  request to Congress, but provides no requirements related to the form and  content of the budget request. For federal agencies and wholly owned U.S.  government corporations, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  prescribes the form and content of budget requests, consistent with  specified statutory requirements, that are submitted through the President  to Congress. Under the LSC Act, LSC submits that budget request directly  to Congress, with OMB\u2019s role limited to submitting comments to Congress  if it chooses to review LSC\u2019s budget. As a federally chartered, private  nonprofit D.C. corporation, CPB also must annually prepare a budget  request as part of the annual appropriations process. Unlike LSC, however,  CPB requests and receives funding for 2 years (i.e., funding for fiscal 2008  was provided in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations act.) Once the level of  the annual appropriations act is enacted, CPB\u2019s appropriation is paid into  the Public Broadcasting Fund, which is a fund established in the Treasury  and administered by the Secretary of the Treasury.

By contrast,  independent federal agencies and U.S. government corporations are  subject to more detailed financial and performance planning and reporting  requirements. When the LSC Act was enacted in the 1970s, audited  financial statements were not prepared for federal agencies and LSC as a  private, nonprofit corporation was not subject to the financial audit  requirements imposed on public companies and U.S. government  corporations. The LSC Act requires LSC to have its accounts audited by an  independent public accountant annually in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The LSC Act does not detail what  must be included in the report or which accounting standards to use.

Most D.C. nonprofit corporations are only required to keep  correct and complete books and records of account and minutes of the  proceedings of their boards of directors. This information is not required  to be published or made available for public inspection. Similar to LSC,  CPB is required to annually have its accounts audited by an independent  public accountant in accordance with GAAS.

Like most D.C.  nonprofit corporations, LSC is not required to submit a similar annual  report on its operations and activities to the President or Congress.", "Independent federal agencies and U.S. government corporations have  stronger financial and performance reporting requirements than LSC. The  Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), as amended by the  Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA), requires the major  24 agencies of the federal government, including some independent  federal agencies such as NSF and NRC, to submit annual audited financial  statements to OMB and Congress. These financial statements must be  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and  audited in accordance with applicable generally accepted government  auditing standards (GAGAS). The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of  2002 (ATDA) expanded this requirement to include most other federal  executive agencies. U.S. government corporations had been subject to  financial reporting requirements for many years under the Government  Corporation Control Act.

According to LSC\u2019s current COOP  description provided by LSC, OIT would need to relocate its systems to a  remote location should the LSC building not be accessible. Also, from this  description, it appears that system hardware first needs to be retrieved  from the LSC building and then transported and installed in another  location. However, there is no specific implementation plan or remote  location specified in the plan. LSC provided us with meeting agendas from  May 2006 and June 2006 regarding emergency responses, but did not  provide any additional COOP program information. Furthermore, there is  no indication that OIT conducted any simulations of disruptions to test its  established plans. An organization that does not have a tested,  comprehensive COOP is vulnerable to unexpected incidents capable of  causing great damage.

Public companies  now operate under strengthened governance and accountability standards,  including requirements for ethics policies and improved internal controls.  The federal government and nonprofit sectors have followed this lead and  established new standards and requirements for improved internal control  reporting and governance and accountability. For nonprofit corporations  using funding from taxpayers and donors, effective governance,  accountability, and internal control are key to maintaining trust and  credibility. Governance and accountability breakdowns result in a lack of  trust from donors, grantors, and appropriators, which could ultimately put  funding and the organization\u2019s credibility at risk.", "Since its inception over 30 years ago, LSC\u2019s governance and accountability  requirements, including its financial reporting and internal control, have  not changed significantly.

The current accepted practices of federal agencies, U.S. government  corporations, and nonprofit corporations provide a framework for  identifying standards that can most effectively be used for strengthening  LSC\u2019s governance and accountability. Effectively utilized, current,  accepted governance and accountability practices are necessary to  provide strong board oversight and effective day-to-day management of  LSC\u2019s performance.

Johnson  declared poverty to be a national problem and initiated a \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d  to make federal resources available to support local antipoverty programs,  such as the legal assistance provided by legal aid societies. The first War  on Poverty legislation, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, established  the now-defunct Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) within the  Executive Office of the President to administer the War on Poverty  programs, including what would become the Legal Services Program, the  predecessor to the current Legal Services Corporation (LSC).", "The OEO\u2019s Legal Services Program activities soon generated political  controversy, and by the early 1970s there was a general consensus that the  OEO\u2019s Legal Services Program should be moved out of the Executive  Office of the President. A number of different structures were proposed.  For example, there were proposals to move the Legal Services Program  into an executive department, such as the Department of Justice, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, or the predecessor to the  current Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to raising  concerns about political interference, critics of placing the function in an  executive department raised concerns about decreased program visibility,  reduced responsiveness to client needs, and the objectives of the program  being subordinated to the department\u2019s mission. Another proposed  organizational home was the Judiciary, especially the Administrative  Office of the United States Courts, but critics argued that the Judiciary  was already overburdened with work and faced frequent funding  problems.", "Four alternative organizational structures were suggested that took into  consideration accountability to Congress and the public while promoting  political independence, permanence, program stability, operational  flexibility, and attorney independence to represent clients consistent with  high professional standards. The four alternative organizational structures  proposed were a federal block grant program, an independent agency in  the executive branch, a U.S. government corporation, or a private  nonprofit corporation. Examples of such organizations today include,  respectively, (1) the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program  and the Community Development Block Grant Program, (2) the National  Science Foundation and the National Foundation on the Arts and the  Humanities, (3) the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the  Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps), and        (4) the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).", "Ultimately, consensus in the early 1970s coalesced around an entity  modeled after the CPB, which was a private, nonmembership, nonprofit  corporation in the District of Columbia with federal funding that was  federally chartered by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 to \u201cfacilitate  the development of public telecommunications and to afford maximum  protection from extraneous interference and control.\u201d The CPB federal  charter created a nine-member, bipartisan board of directors that is  appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and  consent of the U.S. Senate. The board manages CPB to accomplish its  primary mission of providing federal funding via grants and contracts to  public telecommunications and production entities in order to promote  the expansion and development of public telecommunications with high- quality, diverse programming responsive to local needs and furthering  instructional, educational, and cultural purposes. CPB, which was last  reauthorized in 1992, is also funded through annual appropriations.", "By transferring the Legal Services Program to a federally funded, private  nonprofit corporation modeled after CPB, supporters of this type of  organizational entity hoped to achieve the goal of greater operational  flexibility and protection from political pressure from all levels of  government while retaining accountability to Congress and the public.  Supporters also hoped to encourage private donations to LSC, so unlike  CPB\u2019s federal charter, the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (LSC  Act) provides that LSC shall be eligible to be treated as a charitable  corporation exempt from federal taxation.", "Under the Internal Revenue Code, tax-exempt status basically means that  the corporation is operated and organized exclusively for charitable  purposes, does not attempt to influence legislation, does not campaign on  behalf of candidates for public office, and does not allow any of its net  inure earnings to inure to the benefit of any individual. To maintain tax- exempt status, organizations must annually file with the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) a Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt From Income  Tax, which is available for public inspection and includes such  information as the organization\u2019s gross income, assets and liabilities, and  compensation paid to high-level managers. A number of the provisions in  the LSC Act are consistent with IRS\u2019s requirements for tax-exempt status.  For example, the LSC Act\u2019s purpose of providing civil legal assistance to  low-income people qualifies as charitable, and the LSC Act prohibits LSC  from engaging in certain political activities, such as activities that would  influence the passage or defeat of any legislation at the local, state, or  federal level or from making LSC resources available to support any  political party or campaign of any candidate for public office. The LSC Act  also states that LSC has no power to issue stocks and prohibits any LSC  income or assets from inuring to the benefit of any director, officer, or  employee, except as reasonable compensation for services or  reimbursement for expenses. By making and keeping LSC a tax-exempt  organization, the LSC Act prevents federal tax dollars from being spent on  paying federal taxes and thus permits LSC to use its funds for the  charitable purpose set out in the LSC Act.", "Congress enacted the LSC Act in 1974 to transfer the functions of the Legal  Services Program from the Executive Office of the President into a private,  nonmembership, nonprofit corporation with tax-exempt status that would  be federally chartered in the District of Columbia and be authorized to  receive annual federal appropriations to fund its operations supporting  civil legal assistance to low-income people in communities throughout the  United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Examples of Corporate Governance Guidelines", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Corporate governance guidelines", "paragraphs": ["In carrying out their functions, corporate directors must fulfill fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and good  faith.

The grant recipient audit report  must state whether (1) the grant recipient\u2019s financial statements fairly  present its financial position and results of operations in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); (2) the grant recipient  has internal control systems that provide reasonable assurance that it is  managing its funds, LSC and otherwise, in compliance with federal laws  and regulations; and (3) that the grant recipient has complied with federal  laws and regulations applicable to funds received from LSC or other  sources.", "The LSC 1996 Amendments include other grant management provisions.  For example, the LSC 1996 Amendments require the board to select LSC  grant recipients through the implementation of a system of competitive  awards, including such selection criteria as (1) the demonstration of an  understanding of client legal needs and capability of serving such needs;  (2) the quality, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of the proposed plan for  delivery of legal assistance; and (3) LSC\u2019s past experience with the  applicant, including the record of past compliance with LSC requirements.  The LSC 1996 Amendments require the board to ensure that no grant  recipient uses LSC funds for any litigation activity in providing client legal  services unless certain recordkeeping requirements are met. For all cases  or matters, the LSC 1996 Amendments require the board to obtain the  grant recipient\u2019s agreement to maintain timekeeping records. Additionally,  the LSC 1996 Amendments require the board, before providing funding to  a grant recipient, to ensure that the grant recipient enters into a  contractual agreement to be subject to all federal laws relating to the  proper use of federal funds (i.e., not using federal funds for fraud, waste,  or abuse) and that for such purposes LSC shall be considered a federal  agency and its grant funds shall be considered federal funds. Finally, LSC  has issued regulations on its administration of grants, including provisions  establishing cost standards and procedures.", "Requirements for audits of grants provided by federal agencies and U.S.  government corporations are found in the Single Audit Act, as amended,  which established uniform audit requirements for state and local  governments and nonprofit organizations that receive grants or other  forms of federal financial assistance. In addition to uniform audit  requirements, the Single Audit Act is intended to \u201cpromote sound financial  management, including effective internal controls, with respect to Federal  awards administered by non-Federal entities\u201d and \u201cpromote the efficient  and effective use of audit resources.\u201d The Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) has issued implementing regulations on the Single Audit  Act in OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and  Non-Profit Organizations (rev. June 27, 2003).", "Under the Single Audit Act and implementing regulations, generally grant  recipients must annually arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an  audit in accordance with GAGAS and prepare a report on the grant  recipient\u2019s financial statements and schedule of expenditures, internal  controls, and compliance with laws and regulations. The auditor must  report whether (1) the financial statements are presented fairly in all  material respects in conformity with GAAP and (2) the schedule of  expenditures of the grants is presented fairly in all material respects in  relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. With respect to  internal controls, the auditor must obtain an understanding of each of the  grant recipient\u2019s major programs, assess control risk, and perform tests of  the controls. The auditor must also determine whether the grant recipient  has complied with the provisions of laws, regulations, and contracts or  grants related to the grant that have a direct and material effect on each  major program.  The Single Audit Act requires each grantor federal entity  to assess the quality of such audits and monitor the grant recipient\u2019s use of  the federal funds received pursuant to the grant. The Single Audit Act also  requires any auditor of a grant recipient to provide access to the auditor\u2019s  workpapers in response to a request from the grantor federal entity or the  Comptroller General as part of either\u2019s activities in furthering their  oversight responsibilities.", "In addition to providing guidance on audits of grant recipients of federal  entities, OMB uses the authority it possesses under a number of statutes to  issue guidance on uniform administrative requirements for federal grants  that each federal agency and U.S. government corporation must  implement by promulgating entity-specific regulations. OMB has issued  two different circulars for grants to different types of entities: OMB  Circular No. A-102 applies to grants to state and local governments and  OMB Circular No. A-110 applies to grants to institutions of higher  education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations. These circulars  provide for the use of common forms, such as applications, and common  standards, such as grant recipient financial reporting, socioeconomic  policies, and grantor monitoring and oversight responsibilities. OMB has  also issued guidance providing cost principles for federal entities to use in  administering their grants. In three separate circulars, OMB sets out  principles to determine the applicability of costs incurred by three groups  of entities to federal grants.  OMB Circular No. A-87 establishes cost  principles for state, local, and tribal governments; whereas OMB Circular  Nos. A-21 and A-122 establish such principles, respectively, for institutions  of higher education and nonprofit organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acquisition and Management of Property and Services", "paragraphs": ["Unlike most independent federal agencies and wholly owned government  corporations, LSC is not subject to a wide range of federal laws and  regulations that govern the acquisition and management of property and  services, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or the Federal  Travel Regulation (FTR).

Under the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act, it can acquire any interest in  real or personal property by purchase, gift, lease, or contract and then  \u201cown, hold, improve, use and otherwise deal in and with\u201d such property.

Federal  agencies and wholly owned U.S. government corporations, but not LSC,  are subject to federal governmentwide management laws in these areas.  The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, governs information technology  acquisitions by federal agencies and wholly owned U.S. government  corporations, requiring, among other things, the design and  implementation of a process for maximizing the value, and assessing and  managing the risks of the entity\u2019s information technology acquisitions, as  well as the creation of a chief information officer position to help manage  this process. Federal agencies and wholly owned U.S. government  corporations, but not LSC, are also subject to statutory requirements for  travel by federal civilian employees, as well as the implementing the FTR,  promulgated by the General Services Administration, which are intended  to regulate travel \u201cin a manner that balances the need to assure that  official travel is conducted in a responsible manner with the need to  minimize administrative costs.\u201d For example, the FTR provides rules on  when government employees may use first-class or business-class airline  accommodations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Resources Management", "paragraphs": ["Under the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act, the LSC board possesses broad  powers in relation to its officers, employees, and other agents with only  limited restrictions imposed on this power by the LSC Act and other D.C.  statutes. (See table 8.) Unlike federal agencies, LSC is not subject to the  laws in the U.S. Code relating to the executive branch workforce. For  example, like directors of other private nonprofit, tax-exempt  corporations, the LSC directors have the power to determine the rates of  compensation of LSC\u2019s officers and employees so long as the  compensation is not so high that it might constitute prohibited personal  inurement. In one of its few human resources restrictions, however, the  LSC Act specifically makes LSC subject to certain laws governing pay and  benefits for civilian employees of federal agencies and wholly owned U.S.  government corporations.  The LSC Act does so by imposing a ceiling on  compensation for any LSC officer or employee who is linked to a federal  pay schedule under federal law: level V of the Executive Schedule, which  in calendar year 2006 was $133,900. The LSC Act also treats LSC as a  federal entity for purposes of personnel participation in specified federal  employee benefits programs to which LSC is required to make  contributions at the same rates applicable to federal employers.", "Unlike the employees of LSC and other Washington, D.C., nonprofit  corporations, employees of federal agencies and, to a limited extent, U.S.  government corporations, enjoy certain protections under the  Whistleblower Protection Act when they engage in \u201cwhistleblowing,\u201d  which involves reporting evidence of illegal or improper federal employer  activities to the relevant authorities. For example, federal agency and U.S.  government corporation supervisors may not take disciplinary action  against an employee for disclosing information that the employee  reasonably believes evidences gross mismanagement, a gross waste of  funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public  health or safety. There is no equivalent statutory provision for employees  of Washington, D.C., nonprofit corporations, such as LSC or CPB. Under  Washington, D.C., law, however, if a D.C. nonprofit corporation terminates  an employee because he or she disclosed information of employer  misconduct, such as illegal activities, then the terminated employee can  sue the corporation for wrongful discharge under D.C. law\u2019s public policy  exception to the at-will employment doctrine that at-will employees can be  terminated at any time for any reason. Furthermore, LSC employees, like  those of CPB and federal entities subject to the IG Act, enjoy additional  protections not available to employees of typical D.C. nonprofit  corporations. Under the IG Act the IG must not, without the employee\u2019s  consent, disclose the identity of an employee who informs the IG about  the possible existence of an activity at LSC constituting a violation of law,  rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of  authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health and  safety. The IG Act also prohibits the LSC employee\u2019s manager from  retaliating, or threatening to retaliate, against the employee for this  communication with the IG, unless the employee provided the information  to the IG with knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its  truth or falsity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recordkeeping and Public Access to Information", "paragraphs": ["Large organizations such as LSC generate print and electronic records and  conduct executive meetings as part of their regular course of business.

CPB is subject to a similar 3-year retention period for records supporting  its annual financial audit, but other Washington, D.C., nonprofit  corporations are subject to only minimal recordkeeping requirements,  including keeping correct and complete books and records of account and  minutes of board proceedings, which do not have to meet any particular  standard. Under the Federal Records Management laws, however, the  heads of independent federal agencies and wholly owned U.S. government  corporations have much broader recordkeeping duties: the creation of  records to document all \u201cessential transactions\u201d and retention of these  records for specified time periods depending on the type of transaction  documented.", "For any records that LSC, federal agencies, and U.S. government  corporations retain, they must provide the public with access to these  records as required by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). FOIA  requires that federal entities make their records available for public  inspection and copying unless one of the listed FOIA exemptions apply,  such as the exemptions for records pertaining to medical files, internal  personnel practices, or trade secrets. This is one of the handful of  provisions in the LSC Act in which the LSC Act provides that LSC shall be  treated as a federal agency. There is no comparable public right to access  corporate records under the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act.
