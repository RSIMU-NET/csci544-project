Three corporations provided the total amount they paid to each  director for the reporting period (amounts reported ranged from less than  $17,000 to more than $49,000). Five reported monthly or annual salaries  for the directors, along with a description of other expenses for which  directors could be reimbursed, such as travel and technology expenses.  At these five corporations, salaries reported ranged from $1,500 per  month to $48,000 per year.

For example, one corporation requires that at least one  director come from each of the region\u2019s villages, whereas another  established units corresponding to certain villages or communities and  specified a minimum number of directors who must come from each unit.  In addition, the corporations have varied in how they evaluate and  recommend candidates and conduct their elections. For instance, about  half the corporations\u2019 boards have nominating committees to assess  potential candidates and develop or recommend to the board a slate of  nominees. These corporations often pay campaign expenses for their  board slate, but most of them also provide information in their proxy  statements on other candidates, known as independent candidates, and  include the independents\u2019 names on their proxy at no cost to the  candidates.

These corporations pay for the proxy solicitations, but similar to those  corporations with board slates, candidates may or may not be reimbursed  by the corporation for other campaign expenses.

We heard from a few shareholders  that the corporations will share only mailing addresses and campaigning  via e-mail or other electronic means may therefore not be an option for  interested candidates. Several corporate officials we spoke with noted  that their corporations do not use e-mail to solicit proxy solicitations and  that they provide only shareholder mailing addresses to interested  independent candidates because the corporations solicit proxies by mail.", "All of the corporations use cumulative voting for their elections of  directors. Cumulative voting means that each shareholder has a number  of votes equal to the number of shares he or she owns multiplied by the  number of directors to be elected. For example, if a shareholder owned  100 shares and four directors were up for election, the shareholder would  have 400 votes and could cast all 400 votes for one candidate or divide  his or her votes among the candidates. In addition, nine corporations  allow their shareholders to return a discretionary proxy, meaning that  shareholders may grant the board or other specified proxy holders  discretion to cast their votes as the proxy holders see fit; for the  three corporations that do not solicit discretionary proxies, any votes that  are not directed to a particular candidate are counted only toward  reaching a quorum.", "Several corporations indicated that achieving a quorum for their annual  elections can be challenging, but they have been successful over the last  several years in obtaining the required participation of shareholders to  elect directors for the board. To have a valid election, a quorum of  shareholders must be represented at the meeting in person or by proxy.  Four corporations\u2019 quorum is one-third of voting shares, and the other  eight corporations\u2019 quorum is a majority of voting shares. To encourage  shareholders to vote, all 12 corporations offer monetary prizes or other  incentives to shareholders voting in the annual election of directors.  Seven corporations also allow shareholders to vote online; a few  corporations said they have considered online voting but determined it  may not be feasible or worthwhile, because, for example, many of their  shareholders live in remote locations where Internet access is limited.", "In reviewing the regional corporations\u2019 election outcomes during the  10-year period from 2001 to 2011, we found that more board-endorsed  candidates or incumbents have won elections than independent  candidates but that board director positions have also changed hands  numerous times. Some shareholders we spoke with said that their  corporation\u2019s use of a board slate and discretionary voting has made it  difficult to elect independent candidates. We found that for the  corporations with board slates, elections were won mostly by board slate  nominees. We also found, however, that at least one independent  candidate was elected during the 10-year period at all but one of these  corporations; one corporation elected no independent candidates.  Similarly, for the corporations without board slates, we found that  incumbent directors who ran for reelection largely won, but it was not  uncommon for at least one incumbent candidate to be unseated across  these corporations during any one election cycle. In addition, in most  elections across the 10-year period, candidates outnumbered the  available seats on the board of directors, although we found that for the  corporations with village-specific or other geographical restrictions on  certain board seats, a specific seat went uncontested in several elections.  Across the 12 corporations, director positions have turned over several  times during the last 10-year period. Roughly half or fewer of the directors  who were serving in 2001 were still serving in 2011 (see table 5).  Turnover has occurred for a variety of reasons, including resignations,  deaths, nominating committees not selecting incumbent board directors  for reelection, and incumbents losing board elections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shareholder Involvement", "paragraphs": ["Legally, the role of shareholders in a corporation is limited, although the  regional corporations have developed a number of methods to seek  feedback from and encourage the involvement of their shareholders. For  instance, in addition to annual shareholder meetings, most regional  corporations annually hold informational meetings in all or a portion of the  villages located in their region and in other locations where significant  numbers of shareholders reside, such as Anchorage or the Pacific  Northwest. For these meetings, corporate officials or board directors  travel to communities to update shareholders on the corporation\u2019s  business activities and finances and to enable shareholders to ask  questions, raise concerns, and offer comments and suggestions. The  corporations also provide news, updates, and other information to their  shareholders via corporate websites, electronic or printed monthly or  quarterly newsletters, and online social media like Facebook. In addition,  nine regional corporations stream their annual meetings online, allowing  shareholders to participate remotely. Several corporations reported that  they have received good online participation, allowing some shareholders  to participate who might not otherwise be able to attend. For instance,  one corporation reported to us that shareholders could view its 2012  annual meeting via webcast for the first time, and approximately  400 shareholders participated.", "Three corporations have established shareholder advisory committees  comprising volunteer shareholders\u2014representing shareholders living both  within and outside of Alaska\u2014to learn about what matters to  shareholders, hear how the corporations can improve communications  and interactions with shareholders, and educate shareholders about  corporate policies and procedures, among other things. For example, one  corporation has established three shareholder committees to represent  shareholders living (1) in Anchorage, (2) in Alaska but outside Anchorage,  and (3) in the lower 48 states. Each committee consists of nine members  who are chosen by a random drawing from the names of those who  indicated interest in serving on the committee; chosen members serve  3-year terms. Two current directors from this corporation previously  served on the shareholder advisory committee, one of whom told us that  it was a great opportunity to learn more about the corporation and  become interested in serving on the board.", "Further, six of the corporations open at least a portion of their regular  board meetings to shareholders. In a few instances, a request to attend  must be made in advance; in others, any interested shareholders may  attend. A few other corporations said they offered limited instances when  shareholders are invited to attend specific board meetings, such as when  the board may be meeting with visiting dignitaries or discussing a cultural  artifact. Additionally, many corporate officials we spoke with said they  have an \u201copen door\u201d policy, whereby shareholders can call or come to  their corporate offices to directly express concerns or obtain information.  Corporate officials also noted that many of the directors live in villages in  their region, and they receive feedback on corporate matters from  shareholders on a daily basis because their families, neighbors, and  coworkers are also shareholders.", "We found that most regional corporations have surveyed their  shareholders for feedback over the past several years, although obtaining  a high survey response rate has been a challenge. All but two  corporations reported to us that they have surveyed their shareholders; a  few reported that they survey their shareholders on a regular basis, such  as every other year. Regional corporations have surveyed their  shareholders to gauge their general satisfaction with the corporation or to  obtain their views on specific topics, such as opening enrollment to  Alaska Natives or descendants born after the law was enacted in  December 1971, training or employment preferences, or special  payments to elders. In the survey results we reviewed for the handful of  corporations that shared them with us, the corporations reported that  most shareholders expressed satisfaction with their corporation. For  example, in a survey conducted in 2008, 67 percent of shareholder  respondents for one corporation expressed positive \u201coverall feelings  toward\u201d their corporation, and 62 percent of the respondents said the  corporation did a good job of telling shareholders what the company was  doing. We also noted, however, that in many instances survey response  rates were fairly low, ranging from 6 to 46 percent. A few corporate  officials we spoke with acknowledged the participation challenge and said  they typically offer incentives, such as prize drawings, to improve the  response rate. We also spoke to several shareholders, who said they  were generally satisfied with their regional corporation and stayed abreast  of corporate activities by regularly reading corporate reports. On the other  hand, we also heard concerns from several other shareholders that  access to meaningful corporate information was lacking or that some  shareholders do not participate in surveys or other corporate activities  because they were frustrated or disappointed with the corporation.", "In addition to participating in meetings and surveys, shareholders may  submit resolutions for inclusion in a board proxy solicitation regarding  corporate matters for a shareholder vote. Many corporations have specific  requirements for including proposed resolutions, such as setting time  frames for submission or limiting the number of resolutions that can be  submitted during any one year, and shareholder resolutions have often  been advisory. We found that from 2001 through 2011, shareholders from  five corporations submitted 1 or more resolutions during any one year (for a total of 14 resolutions across the five corporations during this period).Examples of submitted shareholder resolutions included limiting terms for  the board of directors to two consecutive terms, designating a specific  location for the corporation\u2019s next annual meeting, and establishing a  settlement trust.", "Another option available to shareholders if they are dissatisfied with  corporate policies or activities is to file a lawsuit against the corporation.  During our review, we identified several lawsuits that shareholders  brought against regional corporations, including challenges to the  corporation\u2019s denial of shareholder access to corporate books and  records, the settlement agreement governing the 7(i) distribution, and  payments to elders made through a settlement trust or elder benefits  program. Shareholders lost the lawsuits we identified except one case  that settled out of court and two cases that, as of this report, were still  pending. Nevertheless, in a few of these cases, neither federal nor state  law authorized shareholders to bring lawsuits challenging the  corporation\u2019s action, and under state law, successfully challenging a  corporate board\u2019s business judgment is difficult.

The report also noted, however, that if this assumption proved  invalid in light of experience, the committee was prepared to reimpose  provisions of federal securities laws as necessary and that the 20-year  exemption should be viewed by the Alaska Natives as an experiment  which would be stopped if abused. In 1988, the act was amended to  extend the exemption from securities law until after a corporation issued  shares of its stock to the public, shareholders voted to terminate the  restriction on sales, or the corporation registered with the SEC.

The most broadly dispersed monetary benefit consists of  cash dividends paid per share to shareholders. Shareholders and  officials from several regional corporations told us that dividends are  often considered the most important benefit shareholders receive from  the corporations. We heard from several corporations that dividend  payments to shareholders provide a critical source of income to help  defray living expenses, such as high heating costs during the winter.  The total dividends per share paid by each of the 12 regional  corporations during the 2010 reporting period varied considerably,  ranging from $2.35 per share at one corporation to $64.26 at another  (see table 6). The regional corporations\u2019 boards annually determine  and approve dividend amounts on the basis of factors including the  corporations\u2019 financial performance, and some have established  formulas, such as a targeted percentage of net income, or a  permanent fund out of which dividends are to be paid.", "In analyzing the corporations\u2019 financial data for the 10-year period  from 2001 through the 2010 reporting period, we found that not all  corporations provided dividends every year. Each of the  12 corporations paid dividends in recent years, but a handful of  corporations did not provide dividend payments in the early 2000s;  some corporations struggled financially or declared bankruptcy in the  past. Our analysis showed that for the 10-year period, the  cumulative total in dividends per share ranged from $5.50 per share to  over $600 per share; for half the corporations, the cumulative total  amounted to approximately $34 to $100 per share over the period.  Thus, a shareholder owning 100 shares could have received from  $550 to as much as $60,000 over the period; typically, however,  shareholders would have received about $3,400 to $10,000.", "Elder benefits. In addition to dividends, almost all the regional  corporations provide monetary payments to elder shareholders.  Specifically, 11 corporations make cash payments, often quarterly or  annually, to their elder shareholders, starting at age 60, 62, or 65,  depending on the corporation. The regional corporations provide  these payments\u2014which ranged from $300 to $4,000 per individual  during the 2010 reporting period\u2014through various mechanisms,  including from designated trusts, as a separate class of shares, or in  cash payments authorized by the corporations\u2019 boards. Several  corporate officials we spoke with commented that these payments   often constitute an important source of income for elder shareholders,  who may not otherwise have a retirement income.", "Scholarships. The 12 regional corporations support a variety of  educational scholarships to their shareholders and, in some cases, to  descendants of shareholders. In general, the corporations provide  funding to closely affiliated nonprofit organizations, such as  foundations endowed by the corporations, which then award  scholarships to qualifying undergraduate, graduate, or vocational  students. During the corporations\u2019 2010 reporting period, each of the  12 corporations reported to us that they provided funding to support  individual scholarship awards made by the nonprofit organizations, in  amounts varying by corporation and by type of scholarship award  (see table 7). In some cases, scholarships are competitive; in other  cases, corporate officials said they try to provide funding to as many  eligible applicants as possible.", "Memorial benefits. Most regional corporations provide financial  assistance to their shareholders and, in some cases, to shareholder  descendants or other family members to help with funeral-related  expenses related to the death of a shareholder, spouse, or  descendant. Financial assistance can be used for burial or funeral- related expenses, including travel by family members, which may  allow shareholders to maintain Alaska Native burial traditions and help  offset the high costs of travel in Alaska. Most corporations reported  that they set a cap on the amount of financial assistance available per  individual or family, ranging from $500 to $3,000, depending on the  corporation.", "Shareholders\u2019 equity. Shareholders\u2019 equity has been described by  some of the regional corporations as a benefit, but because  shareholders cannot currently sell their shares for a monetary return,  they may not view such equity as a benefit. Shareholders\u2019 equity is  the net assets of the company, that is, the value of a company\u2019s  assets minus its liabilities. According to a Department of the Interior  study on Alaska Native corporations, the values of the regional  corporations are difficult to estimate in the absence of a market for  their shares. Moreover, absent a market value, shareholders cannot  in effect express confidence or lack of confidence in the corporation\u2019s  management of the shareholders\u2019 assets by buying or selling their  shares. Nevertheless, in their 2010 reporting period, the 12 regional  corporations reported total shareholders\u2019 equity values ranging from  $15 million to about $1.1 billion (6 regional corporations reported  equity per share, which ranged from about $83 to nearly $1,000 per  share). In contrast to the corporations\u2019 view, a number of shareholders  we heard from said that shareholders\u2019 equity has little real value to  them since they cannot sell shares for a tangible monetary benefit.", "Charitable donations. The regional corporations each make a variety  of charitable monetary and in-kind donations to regional nonprofit  organizations and other entities that offer services to corporation  shareholders and others in the communities. For instance, most of the  corporations reported that they provide funding or other support to  housing authorities, health organizations, or vocational schools  located in their regions. One corporation, for example, provides  funding to a flight school that trains private and commercial pilots, a  particularly useful skill given that many Alaska Native villages are  accessible only by plane (see fig. 2). Flight school officials told us that  a local airline hires nearly all of the school\u2019s graduates. Another  corporation provides funding to a vocational facility in the region,  which offers junior and high school students varied training, such as  driver\u2019s education, metal welding, and small-engine repair.  Representatives at some of the nonprofit organizations we visited  stressed the importance of the regional corporations\u2019 support in  maintaining their operations and programs. The corporations also  make in-kind donations, such as firewood for winter heating, including   delivery to elders and others unable to haul it themselves, or gravel  for village infrastructure from corporation-owned gravel pits.", "Nonmonetary benefits offered by the regional corporations\u2014often in  partnership with village corporations, tribal organizations, and nonprofit  organizations within the region\u2014include employment opportunities;  cultural preservation; land management; economic development; and  advocacy on behalf of Alaska Natives and their communities. Specific  benefits may include, but are not limited to, the following:", "Employment and related opportunities. The 12 regional corporations  or their subsidiaries may employ Alaska Native shareholders in  preference over others (see table 8). They may also offer  internships and other employment support. Some regional corporation  officials told us that employing shareholders is an important priority to  them, and they actively train and employ shareholders in their  businesses. For example, according to one regional corporation,  55 percent of the employees at its zinc-lead mine are shareholders.  According to corporation officials, employment opportunities for  shareholders living within the region were an important consideration  in initially determining whether to develop the mine. Officials from a  few other regional corporations, in contrast, told us that their  corporations have not emphasized creating employment opportunities  because it has not been a high priority for their shareholder base or  that business and employment opportunities may not be readily  available where shareholders reside. In addition to hiring shareholders  and other Alaska Natives directly, the corporations have internship  programs for shareholders and, in some cases, for shareholder  descendants or spouses. Internships vary from 6- to 12-week summer  internships to longer internships or apprenticeships that can lead to a  permanent position with a regional corporation. Several corporations  also offer other employment support to their shareholders, such as  providing career counseling, job fairs, and leadership training to retain  shareholders as managers and leaders within the corporation.", "Cultural preservation. The regional corporations have supported  numerous cultural activities focused on preserving and maintaining  Alaska Native traditions and heritage. Nearly all of the corporations  have established nonprofit organizations or heritage centers, many  with the express purpose of administering cultural and educational  programs to preserve and honor unique Native cultures. Cultural  activities supported by regional corporations include programs for  youth and elders, Alaska Native community events, and language and  artifact preservation. For example, several corporations sponsor  youth-elder camps, featuring activities such as language learning and  gathering and preparing subsistence foods that help transmit Native  traditions from one generation to the next. Other corporations support  groups or events centered on traditional art forms and languages,  such as crafts, Native songs and dances, and the development of a  compact disc teaching an Alaska Native language. Still other  corporations have focused on protecting sacred and historical sites  and Native artifacts. For example, one corporation helps protect more  than 80 sacred historical sites located throughout the region on behalf  of tribal entities that are the traditional owners of the sites, which  include historical burial grounds, forts, petroglyphs, and villages.", "Land management. The regional corporations actively manage their  surface lands for subsistence and recreation by their shareholders  and other Alaska Natives, as well as for natural resource use and  protection. Many corporations indicated that subsistence\u2014which  plays a key role in Alaska Natives\u2019 livelihoods and traditional culture\u2014 is often a primary or highest-priority use of their lands; subsistence  activities include hunting, trapping, fishing, and food gathering and  camps associated with these activities. Natural resource use and  protection include a wide variety of activities such as working with  research partners to study topics related to sustainable management  of corporate natural resources, including timber, wildlife, and  renewable energy potential; harvesting and marketing of corporate  natural resources; managing property leases, and easements;  developing strategies to promote outdoor tourism; and patrolling  corporate lands against trespassing, particularly for those  corporations with road systems in the regions.", "Economic development. With their size and relative profitability, the  regional corporations take actions to foster economic development in  their regions, typically working in partnership with other regional or  community organizations. For example, one corporation is working  with a regional Native health association to build a 33,000-square-foot  multidisciplinary health facility on corporation-owned land (which is  leased to the association for 50 years at $1 per year). The facility is to  house dental and health clinics, as well as behavioral health, tribal  community, and environmental health services. Another corporation  has established a joint business venture with a village corporation to  bring an out-of-use seafood plant back into production. The regional  corporations are also involved in various ways\u2014such as seeking  funding or procuring physical resources\u2014in infrastructure or energy  development. Several regional corporation officials told us that energy  development is a high priority for them, to help reduce the high costs  of energy in Alaska Native villages. These corporations, for example,  are exploring renewable energy development opportunities, including  wind power generation on varying scales, and others are exploring or  investing in other alternative heating sources, such as solar power,  geothermal heat, or wood pellet heating.", "Advocacy. Officials from several regional corporations said they serve  as advocates for Alaska Natives and the communities they live in,  partly because they have lobbying resources and legal expertise that  local populations may not. The regional corporations may lobby  state and federal legislatures directly on behalf of their shareholders,  or they may work through other Alaska Native advocacy  organizations. One corporation, for example, successfully lobbied the  Alaska state legislature to pass a bill in support of a commercial  oyster industry in its region, which established a loan program for  entrepreneurs wishing to engage in this industry. Officials from  another corporation routinely attend meetings with the Alaska  Department of Fish and Game to represent village interests in  subsistence fishing and hunting rights. In addition, each of the  regional corporations is a member of the Alaska Federation of  Natives, the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska. The  organization\u2019s mission includes, among other goals, advocating for  Alaska Native people, fostering and encouraging preservation of  Alaska Native cultures, promoting understanding of Alaska Natives\u2019  economic needs, and encouraging development consistent with those  needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Questions to Consider for the Future", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 40 years, the regional corporations have evolved along with  the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which has been amended  several times.

We identified questions regarding the  ambiguity of existing federal financial reporting requirements for the  corporations, the role of the federal government in maintaining the  corporations\u2019 solvency, and the implications of defining who is eligible to  be a shareholder\u2014this last question specifically for the corporations and  their shareholders to consider.

We were unable to determine whether the corporations are  complying with this reporting requirement because the phrase  \u201csubstantially all\u201d is not defined. As a result, it is not clear which  information is required or the extent to which any required information  must be included in regional corporations\u2019 annual reports.

They also stated that they do not believe they should have to comply with  all of the reporting requirements for SEC registrants because many of the  requirements are not relevant to Alaska Native corporations.

However, in their observations about the  corporations\u2019 annual shareholder reports, SEC staff noted that additional  information in the annual reports could inform shareholder voting on  directors and resolutions and allow shareholders to better understand the  regional corporations\u2019 financial performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the Appropriate Role of the Federal Government in Maintaining the Solvency of Alaska Native Corporations?", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 40 years, some regional corporations have experienced  periods of financial crisis, and legislation has been enacted to help ensure  their continued financial solvency.

In  response to questions about Interior\u2019s responsibility to shareholders of the  Alaska Native corporations and specifically to shareholders of the 13th  Regional Corporation, Interior\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs  stated that the Bureau of Indian Affairs currently has neither a statutory  nor a regulatory responsibility to Alaska Native corporations. The  Assistant Secretary further stated that the bureau has no responsibility to  ensure that Alaska Native corporations are meeting their legal obligations  and that it does not have the authority to assist the 13th Regional  Corporation (or any other Alaska Native corporation) in any  reorganization efforts.", "In addition, advocates for the 13th Regional Corporation have also sought  assistance through Congress. Specifically, legislation was proposed in  2006 and 2008 that would have authorized the conveyance of over  1 million acres of land in Alaska to the 13th Regional Corporation for it to  manage and required that it share a portion of natural resource revenue  derived from the land with the other regional corporations. More  recently, representatives from the 13th Regional Corporation have  promoted an alternative proposal they would like to see as a bill  introduced in Congress. Under this proposal, the 13th Regional  Corporation would receive over 1 million acres of land, which the other  regional corporations would manage and share a larger portion of that  land\u2019s associated natural resource revenue. As of this report, however,  this proposal had not been acted upon.", "Also, several shareholders we spoke with suggested that the 13th  Regional Corporation\u2019s shareholders be allowed to become shareholders  of one of the other 12 regional corporations.

Shareholder eligibility criteria have changed since the  corporations were established and may continue to change under the  1988 and 1992 amendments to the Settlement Act. Under the original act,  only those Alaska Natives with at least a 25 percent blood quantum who  were alive on December 18, 1971, were eligible to become shareholders,  and these restrictions were to end in 1991. The 1988 amendments,  however, extended these restrictions until and unless a majority of a  corporation\u2019s shareholders voted to lift them and allow sales of stock to  the public. As of this report, none of the corporations had voted to lift the  restrictions on the sale of stock, and many of the corporate officials we  spoke with expressed their strong desire to remain Alaska Native  owned.", "In addition, amendments to the Settlement Act allowed the corporations\u2019  shareholders to vote to amend the articles of incorporation to authorize  the issuance of shares to Alaska Natives born after December 18, 1971,  or to descendants of Alaska Natives; to eligible Alaska Natives who  missed enrollment; or to Alaska Native shareholders who are 65 years old  or older. Shareholders of 6 of the 13 corporations have voted to issue  shares to some or all of these classes of shareholders, although who is  eligible to receive the shares varies considerably among the corporations  (see table 9). Some of the other corporations are still studying the issue of  opening enrollment.
