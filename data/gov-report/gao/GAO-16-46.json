For this report, GAO assessed the extent to which DOD components (1) reviewed contracts and activities in the fiscal year 2013 inventory of contracted services and (2) developed plans to use the inventory for decision-making. GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance; 35 component inventory certification letters and 28 contract actions for services categorized as often supporting inherently governmental functions; and interviewed DOD acquisition, manpower, and programming officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to face challenges in ensuring that it fully reviews its inventory of contracted services. As of September 2015, 35 of 37 components certified they had done so and generally addressed more of the review elements required by DOD guidance than in prior years. For the second consecutive year, however, the Air Force did not submit a certification letter. Further, components may be inaccurately reporting on the extent to which contractors were providing services that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions, a key review objective to help ensure that DOD has proper oversight in place. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy indicates that certain contracted services\u2014such as professional and management support\u2014are more likely to include such functions. In fiscal year 2013, the Army reported that nearly 80 percent of the $9.7 billion it obligated for these types of services included closely associated with inherently governmental functions. In contrast, the Navy and other DOD agencies reported about 13 percent of the $10.7 billion obligated for similar contracted services included such functions.", "GAO's review found that the lack of documentation on whether a proposed contract included such functions may result in inventory review processes incorrectly reporting these contracts. At least 12 of the 28 contract actions GAO reviewed appear to include these functions, but\u2014of those 12\u2014DOD components identified only one prior to contract award and only two during the review process as such. Without accurate identification of the functions contractors are performing, DOD cannot be assured that proper oversight is in place or provide data on the activities and functions contractors are performing.", "Military departments have not developed plans to facilitate the use of the inventory for workforce planning or budgetary decisions nor have they appointed an accountable official to help do so, as DOD previously stated they intended to do. Further, DOD has not outlined the relationships between a management support office, military departments, and other stakeholders to facilitate the collection and use of inventory data in decision-making processes.

DOD relies on contractors to perform various  functions, such as professional and management support, information  technology support, and weapon system support. Contractor personnel  constitute a key component of DOD\u2019s total workforce, which includes  DOD active and reserve forces and DOD civilian employees, and are vital  to helping DOD meet its mission.

This inventory is intended, in part, to help  provide better insight into the number of contractor full-time equivalents  (FTEs) providing services to the department and the functions they are  performing, and determine whether any of these functions warrant  conversion to DOD civilian performance. Further, this section also  requires DOD to undertake certain actions using these inventories.  Specifically, subsections (e) and (f), respectively, direct the secretaries of  the military departments or heads of the defense agencies to, among  other things:  review the inventory to ensure that personal services contracts on the  list are performed under applicable statutes and regulations and  identify contracted functions that DOD should consider for conversion;  and develop a plan, including an enforcement mechanism and approval  process, to use the inventory for strategic workforce planning,  workforce mix, and budgeting decisions.", "More recently, the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 directed the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  (USD(AT&L)) and the senior acquisition executive for the Navy and Air  Force, respectively, to issue policies implementing a standard pre- solicitation checklist similar to the Army\u2019s Request for Service Contract  Approval form.

We reviewed  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 inventory submission and review guidance,  issued on March 18, 2014 by USD(AT&L) and the Acting Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)). This guidance  required the military departments and defense agencies to certify\u2014 through submission of a certification letter to the USD(P&R)\u2014that their  review was conducted in accordance with subsection (e). The guidance  required components to report on seven elements, including the contract  selection criteria and methodologies used to conduct the reviews, the  extent to which contractors were found to be performing inherently  governmental functions and those closely associated with inherently  governmental functions, and, to the extent necessary, a plan to realign  the work to government performance, among other elements. We  assessed all unclassified fiscal year 2013 inventory review certification  letters submitted by 35 DOD components by September 2015 to  determine if components addressed the seven elements specified in  DOD\u2019s inventory guidance. Further, to gauge the extent to which DOD  components identified instances in which contractors may be performing  activities closely associated with inherently governmental functions, we  identified total obligations for contracts in the inventory that where  categorized under one of the 17 product service codes that the Office of  Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and GAO identified as likely to be  closely associated with inherently governmental functions. We then  compared these obligations to total obligations certified by DOD  components as being for contractors performing closely associated with  inherently governmental functions in the fiscal year 2013 certification  letters. We compared the inventory submission data to the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data for fiscal  year 2013 and determined the data were sufficiently reliable for this  purpose.", "In addition, we selected 28 non-generalizable contract actions across the  major command at each military department with the highest obligations  for knowledge based services in fiscal year 2013. These commands  included the Army Materiel Command, the Air Force Materiel Command,  and the Naval Sea Systems Command. We selected the contract actions  based on the fiscal year 2013 inventory submission data and, in part,  because of their high dollar value and categorization under product  service codes that OFPP and GAO identified as often including closely  associated with inherently governmental functions. We reviewed the  documents in the file for each contract action, including the statements of  work and pre-award documentation, to identify any planned contractor  activities that appeared to be closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. For the purposes of this report, we considered a  contract action to include such functions if any activity described in the  statement of work appeared to be closely associated with inherently  governmental functions as defined under section 7.503(d) of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and appendix B of OFPP Policy Letter 11- 01. To inform the file review, we interviewed officials at the commands  responsible for compiling and reviewing the inventory as well as  contracting, program and resource management officials for the selected  contract actions. In addition, we interviewed officials from USD(P&R) and  USD(AT&L). We also interviewed command and department-level  officials to determine plans to implement a standard pre-solicitation form  similar to the Army\u2019s.", "To assess the extent to which DOD components have developed plans  and processes to use the inventory to inform management decisions  pursuant to subsection (f), we used the data we collected for our  November 2014 report on this issue to establish the extent to which each  military department\u2019s strategic workforce planning, manpower mix, and  budgeting guidance and documentation required or cited the use of the  inventory of contracted services. We then interviewed officials from each  military department and collected any updated policies to determine what  updates, if any, had been made to those policies and procedures. We  also interviewed acquisition and manpower officials at the three military  departments to assess the status of the military department\u2019s plans to  appoint an accountable official to facilitate efforts to develop a plan,  including an enforcement mechanism, pursuant to subsection (f). We also  assessed DOD\u2019s efforts to develop a common contractor manpower data  system by interviewing officials from USD(P&R) and the Defense  Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and reviewing briefing slides resulting  from the December 2014 strategic review of options. To assess the  completeness of the data from DOD\u2019s four Contractor Manpower  Reporting Application (CMRA) systems, we reviewed policy and guidance  and interviewed contractor and government officials responsible for  inputting and verifying the data. We also compared data from the FPDS- NG for the 30 service contracts with the highest obligations from October  2012 through July 2013 at the Army, Navy, and Air Force to determine  the extent to which the contractors reported direct labor hours and invoice  amounts for these contracts in these CMRA systems.

The information DOD is to collect includes, among  other things, the services purchased, the total dollar amount of the  purchase, the form of contracting action used to make the purchase, and  the extent of competition provided in making the purchase. In 2008,  Congress amended section 2330a to add a requirement for the Secretary  of Defense to submit an annual inventory of the activities performed  pursuant to contracts for services on behalf of DOD during the preceding  fiscal year.", "The inventory is to include a number of specific data elements for each  identified activity, including  the function and missions performed by the contractor; the contracting organization, the component of DOD administering the  contract, and the organization whose requirements are being met  through contractor performance of the function;  the funding source for the contract by appropriation and operating  agency; the fiscal year the activity first appeared on an inventory;  the number of contractor employees (expressed as full FTEs) for  direct labor, using direct labor hours and associated cost data  collected from contractors; a determination of whether the contract pursuant to which the activity  is performed is a personal services contract; and a summary of the information required by section 2330a(a) of title 10  of the U.S. Code.", "Within DOD, USD(AT&L), USD(P&R), and the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) have shared responsibility for issuing  guidance for compiling and reviewing the inventory.

USD(P&R), as supported by the Comptroller, is responsible for, among  other things, developing guidance for the conduct and completion of this  review. As part of this review, the military departments and defense  agencies are to ensure that any personal services contracts on the inventory were properly  entered into and performed appropriately;  the activities on the list do not include any inherently governmental  functions; and  to the maximum extent practicable, the activities on the inventory do  not include any functions closely associated with inherently  governmental functions.", "This review also requires the secretaries of the military departments and  heads of defense agencies to identify activities that should be considered  for conversion to government performance, or insourced, pursuant to  section 2463 of title 10 of the U.S. Code, or to a more advantageous  acquisition approach.

To achieve a  uniform approach to collecting contractor manpower data, USD(P&R) and  USD(AT&L) issued a joint memorandum in November 2012 that  reiterated its goal for all components to report contractor manpower data  using a common system, which it termed the Enterprise-wide Contractor  Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA).

Additionally, we reported that USD(P&R) initiated a strategic review to  assess all data collection options, raising the question of whether DOD  would continue to establish a common data system, ECMRA, as it  indicated it intended to do in a November 2012 memorandum. Noting that  continued delays in developing an implementation plan for a common  data system increased the risk that DOD would be unable to collect the  statutorily required data needed to serve as the basis for DOD\u2019s inventory  process, we recommended that USD(P&R) approve a plan of action, with  timeframes and milestones, for rolling out and supporting a department- wide data collection system as soon as practicable following the strategic  review.

There is no requirement in statute, the FAR, DOD Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or OFPP Policy Letter  11-01 to document a pre-award determination regarding closely  associated with inherently governmental functions; however, there are  requirements for agencies, and DOD specifically, to take certain steps  to mitigate the risk of using contractors for such functions.

We found the Army\u2019s pre-award process, specifically  the Service Contract Approval checklist, documents the determination  of closely associated with inherently governmental functions and other  determinations of planned contractor functions. By contrast, the Air  Force and Navy do not have department-wide requirements to  document this determination in its contract files. Acquisition officials  documented their pre-award determinations in eight of the 28 contract  actions. In one case involving a Navy contract, the command clearly  identified that the proposed contract included closely associated with  inherently governmental functions. In another case involving an Army  contract, the pre-award documentation identified closely associated  with inherently governmental functions, but our review did not identify  such functions in the statement of work.

For example, the Army identified one  contract action in our review as including closely associated with  inherently governmental functions based on a blanket Service  Contract Approval form for contracts within the Software Engineering  Center. We found, however, that the activities described in the form  were not consistent with the activities outlined in the statement of  work, which did not appear to include closely associated with  inherently governmental functions. We also found that the Navy and  Air Force commands used a blanket or class determination and  finding document to cover multiple contract actions under which  contractors would perform evaluations and analyses of proposals or  advisory and assistance services, as permitted by the FAR. For  example, for six of the Air Force contract actions, the contract files  included blanket approvals to use non-government personnel in  source selection and sole source evaluations. However, these  services are clearly identified in FAR \u00a7 7.503(d)(8) and OFPP Policy  Letter 11-01, appendix B, paragraph (1)(e)(ii) as closely associated  with inherently governmental functions, but there was not  documentation in the contract files identifying these activities as being  closely associated with inherently governmental functions.", "Having contractors perform closely associated with inherently  governmental functions is often necessary to support an agencies\u2019  mission. However, using contractors for these functions poses several  risks to an agency, including the inappropriate transfer of inherently  governmental functions to the contractor. To mitigate these risks, the FAR  and OFPP Policy Letter 11-01 requires agencies to ensure appropriate  oversight of contractors performing closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. Further, section 2383 of title 10 of the U.S.  Code and the DFARS require that DOD take certain steps before entering  into a contract for such functions, such as ensuring that appropriate DOD  military or civilian personnel will oversee contractor performance and will  perform all inherently governmental functions associated with the  contract. To carry out these steps, it is critical for DOD to identify  contracts that may include closely associated with inherently  governmental functions during the pre-contract award process. Both the  OFPP guidance and the FAR offer descriptions of tasks that are closely  associated with inherently governmental functions (see figure 3).", "As the inventory review process at the Army and Navy relies, in part, on  pre-award determinations and documentation, inaccurate identification of  contractors performing closely associated with inherently governmental  functions prior to contract award may hinder the review process at these  departments. Our review of inventory review processes at the three  commands we reviewed found that the commands may not have  accurately identified contract activities that included closely associated  with inherently governmental functions during the review process. In our  review of the 28 contract actions, we did not assess whether the  contractor actually performed closely associated with inherently  governmental functions, which could potentially account for some  differences between our pre-award assessment and assessments  commands made for the inventory review.

Having  contractors perform closely associated with inherently governmental  functions is necessary to support an agencies\u2019 mission, but statutory law,  the FAR, DFARS, and OFPP guidance require that DOD provide  sufficient oversight to mitigate the risks when contractors perform such  work. DOD intends to require its services requirement review boards to  identify contractor functions prior to awarding a contract and is expected  to issue supplemental guidance to implement this requirement. Additional  actions are planned by the Air Force and Navy. Until such time that the  new instruction and supplemental guidance is issued, however, the  military departments and defense agencies may be missing opportunities  to improve their capability to identify and mitigate the risks of contractors  performing closely associated with inherently governmental functions.", "Overall, while components are addressing more of the required elements  in DOD\u2019s inventory review guidance, the results of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013  inventory review raises questions about the accuracy and completeness  of the reviews. In this case, the Army identified nearly 80 percent of its  contracts in the 17 product service codes OFPP and GAO identified as  often including closely associated with inherently governmental functions,  as including such work. In contrast, the Navy and other defense agencies  identified about 13 percent of their contracts as doing so in these same  codes. Additionally, the Air Force did not submit a letter certifying they  had completed the review for the second consecutive year, without  explanation. The lack of documentation on whether a proposed contract  includes closely associated with inherently governmental functions may  result in inventory review processes incorrectly reporting these contracts.  At least 12 of the 28 contract actions we reviewed appeared to include  these activities, but\u2014of those 12\u2014the DOD components identified one  prior to contract award and two during the inventory review process as  including such activities. More recently, DOD officials noted that it may be  unrealistic for components to review all contracts in their inventory and  added that a risk-based approach to select which contracts to review may  be appropriate. Neither DOD\u2019s March 2014 guidance nor its December  2014 guidance for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 inventories, respectively,  provided a specific percentage of contracts to be reviewed or the basis for  selecting the contracts to review.

USD(P&R) issued guidance that designated responsibility for the  development of the strategic workforce plan to the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel Policy, but did not require use  of the inventory. This guidance pre-dates the statutory requirement to use  the inventory to inform strategic workforce planning. For example, the  Fiscal Years 2013-2018 Strategic Workforce Plan, the most recent plan  available at the time of our November 2014 review, stated that DOD\u2019s  plans for identifying and assessing workforce mix will leverage the  inventory of contracted services, but it did not provide any additional  details on using the inventory.", "None of the three military departments had developed a statutorily  required plan or enforcement mechanism to use the inventory of  contracted services and generally they had not developed guidance or  processes for these purposes (see table 5).", "DOD had two department-wide policies for determining workforce mix\u2014 DOD directive 1100.4 and DOD instruction 1100.22\u2014but neither required  the use of the inventory to inform workforce mix planning.
