GAO analyzed documents, VA data as of November 2012 on selected major construction projects, and interviewed VA officials, architecture and engineering, and construction firms."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Costs substantially increased and schedules were delayed for Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) largest medical-center construction projects in Denver, Colorado; Las Vegas, Nevada; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Orlando, Florida. As of November 2012, the cost increases for these projects ranged from 59 percent to 144 percent, with a total cost increase of nearly $1.5 billion and an average increase of approximately $366 million. The delays for these projects range from 14 to 74 months, resulting in an average delay of 35 months per project. In commenting on a draft of this report, VA contends that using the initial completion date from the construction contract would be more accurate than using the initial completion date provided to Congress; however, using this date would not account for how VA managed these projects prior to the award of the construction contract. Several factors, including changes to veterans' health care needs and site-acquisition issues contributed to increased costs and schedule delays at these sites.", "Although VA has taken some actions to address problems managing major construction projects, the agency has opportunities for further improvement. For example, VA established a Construction Review Council in June 2012 to oversee the department's development and execution of its real property programs. However, construction management challenges remain, and opportunities exist for VA to avoid further cost increases and schedule delays.", "Given the complexity and speed of medical advances, many health care organizations have enlisted the services of experts in planning the procurement and installation of medical equipment for new medical centers. VA has used these planners at various phases for some projects and is reviewing its overall procurement of medical equipment. However, VA has not taken full advantage of medical equipment planners on all projects, in part because there is no guidance for doing so. Not using a medical equipment planner can lead to increased design and construction changes resulting in cost increases and schedule delays.", "VA has not yet clearly defined roles and responsibilities of VA construction management staff, even though the agency previously identified the need to do so. GAO found that conflicting direction from VA to contractors can cause some confusion and lead to cost increases and construction delays. For example, contractor officials at one site said that VA's project manager directed them to defer the design of specific rooms until medical equipment was selected for the facility; however, VA's central office then directed the contractor to proceed with designing the rooms. This conflicting direction from VA will require the contractor to redesign the space, further expending project resources.", "The federal government's regulations and VA's policy specify that changes to construction contracts, known as change orders, should be issued in a timely manner; however, VA's change-order approval process requires time-consuming reviews at multiple organizational levels that have resulted in extensive delays and increased costs for some projects.

In response to  the construction industry\u2019s concerns that VA and other federal agencies  did not involve the construction contractor early in the design process, VA  and the Army Corps of Engineers began working to establish a project  delivery model that would allow for earlier contractor involvement in a  construction project, as is often done in the private sector. However, in  Denver and New Orleans VA did not implement IDC early enough to  garner the full benefits.", "VA officials stated that Denver and New Orleans were initiated as design- bid-build projects and later switched to IDC after the projects had already  begun. According to VA officials, the IDC method was very popular with  industry, and VA wanted to see if this approach would be effective in  delivering a timely medical facility project. Thus while the intent of the IDC  method is to involve both the project contractor and architectural and  engineering firm early in the process to ensure a well coordinated effort in  designing and planning a project, VA did not hire the contractor for  Denver until after the initial designs were completed. New Orleans  officials said that they were delayed in bringing on the contractor because  of a bid protest. The designer was allowed to continue with design development during the resolution of the protest, which did not allow the  project to fully benefit from the IDC method. According to VA officials, had  the award not been protested, sufficient interaction between the  architectural and engineering and construction firm could have taken  place during design development, which should have greatly limited or  mitigated many of the design issues. According to VA, in both Denver and  New Orleans, because the contractors were not involved in the design of  the projects and formulated their bids based on a design which had not  been finalized, these projects required changes that increased costs and  led to schedule delays. VA staff responsible for managing both projects  said it would have been better to maintain the design-bid-build model  throughout the entire process rather than changing mid-project because  VA did not receive the value of having contractor input at the design  phase, as the IDC method is supposed to provide. For example,  according to Denver VA officials, the architectural design called for curved  walls rather than less expensive straight walls along the hospital\u2019s main  corridor. The officials said that had the contractor been involved in the  design process, the contractor could have helped VA weigh the aesthetic  advantages of curved walls against the lower cost of straight walls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Medical Equipment Planners", "paragraphs": ["VA officials have emphasized that they need the flexibility to change their  heath care processes in response to the development of new  technologies, equipment, and advances in medicine.

Army Corps of Engineers officials said they  also use medical planners from the Department of Army\u2019s Office of the  Surgeon General on all of their medical facility projects. Officials from  contracting firms currently working on VA projects told us that in their  experience with other federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, medical equipment planners have helped avoid schedule  delays.

For example, in Orlando, VA relied on local VHA staff  with limited experience in procuring medical equipment for a new  hospital. Orlando VA officials recommended hiring a consulting firm to  assist them with various aspects of medical equipment planning,  procurement, delivery, and installation in 2011. However, VA was unable  to implement this recommendation until fiscal year 2012, at which point  the design decisions had already been made. Because the medical  equipment specifications changed several times, construction design  documents for various parts of the medical facility had to be changed.  Consequently, the facility also had to be altered, and some previously  constructed areas required minor demolition to accommodate the medical  equipment.

The data included a short project description, project location, the  original and current total estimated cost of the project, the original and  current completion date, and the type of acquisition strategy selected for  the project. We analyzed the current cost and completion dates to  determine any increases in costs and the extent to which projects may  have exceeded time allotted and summarized the results. We also  collected VA information on reasons for cost increase and schedule  changes to VA projects based on scope changes. We assessed the  reliability of the data through interviews with knowledgeable VA officials  and a review for completeness and any unexpected values. We  determined that the data was sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this  report. To identify the reasons for cost, schedule, and scope changes in  VA\u2019s construction projects, we interviewed VA\u2019s headquarters officials  regarding the status of all major medical-facility projects and examined  project documents and interviewed on-site managers and engineers. We  selected the four most expensive ongoing major medical-facility  construction projects based on cost, current status of the project, and  type of facility, located in Denver, Colorado; Orlando, Florida; New  Orleans, Louisiana; and Las Vegas, Nevada. We obtained specific  information from VA\u2019s ongoing major medical-facility projects as of  November 2012. We visited the construction sites in Denver, Orlando,  and New Orleans to talk to officials on site to determine the reasons for  changes in costs and schedules. We updated our prior work on the Las  Vegas facility with information on the project completion costs and the  change-order process.and cannot be generalized to sites agency-wide.", "The information from our site visits is illustrative  To identify which actions VA has taken to improve its construction  management, and any opportunities that exist for VA to further improve its  management, we reviewed VA\u2019s management practices of construction  projects at the three locations we visited and interviewed VA  headquarters\u2019 officials from the Veterans Health Administration, Office of  Construction and Facilities Management, Office of General Counsel, as  well as project managers and senior resident engineers at the  construction sites we visited. We reviewed and analyzed construction  documents, agency policy and guidance, previous VA reports, and  interviewed officials from VA, veterans support organizations, architecture  and engineering firms, general contractor construction firms, and  construction management firms. We also reviewed the Federal  Acquisition Regulations, VA\u2019s Strategic Plan, and GAO past reports. In  addition, we interviewed officials from the Naval Forces Engineering  Command and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to discuss their current  construction practices in major medical-facility projects.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2012 to April 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
