CMS has not provided sufficient oversight of these data or issued complete guidance to contractors on avoiding duplicative claims reviews.", "CMS requires its contractors to include certain content in postpayment review correspondence with providers, but some requirements vary across contractor types and are not always clear, and contractors vary in their compliance with their requirements. These factors can lead to providers receiving less information about the reviews and thus decrease effective communication with them. In addition, the extent of CMS's oversight of correspondence varies across contractors, which decreases assurance that contractors comply consistently with requirements. In the correspondence reviewed, GAO found high compliance rates for some requirements, such as citing the issues leading to an overpayment, but low compliance rates for requirements about communicating providers' rights, which could affect providers' ability to exercise their rights.", "CMS has strategies to coordinate internally among relevant offices regarding requirements for contractors' claims review activities. The agency also has strategies to facilitate coordination among contractors, such as requiring joint operating agreements between contractors operating in the same geographic area.

Because of its  size, complexity, and susceptibility to mismanagement and improper  payments, for more than 20 years we have designated Medicare as a  high-risk program. Improper Medicare payments include payments made  for treatments or services that were not covered by program rules, that  were not medically necessary, or that were not provided to beneficiaries  in the way that they were billed to Medicare. In fiscal year 2013, the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the  Medicare program\u2014made payments for about 1.2 billion fee-for-service  (FFS) claims and was estimated to have made improper payments of   $36 billion in the Medicare FFS program.", "CMS has a goal to reduce improper payments in the Medicare program  and conducts a number of activities in order to protect the integrity of the  program\u2014that is, to ensure that payments are made correctly the first  time and to identify, investigate, and recoup payments made in error. One  such activity is the review of FFS claims and related documentation from  providers after payment has been made. These postpayment claims  reviews by Medicare contractors\u2019 trained clinicians and coders can  determine if a claim was paid properly and may help determine if the  claim was potentially fraudulent. Currently, CMS uses several different  types of contractors to conduct postpayment claims reviews: Medicare  Administrative Contractors (MAC), which process and pay claims and  also recoup overpayments and remediate underpayments; Zone Program  Integrity Contractors (ZPIC), which investigate potential fraud; the  Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) contractor, which conducts  postpayment reviews as part of estimating Medicare\u2019s improper payment  rate; and Recovery Auditors (RA), which conduct postpayment reviews to  detect improper payments in claims not previously reviewed by staff from  other contractors. In 2012, the RAs conducted 83 percent of the roughly  1.4 million postpayment claims reviews conducted that year, with MACs,  ZPICs, and the CERT contractor conducting the remainder.", "The four types of contractors use the same general process for  conducting postpayment claims reviews: they select claims, request  documentation from providers to support Medicare coverage of those  claims, apply Medicare coverage and coding requirements to determine if  the claims were paid properly, communicate the results of their reviews to  the providers, and use quality assurance processes to help ensure the  quality and consistency of their reviewers\u2019 decisions. However, as we  reported in July 2013, these types of contractors were established by  different laws and for varying purposes, and they report to different units  within CMS. This presents challenges to CMS\u2019s coordination and  oversight of contractors\u2019 claims review efforts, including ensuring  consistency in the claims review process, and creates the potential for the  same claims to be reviewed more than once by different contractors.  Further, we also reported that CMS\u2019s requirements for many aspects of  the claims review process differ across the contractor types. Some of  these differences may impede the efficiency and effectiveness of  postpayment claims reviews and are inconsistent with federal guidelines  to streamline service delivery. In July 2013, we recommended that CMS  examine the postpayment review requirements for the contractors to  determine those that could be made more consistent without impeding  efforts to reduce improper payments. HHS concurred with the  recommendations in the report and CMS officials told us that they have  begun examining their requirements with the intention of increasing the  consistency of requirements where possible.", "In addition, questions have been raised recently about whether CMS\u2019s  coordination and oversight of postpayment review contractors provide  adequate assurance that the reviews are effective and efficient and  whether the agency is minimizing administrative burdens on providers.  CMS officials indicated that they consider duplicative claims reviews to be  appropriate under some circumstances. However, CMS officials consider  other duplicative claims reviews to be inappropriate; any such  inappropriate reviews could create an unnecessary burden on some  providers and contractors.

We assessed the Recovery Audit Data Warehouse data for this purpose  by reviewing relevant documents; conducting electronic data testing to  look for missing data, outliers, or obvious errors; and analyzing the data  to identify potentially duplicative reviews.

Following a demonstration of  recovery auditing required by the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Tax Relief and Health  Care Act of 2006 established the National RA program. Use of RAs  expands the capacity for claims reviews without placing additional  demands on CMS\u2019s budget, because the RAs are paid from funds  recovered rather than appropriated funds. As a result of lessons learned  during the RA demonstration project and to establish tighter controls on  RAs, CMS imposed certain postpayment requirements unique to the RAs  when it implemented the national program that it has not imposed on the  other contractors. For example, prior to widespread use, RAs must submit  to CMS for review and approval descriptions of the types of claims that  they propose to review. CMS expects the RAs to select only those claims  with the highest risk of improper payments. RAs must also submit the  basis for assessing whether the claims for those services are proper.  CMS established national RA operations in 2009 with one RA in each of  four regions that together cover the United States. Federal law requires  CMS to pay RAs on a contingency basis from Medicare overpayments  recouped. However, if an RA\u2019s overpayment determination is overturned  on appeal, the RA is not paid for that claim. In contrast, MACs, ZPICs,  and the CERT contractor are paid on the basis of the costs for the tasks  performed.

Since most of the postpayment claims reviews were conducted  by RAs, RA review would be most likely to cause any potential  duplications. To prevent RAs from duplicating reviews, the MACs, ZPICs,  the CERT contractor, and other entities can enter the claims they have  reviewed into the Recovery Audit Data Warehouse, and the database  stores them as excluded claims (or exclusions). Exclusions are  permanent, meaning that excluded claims are not supposed to ever be  available for review by the RAs. In addition, the ZPICs and law  enforcement entities, such as the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG),  can upload claims into the Recovery Audit Data Warehouse that they  may, but not necessarily will, select for postpayment review as part of a  fraud investigation and the database stores them as suppressions.While a claim is suppressed, it is unavailable for RA review. When a ZPIC  or law enforcement agency concludes its investigation, the suppressions  are required to be lifted. CMS then requires formerly suppressed claims  for which medical records were requested to be excluded and thus  become ineligible for RA review; all other formerly suppressed claims are  to be released for possible future postpayment review.

CMS conveys  requirements through statements of work contained in the contracts, and  in manuals that provide additional guidance on what contractors must do  and that may be specifically referenced in a statement of work. For ADRs  and results letters, we identified requirements in the RA statement of work  (which applies to RAs), the Medicare Program Integrity Manual, the  Medicare Contractor Beneficiary and Provider Communications Manual  (which applies to MACs and ZPICs), and the CERT Manual and CERT  statement of work (which apply to the CERT contractor). These  documents sometimes contained differing guidance about the information  the correspondence from different contractors must include. For example,  the RA statement of work in effect during our review specifically required  RA results letters to explain the procedures for recovering any  overpayments and providers\u2019 rights to appeal, but the Medicare Program  Integrity Manual did not include these requirements for RAs. CMS officials  told us that the RA statement of work was the primary guiding document  for RA requirements; however, they also told us that they were not  requiring the RAs to include some of the content requirements listed for  results letters in the RA statement of work. As another example, the  Medicare Program Integrity Manual contains some differing guidance to  the MACs about their ADRs. While chapter 3 of the Medicare Program  Integrity Manual instructs MACs to notify providers in ADRs that they  have 45 days to respond to the request for documentation, this manual  also includes a sample ADR that MACs may use for postpayment review  that includes language informing providers that they have 30 days to  respond to the documentation request. In addition, the Medicare  Program Integrity Manual\u2019s list of results letter requirements includes one  statement indicating that the MACs and ZPICs must include appeals  information in their results letters, as well as a different statement right  next to it indicating that only MACs must do so.", "Without consistent and specific requirements for the content across  contractor types, CMS does not have assurance that, consistent with  federal internal control standards, providers receive similar and sufficient  information during claims reviews to understand their responsibilities in  responding or their rights if their claims are denied. Establishing  consistent processes to communicate with providers is also aligned with  OMB guidance to agencies to streamline service delivery and improve  customer service, which can increase administrative efficiency. Further,  inconsistencies in CMS\u2019s requirements in contractors\u2019 statements of work  and the Medicare Program Integrity Manual could make it difficult for  contractors to easily identify the most current set of requirements that  apply to contractor correspondence.
