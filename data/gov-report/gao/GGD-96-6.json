IRS annually selects about 1,700 of the largest and most complex corporations for CEP. The remaining large corporations (about 45,000) may be audited under a separate IRS program\u2014the subject of this report.", "IRS has different ways to select corporations for audits. For small corporations, IRS uses a formula that measures the likelihood of changes to tax liability. This formula helps IRS objectively select returns for audits that are considered to be most likely to produce tax changes. IRS developed the formula by analyzing results of line-by-line audits of a random sample of tax returns. Once selected, a small corporation return is usually audited by an IRS revenue agent. In fiscal year 1994, IRS audited about 44,000 (1.8 percent) of 2.4 million income tax returns filed by small corporations.", "For CEP, IRS selects corporations on the basis of criteria for size, complexity, and the like. After considering its audit resources and manually reviewing the audit potential of every CEP return, IRS selects returns for audit. IRS audits CEP returns with teams of revenue agents and specialists, such as economists and engineers. Our 1992 report on CEP noted that IRS audited about 77 percent of the CEP returns for fiscal year 1991.", "The remaining large corporations (hereafter referred to as large corporations) are usually selected for audit on the basis of IRS agents\u2019 judgment, rather than through a scoring formula or specific criteria. In some cases, revenue agents at a service center select returns and send them to a district office to be audited; in other cases, all relevant returns are sent to the district office, where revenue agents choose those they will audit. Unlike with CEP returns, IRS usually uses a revenue agent (hereafter referred to as auditor) rather than a team to audit the returns from this segment of the large corporation universe. According to IRS Examination officials, these individual auditors recently have been using IRS specialists more than they have in the past.", "To give perspective on the sizes of these large corporations compared to other types of businesses, we analyzed average assets reported for 1992 (the most recent year of available data at IRS\u2019 Statistics of Income Division). Reported assets ranged from an average of about $0.4 million by small corporations to about $6.8 billion by CEP corporations. Within this wide range, the remaining large corporations reported an average of $130.7 million in assets as compared with partnerships, which reported an average of $1.3 million in assets.", "In recording the audit results for large corporations not part of CEP, IRS has created four classes according to asset size, ranging from $10 million to over $250 million. To facilitate our reporting of trends, we collapsed the four classes into two, (1) lower asset ($10 million to less than $100 million) and (2) higher asset ($100 million and over).

We used IRS data to eliminate CEP corporations.", "We used three IRS databases to meet our objectives. To analyze audit trends, we used Audit Information Management System (AIMS) data on large corporate audits closed in fiscal years 1988 through 1994. To compute the assessment rate, we computer-matched the AIMS data on recommended tax assessments to actual tax assessments on the Business Master File (BMF), which contains information about business tax returns. We tracked the BMF data through December 1994. To develop a profile of the large corporations, we obtained the 1992 Statistics of Income (SOI) file for corporations\u2014the most recent at the time we did our work.

Number of audits: The total number of audited returns increased about 3 percent (from 10,062 in 1988 to 10,392 in 1994), after peaking in 1991 at 11,962. This increase largely involved corporations with less than $50 million in assets. The number of audited returns for higher asset corporations fluctuated but decreased 16 percent between 1988 and 1994, particularly in 1989 and 1990. (Refer to table II.1.) 2. Audit coverage: Audit coverage rose from 23 percent in 1988 to 24 percent in 1994, after peaking at 28 percent in 1991. Coverage varied by asset class. It decreased (especially from 1991 to 1992) from 43 percent to 31 percent for higher asset corporations, and it increased from 18 percent to 22 percent for those with lower assets after peaking in 1991 at 25 percent. (Refer to table II.2.) 3. Direct audit hours: A comparison of 1988 and 1994 shows that IRS invested 25 percent more hours in auditing large corporations, particularly those with lower assets. Audit hours decreased for higher asset corporations, particularly 1988 through 1990. (Refer to table II.3.) 4. Direct audit hours per return: This ratio increased 21 percent from 1988 to 1994, driven by audits of lower asset corporations. Their ratio increased 43 percent compared to 14 percent for higher asset corporations. On average, IRS spent twice as long auditing a return with higher assets compared to those with lower assets\u2014184 hours versus 89 hours, respectively. (Refer to table II.4.) 5. Additional recommended taxes: This amount increased 16 percent from about $1.6 billion in 1988 to $1.9 billion in 1994. It also increased for both types of corporations. The amount peaked in 1992 for lower asset corporations and fluctuated year to year for higher asset corporations while peaking in 1993. IRS Examination officials explained that a few large audits produced the peaks in 1991 and 1993. In 1994 constant dollars, however, recommended taxes decreased 4 percent between 1988 and 1994. (Refer to table II.5 for current dollar data on additional taxes recommended and table V.1 for 1994 constant dollars.) 6. Additional recommended taxes per return: As with recommended taxes, this ratio increased overall and for both categories of corporations. It rose 12 percent from about $160,000 in 1988 to $180,000 in 1994 (after reaching $242,000 in 1993). Higher asset corporations drove this increase as its ratio increased 38 percent after declining in 1992 and 1994. Although IRS audited fewer of their returns, IRS recommended a relatively higher amount of taxes. In 1994 constant dollars, recommended taxes per return decreased 7 percent between 1988 and 1994. (Refer to table II.6 and table V.3 for details.) 7. Additional recommended taxes per audit hour: The overall ratio decreased 7 percent from $1,409 in 1988 to $1,313 per hour in 1994. Although the ratio rose for corporations with higher assets, this rise was more than offset by a declining ratio for those with lower assets. In 1994 constant dollars, the overall ratio decreased 23 percent from 1988 to 1994. (Refer to tables II.7 and V.4.)", "IRS Examination officials offered reasons for the increase in direct audit hours outpacing increases in audit coverage and recommended taxes after 1988. IRS has been auditing more complex returns and using more IRS specialists. Both steps took more time and reduced coverage. Also, many auditors have needed more time as they gradually shifted from auditing corporate tax shelters to auditing the whole large corporation return. On the other hand, recommended amounts can be reduced by economic downturns. They also cited 1986 tax law changes that took away audit issues (e.g., investment tax credit) with relatively high yield for a small time investment and that lowered corporate tax rates, affecting additional recommended taxes in later years.", "We also analyzed trends in audit closures. The large corporations agreed with higher portions of recommended tax amounts from 1988 to 1994 (34 percent by 1994), but they continued to appeal most amounts (66 percent by 1994). Although they had similar trends over the 7 years, higher asset corporations agreed, on average, with 21 percent of all recommended amounts while lower asset corporations agreed with 33 percent (see table II.9). Even so, large corporations increasingly agreed with most audits (52 percent for 1994) that recommended taxes (see table II.8). In sum, they tended to agree with small tax amounts recommended in many audits but appeal larger amounts recommended in fewer audits.", "Audits that end with no change to taxes owed could have adjustments (e.g., reduced a reported net operating loss but not enough to produce a tax liability) or no adjustments. IRS views the former as productive and the latter as unproductive. The no-change trends differed. Those with adjustments dropped from 28 percent to 16 percent; those without adjustments increased from 8 to 16 percent. The without adjustments rate had reached 18 percent for lower asset corporations and 10 percent for those with higher assets by 1994.", "IRS Examination officials said they would like to see the no-change rate without adjustments fall below 10 percent. They believed that this rate will start falling as IRS closes ongoing audits that they viewed as more productive. For example, they believed that their investment in audits of more complex returns will start shifting more no-change audits to audits that recommend taxes. Also, more auditors have now learned how to audit large corporations, not just tax shelters. Even so, these officials still want better systems for selecting and classifying (i.e., finding issues that need to be audited) returns. In recognizing this need, they convened task forces during 1994 to overcome such problems with large corporation audits. These task forces are slated to last through 1996.", "See appendix II for detailed information about these trends and IRS\u2019 explanations and appendix V for trends for recommended tax amounts in constant dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment Rate", "paragraphs": ["In tracking taxes recommended for large corporations from 1988 through 1994, we found that the final assessment had been recorded for $8.6 billion of $12 billion in net recommended taxes. Our computer match, involving about 56,000 audited returns, showed that IRS assessed $2.3 billion of the $8.6 billion (27 percent) through December 1994. In computing this rate, we subtracted the tax refunds recommended from the additional taxes recommended for these audited returns.", "The assessment rate was similar for higher and lower asset corporations\u201426 percent and 28 percent, respectively. The rate, however, differed widely by the four asset classes, ranging from 20 percent to 38 percent. By IRS district, the assessment rate ranged from over 100 percent to less than 1 percent.", "The reasons for these wide variations were not apparent in the IRS databases we used to compute the assessment rates. Our work has shown that various factors can cause the rate to exceed 100 percent, such as IRS Appeals assessing more taxes than recommended by the auditors. Also, the rates can drop whenever corporate claims for refunds or net operating losses from other tax years reduce or offset taxes that were recommended in the audit.", "Nor did IRS Examination officials know the reasons for the wide variation in the rates. They noted that the lowest rates occurred in two regions and they are starting to pinpoint the reasons. We also plan to explore these reasons during a follow-on review.", "Our discussions with IRS Examination officials disclosed possible reasons for low rates. These officials pointed to nonaudit factors that can lower the assessment rate, even if auditors supported the taxes recommended. They cited retroactive tax law changes, court decisions that affect the recommended taxes, and other tax abatements. In addition, they said IRS Appeals can concede recommended taxes to avoid the hazards of litigation or because the corporation provides new information that swayed Appeals\u2019 decision; this information could have dissuaded the auditors from recommending the taxes. These officials did not know the extent to which these factors lowered the assessment rate, given limitations in IRS\u2019 databases. For this reason, our 1994 report on CEP recommended corrections to IRS\u2019 databases.", "In sum, IRS Examination officials cautioned against misinterpreting the assessment rates. Because of these nonaudit factors, they believed that the rates reflect more about the tax system and economic fluctuations than the effectiveness of the audits. Appendix III provides details on assessment rates and IRS\u2019 explanations.", "We also computed the assessment rate for just the additional taxes recommended (i.e., excluding audits recommending refunds). That rate equalled 38 percent. IRS had estimated a similar assessment rate on just the additional taxes recommended for audits closed in fiscal years 1992 through 1994\u201436 percent.", "Regardless of which type of assessment rate is considered, we did not attempt to track how much of the assessed taxes were ultimately collected. IRS Finance officials provided data indicating that IRS collected 23 percent of the taxes recommended and 68 percent of the taxes assessed as of July 1995 for the audits closed in fiscal years 1992 through 1994. IRS based these results on data being tracked in a new system. We plan to analyze the data and methodology being used in this system during the second phase of our work.", "Whenever audits recommend additional taxes that go unassessed, IRS can miss opportunities to invest audit resources more productively, and large corporations can incur more costs to challenge those recommendations. Data on many of these costs were not available. Using only the direct audit costs, we calculated that IRS recommended $56 and assessed $15 in taxes for each dollar directly spent on auditing large corporations from 1988 through 1994. These calculations exclude indirect audit costs (e.g., overhead), IRS costs outside of audits (e.g., appeals and litigation processes to settle on assessed tax amounts), and corporations\u2019 costs. It is important to recognize that these ratios provide just one indicator of IRS\u2019 audit activities. The ratios do not account for the costs and taxes associated with what IRS calls revenue protection. For example, IRS may audit various corporate claims for tax refunds to determine whether the claims are proper. In doing so, IRS protects the government\u2019s revenue. Auditors disallowed $202 million in claims by large corporations during 1994 in addition to the $1.9 billion they recommended in taxes. In 1991\u2014the first year for which IRS tracked protected tax revenue\u2014IRS auditors denied $212 million of these claims.", "To provide perspective, we computed a similar ratio for all IRS audits. Although not readily available for assessed taxes, data were available in IRS\u2019 1996 budget to compute the ratio of recommended taxes to the costs of all IRS audits. Our computations showed that the ratio has been about $16 in recommended taxes to $1 in audit costs (including indirect costs) for recent years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Profiles of Large Corporations", "paragraphs": ["According to 1992 income tax returns, over 60 percent of the large corporations were engaged in manufacturing or in the finance/insurance industry.

While generally agreeing with the trends we analyzed, these officials had comments on our draft. In addition to technical comments that we have incorporated where appropriate, they offered comments on three major issues.", "First, they pointed to various efforts undertaken to correct problems with large corporation audits. The major effort entails studying ways to improve the selection of returns for audit. Our letter now refers to these efforts.", "Second, they suggested explanations for some trends. For example, they offered various reasons for the increases in audit coverage and additional recommended taxes lagging behind the increase in direct audit time. They noted that IRS has been investing time in auditing more complex issues and in using IRS specialists. They viewed this investment as necessary and as likely to pay off soon. They also cited tax law changes in 1986 and the transition in the early 1990s from auditing corporate tax shelters to all large corporate tax issues. Both factors had dampening effects on recommended tax amounts after 1988, according to these officials. They suggested that these factors, in combination with auditing more complex returns, also contributed to IRS closing more audits with neither changes to taxes owed nor adjustments to taxable income. While we did not validate IRS\u2019 suggested explanations, we have added them to the letter and related appendixes.", "Third, they asked for clarification on the 27 percent assessment rate. Although our draft report had not labelled this rate as a measure of audit effectiveness, they wanted cautions noted. They said the rate should not be used as such a measure because of nonaudit factors (e.g., net operating losses from other tax years that offset audit yield). They did not know the extent to which these factors affected the rate but they believed that the rate was just as likely to be the product of the tax and economic systems, which they have little control over, rather than of the audits. We have added their comments about the potential effects of these nonaudit factors on the rates.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and other interested parties.
