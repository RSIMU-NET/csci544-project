The CMS-64 and MSIS have the potential to offer a robust view of payments, overall spending, and services in the Medicaid program; however, GAO found that the usefulness of these data is limited because of issues with completeness, accuracy, and timeliness.", "Available expenditure data do not provide complete or accurate information on how states finance their portion of program costs, such as complete data on the sources or amounts of local government funds used to finance states' share of Medicaid costs, thus complicating CMS's ability to assess the appropriateness of states' financing.", "Available utilization data, particularly for Medicaid managed care, are incomplete and are reported up to 3 years late, complicating CMS's ability to identify billing patterns that indicate inappropriate provider behavior or ensure that beneficiaries have access to covered services.", "CMS has acknowledged the need for improved Medicaid data and cites the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) as its key initiative to improve Medicaid data and program oversight. T-MSIS includes aspects aimed at improving the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of state data available to CMS, yet uncertainty remains as to when these data will be available from all states as implementation has been delayed for several years. As of October 2016, 18 states were submitting T-MSIS data. Although CMS officials were uncertain when the remaining states would begin submitting data, they estimated that states representing over 70 percent of the Medicaid population would be submitting T-MSIS data by the end of calendar year 2016. CMS officials identified several factors contributing to states' delayed T-MSIS implementation, such as coinciding with the ongoing efforts of over 30 states to redesign or replace their Medicaid information technology systems. Moreover, CMS has not fully developed its plans to ensure the quality of T-MSIS data, and its plans for using these data for oversight purposes remain preliminary. Through rulemaking and other guidance, CMS has taken other actions to improve data; however, given that these actions have recently or not yet been implemented, it is unclear how they will affect CMS's oversight. CMS's continued reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, and untimely data, and the ongoing uncertainty about the scope and timing of its remedial actions, hamper effective oversight and are inconsistent with federal internal control standards, which require entities to rely on quality and timely information to oversee their programs and take timely actions to improve deficiencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS take immediate steps to improve Medicaid data available for program oversight, such as expediting efforts to assess and ensure the quality of T-MSIS data.

Within broad federal guidelines and under  federally approved plans, states have some discretion in setting Medicaid  eligibility standards and provider payment rates; determining the amount,  scope, and duration of covered benefits, and how these benefits are  delivered; and developing their own administrative structures. For  example, states may pay health care providers for each service they  provide on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis; contract with managed care  organizations (MCO) to provide a specific set of Medicaid-covered  services to beneficiaries and pay them a set amount per beneficiary per  month; or rely on a combination of both delivery systems. This flexibility  has influenced the development of the program and has resulted in over  50 distinct state-based programs that vary in how health care is delivered,  financed, reimbursed, and overseen.", "Medicaid expenditures are financed by both the federal government and  the states. The rate at which the federal government matches most state  expenditures\u2014the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)\u2014also  varies by state and by beneficiary eligibility type, which also contributes to  program variation. Specifically, the federal government pays a higher  portion of Medicaid expenditures in states with low per capita incomes  relative to the national average, and pays different portions for  expenditures for beneficiaries qualifying for Medicaid under traditional  eligibility rules and those qualifying under a PPACA expansion. The  resulting variation complicates program oversight efforts, which are  shared by the federal government and the states, and are aimed, in part,  at ensuring that funds are used appropriately and that enrollees have  access to covered benefits. (See table 1.)", "To help inform its oversight, CMS relies on data that states submit from  their respective Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS).  MMIS are claims processing and information retrieval systems that  support the administration of the program, which states are required to  implement in order to receive federal matching funds. Two data sets  derived from state MMIS provide CMS with state data on program  expenditures and utilization.", "The CMS-64 contains service expenditures and administrative  expenses that are not linked to individual enrollees. State Medicaid  agencies must submit this information each quarter 30 days after a  quarter has ended. CMS-64 data are reported at a state aggregate  level, such as a state\u2019s total expenditures for such categories as  inpatient hospital services and prescription drugs, and are the basis  for determining federal reimbursements to states for Medicaid  expenditures.

In addition to identifying  failure to report encounter data, this file could help CMS\u2019s  oversight by allowing the agency to identify excess plan  profit and volatility of expenditures for some enrollee  groups across states.", "In addition to the data variables associated with the three new  files, CMS expanded the scope of data to be collected through  the existing MSIS files. For example, according to CMS  officials, T-MSIS is to collect more detailed information on  enrollees, including their citizenship, immigration, and disability  status, as well as expanded diagnosis and procedure codes  associated with their treatments.", "Accuracy: Within T-MSIS, there exist aspects aimed at improving the  accuracy of data initially submitted by states. For example, T-MSIS  includes approximately 3,500 automated quality checks, which  provide states with feedback on data format and consistency, in  contrast to MSIS, which has relatively few automated checks. T-MSIS  quality checks include ensuring that a beneficiary\u2019s date of birth is a  valid date and that a beneficiary\u2019s age is under a reasonable limit.  Other quality checks are to ensure logical relationships across T- MSIS files, such as ensuring that the beginning date of service on  claims are on or after a beneficiary\u2019s date of birth.

For example, the rule requires states to include provisions regarding  the maintenance of encounter data in contracts with MCOs and  limited benefit plans, to have procedures in place to ensure that  enrollee encounter data these entities submit are complete and  accurate, and includes financial consequences for lack of  compliance. Although MCOs have been expressly required to report  encounter data under statute since 2010, CMS\u2019s May 2016 rule  provides more clarity regarding the format and collection of these  data. However, because these rules will not take effect until 2017 and  2018, their success in improving data is dependent on state and CMS  implementation. In addition, the managed care rule increases and  clarifies state responsibilities related to overseeing payments to and  by MCOs, which addresses a GAO recommendation that CMS hold  states accountable for managed care program integrity by requiring  them to conduct audits of MCOs. In particular, the managed care  rule requires that states, at least once every 3 years, audit encounter  and financial data submitted by MCOs.", "A December 2015 final rule includes more targeted financial  consequences for states that do not comply with data submission  requirements, including T-MSIS.

According  to CMS officials, the agency is producing data quality reports for internal  users and anticipates sharing such reports with the public in 2017. While  CMS officials identified seven broad priority areas for assessing the  quality of the data\u2014eligibility, expenditures, all utilization, FFS utilization,  managed care utilization, providers, and third party liability\u2014they have  not yet delineated priorities within these areas for further review or  identified specific data variables for priority validation\u2014associated with  improper payments or otherwise. Nonetheless, CMS officials noted that  they have taken some steps to address the quality of state data. For  example, in addition to the automated front-end data quality checks, the  agency\u2019s contractor has developed 2,000 quality measures to determine  whether data are within expected ranges. For instance, if a state\u2019s data  suggested a Medicaid population that is 70 percent male, CMS would  examine the data further as its data indicate the Medicaid population is  predominantly female. CMS officials emphasized that they continue to  develop processes to ensure data quality and expect to identify trends in  the data that would allow them to develop new quality checks or  determine which checks are no longer relevant.

T-MSIS includes aspects  aimed at improving the quality of state data available to CMS, yet  uncertainty remains as to when these data will be available from all  states; how CMS will ensure their quality; or how CMS will use these data  for oversight purposes.

In its written  comments, HHS concurred with our recommendation and acknowledged  the importance of having robust, timely, and accurate data to ensure the  highest financial and program performance in the Medicaid program.

Further, HHS noted its  ongoing efforts to work with states to ensure compliance with T-MSIS  reporting requirements, reduce reporting errors, and improve the quality  of their data submissions. HHS also provided a technical comment, which  we incorporated.
