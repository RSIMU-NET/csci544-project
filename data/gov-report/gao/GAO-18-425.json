Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) guidance indicates that Title IX coordinators\u2014which school districts are required to designate and make visible per regulations for Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments (Title IX)\u2014should work closely with athletics administrators to determine whether action is needed to address any underrepresentation, or to otherwise encourage equal athletic opportunities. However, GAO estimates that 51 percent of athletics administrators either were unaware of or unsupported by their Title IX coordinator, according to the survey (see figure). These findings raise questions as to whether Title IX coordinators are familiar with and using Education's guidance. Officials from an association for Title IX coordinators said this lack of communication with athletics administrators may be related to some Title IX coordinators' limited understanding of Title IX and athletics. OCR officials said that they did not know the extent to which Title IX coordinators are working with their athletics administrators to encourage equal athletic opportunities because Education generally does not collect this information. Better information on Title IX coordinators could help Education support school districts' efforts to encourage equal sports opportunities for girls and boys.", "The factors that most affect boys' and girls' participation in public high school sports are the number of, and interest in, participation opportunities offered, according to GAO's survey and interviews with nine subject matter specialists.

For example, when scheduling  practice times and competitions, five athletics administrators said that  they scheduled a boys\u2019 competition only if they could also schedule a  girls\u2019 competition. Four athletics administrators described watching  practices, inspecting equipment to identify when it needed replacement,  or replacing equipment as their coaches requested it. Four athletics  administrators said that coaches can sometimes influence the distribution  of resources. For instance, one athletics administrator noted that in the  past, his school had unequal facilities for boys\u2019 baseball and girls\u2019 softball,  stemming in part from the boys\u2019 baseball coach being a stronger  advocate for his team. However, these athletics administrators generally  described working with the coaches to ensure that resource allocation did  not create inequalities.", "Most schools reported using a mix of public and private funds to support  their athletic programs. An estimated 75 percent of public high schools  received public funding (state or local) for their sports programs; for some  individual sports or school athletics programs, public funding may be the  primary funding source. We estimate that about 52 percent of schools  that received public funding monitored or directed its use to help  encourage equal resources for boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 teams. OCR\u2019s Title IX  Resource Guide encourages Title IX coordinators to periodically review  expenditures on male and female athletic teams as part of their review of  resources. At four schools, athletics administrators told us that they paid  attention to the actual resources girls and boys received rather than  focusing on expenditures, and three of these administrators explained  there could be valid reasons for spending differences. For example, one  athletics director said that both boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 hockey teams at his  school participated in annual tournaments, but the girls preferred a  tournament that did not require a hotel stay, so it was less expensive.", "In addition, we estimate that about 81 percent of public high schools had  at least one booster club and, according to our survey, an estimated 51  percent of these schools monitored or directed the club to encourage  equal opportunities. Among the eight athletics administrators we  interviewed, relationships with booster clubs varied. For instance, some  issued booster club guidelines and approved their purchases in advance,  while others had no oversight of booster club expenditures. For  example, one athletics administrator told us that he provides booster club  presidents with written guidelines and approves purchases to make sure  they do not create a Title IX compliance issue. Another athletics  administrator\u2019s school had recently undergone negotiations to obtain  access to booster club expenditure records for the first time so that they  could regularly review those expenditures. OCR has stated in compliance  decisions, and OCR officials confirmed to us in interviews, that it  considers resources provided through the use of private funds, including  booster funding, in assessing whether schools are providing equivalent  resources to teams of each sex.

This guidance states that the Title IX coordinator should  support and work closely with members of the school community,  including athletics administrators, to ensure compliance with Title IX.  When asked about these survey results, officials from an association for  Title IX coordinators and for other related administrators told us that they  were not surprised that a number of athletics administrators were not  aware of or supported by their Title IX coordinator, because the results  are consistent with what they hear when interacting with their members  across the country. Based on these interactions, these association  officials said they have observed that there is often a separation between  athletics and other school departments, and that Title IX coordinators  without an athletics background may be reluctant to engage in oversight  of that department.", "Based on their experiences providing training to Title IX coordinators,  these association officials also said that Title IX coordinators\u2019 familiarity  with Title IX requirements has improved somewhat since the release of  OCR\u2019s 2015 guidance delineating their role and responsibilities, but their  familiarity with these requirements is still generally low, particularly with  respect to athletics. In these officials\u2019 opinion, this lack of understanding is  due in part to the complex and wide-ranging nature of Title IX and to the  lack of resources for training in many school districts. These and other  subject matter specialists we interviewed said that other potential factors  contributing to athletics administrators\u2019 lack of awareness of their Title IX  coordinator included high turnover among athletics administrators and  myriad responsibilities of staff in both roles. When Title IX coordinators do  not work closely with athletics administrators, as OCR guidance suggests  they do, they may miss opportunities to make those administrators aware  of tools the guidance recommends that could help advance equal  opportunities. In addition, OCR guidance recognizes that the most serious  Title IX violations tend to occur in districts without a supportive Title IX  coordinator.", "OCR officials said that they had learned from their complaint  investigations and compliance reviews that some athletics administrators  were not working with their districts\u2019 Title IX coordinators. However, these  officials said they did not know the extent to which Title IX coordinators  themselves were aware of and using the tools recommended in their  guidance because, outside of these enforcement activities, OCR  generally does not collect information on Title IX coordinators\u2019 knowledge  of or activities related to the guidance. Standards for internal control in  the federal government state that agencies should both obtain quality  information from and communicate quality information to external parties  to help achieve the agency\u2019s objectives and address risks.

We estimate that  over 70 percent of athletics administrators viewed the number of  interscholastic athletic participation opportunities at their school as  encouraging boys and girls to participate in high school sports (see fig.  5).", "Our 2017 report on high school sports access and participation found that  in school year 2013-14, public high schools overall offered the same  number of sports and teams for boys and girls. Of the nine subject  matter specialists we interviewed for this report, six described specific  knowledge of factors that encourage or discourage participation in high  school sports. All six of these subject matter specialists agreed that  opportunity is an important factor affecting student participation,  especially for girls; several specialists also said that the continued  participation gap shows that girls do not have access to an equal number  of roster spots on teams as boys. For example, one researcher, as well  as a representative of a national association of athletics administrators,  suggested that one reason the gap between boys and girls persists is that  schools do not offer girls\u2019 sports with roster sizes equivalent to popular  boys\u2019 sports, such as football. One of the eight athletics administrators  said that this was the case at her school, noting that none of her girls\u2019  teams came close to the size of the football teams. The gap may be  particularly acute for minority girls, according to one subject matter  specialist. Our 2017 report on public high school sports access and  participation found that, for both boys and girls, fewer students attended  high minority and high poverty schools that offered sports, compared to  students at other schools, and these schools had lower participation rates  when they did offer sports.", "We estimate that over 75 percent of athletics administrators viewed the  level of student interest in the sports offered by their school as  encouraging participation in their school\u2019s teams. Several subject matter  specialists agreed that offering sports that align with students\u2019 specific  interests is an important aspect of providing meaningful opportunities, but  a few also noted that some schools fail to consider which sports most  interest their female students.", "We estimate that 70 percent or more of athletics administrators viewed  student interest in working with certain coaches as a factor that  encouraged participation at their school. As explained by one researcher,  coaching quality plays a large role in encouraging high school sports  participation and a good coach can pull students into a sport and keep  them participating. Alternatively, another researcher noted that less  qualified or inexperienced coaches depress participation. These views  are consistent with our work, in which we reported that the quality of  coaching is a key factor in maximizing the positive effects of sports  participation on students\u2019 personal development.", "In addition, research shows that the state of athletic facilities can also  affect a student\u2019s choice to participate in high school sports, and a few  athletics administrators and subject matter specialists we interviewed also  cited this as a factor. For example, one study found that proximity to  sports facilities was a factor predicting children\u2019s participation in team  sports. Another study found that student participation in interscholastic  sports is higher at schools with more sports facilities compared with  schools that have few sports facilities. A few of the subject matter  specialists and one athletics administrator made similar observations  about the relationship between facilities, participation, and inequity. For  example, the athletics administrator said that at his high school, baseball  and softball participation has decreased because their athletic facilities  are located off campus, requiring additional travel for both students and  parents for practices and games. Additionally, representatives from two  advocacy groups noted that parents may have concerns related to school  sports facilities, particularly for the safety of their daughters. For example,  one said that some schools have girls\u2019 teams practice in off-campus  facilities, sometimes in unsafe neighborhoods, without offering  transportation. The other said parents may be concerned when fields are  insufficiently lit or their daughters come home late from practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Related to Family and Community Resources and Cultural Expectations May Discourage Participation in Sports", "paragraphs": ["We found no clear consensus in our survey of athletics administrators  regarding factors that tend to discourage students from participating in  sports, and the eight athletic administrators we interviewed had mixed  views on the subject. That said, the most frequently mentioned factors  that were perceived to discourage participation (representing an  estimated 15-35 percent of athletic administrators) were (1) competing  responsibilities, (2) lack of access to athletic feeder programs, (3) the  perceived benefits of joining club teams, and (4) participation costs to the  student.", "Competing responsibilities. Over one-quarter of athletics  administrators cited students\u2019 competing responsibilities as  discouraging participation in public high school sports. This could  include a range of responsibilities, including schoolwork, other school  activities, and family obligations. Among the athletic administrators we  interviewed, one noted that many students at his magnet school were  more focused on academics than athletics. A few cited examples of  competing responsibilities that were tied to family resources. For  example, two said that many of their students have jobs and family  responsibilities that prevent them from participating in sports. One of  these administrators said that his school\u2019s student population largely  comes from lower-income families, and many are juggling jobs; in  response, the school changed practice schedules to better match  students\u2019 availability, which has made it easier for more students to  participate.", "Lack of access to athletic feeder programs. Some athletics  administrators also mentioned a lack of access to athletic feeder  programs\u2014club or community-based youth sports programs that train  younger children before they enter high school\u2014as discouraging  participation in sports at their public high schools. In addition, a few of  the eight athletics administrators we interviewed saw this lack of  access as being closely related to community or family resources.  Two of these administrators, who worked in lower-income schools,  reported that younger children in their area have very little access to  community or club sports and that students who do not have previous  exposure to sports may lack the skills to participate at the high school  level. One of these administrators also said that having more  community youth sports might increase student interest in playing at  the high school level. A third athletics administrator said that feeder  programs help drive participation in high school sports. In his school\u2019s  competitive environment, students trying out for sports for the first  time when they get to high school are, in most cases, likely to be cut  from the team. He added that he has found that family income is a  major contributing factor to children\u2019s ability to begin training early,  which puts lower income students at a disadvantage. His point was  echoed in one research study that found that as family income  increases, boys and girls tend to enter organized sports at a younger  age.", "Perceived benefits of joining club teams. Athletics administrators  also mentioned the presence of club teams that students may choose  over school teams as discouraging participation in public high school  teams. This may be particularly true for higher-income students, as  competitive travel and club teams\u2014which parents and students may  see as offering higher-caliber coaching, more specialized training, and  greater opportunities to compete against elite athletes\u2014can be quite  expensive. Several subject matter specialists we interviewed cited this  as an issue that affects high school sports participation. Further, a few  of the high school athletics administrators we interviewed observed  decreased student participation at their schools due to the presence  of club teams. One athletics administrator from the Southwest  explained that participation is weaker for his school\u2019s Olympic sports,  such as swimming, due to competition from club sports. He noted that  at his high school, this phenomenon makes it more difficult to recruit  other students because the school teams become less competitive.  Another athletics administrator from the Midwest explained that at his  high school, the presence of club sports disproportionally depressed  girls\u2019 participation in high school sports. In particular, he said the  popularity of club girls\u2019 volleyball in the winter reduced participation in  his girls\u2019 basketball teams.", "Participation costs. The cost to students of participating in athletics  was also mentioned by some athletics administrators as discouraging  participation in public high school teams. The subject matter  specialists and athletics administrators we interviewed had mixed  views on the effect of costs on student participation. Among the  subject matter specialists, two said that the increasing prevalence of  fees in high school sports programs is threatening participation by  lower-income students. One athletics administrator agreed, saying  that in the past he has dissuaded his school district from charging  participation fees for this reason. Another said that his school does  not charge fees, but students could still be discouraged by the  fundraising required for \u201cextras\u201d such as team t-shirts. In contrast, one  subject matter specialist said that it is typically higher-income schools  that charge students fees to participate in sports, and therefore fees  do not generally affect students in lower-income schools.", "In addition to the four most commonly cited barriers from our survey,  several research studies noted that cultural expectations around family  responsibilities and gender roles may also discourage some student  groups more than others. For example, one study found that Hispanic  girls quit sports to take care of younger siblings at higher rates than their  white peers. This and another study noted that students from recent  immigrant families may also be discouraged from participating in sports  because of different cultural expectations around prioritizing sports, and  girls may be additionally affected by expectations around gender roles.  For example, it found that immigrant parents are more likely than non- immigrant parents to believe that boys are more interested in sports than  girls, and that 75 percent of immigrant sons were involved with organized  or team sports compared with 43 percent of immigrant daughters.  Similarly, a study of sports involvement among East African immigrant  girls found that those the researchers interviewed face social barriers to  participation, such as peer criticism, parents\u2019 fears of interactions with  male athletes, and lack of parental support.", "Several of the subject matter specialists and athletics administrators with  whom we spoke made similar observations around cultural expectations.  One suggested that differences in sports participation among immigrant  communities may stem from the opportunities to play sports in the  family\u2019s country of origin, noting that the United States is unique in tying  sports teams to its academic institutions. Officials from two advocacy  organizations, one of which advocates for the Hispanic community, noted that some Hispanic families expect daughters to come home after  school to help care for their siblings. This can interfere with participating  in after-school activities. In addition, one athletics administrator we  interviewed, whose school serves a predominantly Hispanic community,  commented that his coaches have seen girls from this community quit  sports teams on several occasions due to family responsibilities. One of  the advocacy organization officials added that schools wanting to improve  participation among Hispanic girls should, for example, consider more  creative scheduling to allow these students to attend practices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While sports participation for girls has risen dramatically over the last 45  years, a significant gap still remains between boys and girls in public high  school sports.

The activities that OCR described in its  response are predicated on a complaint being filed or technical  assistance being requested. This narrow approach means that OCR will  likely not learn the full extent to which K-12 Title IX coordinators are  unaware of or not using the tools in OCR\u2019s guidance. It also means that  its reviews of the agency\u2019s communication practices may be hampered by  incomplete information on how best to encourage Title IX coordinators to  use these tools and work with athletics administrators to ensure equal  opportunities.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

To  address these objectives, we used a variety of methods, including a web- based survey of public high school athletics administrators; follow-up  interviews with eight survey respondents; reviews of federal law,  regulations, and guidance; and interviews with federal officials at the  Department of Education (Education) and with subject matter specialists."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Web-based Survey of Public High School Athletics Administrators", "paragraphs": ["To obtain school-level perspectives on factors that affect boys\u2019 and girls\u2019  participation levels in public high school sports programs and approaches  schools and athletics administrators have used to encourage equal  athletic opportunities, we designed and administered a survey to athletics  administrators at a generalizable, stratified random sample of public high  schools in the United States. The survey included questions about what  sports and levels of competition the school offered for each sex, how  many boys and girls participated in sports in school year 2015-16, and  factors that encourage and discourage girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 sports participation  at the school. The survey also included a variety of questions related to  the school\u2019s and athletics administrator\u2019s activities to encourage equal  opportunities in the prior 2 years, challenges they faced in encouraging  equal opportunities, sources of guidance on Title IX, booster club  structures and oversight, and data they maintained on funding and  expenditures. In addition, it included a question on whether, to the  athletics administrator\u2019s knowledge, their school district had a Title IX  coordinator.", "Our population of interest for the survey was athletics administrators at  public high schools. In terms of the schools, we defined our target  population as public schools offering at least one high school level grade  (9, 10, 11, or 12) that appeared in both Education\u2019s Common Core of  Data (CCD) and Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) for the 2013-14  school year, were located in the 50 states and the District of Columbia,  and indicated in the CRDC that they offered interscholastic sports. We  excluded schools that were listed as closed or not operational according  to the school year 2015-16 CCD, as well as single-sex schools and  schools located in U.S. territories. We also obtained the most current  school contact information from the school year 2015-16 CCD.", "We originally selected a stratified random sample of 813 from a  population of 15,330 schools in our sampling frame. However, we  ultimately excluded 26 schools from our original population and sample  because they had closed, did not serve high school grades, or did not  offer interscholastic sports, and thus were not considered eligible for our  survey. In addition, we found schools in the population and sample that  shared sports programs and athletics administrators, effectively reducing  the population by 10 schools and the sample by 3 schools for purposes of  our survey. This resulted in a sample of 784 schools from the eligible  population of 15,294.", "We stratified this sample based on school type (charter or traditional),  concentration of minority students (low = 0-25 percent, mid = 26-74  percent, high = 75-100 percent),  locale type (urban, suburban, or rural),  and participation rates of male and female students in school year 2013- 14. This created 24 strata as noted in table 1. For the participation rate  strata, we calculated each school\u2019s male and female students\u2019  participation rates using data from the school year 2013-14 CRDC.  Participation rates were defined as the number of sports participants of  that gender divided by the number of enrolled students of that gender,  and these rates were then compared to determine which gender had  higher participation: females or males. We placed schools with equal  participation rates for males and females into the \u201cFemales\u201d participation  category because, given the overall higher participation rates for boys, schools with both equal participation rates and higher rates for girls are  rarer.", "We chose these strata to ensure schools with the stratum characteristics  were included in the sample. The total sample size of n=813 was inflated  for an expected 60 percent response rate, and we distributed the sample  across the strata for workload and analysis considerations. The sample  size in table 1 optimizes for some groups, while controlling the distribution  across the 24 strata. Specifically, we calculated the Neyman optimal  sample size that resulted in an overall 5 percent margin of error for an  attribute estimate. We allocated samples across strata to achieve  precision goals at two levels: overall population percentage estimates  with margins of errors within plus or minus 5 percentage points, and  subpopulation percentage estimates (i.e. school type, minority level,  locale, or participation group) with margins of errors within plus or minus  10 percentage points, both at the 95 percent confidence level.  Additionally, we ensured a minimum sample of 10 schools in every  stratum.", "Based solely on the constraint of an overall margin of error within plus or  minus 5 percentage points, some reporting groups were expected to have  margins of errors that were less than 10 percentage points without the  need of additional explicit constraints. For other reporting groups, we  implemented constraints so that the designed margin of error was within  plus or minus 10 percentage points. Specifically, we included the  following constraints for margins of error of attribute estimates with 95  percent confidence intervals within each reporting group, for a realized  response rate of 60 percent: margins of error within plus or minus 5 percentage points overall, within plus or minus 10 percentage points for urban schools, within plus or minus 10 percentage points for high minority schools, within plus or minus 10 percentage points for charter schools.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we expressed our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 7  percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  Unless otherwise noted, all percentage estimates in this report have  confidence intervals within plus or minus 7.7 percentage points. For other  estimates, the confidence intervals or margins of error are presented  along with the estimates themselves.", "We took several steps to minimize non-sampling error. We used several  methods to identify the names and email addresses of the athletics  administrators for our selected sample of schools. In some states, the  high school associations had directories we used to obtain this  information. For those that did not, we searched the school\u2019s website or  called the school or district. We administered the survey from June  through early September 2017. To obtain the maximum number of  responses to our survey, we sent e-mails to the principals of the schools  in the sample prior to the survey\u2019s launch, asking them to support and  encourage their athletics administrator to complete the survey. We also  worked with the National Federation of State High School Associations to  have the state associations e-mail their members and encourage them to  participate in the survey. Finally, we sent direct reminder emails to  nonrespondents and contacted nonrespondents over the telephone.", "We took additional steps to minimize non-sampling errors, including  pretesting draft instruments and using a web-based administration  system. During survey development, we met with officials from national  groups representing high school activities associations and athletics  administrators and held discussion groups with nine athletics  administrators to explore the feasibility of responding to the survey  questions. We then pretested the draft instrument from April through May  2017 with five athletics administrators in public high schools that were  diverse across a range of characteristics, such as region, school type and  locale, and minority enrollment. In the pretests, we asked about the clarity  of the questions and the flow and layout of the survey. A survey specialist  independent of the project team within GAO also reviewed a draft of the  questionnaire prior to its administration. Based on feedback from the  pretests and the independent review, we made revisions to the survey  instrument. To further minimize non-sampling errors, we used a web- based survey, which allowed respondents to enter their responses  directly into an electronic instrument. Using this method automatically  created a record for each respondent in a data file and eliminated the  errors associated with a manual data entry process.", "Despite these efforts, like most surveys, our survey had nonresponse.  Specifically, the weighted response rate was 42 percent. Survey  nonresponse raises the possibility that those athletics administrators who  did respond to the survey may not be representative of the intended  population, due to nonresponse bias. We carried out a nonresponse bias  analysis and identified three potential factors that may have been related  to athletics administrators\u2019 propensity to respond: school concentration of  minority students, school size, and region. In order to adjust for the  potential nonresponse bias, we adjust the sampling weight with a  nonresponse adjustment to form a final weight. Data analyzed using the  final, nonresponse-adjusted sampling weight is assumed to be missing at  random, given the nonresponse adjustments, and therefore unbiased for  the intended population. We used response propensity weighting class  adjustments based on a model that included the variables identified in the  nonresponse bias analysis. We conducted our analysis using survey  software that accounted for the sample design and weighting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Follow-Up Interviews", "paragraphs": ["To gain further insights into factors that encourage or discourage  participation in sports, schools\u2019 efforts to encourage equal opportunities,  and the role of the Title IX coordinator, we conducted follow-up interviews  with 8 athletics administrators, chosen from the 105 who had responded  to our survey as of late August and indicated that they were willing to  participate in a follow-up discussion on their responses. Specifically, we  selected respondents to obtain diversity in their responses to a few key  survey questions, as well as certain characteristics of their schools. In  making our selections, we considered their responses to survey questions  on:   their awareness of their Title IX Coordinator, activities their schools conducted within the last two years to  encourage equal opportunities for boys and girls in sports, and whether the school maintains expenditure data on sports and their  willingness to share these data.", "We identified school characteristics with the data sources used to create  our survey sampling frame.

In addition, we  asked them about funding sources and their use of expenditure data, the  role of booster clubs, and the role of outside funding. For each school  where the athletics administrator reported that they had expenditure data,  we requested a copy of these data. We obtained expenditure data from  three schools. In some cases we obtained additional documentation  such as booster club guidelines, processes for adding school sports, and  participation data.
