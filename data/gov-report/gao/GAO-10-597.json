Since its first audit of IRS's financial statements in fiscal year 1992, GAO has identified a number of weaknesses in IRS's financial management operations. In related reports, GAO has recommended corrective actions to address those weaknesses. Each year, as part of the annual audit of IRS's financial statements, GAO makes recommendations to address any new weaknesses identified and follows up on the status of IRS's efforts to address the weaknesses GAO identified in previous years' audits. The purpose of this report is to (1) provide an overview of the financial management challenges still facing IRS, (2) provide the status of financial audit and financial management-related recommendations and the actions needed to address them, and (3) highlight the relationship between GAO's recommendations and internal control activities central to IRS's mission and goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS has made progress in improving its internal controls and financial management since its first financial statement audit in 1992, as evidenced by 10 consecutive years of clean audit opinions on its financial statements, the resolution of several material internal control weaknesses, and actions resulting in the closure of over 250 financial management recommendations. This progress has been the result of hard work throughout IRS and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces significant financial management challenges in (1) resolving its remaining material weaknesses in internal control, (2) developing outcome-oriented performance metrics, and (3) correcting numerous other internal control issues, especially those relating to safeguarding tax receipts and taxpayer information. At the beginning of GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2009 financial statements, 62 financial management-related recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the issues that gave rise to them. During the fiscal year 2009 financial audit, IRS took actions that GAO considered sufficient to close 18 recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional internal control issues resulting in 41 new recommendations. In total, 85 recommendations remain open. To assist IRS in evaluating and improving internal controls, GAO categorized the 85 open recommendations by various internal control activities, which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control categories: safeguarding of assets and security activities; proper recording and documenting of transactions; and effective management review and oversight. The continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle that IRS needs to overcome. Effective implementation of GAO's recommendations can greatly assist IRS in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management and can help enable it to more effectively carry out its tax administration responsibilities. Most can be addressed in the short term (the next 2 years). However, a few recommendations, particularly those concerning the functionality of IRS's automated systems, are complex and will require several more years to effectively address."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.

Because of its role and overall mission, IRS\u2019s activities affect virtually all  of the nation\u2019s citizens. It is therefore critical that the agency strive to  maintain sound internal control and financial management practices.", "IRS has made much progress in improving its financial management since  it was first required to prepare a set of financial statements nearly two  decades ago. This progress is reflected in IRS\u2019s 10-year record of obtaining  a clean audit opinion on its financial statements and correcting several  material internal control weaknesses and significant deficiencies in  internal controls over the years. At the same time, IRS continues to face  significant financial management challenges in achieving the overarching  goals of federal financial management\u2014accountability and useful  management information. To enable more effective financial and  operational management, IRS needs to (1) address its remaining   long-standing material internal control weaknesses, (2) develop data and  performance metrics that will enhance its ability to manage for outcomes,  and (3) implement corrective actions to address other identified internal  control issues.", "An agency\u2019s internal control serves as the first line of defense in  safeguarding its assets and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud, as  well as in helping to effectively manage its stewardship over public  resources. For many years, IRS has had weaknesses in internal controls  over fundamental elements of its operations that leave it vulnerable to a  greater risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Specifically,  during our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2009 financial statements, we found  that IRS continued to be challenged with two long-standing material  weaknesses in internal control that are at the heart of its operations\u2014 weaknesses in internal controls over unpaid tax assessments and over  information systems security. We also found that IRS faces a significant  management challenge in enhancing and using its financial management  capabilities to develop outcome-oriented performance metrics critical to  providing the foundation upon which an agency can manage its operations  for outcomes.

While we use all five elements of  internal control as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of IRS\u2019s internal  controls, our ongoing evaluations and tests have focused heavily on  control activities, where we have identified numerous internal control  weaknesses and have provided recommendations for corrective action.

IRS\u2019s management has not developed the data or   outcome-oriented performance measures that would enhance its ability to  manage for outcomes. For example, it has not integrated the use of   cost-based (and when appropriate, revenue-based) performance metrics  into its routine management and decision-making processes or externally  reported performance metrics. Although IRS has developed projected  return on investment estimates for new enforcement (tax collection)  initiatives in its annual budget submissions, it has not developed similar  outcome-oriented performance metrics to determine whether funded  initiatives achieve their estimated goals. IRS has also not developed  outcome-oriented performance metrics for its existing enforcement  programs. These limitations inhibit IRS\u2019s ability to more fully assess and  monitor the relative merits of its existing programs, to evaluate new  initiatives, or to consider alternatives and adjust its strategies as needed.  Outcome-oriented performance metrics based on specific enforcement  programs\u2019 costs and revenues should improve IRS\u2019s ability to (1) establish  measurable outcome goals, (2) evaluate the relative merits of various  program options, and (3) highlight opportunities for optimizing the  allocation of resources. They can also help IRS more credibly demonstrate  to Congress and the public that it is spending its appropriations wisely.", "IRS\u2019s existing metrics focus on process-oriented workload measures of  program outputs rather than on measuring program outcomes. For  example, for its enforcement programs, IRS focuses on measuring discrete  activities within its overall tax collection efforts, such as the percentage of  various types of tax returns examined, criminal investigations completed,  and the number of tax returns examined and closed. While such output  measures can be useful elements in assessing performance, they are not  designed to measure the contribution each of these activities makes to the  collection of unpaid taxes, nor do they compare the cost of collection  activities to the tax revenue generated. IRS\u2019s enforcement metrics do not  include revenue collected\u2014a measure of outcome\u2014compared to the cost  of collection that could show the net monetary benefits of the  enforcement programs. In addition, IRS\u2019s publicly available performance  metrics do not measure the cost of IRS\u2019s programs either in the aggregate  or per service or activity performed.", "As we report in the \u201cStatus per IRS\u201d section of appendix I in this report,  IRS has reported that it considers our recommendation to develop  outcome-oriented performance measures and related performance goals  for IRS\u2019s enforcement programs and activities to be closed. We do not  agree. Part of IRS\u2019s justification for closing the recommendation is that  IRS uses cost-benefit return on investment analysis to evaluate future  scenarios and to support funding requests for new initiatives in its annual  budget submissions. Such prospective return on investment information is  useful for budgetary decision making, but our recommendation is for IRS  to develop outcome data on the actual results of its programs and  activities. We have also previously recommended that IRS (1) extend the  use of return on investment in future budget proposals to include major  enforcement programs and (2) develop return on investment data for its  enforcement programs using actual revenue and full cost data and  compare actual results to the projected return on investment data  included in its budget request. Our recommendations regarding  development of outcome-oriented performance metrics remain open  because, as noted above, IRS does not develop such data for either funded  initiatives or for ongoing enforcement programs and activities and it has  not deployed outcome-oriented performance measures.", "IRS also reported that return on investment information is but one tool  that can be utilized to improve resource-allocation decision making, and it  is not prudent to rely exclusively on return on investment as the sole  determinant of resource allocation. As we have reported previously, we  acknowledge that IRS must consider other factors besides maximizing  revenue collection and least-cost operations. The fairness of IRS\u2019s  implementation of the tax code and treatment of all taxpayers are  important, and we are cognizant of the many factors, such as coverage,  that are important considerations when making resource-allocation  decisions. These factors, and the decisions IRS makes about how to  respond to them, have a significant effect on taxpayers, as well as on tax  collections. However, using full cost and collection outcome-oriented  performance metrics are also important to make optimum use of its  available resources and to be able to credibly demonstrate it is doing so to  Congress and the public.", "For several years, IRS has been developing full cost data on its programs  and activities in response to a recommendation we made in 1999.  However, as we have reported in the past, IRS\u2019s efforts have been slowed  because IRS cannot produce full cost information down to the program  and activity levels directly from its cost accounting system, the Integrated  Financial System (IFS). IRS has partially overcome this difficulty by  developing the ability to manually combine cost data from IFS with  personnel time-charge data from IRS\u2019s various workload management  systems and revenue data for enforcement programs to develop full cost  (and revenue) information for selected programs.", "IRS\u2019s lack of outcome-oriented performance metrics is inconsistent with  federal financial management concepts as embodied in FASAB\u2019s  Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No. 1, Objectives of  Federal Financial Reporting. In its discussion of financial reporting  concepts, FASAB notes that federal financial data should provide  accountability and decision-useful information on the costs of programs  and the outputs and outcomes achieved, and it should provide data for  evaluating service efforts, costs, and accomplishments.", "The absence of outcome metrics is also inconsistent with the objectives of  the CFO Act of 1990. A key objective of the act was for agencies to  routinely develop and use appropriate financial management information  to evaluate program effectiveness, make fully informed operational  decisions, and ensure accountability. While obtaining a clean audit opinion  on its financial statements is important in itself, it is not the end goal  reflected in the act. The end goal is modern financial management systems  that provide reliable, timely, and useful financial information to support  day-to-day decision making and oversight. Such systems and practices  should also provide for the systematic measurement of both outputs and  outcomes.", "Developing the data and performance metrics necessary for a more  outcome-oriented approach to managing operations requires active and  sustained senior management leadership. We acknowledge that without  the benefit of integrated financial management systems, IRS faces  significant challenges in developing outcome-oriented performance  metrics, including the data needed for such metrics. However, undertaking  such an effort agencywide will enhance IRS\u2019s ability to effectively measure  and compare the benefits of its programs to make better informed  resource-allocation decisions and to better support its budget requests.", "We have made several recommendations to IRS over the years to address  its financial management challenges in developing full cost data for its  programs and activities and for outcome-oriented performance measures.

Although IRS has made substantial  improvements in safeguarding taxpayer receipts and information since our  financial audits first began surfacing serious internal control issues in this  area, the task of ensuring ongoing control over such critical  responsibilities for IRS is a difficult one. Each year, we continue to  identify control issues related to IRS\u2019s safeguarding of taxpayer receipts  and information. For example, based on our fiscal year 2009 audit, we  identified new internal control issues and made 19 additional  recommendations that related either directly or indirectly to the physical  safeguarding of taxpayer receipts and information. The internal control  issues encompassed in our recommendations cover critical physical  security functions, such as  transporting taxpayer receipts and sensitive taxpayer information  among IRS facilities and lockbox banks and maintaining physical  security at IRS facilities to prevent loss, theft, or the potential for fraud  regarding tax receipts and taxpayer information;    conducting inspections and audits of the design and operation of IRS\u2019s  physical security processes and controls designed to safeguard tax  receipts and taxpayer information;    conducting appropriate background investigations and screening of  personnel, including contractors, with access to IRS facilities and  lockbox bank operations; and    ensuring the proper destruction of documents to prevent the  inappropriate release of sensitive taxpayer information.", "Due to the volume of taxpayer receipts and sensitive taxpayer files that  IRS is responsible for safeguarding, and the implications for IRS\u2019s mission  if they are lost, stolen, or the subject of fraud or misuse, it is critical that  IRS successfully resolve the internal control issues we have identified and  work toward continually improving its internal controls to prevent new  issues from arising."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Status of Recommendations Based on the Fiscal Year 2009 Financial Statement Audit", "paragraphs": ["In June 2009, we issued a report on the status of IRS\u2019s efforts to implement  corrective actions to address financial management recommendations  stemming from our fiscal year 2008 and prior year financial audits and  other financial management\u2013related work.

Each of the  unresolved recommendations from our financial audits and financial  management\u2013related work, and the underlying issues that gave rise to  them, can be traced to 1 of the 11 specific control activities as shown in  table 1.", "As table 1 indicates, 19 (22 percent) of the unresolved recommendations  relate to IRS\u2019s controls over safeguarding of assets and security activities,  39 (46 percent) relate to issues associated with IRS\u2019s ability to properly  record and document transactions, and 27 (32 percent) relate to issues  associated with IRS\u2019s management review and oversight.", "On the following pages, we group the 85 open recommendations under the  specific control activity to which the condition that gave rise to them most  appropriately fits. We define each control activity as presented in the  internal control standards and briefly identify some of the key IRS  operations that fall under that control activity. Although not  comprehensive, the descriptions are intended to help explain why actions  to strengthen these control activities are important for IRS to efficiently  and effectively carry out its overall mission. Each control activity  description includes a table of the related open recommendations. The  tables list the recommendations by the year in which we made them   (ID no.). For each recommendation, we also indicate whether it is a short- term or long-term recommendation. We characterized a recommendation  as short-term when we believe that IRS had the capability to implement  solutions within 2 years of the year in which we first reported them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Safeguarding of Assets and Security Activities", "paragraphs": ["Given IRS\u2019s mission, the sensitivity of the data it maintains, and its  processing of trillions of dollars of tax receipts each year, one of the most  important control activities at IRS is the safeguarding of assets. Internal  control in this important area should be designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or prompt detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets. IRS has outstanding  recommendations in the following three control activities in the internal  control standards that relate to safeguarding of assets (including buildings  and equipment as well as tax receipts) and security activities (such as  limiting access to only authorized personnel): (1) physical control over  vulnerable assets; (2) segregation of duties; and (3) access restrictions to,  and accountability for, resources and records.", "Internal control standard: An agency must establish physical control to secure and  safeguard vulnerable assets. Examples include security for and limited access to  assets such as cash, securities, inventories, and equipment which might be vulnerable  to risk of loss or unauthorized use. Such assets should be periodically counted and  compared to control records.", "Of the trillions of dollars in taxes that IRS collects each year, hundreds of  billions is collected in the form of checks and cash accompanied by tax  returns and related information. IRS collects taxes both at its own  facilities as well as at lockbox banks. IRS acts as custodian for (1) the tax  payments it receives until they are deposited in the General Fund of the  U.S. Treasury and (2) the tax returns and related information it receives  until they are either sent to the Federal Records Center or destroyed. IRS  is also charged with controlling many other assets, such as computers and  other equipment, but it is IRS\u2019s legal responsibility to safeguard tax returns  and the confidential information taxpayers provided on those returns that  makes the effectiveness of IRS\u2019s internal controls over physical security  essential.", "While effective physical safeguards over receipts should exist throughout  the year, such safeguards are especially important during the peak tax  filing season. Each year during the weeks preceding and shortly after   April 15, an IRS service center or lockbox bank may receive and process  daily over 100,000 pieces of mail containing returns, receipts, or both. The  dollar value of receipts each service center and lockbox bank processes  increases to hundreds of millions of dollars a day during the April 15 time  frame.", "The following 11 open recommendations in table 2 are designed to  improve IRS\u2019s physical controls over vulnerable assets. They include  recommendations for IRS to improve controls over (1) physical security at  its Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC), (2) courier activities, and   (3) lockbox banks\u2019 handling of unprocessable items. We consider all of  these recommendations to be correctable on a short-term basis.", "Internal control standard: Key duties and responsibilities need to be divided or  segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error or fraud. This should  include separating the responsibilities for authorizing transactions, processing and  recording them, reviewing the transactions, and handling any related assets. No one  individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or event.", "As noted in the previous section, IRS employees process hundreds of  billions of dollars in tax receipts in the form of cash and checks.  Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain appropriate separation of  duties to allow for adequate oversight of staff and protection of these  vulnerable resources so that no single individual would be in a position of  causing an error or irregularity, or potentially converting the asset to  personal use, and then concealing it. For example, when an IRS field office  receives taxpayer receipts and returns, it is responsible for depositing the  cash and checks in a depository institution and forwarding the related  taxpayer information received, such as tax returns, to an IRS service  center for further processing. In order to adequately safeguard receipts  from theft, the person responsible for recording the information from the  taxpayer receipts on a voucher should be different from the individual  who prepares those receipts for transmittal to the service center for  further processing. Also, IRS employees must properly account for the  billions of dollars IRS spends each year on its operations.", "Implementing the following three recommendations in table 3 would help  IRS improve its separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen its  controls over tax receipts, procurement activities, and financial  accounting processes. All are short-term in nature.", "Internal control standard: Access to resources and records should be limited to  authorized individuals, and accountability for their custody and use should be assigned  and maintained. Periodic comparison of resources with the recorded accountability  should be made to help reduce the risk of errors, fraud, misuse, or unauthorized  alteration.", "Because IRS handles, and is responsible for maintaining accountability  over, a large volume of cash and checks, it is imperative that it maintain  strong controls to appropriately restrict access to those assets, the records  relied on to track those assets, and sensitive taxpayer information.  Although IRS has a number of both physical and information systems  controls in place, some of the issues we have identified in our financial  audits over the years pertain to ensuring that (1) those individuals who  have direct access to cash and checks are appropriately vetted, such as  through appropriate background investigations, before being granted  access to taxpayer receipts and information and (2) IRS maintains  effective access security control. The following five short-term  recommendations in table 4 were intended to help IRS improve its access  restrictions to assets and records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proper Recording and Documenting of Transactions", "paragraphs": ["Internal control standard: Internal control and all transactions and other significant  events need to be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily  available for examination. The documentation should appear in management directives,  administrative policies, or operating manuals and may be in paper or electronic form. All  documentation and records should be properly managed and maintained.", "IRS collects and processes trillions of dollars in taxpayer receipts annually  both at its own facilities and at lockbox banks under contract to process  taxpayer receipts for the federal government. Therefore, it is important  that IRS maintain effective controls to ensure that all documents and  records are properly and timely recorded, managed, and maintained both  at its facilities and at the lockbox banks. In this regard, it is critical that  IRS adequately document and disseminate its procedures to ensure that  they are available for IRS employees. IRS must also document its  management reviews of controls, such as those regarding refunds and  returned checks, credit card purchases, and reviews of TAC operations. To  ensure future availability of adequate documentation, IRS must ensure that  (1) its systems, particularly those now being developed and implemented,  have appropriate capability to identify and trace individual transactions  and (2) all critical steps in its accounting processes are adequately  documented and controlled. Resolving the following 18 recommendations  in table 5 would assist IRS in improving its documentation of transactions  and related internal control procedures. Seventeen of these  recommendations are short-term, and one is long-term.", "IRS maintains records for tens of millions of taxpayers in addition to  maintaining its own financial records. To carry out this responsibility, IRS  often has to rely on outdated computer systems or manual work-arounds.  Unfortunately, some of IRS\u2019s recordkeeping difficulties we have reported  on over the years will not be addressed until it can replace its aging  systems, an effort that is long-term and, in part, dependent on obtaining  future funding.", "Implementation of the following 20 recommendations in table 6 would  strengthen IRS\u2019s recordkeeping abilities. Sixteen of these  recommendations are short-term, and four are long-term regarding  requirements for new systems for maintaining taxpayer records. Several of  the recommendations listed deal with financial reporting processes, such  as maintaining subsidiary records, recording budgetary transactions, and  tracking program costs. Some of the issues that gave rise to several of our  recommendations directly affect taxpayers, such as those involving  duplicate assessments, errors in calculating and reporting manual interest,  errors in calculating penalties, and collection of trust fund recovery  penalty assessments. Three of these recommendations have remained  open for over 10 years, reflecting the complex nature of the underlying  systems issues that must be resolved to fully address some of these  control deficiencies.", "Internal control standard: Transactions and other significant events should be  authorized and executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority. This  is the principal means of ensuring that only valid transactions to exchange, transfer,  use, or commit resources and other events are initiated or entered into. Authorizations  should be clearly communicated to managers and employees.", "Each year, IRS spends approximately $250 million annually to cover the  cost of its employees\u2019 travel. Failure to ensure that employees obtain  appropriate authorizations for their travel leaves the government open to  fraud, waste, or abuse.

Management must set the objectives,  put control activities in place, and monitor and evaluate controls to ensure  that they are followed. Without adequate monitoring by managers, there is  a risk that internal control activities may not be carried out effectively and  in a timely manner. IRS has outstanding recommendations in the following  four control activities related to effective management review and  oversight: (1) reviews by management at the functional or activity level,  (2) establishment and review of performance measures and indicators,   (3) management of human capital, and (4) top-level reviews of actual  performance.", "Internal control standard: Managers need to compare actual performance to planned or  expected results throughout the organization and analyze significant differences.", "IRS employs over 100,000 full-time and seasonal employees. In addition, as  discussed earlier, lockbox banks process tens of thousands of individual  receipts, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars for IRS. Management  oversight of operations is important at any organization, but is imperative  at IRS given its mission.", "Implementing the following 14 short-term and 1 long-term  recommendations in table 8 would improve IRS\u2019s management oversight  of several areas of its operations, including monitoring of contractor  facilities, release of tax liens, issuance of manual refunds, and use of  appropriated funds. These recommendations were made because an  internal control activity either did not exist or the existing control was not  being adequately or consistently applied.", "Internal control standard: Activities need to be established to monitor performance  measures and indicators. These controls could call for comparisons and assessments  relating different sets of data to one another so that analyses of the relationships can be  made and appropriate actions taken. Controls should also be aimed at validating the  propriety and integrity of both organizational and individual performance measures and  indicators.", "IRS\u2019s operations include a vast array of activities encompassing educating  taxpayers, processing of taxpayer receipts and data, disbursing hundreds  of billions of dollars in refunds to millions of taxpayers, maintaining  extensive information on tens of millions of taxpayers, and seeking  collection from individuals and businesses that fail to comply with the  nation\u2019s tax laws. Within its compliance function, IRS has numerous  activities, including identifying businesses and individuals that  underreport income, collecting from taxpayers who do not pay taxes, and  collecting from those receiving refunds for which they are not entitled.  Although IRS has at its peak over 100,000 employees, it still faces resource  constraints in attempting to fulfill its duties. It is vitally important for IRS  to have sound performance measures to assist it in assessing its  performance and targeting its resources to maximize the government\u2019s  return on investment. However, in past audits we have reported that IRS  did not capture costs at the program or activity level to assist in  developing cost-based performance measures for its various programs and  activities. As a result, IRS is unable to measure the costs and benefits of its  various collection and enforcement efforts to best target its available  resources.", "The following one short-term and two long-term recommendations in table  9 are designed to assist IRS in (1) evaluating its operations,   (2) determining which activities are the most beneficial, and   (3) establishing a good system for oversight. These recommendations are  directed at improving IRS\u2019s ability to measure, track, and evaluate the  costs, benefits, or outcomes of its operations\u2014particularly with regard to  identifying its most cost-effective tax collection activities.", "Internal control standard: Effective management of an organization\u2019s workforce\u2014its  human capital\u2014is essential to achieving results and an important part of internal control.  Management should view human capital as an asset rather than a cost. Only when the  right personnel for the job are on board and are provided the right training, tools,  structure, incentives, and responsibilities is operational success possible. Management  should ensure that skill needs are continually assessed and that the organization is able  to obtain a workforce that has the required skills that match those necessary to achieve  organizational goals. Training should be aimed at developing and retaining employee  skill levels to meet changing organizational needs. Qualified and continuous supervision  should be provided to ensure that internal control objectives are achieved. Performance  evaluation and feedback, supplemented by an effective reward system, should be  designed to help employees understand the connection between their performance and  the organization\u2019s success.
