DOD policy requires DOD and the military departments to approve acquisition strategies and lifecycle sustainment plans, which include information on contractor support, but DOD officials reported that they do not collect information on the use of long-term contracts. DOD\u0092s limited visibility over long-term maintenance contracts reflects broader DOD challenges with managing services acquisition. GAO\u0092s past work has identified the need for DOD to obtain better data on its contracted services to enable it to make more strategic decisions. DOD is considering a number of policy- and data-related initiatives that could improve its knowledge of these contracts, but these efforts are in the early stages of development.", "Decisions made early in the acquisition process can limit DOD\u0092s ability to select alternative maintenance providers over the life cycle of a weapon system program. Program officials believed that DOD had the ability to select alternative service providers for half of the contracts GAO reviewed, as DOD either had sufficient technical data or there was an existing competitive environment. DOD officials believed the lack of technical data, funding, or expertise would hinder them from selecting alternative service providers on the other contracts GAO reviewed. Recent legislation and DOD\u0092s 2010 efficiency initiatives emphasize the importance of technical data considerations. GAO found that eight weapon systems that underwent DOD acquisition-related reviews between October 2010 and October 2011 considered technical data issues, but not all have determined the extent to which they will acquire these data or the cost to do so.", "Once the decision is made to use long-term contracts, DOD faces choices on how to best incentivize contractor performance and manage costs. GAO found that the 10 long-term maintenance contracts reviewed varied in terms of the incentives employed and tools used to gain insight into contractor costs. For example, GAO found that all 5 contracts with the longest durations, potentially ranging from 9 to 22 years, used monetary incentives such as award or incentive fees, or contract term incentives that can extend the life of the contract by several years. However, DOD and program officials expressed some concerns about the lack of insight on contractors\u0092 costs. In two cases, program offices established fixed prices for the entire potential length of the 9- and 15-year contracts without the ability to renegotiate prices or obtain incurred cost data. In comparison to the contracts with the longest durations, the five contracts GAO reviewed with maximum lengths of 5 years made less use of incentives or cost-control tools and generally did not have the ability to renegotiate contract prices, but program officials believed that the shorter-term nature of the contracts mitigated some of their risks. DOD does not collect information concerning the effectiveness of the various incentives or cost control tools used on long-term maintenance contracts, but it has identified efforts made by individual programs to improve acquisition of maintenance services. Developing lessons learned on what incentives and cost-control tools work best would help inform future acquisition strategies and reduce risk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD collect information on the extent to which DOD uses long-term maintenance contracts and develop lessons learned regarding the use of incentives and cost-control tools.

Of the 10 contacts we reviewed, we found that DOD programs that  used contracts extending longer than 5 years made frequent use of  incentives to motivate performance and tools that provide insight into and  control of costs. Program officials acknowledged, however, that in some  instances incentive structures needed to be periodically revised to better  incentivize contractor performance and they may not have sufficient  insight on contractor costs. Program offices using contracts lasting 5  years, on the other hand, made less use of incentives and generally did  not have the ability to renegotiate contract prices, but believed that the  shorter-term nature of the contracts mitigated some of their risks. Further,  program offices now obtain incurred cost data for two contracts, which  they expect will help in the negotiation of better contract prices. The  various contract lengths, incentives and cost-control tools across the  programs we reviewed reflects the differences of each acquisition and the  mission-specific maintenance approaches taken to support each weapon  system, but the department has not collected information on their  effectiveness on long-term maintenance contracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Programs with Longer- term Contracts Used Different Incentives and Tools to Provide Visibility on Costs", "paragraphs": ["Of the programs we reviewed, we found that the Air Force awarded five  relatively longer-term contracts\u2014between 9 and 22 years\u2014that  incentivized contractor performance and attempted to gain insight into  and control costs in various ways. All five of these contracts used some  combination of monetary or contract term incentives to encourage  contractor performance. These programs varied, however, in terms of the  approaches used to gain insights into the contractors\u2019 costs. For example,  the JSTARS program used cost-based incentive metrics, scheduled  specific opportunities to renegotiate the contract\u2019s price, and received  incurred cost data. In contrast, the contract to maintain the C-130\u2019s T56  engine did not use any of these approaches to gain cost insight. Table 4  summarizes the incentives and tools used to gain cost insight and cost  control.", "Program offices can use incentives to motivate contractors to provide  exceptional levels of contract performance. Three longer-term contracts  we reviewed include monetary incentives in the form of an award fee or  an incentive fee, while three contracts use contract term incentives where  a point system is used to award additional contract years. Program  officials acknowledged that the incentives needed to be adjusted at times.  For example, the JSTARS program uses an award fee incentive to  motivate short-term contractor performance and an award term incentive  to motivate the contractor\u2019s long-term performance. Over the course of  the JSTARS contract, the contractor has earned nearly all the available  award fee and award term years despite some serious performance  issues in 2009. In this case, the Air Force identified several serious  maintenance failures, including the presence of foreign objects in engine  filters and aircraft structural damage resulting from maintenance errors,  that were caused by the JSTARS contractor and which could have  resulted in serious personal injury and loss of aircraft. Because the  incentive structure encompasses the broad range of responsibilities  assigned to the contractor, the contractor still earned most of that  evaluation period\u2019s available fee and enough award term points to earn  another year of contractor performance. The fee-determining official  noted that if it were possible, he would have given the contractor a much  lower award fee and rating. While the failures were reflected in the award  fee evaluation under three performance metrics, the contractor\u2019s  aggregate performance against the remaining metrics allowed it to earn  90 percent of the eligible fee for this 2009 evaluation period. The JSTARS  program subsequently amended its award fee plan to make the contractor  ineligible for 40 percent of the award fee if its performance caused or  contributed to a major accident. The contractor has earned at least 95  percent of the available award fee for every other evaluation period since  the contract was awarded in 2000.", "Program offices structured contract term incentives differently, which  provided DOD different degrees of flexibility to award additional years of  performance. For example, the award term plans for the JSTARS and  C-130 T56 engine contracts we reviewed guarantee additional years of  work if contractors meet or exceed incentive metrics. Both the JSTARS  and C-130 T56 engine contractors have earned the maximum number of  possible award term years. Conversely, the current incentive option  offered by the KC-10 program differs from the award terms used by the  JSTARS or C-130 T56 contracts in key respects. The KC-10 program\u2019s  incentive includes \u201cmust-meet\u201d metrics and a high degree of government  discretion in awarding the additional incentive year. For example, even if  the contractor meets all incentive metrics and earns the maximum  available number of points needed to be considered for an additional  incentive year, the program office can still decline to award the additional  year. Additionally, if the contractor does not meet the standard set for any  \u201cmust-meet\u201d metric, it will not receive an incentive year. By structuring the  incentive in this way, the program office mitigates the risk of the  contractor earning incentives despite unsatisfactory performance, as in  the previous JSTARS example. According to KC-10 officials, the  contactor would not earn its first available incentive year with an  approximate contract value of $450 million because it failed to provide  continuous support for the initiation of global tanker support activities, a  \u201cmust-meet\u201d metric, among other performance shortcomings.", "Some of the programs that use longer-term contracts adjusted incentive  metrics to influence contractor performance in areas needing  improvement. For example, C-130J program officials said that since  awarding the airframe maintenance contract in 2006, they gradually  added more incentive metrics to the airframe contract\u2019s award fee plan to  incentivize contractor performance in other areas. After the contractor  improved performance in providing engineering services, the program  office added an incentive metric to improve the contractor\u2019s performance  for supply chain management.", "The programs using the five longer-term contracts we reviewed also use  to varying degrees different tools to gain insight into and control costs  over the term of the contracts, as illustrated by the following examples.", "The JSTARS cost-type contract was awarded on a non-competitive  basis to the system\u2019s original equipment manufacturer and the  contractor bears little risk under this long-term arrangement, but the  program office has taken measures to obtain insights into and control  the contractor\u2019s costs. The program office used the incurred cost data  it receives under the cost-type contract to help renegotiate contract  prices during triennial reviews. Additionally, the program uses cost- based incentive metrics to evaluate performance for award fee and  award term determinations. For example, under the terms of the  program\u2019s January 2012 award fee plan, 10 percent of the  contractor\u2019s award fee is determined by tracking cost performance  against contract estimates. This same metric is used to represent 10  percent of award term determinations. In addition, cost containment is  also evaluated as part of a weapon system improvement metric that  accounts for 37 percent of award term determinations.", "The C-130J program structured its potentially 10-year airframe and 9- year engine maintenance firm-fixed price contracts so that prices  would be renegotiated at certain points during the contracts\u2019  durations. For example, the program office receives incurred cost data  for the airframe contract, and has renegotiated prices three times  since the contract was awarded in 2006, with another renegotiation  scheduled for January 2014. Program officials said that receiving  incurred cost data helped them negotiate a 13 percent reduction in  total contract costs during the last scheduled price renegotiation in  January 2012. Program officials told us they can also gain insight into  cost baselines through regular contractor performance monitoring and  evaluation. For example, according to officials, the contractor  supporting airframe maintenance used a new system to track parts  that allowed for better utilization of spare parts and led to a decrease  in hours needed to perform the contract requirement. Program  officials were able to negotiate a lower price for that contract  requirement during the next scheduled price negotiation.", "In contrast, neither the C-130 T56 engine contract nor the KC-10  program scheduled price renegotiations despite establishing firm-fixed  prices for the entire potential length of the 15- and 9-year life of the  respective contracts. For example, the C-130 T56 engine contract has  prices fixed for the entire 15-year potential term of the contract with  adjustments made for changes in best estimated quantities and for  economic adjustments. Program officials expressed concern over  their lack of insight into the contractor\u2019s incurred costs and added that  having such information, along with scheduled price renegotiations at  the 5-year and 10-year points in the contract, would likely have been  helpful in controlling maintenance costs. While KC-10 program  officials cited the benefit of competition to drive down prices for  maintenance services, USD(AT&L) officials indicated that proposed  contracts reflecting a similar approach, where prices for the entire  duration of a long-term contract are priced at award, would be  reviewed carefully to ensure that the government\u2019s interests were  adequately protected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs with Shorter- term Contracts Tended Not to Use Incentives or Price Renegotiation Techniques", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Navy programs we reviewed used contracts with a  maximum length of five years and generally did not make as frequent use  of incentives or cost-control tools as programs using longer contracts.  Army and Navy program officials indicated that they would prefer to use  longer contracts in the future to enable contractors to invest in support  infrastructure and improvements. Table summarizes the incentives and  tools used for cost insight and cost control.", "Across the five contracts with a maximum length of five years, three used  monetary incentives and none used incentives that lengthen the  contract\u2019s term. The T-45 program office uses a performance bonus  incentive, which allows the program to withhold monthly performance  bonuses for contractor performance that did not meet or exceed  thresholds on both incentive metrics. The program measures ready-for- training availability and the maintenance cancellation rate. The contractor  must meet or exceed performance thresholds for these metrics at all  three locations where the aircraft are based to receive an overall bonus.  As a result, the contractor could lose as much as 65 percent of the  available bonus by not meeting requirements at a single location.  According to program officials, this incentivizes the contractor to perform  optimally at all three locations. Performance records show that the  contractor has earned most of the available bonus since the contract was  awarded in 2008. Similarly, the contract for CH-47 engine maintenance  support includes a clause which allows the contractor to earn an incentive  fee for reducing engine repair turn-around time. Since the contract began  in 2011, there has been one evaluation period; the contractor did not  meet the incentive metric and did not earn any incentive fee. On the other  hand, MH-60 program officials told us that incentives in the form of  additional payments are not necessary for their program\u2019s maintenance  support contract. They added that the contractor is self-incentivized to  maximize its profit in this firm-fixed price contracting arrangement, which  can be achieved through realizing efficiencies. Furthermore, they  questioned the value of paying a contractor to provide services above and  beyond what the program requires. Instead, contract provisions allow  the government to reduce the contractor\u2019s payment if the contractor\u2019s  work does not meet minimum thresholds. MH-60 program officials  reported that they have not had to make any downward price adjustments  because the contractor is exceeding contract requirements.", "Programs are now receiving incurred cost data to control maintenance  costs for two five-year, firm-fixed price contracts, though this approach  was not used in previous contracts for the same services. Since 2009, the  MH-60 program office has required the contractor to submit incurred cost  data semiannually. Program officials said that they were directed by the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy to request the contractor\u2019s  incurred cost data and were supported by USD(AT&L) in negotiating for it.  By comparing incurred costs and contract prices, program officials said  that they were able to negotiate more favorable prices for the 2011 follow- on maintenance support contract. During the previous contract, the  contractor was able to realize efficiencies that drove down its incurred  costs. With access to this information, the MH-60 program was able to re- baseline contract costs and negotiate lower prices to reflect these  efficiencies. The AH-64 and CH-47 programs also receive incurred cost  data. A May 2011 DOD Inspector General audit found that the AH-64 and  CH-47 programs were paying above fair and reasonable prices for parts  supplied through their 5-year maintenance support contract. The  Inspector General reviewed costs for 24 high-dollar parts and calculated  that the contractor charged the Army about $13 million more than the fair  and reasonable prices for 18 of the parts. Based on this finding, these  programs began reviewing incurred costs for the highest-value parts  supplied through this contract. The incurred cost review is being  performed in parallel with a major update of total parts pricing on the  contract, and program officials expect that there will be many downward  price changes as a result. The program office plans to perform this review  annually over the term of the contract.", "DOD has not collected information concerning the effectiveness of the  various incentives or cost-control tools used on long-term maintenance  contracts, but it has recognized efforts made by individual programs to  improve acquisitions of such services. For example, during a December  2010 peer review of the MH-60 airframe contract, USD(AT&L) officials  noted that the use of incurred cost data allowed the program to negotiate  lower prices for certain services. Program officials told us that it was  difficult to negotiate for incurred cost data for fixed-priced contracts as  contractors are generally reluctant to share their actual costs and seek to  protect business-sensitive information. USD(AT&L) and military  department officials told us that they are encouraging program officials to  be more aggressive when asking for incurred costs, especially in  situations where the government does not have the benefit of leveraging  competition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not collect data on the extent to which long-term contracts are  currently used and managed, but our assessment of 10 contracts shows  the value of having such information.
