Any issues uncovered during planned integration and testing may push the launch date as late as June 2021. Moreover, while NASA acknowledges about $1 billion in cost growth for the SLS program, it is understated. This is because NASA shifted some planned SLS scope to future missions but did not reduce the program's cost baseline accordingly. When GAO reduced the baseline to account for the reduced scope, the cost growth is about $1.8 billion.", "In addition, NASA's updated cost estimate for the Orion program reflects 5.6 percent cost growth. The estimate is not complete, however, as it assumes a launch date that is 7 months earlier than Orion's baseline launch date. If the program does not meet the earlier launch date, costs will increase further. Updating baselines to reflect current mission scope and providing complete cost estimates would provide NASA management and Congress with a more transparent assessment of where NASA is having difficulty controlling costs.", "NASA paid over $200 million in award fees from 2014-2018 related to contractor performance on the SLS stages and Orion spacecraft contracts.

In some cases, the changes were  significant enough that they invalidated legacy systems Boeing had  planned to use, which required rework. However, SLS program  officials stated that they continued to update loads data as the  environments anticipated during launch became clearer.", "Boeing officials also stated that they alerted NASA in September 2014  that a decision to decrease funding in fiscal year 2015 would require  the contractor to delay the core stage delivery date. In October 2018,  however, the NASA OIG reported that while Boeing anticipated  receiving $150 million less than planned in fiscal year 2015, the  company received only $53 million less; that a funding increase was  received in fiscal year 2016; and that the value of Boeing\u2019s contract  increased by nearly $1 billion in May 2016.", "Finally, Boeing officials stated that it has been challenging to execute  NASA\u2019s development approach that called for the first set of hardware  built to be used for the initial launch. Boeing officials stated that they  are more used to an approach in which they use the first hardware  built to qualify the design and that hardware is never flown. The  challenge with the current approach, according to Boeing officials, is  that all the learning associated with a first build is occurring on the  flight unit, which requires extra scrutiny and slows down the process.  SLS program officials stated that this approach has been part of the  development plan since the initial contract with Boeing was signed.", "One area in which the program has benefited from the core stage delay is  that development of SLS test and flight software, which has been a  schedule concern for the program, now has additional time to complete  development.

The SLS development cost baseline established in  August 2014 for EM-1 includes cost estimates for the main vehicle  elements\u2014stages, liquid engines, boosters\u2014and other areas. According  to program officials, because of the December 2017 replan process,  NASA decided that costs included as part of the SLS EM-1 baseline cost  estimate would be more appropriately accounted for as costs for future  flights. Thus, NASA decided not to include those costs, approximately  $782 million, as part of the revised SLS EM-1 cost estimate. However,  NASA did not lower the $7 billion SLS development cost baseline to  account for this significant change in assumptions and shifting of costs to  future flights, and NASA officials told us that they were not sure what the  benefit to NASA would be in adjusting the baseline.", "This decision presents challenges in accurately reporting SLS cost growth  over time. NASA\u2019s decision not to adjust the cost baseline downward to  reflect the reduced mission scope obscures cost growth for EM-1.

However, our analysis shows that development cost  growth actually increased by $1.8 billion or 29.0 percent, when the  development baseline is lowered to account for the reduced mission  scope. Essentially, NASA is holding the baseline costs steady, while  reducing the scope of work included in current cost estimates (see figure  4).", "NASA\u2019s current approach for reporting cost growth misrepresents the cost  performance of the program and thus undermines the usefulness of a  baseline as an oversight tool. NASA\u2019s space flight program and project  management requirements state that the agency baseline commitment for  a program is the basis for the agency\u2019s commitment to the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congress based on program  requirements, cost, schedule, technical content, and an agreed-to joint  cost and schedule confidence level. Removing effort that amounts to  more than a tenth of a program\u2019s development cost baseline is a change  in the commitment to OMB and the Congress and results in a baseline  that does not reflect actual effort.", "Further, the baseline is a key tool against which to measure the cost and  schedule performance of a program. A program must be rebaselined and  reauthorized by the Congress if the Administrator determines that  development costs will increase by more than 30 percent. Accounting  for shifted costs, our analysis indicates that NASA has reached 29.0  percent development cost growth for the SLS program.", "In addition, as we previously reported in May 2014, NASA does not have  a cost and schedule baseline for SLS beyond the first flight. As a result,  NASA cannot monitor or track costs shifted beyond EM-1 against a  baseline.

For example, components throughout the crew and service  module relied on computer cards used to regulate power. When those  cards cracked during testing, the program needed to redesign the cards,  retest them, and reinstall them for system tests. Since then, additional  avionics failures have surfaced. In one instance, one of the vehicle\u2019s  global positioning system receivers failed to power up. In another, a part  failed on one of the inertial measurement units, which provide navigation  information like vehicle rotation and acceleration.

For example, in 2016, we found that  the program did not mature requirements and designs for the Mobile  Launcher before beginning construction. In addition, the EGS program  completed all major structural changes to the Mobile Launcher prior to  completing the design and installation of the ground support equipment  and the nine umbilicals that connect the Mobile Launcher directly to the  SLS and Orion. There have also been ground support equipment and  umbilical design changes both during and after the Mobile Launcher\u2019s  design phase because of vehicle requirement changes from SLS and  Orion. Officials indicated this approach was problematic because the  concurrency increased program risk. Further, according to officials, the  decision to have separate contracts for design and construction  exacerbated these challenges. Officials indicated that this contracting  strategy meant that design changes required multiple levels of review and  approval from NASA and each of the program\u2019s contractors, which in turn  led to numerous contract modifications.", "According to EGS officials, the program plans to incorporate lessons  learned from developing the first Mobile Launcher into the acquisition  approach for a second Mobile Launcher that NASA is building to allow for  future configurations of the SLS vehicle. Specific lessons officials plan to  carry forward to the second Mobile Launcher include:  implementing an integrated design process, including establishing a  process to better handle requirement changes during design and  construction; developing and maintaining a three-dimensional (3D) model to  facilitate integrated design; and enabling builder involvement during the design process to avoid  pitfalls during construction.", "However, these lessons learned do not address metrics to assess design  stability before starting construction. Our work on acquisition best  practices show that good processes that mature designs early in  development and ensure that the design meets requirements can position  a program for future success and lead to more predictable cost and  schedule outcomes. Traditionally, we have used the number of  releasable engineering drawings as a metric to assess design stability.  Specifically, our work has found that achieving design stability at the  product critical design review, usually held midway through product  development, is a best practice. Completion of at least 90 percent of  engineering drawings at this point provides tangible evidence that the  product\u2019s design is stable.", "We have also found that the U.S. Navy and the commercial shipbuilding  industry use 3D product models as tools to document design stability.

NASA officials  agreed that developing a Mobile Launcher is analogous to shipbuilding.  Best practices for commercial shipbuilding indicate that 3D product  models documenting 100 percent of the system\u2019s basic and functional  designs should be complete before construction begins.", "Basic design includes fixing the ship steel structure; routing all major  distributive systems, including electricity, water, and other utilities; and  ensuring the ship will meet the performance specifications.", "Functional design includes providing further iteration of the basic  design, providing information on the exact position of piping and other  outfitting in each block, and completing a 3D product model.", "The combined basic and functional designs in conjunction with the 3D  product model provide the shipbuilder a clear understanding of the ship  structure as well as how every system is set up and routed throughout the  ship.

The program\u2019s two software development efforts represent the  EGS critical path, and program officials stated that recent changes have  begun to address previous challenges with the software development. For  example, officials explained that the program has implemented iterative  integration testing and has identified lead engineers for each software  development area. The iterative integration testing involves conducting  tests on smaller segments of software throughout the development  process instead of waiting to conduct testing when a software release is  fully complete. According to officials, these efforts allow the program to  identify and correct errors prior to completing a full software drop. These  changes have also resulted in lower numbers of issues found in some  software releases. Further, the 6-month delay to the SLS and Orion  programs has provided additional flexibility to EGS\u2019s software  development schedule.", "Finally, with respect to EGS\u2019s performance against its cost baseline, EGS  updated its cost estimate as part of the December 2017 replan.

These  contracts\u2019 milestone fees, performance incentive fees, and cost incentive  fees are generally determined against objective criteria, such as meeting  a date and application of predetermined formulas. For example, NASA  will pay a milestone fee to Boeing under the SLS contract when it meets a  specific program milestone such as transferring the core stage to the  government for the green run test. Under this contract, Boeing receives  additional milestone fee when it beats a milestone date and reduced fee  when it misses a milestone date.

The numerical score for each evaluation period represents  the percentage of fee paid to the contractor from the available fee pool.", "Examples of strengths and weaknesses NASA identified in the award fee  letters include the following:", "For the Boeing award fee period ending February 2015, NASA  identified several strengths, including effective and timely  communication, but stated that its subcontractor management for the  vertical assembly center was inadequate. In particular, the program  discovered during this time that the as-built design of the vertical  assembly center tool was not capable of serving its purpose, which is  to build core stage hardware. The design issue resulted in several  months of schedule delays. NASA also raised concerns about  Boeing\u2019s ability to manage to the baseline schedule in a subsequent  award period.", "For the Lockheed Martin award fee period ending April 2017, NASA  identified several strengths, including addressing top program  development risks such as establishing a robust mitigation plan to  address risks related to the heatshield block architecture. At the same  time, NASA noted that Lockheed Martin was not able to maintain its  schedule for the crew service module and that the contractor\u2019s  schedule performance had decreased significantly over the previous  year.", "While both the SLS and Orion contractors have received the majority of  available award fee in each award fee period, the programs have not  always achieved overall desired outcomes. For example, in its December  2018 award fee letter to Boeing\u2014representing the good assessment for  the September 2017 through October 2018 period of performance\u2014the  fee determination official noted that the significant schedule delays on this  contract have caused NASA to restructure the flight manifest for SLS. As  previously discussed, within 1 year of announcing a delay for the first  mission, senior NASA officials acknowledged that the SLS and Orion  programs will not meet the new EM-1 schedule of December 2019, and  the 6 months of schedule reserve available to extend the date to at least  June 2020 has been consumed. In addition, the officials identified 6 to12  months of risk to that date, which could increase the delay up to 31  months. These 6 to 12 months of schedule risk do not include the effects,  if any, of the federal government shutdown that occurred in December  2018 and January 2019 due to a lapse in appropriations for fiscal year  2019.", "Both the contractors and government bear responsibilities for these  delays. We have previously found that NASA has made programmatic  decisions\u2014including establishing low cost and schedule reserves,  managing to aggressive schedules, and not following best practices for  earned value management\u2014that have compounded technical challenges  that are expected for inherently complex and difficult large-scale  acquisitions. Further, we previously reported that NASA did not follow  best practices for establishing cost and schedule baselines for these  programs nor update cost and schedule analyses to reflect new risks.  As a result, NASA overpromised what it could deliver from a cost and  schedule perspective.", "At the same time, both contractors have had challenges that contributed  to past delays. For example, in 2015, Boeing was unable to manufacture  an intertank panel\u2014which resides between the liquid oxygen and liquid  hydrogen tanks\u2014without significant cracking. At the time, NASA  estimated that resolving this issue could result in a 6-month slip to the  production schedule. Further, as previously discussed, NASA discovered  during installation that fuel lines used in the engine section were  contaminated with residue and other debris. According to a program  official, Boeing had not verified the processes that its vendors were using  to clean the fuel lines, resulting in about 2 months\u2019 delay to resolve  residue and debris issues. SLS officials indicated that the engine section  has a very complex design with many parts in a relatively small, cramped  area, so any time problems are found with parts that have already been  installed, removing, repairing or replacing them often requires that other  parts be removed. Furthermore, as some of the tubing sections had  already been installed, resolving this issue, including inspecting, shipping,  and cleaning the tubing, affected the overall program schedule.", "In addition, NASA determined in 2017 that Lockheed Martin would not  meet the delivery date for the crew module\u2014even if the European  Service Module were on schedule\u2014when numerous problems including  design issues, damage during testing, and manufacturing process  changes resulted in major schedule impacts to the program. Lockheed  Martin also had a number of issues with subcontractor-supplied avionics  system components failing during testing that have required time to  address. NASA has highlighted concerns over Lockheed Martin\u2019s ability  to manage subcontractors in award fee evaluation periods from 2016 to  2018, and the resulting significant cost, schedule, and technical risk  impacts to the program. In an attempt to resolve these issues and to  improve subcontractor oversight moving forward, Lockheed Martin  officials told us that they have placed staff in the subcontractor facilities.", "Because of these cost increases and delays, the agency plans to  renegotiate the Boeing contract for SLS. NASA officials stated that  Boeing expects its costs to exceed the cost-reimbursement contract\u2019s not- to-exceed estimated total cost, which will lead to contract renegotiation.  Consequently, the contractor has been executing work under an  undefinitized contract action since September 2018. Contract actions  such as these authorize contractors to begin work before reaching a final  agreement with the government on contract terms and conditions.", "Orion program officials stated that NASA is modifying the cost and period  of performance aspects of its contract with Lockheed Martin for Orion  development and negotiating a new contract with Lockheed Martin for  Orion operations and production. Officials told us the following:", "NASA is modifying the Orion development contract with Lockheed  Martin because the contractor will exceed the cost reimbursement  contract\u2019s not-to-exceed estimated total cost. Orion program officials  indicated that poor performance on the part of the contractor resulted  in the contractor exceeding the costs allowed under the contract  without completing the full scope of work. Consequently, NASA is  modifying the contract to allow increased costs. Orion officials  indicated that since the cost growth is contractor caused, the  contractor will not have the ability to earn any fees on this increased  cost.", "NASA is also modifying the Orion development contract to extend the  contract period of performance. The current contract\u2019s period of  performance ends in December 2020, which is earlier than NASA\u2019s  planned EM-2 launch date of June 2022. Orion program officials  stated that this extension is largely driven by delays in receipt of the  European Service Module.", "According to officials, NASA is negotiating the terms of the Orion  production and operations contract with Lockheed Martin. This  contract is expected to support future production of the Orion  spacecraft from Exploration Mission-3 potentially through 2029. In  addition to production, this effort will include sustaining engineering  and flight operations support, with limited development to allow  mission kits to be built to specifications as mission objective are  defined. Orion program officials indicated that NASA plans to  eventually transition the contract to a fixed-price type contract for  production, but that the development of mission kits will remain under  a cost-reimbursement type contract with some type of incentive fee.", "In November 2018, senior leaders within the ESD organization told us  that it was not clear whether NASA would renegotiate how incentive fees  are distributed among milestone incentive fee, or cost incentive fee, and  award fee as part of the upcoming Boeing contract renegotiations.

For instance, the  Orion program redistributed fees in 2014 to include an incentive fee  component when the contract transitioned from the Constellation program  to the Orion program.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation and NASA contracting guidance  indicate that award fee is appropriate when the work to be performed is  such that it is neither feasible nor effective to devise predetermined  objective incentive targets applicable to cost, schedule, and technical  performance. However, now that the SLS and Orion programs are further  into the acquisition life cycle, the programs are at the point in  development wherein it may be possible to determine more objective  targets for cost, schedule, and technical performance, especially for the  first mission. Further, a principle of federal internal controls is that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks. This includes management conducting reviews to  compare actual performance to planned or expected results, and taking  corrective actions to achieve objectives.

We also compared program schedules across three points in time\u2014 schedules from when NASA first established baselines for each program,  schedules established for each program following the replan in December  2017, and schedules as of November 2018\u2014to assess whether program  components and software were progressing as expected  Furthermore, for the EGS program, we reviewed program-level lessons  learned regarding the acquisition of the Mobile Launcher against  acquisition best practices to determine the extent to which the program  plans to incorporate these best practices as part of its acquisition  planning for the second Mobile Launcher.", "To determine the extent to which NASA\u2019s use of contract award fees are  achieving desired outcomes, we analyzed contract modifications, award  fee plans, and fee determination records for the Orion crew spacecraft  and SLS stages\u2014or stages\u2014contracts. We selected these contracts  because they represent the largest development efforts for each program.  We analyzed contract documentation to determine the amount of award  fee available on these contracts compared to other incentives, such as  milestone incentives, and calculated fees paid to date. Specifically, for  award fee on both contracts, we reviewed fee determination records for  evaluation periods after the SLS program\u2019s confirmation review in 2014  and the Orion program\u2019s confirmation review in 2015 to determine fees  paid, numeric and descriptive ratings awarded for each period and  contractor strengths and weaknesses identified by the program.  Moreover, we reviewed award fee documentation to identify broader  program challenges and compared fee determination results to overall  program outcomes since program confirmation. For the Orion contract,  the scope of our incentive fee analysis included the full scope of incentive  fees available for developing and manufacturing the Orion spacecraft  from the beginning of the contract. For the SLS contract the scope of our  incentive fee analysis included the incentive fees available for 1) contract  line item number 9 of the contract which includes the full scope of stages  work supporting SLS\u2019s EM-1 effort, and 2) contract line item number 12  indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity support task activities for contract  line item number 9.", "We performed our work at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas; the  Boeing Company in Huntsville, Alabama; Marshall Space Flight Center in  Huntsville, Alabama; Kennedy Space Center in Kennedy Space Center,  Florida; Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company in Houston, Texas;  and NASA headquarters in Washington, DC.", "We based our assessment on data collected prior to the federal  government shutdown that occurred in December 2018 and January 2019  due to a lapse in appropriations for fiscal year 2019. This assessment  does not reflect the effect, if any, of the shutdown on the programs\u2019 costs  and schedules or a March 2019 announcement that NASA is studying  how to accelerate the SLS schedule. We assessed the reliability of  program data we used to support this engagement using GAO reliability  standards as appropriate, including reviewing related documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and performing selected  testing of data. We determined the data was sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this engagement.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to June 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  This report acknowledges the complexity of NASA\u2019s deep space  exploration systems. The introduction section of this report  acknowledges that NASA is developing systems planned to  transport humans beyond low-Earth orbit, including the Moon and  eventually Mars, and that each of these programs represents a  large, complex technical and programmatic endeavor. The  introduction also notes that these programs are in the integration  and test phase of development, which our prior work has shown  often reveals unforeseen challenges leading to cost growth and  schedule delays.   2.  Senior NASA officials told us that the revised EM-1 launch date of  December 2019 is unachievable and the June 2020 launch date  (which takes into account schedule reserves) is unlikely. These  officials then estimated that there are 6 to 12 months of schedule  risk associated with the June 2020 date. It would be misleading for  us to continue to report the June 2020 launch date when we were  told there was substantive risk to that date. Without a new  approved schedule, Figure 3, Figure 5, and Figure 8 all present a  notional launch window including the acknowledged schedule  risks. We then used the information NASA provided us to report  that the first launch may occur as late as June 2021, if all risks are  realized.", "Further, this substantial delay to the first mission was  acknowledged by senior officials less than one year after NASA  announced up to a 19 month delay. We maintain that continued  underperformance contributed to these additional schedule delays  and associated cost increases. For example, for SLS, NASA  discovered during installation that fuel lines used in the engine  section were contaminated with residue and other debris.  According to a program official, Boeing had not verified the  processes that its vendors were using to clean the fuel lines,  resulting in about 2 months\u2019 delay to resolve residue and debris  issues. For the Orion program, NASA determined in 2017 that  Lockheed Martin would not meet the delivery date for the crew  module\u2014even if the European Service Module were on  schedule\u2014when numerous problems including design issues,  damage during testing, and manufacturing process changes  resulted in major schedule impacts to the program.", "As a result, we also maintain that these delays and cost growth  reinforce concerns over the management of the programs. In  addition to the underperformance, NASA\u2019s management decisions  on how to report cost growth is not fully transparent and, in  particular, obscures the difficulties the SLS program has faced  controlling costs.  3.  We agree that that these are long-term, \u201cmulti-decadal\u201d programs  and that content is subject to change. As a result, we maintain that  arbitrarily focusing on a single mission and not looking at long- term costs may have negative impacts to this human spaceflight  system. We previously reported in May 2014, that NASA does not  have a cost and schedule baseline for SLS beyond the first flight.  As a result, NASA cannot monitor or track costs shifted beyond  EM-1 against a baseline. We recommended that NASA establish  cost and schedule baselines that address the life cycle of each  SLS increment, as well as for any evolved Orion or ground  systems capability. NASA partially concurred with the  recommendation, but has not taken any action to date. Until action  is taken to do so, as noted above, NASA\u2019s decision to shift some  SLS costs to future missions while not adjusting the baseline  downward not only underestimates cost growth for the first  mission, but also results in there being no mechanism to track  these costs that NASA shifted to future missions.  4.  Through the course of this review, NASA was transparent in its  discussions with us of how it calculated costs for each of the  programs. The findings of this report are not meant to convey that  NASA is withholding information, but rather, that decisions NASA  has made about how to calculate costs do not provide sufficient  transparency into cost growth or cost estimates. Further, we have  previously reported that without transparency into costs for future  flights, NASA does not have the data to assess long-term  affordability and Congress cannot make informed budgetary  decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Cristina T.
