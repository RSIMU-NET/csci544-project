The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2007 required GAO to examine DOD's pharmacy benefits program. Specifically, as discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, GAO examined DOD's prescription drug spending trends from fiscal years 2000 through 2006 and DOD's key efforts to limit its prescription drug spending. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD's data on spending trends, including trends in beneficiary pharmacy use. GAO also assessed DOD's cost avoidance data and the agency's efforts to limit spending through its uniform formulary, which is a list of preferred drugs available to all beneficiaries. GAO interviewed DOD officials about these and other efforts to limit spending."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Collectively, DOD's drug spending at retail pharmacies, military treatment facilities (MTF), and the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) more than tripled from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $6.2 billion in fiscal year 2006. Retail pharmacy spending drove most of this increase, rising almost ninefold from $455 million to $3.9 billion and growing from 29 percent of overall drug spending to 63 percent. The growth in retail spending reflects the fact that federal pricing arrangements, which generally result in prices lower than retail prices, were not applied to drugs dispensed at retail pharmacies during this time. In addition, beneficiaries' increased use of retail pharmacies over the less costly options of MTFs or the TMOP exacerbated the effect of these higher prices. For example, 2 million beneficiaries used only retail pharmacies in fiscal year 2006--double the number in fiscal year 2002. However, future growth in retail pharmacy spending may slow as the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 now requires that federal pricing arrangements be applied to drugs dispensed at retail pharmacies. DOD's key efforts to limit its prescription drug spending have included its use of the uniform formulary and beneficiary outreach to encourage use of the TMOP. By leveraging its uniform formulary, which was implemented in fiscal year 2005, the agency avoided about $447 million in drug costs in fiscal year 2006 and $916 million in fiscal year 2007, according to DOD's data. In exchange for formulary placement, manufacturers can offer DOD prices below those otherwise available through federal pricing arrangements, which at the time of our review were applied only to drugs dispensed at MTFs and the TMOP. To compensate, in August 2006, DOD began obtaining voluntary manufacturer rebates for formulary drugs dispensed at retail network pharmacies. As of October 1, 2007, DOD collected about $28 million in rebates for fiscal year 2007. Also in 2006, DOD began beneficiary outreach--through quarterly newsletters and other materials--emphasizing the TMOP's convenience and cost savings. To help beneficiaries transfer their prescriptions to the TMOP, DOD launched the Member Choice Center in August 2007 and plans to target related outreach toward beneficiaries who frequently obtain high-cost drugs from retail pharmacies. DOD's ongoing efforts are important to limit future prescription drug spending. In addition, DOD has the recommendations of a congressionally mandated task force to consider--that copayment policies be changed to encourage beneficiaries to purchase preferred drugs from cost-effective sources. The agency is also undertaking a fundamental reform--the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 requirement to apply federal pricing arrangements to drugs dispensed at retail pharmacies--that could have an even greater impact on spending. DOD will need to carefully monitor the impact of this new requirement along with its ongoing efforts in order to assess the progress in controlling spending. DOD will also need to determine what types of additional efforts, if any, will be necessary to ensure the fiscal sustainability of its pharmacy benefits program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As part of our efforts to identify major challenges facing the nation in the  21st century, we reported that prescription drug spending was one of the  fastest-growing segments of health care spending in both the public and  private sectors.

Estimated to reach $15 billion by 2015, DOD\u2019s prescription drug  spending has been a growing concern for the federal government. How the  agency can best limit its drug spending has been a focus of recent debate.", "Health plans use various strategies to control their drug costs. These  strategies include having a formulary, which is a list of preferred drugs  that are generally available to beneficiaries; requiring the use of less  expensive generic drugs when available; having higher prescription  copayments for drugs purchased at pharmacies not in an established  network; and offering strong financial incentives to use mail-order  pharmacies. DOD instituted some of these strategies in response to a  provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2000. The NDAA required the agency to create a pharmacy benefits  program that included a uniform formulary, which is a formulary of drugs  available to all TRICARE beneficiaries, and authorized the establishment  of beneficiary copayments for drug purchases. Furthermore, DOD can use  statutory federal pricing arrangements to purchase drugs. These  arrangements typically result in prices lower than those otherwise  available. During our review, federal pricing arrangements were applied  to drugs dispensed only at military treatment facilities (MTF) and the  TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP).

TRICARE beneficiaries can obtain prescription drugs directly  from MTFs, the TMOP, and network and nonnetwork retail pharmacies.", "The pharmacy benefits law, as passed in October 1999, directed the  Secretary of Defense to establish a pharmacy benefits program. The  program is, among other things  required to include a uniform formulary that should ensure drugs are  available in the complete range of therapeutic classes; required to make drugs on the uniform formulary available to beneficiaries  at MTFs, the TMOP, and retail pharmacies; and   authorized to establish copayment requirements for generic, formulary,  and nonformulary drugs.", "The pharmacy benefits law also directed the Secretary of Defense to  establish the P&T Committee to develop the uniform formulary, and the  BAP to review and comment on the development of the uniform  formulary. Finally, the Secretary of Defense was to implement the use of  the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service (PDTS) at designated MTFs, the  TMOP, and retail network pharmacies. The PDTS is an electronic service  that DOD uses to maintain prescription drug information for all TRICARE  beneficiaries worldwide.", "In 2001, DOD established the current pharmacy copayment structure,  which is based on whether a drug is classified as formulary generic   (tier 1), formulary brand-name (tier 2), or nonformulary (tier 3).

MTF pharmacy spending rose  from $1 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2004, but declined  slightly to $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2000, MTF spending  accounted for 65 percent of DOD\u2019s overall drug spending but declined to  25 percent in fiscal year 2006. (See fig. 1.)", "Three overarching factors influenced these trends. First, because federal  pricing arrangements that generally result in lower prices were not applied  to drugs dispensed at retail pharmacies during this time period, these  drugs were generally more expensive for both DOD and its beneficiaries  than the drugs dispensed at MTFs or the TMOP. However, the NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2008 requires that federal pricing arrangements now be applied  to TRICARE prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies.", "Second, the increased use of retail pharmacies has exacerbated the effect  of higher retail prices. More beneficiaries are using only retail pharmacies  to obtain their prescriptions\u2014about 2 million in fiscal year 2006, up from  about 1 million in fiscal year 2002 (see fig. 2). Further, beneficiaries are  obtaining more maintenance drugs\u2014drugs for long-term conditions, such  as high blood pressure or cholesterol\u2014at retail pharmacies (see fig. 3).  From fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2006, the number of maintenance  drug prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies increased by more than  11.6 million. Those dispensed at the TMOP increased much less, by about  1.5 million, while those at MTFs decreased by about 2.5 million. DOD  officials cited additional reasons that they believed contributed to the  increased use of retail pharmacies, though they could not quantify the  effect of these reasons. These reasons included: base closures, which have  decreased the number of MTF pharmacies; deployment of MTF personnel,  which limits MTF appointment availability, resulting in more beneficiaries  going to civilian providers and filling their prescriptions at retail  pharmacies; the vast TRICARE retail network of about 59,000 pharmacies,  which has become more convenient for beneficiaries; and the prescription  copayment structure, which does not discourage beneficiaries from using  the more costly retail pharmacies.", "Third, according to DOD officials, TRICARE expansions have led to a  growing population of aging beneficiaries, who use more drugs. By fiscal  year 2006, about 1.7 million beneficiaries, age 65 or older, were eligible for  the pharmacy benefit through TRICARE benefit expansions that began in  2001. According to DOD data, retail pharmacy spending for beneficiaries  age 65 or older increased by about 207 percent from fiscal year 2002  through fiscal year 2006\u2014slightly higher than the 184 percent increase for  beneficiaries under age 65. (See fig. 4.) DOD officials told us that the  average cost per beneficiary at retail pharmacies in fiscal year 2006 was  about $1,277 for beneficiaries age 65 or older, compared with about   $368 for those under age 65. MTF spending declined slightly for both age  groups as TMOP spending increased.

DOD data show that the  agency avoided about $447 million in drug costs in fiscal year 2006 and  $916 million in drug costs in fiscal year 2007.", "MTFs accounted for most of DOD\u2019s cost avoidance, while retail network  pharmacies accounted for the least. Cost avoidance is affected by the  following factors that result from DOD\u2019s formulary decisions:    The prices DOD obtains for drugs. In exchange for including a  manufacturer\u2019s drug on the uniform formulary, manufacturers can offer  DOD prices below those otherwise available through statutory federal  pricing arrangements, which applied only to drugs dispensed at MTFs and  the TMOP during the time of our review. According to DOD officials, the  agency had obtained prices for drugs dispensed at MTFs and the TMOP  that are about 30 percent to 50 percent lower than the prices it obtained  for drugs dispensed at network and nonnetwork retail pharmacies. This  difference in price can be attributed to savings achieved through the  discounts obtained for uniform formulary placement as well as the lower  prices obtained through federal pricing arrangements for drugs dispensed  at MTFs and the TMOP.", "Changes in beneficiaries\u2019 use of formulary and nonformulary drugs within  a therapeutic class. Once a drug is designated nonformulary, its use may  be substituted with a formulary drug, which results in lower copayments  for the beneficiary and lower costs to DOD. Because MTFs are generally  limited to dispensing formulary drugs, cost avoidance attributed to the use  of formulary drugs over nonformulary drugs is higher at this point of  service than at the TMOP and retail network pharmacies, where  beneficiaries can obtain more costly nonformulary drugs.", "Changes in beneficiaries\u2019 use of generic and brand-name drugs within a  therapeutic class. For both formulary and nonformulary drugs, DOD  requires the substitution of generic drugs for brand-name drugs at MTFs,  the TMOP, and retail pharmacies when a generic equivalent is available.  A brand-name drug having a generic equivalent may be dispensed only if  the prescribing physician establishes medical necessity for its use. A  beneficiary\u2019s use of a generic drug in place of a brand-name drug results in  lower costs to the beneficiary and to DOD.", "Changes in beneficiaries\u2019 use of MTFs, the TMOP, and retail pharmacies as  a result of formulary designations. For example, a beneficiary may shift  from obtaining a 30-day supply of a formulary drug at a retail pharmacy,  where the beneficiary\u2019s copayment would be higher, to an MTF where the  beneficiary can obtain a 90-day supply of the drug without a copayment.", "To calculate cost avoidance, DOD first determines the costs it incurred at  MTFs, the TMOP, and retail network pharmacies for each drug as a result  of its designation as either formulary or nonformulary. DOD then subtracts  these incurred costs from the estimated costs it would have incurred at  MTFs, the TMOP, and retail network pharmacies if the designation had not  been made. Cost avoidance is the difference between the incurred and  estimated costs.", "In addition to costs avoided, DOD has obtained voluntary manufacturer  rebates for some of the formulary drugs dispensed at retail network  pharmacies\u2014though these rebates are a much smaller proportion of  overall savings. Because federal pricing arrangements were not previously  applied to drugs dispensed at retail pharmacies, DOD implemented the  VARR in August 2006 to allow manufacturers to offer rebates for these  drugs. There are two types of VARRs: the Uniform Formulary VARR and  the Utilization VARR. The Uniform Formulary VARR is an agreement  between DOD and a manufacturer that is contingent on the manufacturer\u2019s  drug being selected for the uniform formulary. DOD officials told us that  as of October 1, 2007, the agency had collected about $28 million through  Uniform Formulary VARRs for fiscal year 2007. As manufacturers  continue to enter into these agreements, DOD expects the amount it  collects to increase over time. The Utilization VARR allows manufacturers  to offer a rebate to DOD for drugs that are not on the uniform formulary.  According to DOD, this includes drugs that have not yet been reviewed for  the uniform formulary and drugs that have been reviewed and designated  nonformulary. Unlike the Uniform Formulary VARR, the Utilization VARR  does not secure formulary placement. As of October 2007, no  manufacturers had entered into a Utilization VARR with DOD.", "In our discussions with 10 drug manufacturers about the VARR program, 7  of them told us that they had submitted Uniform Formulary VARRs for  DOD\u2019s consideration. Of these 7 manufacturers, 5 indicated that their  participation was driven by the possibility that their drug would be  selected for the uniform formulary. With regard to the Utilization VARR, 8  of the 10 manufacturers we spoke with indicated that there was little or no  incentive provided to manufacturers to enter into these rebate agreements  with DOD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Beneficiary Outreach Efforts Under Way", "paragraphs": ["DOD has outreach efforts under way intended to help encourage  beneficiaries to use the TMOP instead of retail pharmacies.

The priority for therapeutic class reviews is  determined by various factors, such as the conversion of a drug from  brand-name to generic and the rate of utilization among beneficiaries. The  P&T Committee first reviews the clinical effectiveness of the drugs in a  class. It considers such information as indications for which the drug has  been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the incidence and  severity of adverse effects, and the results of studies on effectiveness and  clinical outcomes. Using this information, the committee determines  whether the drugs are therapeutically equivalent. It then reviews the cost- effectiveness of the drugs, considering such information as the price and  rebate quotes submitted by manufacturers and the estimated financial  effect of possible formulary decisions. The committee then determines the  relative cost-effectiveness of each drug in the class.", "On the basis of the outcomes of both the clinical and cost-effectiveness  reviews, the committee recommends that each drug in the class be  designated as either formulary or nonformulary. If the committee finds  that the drugs in a class are therapeutically equivalent, it generally  recommends that the lower-cost drugs be designated as formulary.  However, the committee has recommended that certain higher-cost drugs  it believed offered additional clinical benefits be designated as formulary.", "For example, the committee recommended that two drugs used to treat  breakthrough pain in cancer patients, Fentora and Actiq, be designated as  formulary despite a more than a fortyfold increase in cost over the two  most cost-effective drugs in the class. While therapeutically equivalent to  the other drugs in the class, both Fentora and Actiq can be dissolved  orally, which the committee valued for patients who have difficulty  swallowing drugs in tablet form. In addition to recommending that a drug  be designated as formulary or nonformulary, the P&T Committee  recommends an implementation period to inform pharmacies and  beneficiaries of formulary decisions. Its recommendations are then  provided to the BAP.", "Once the BAP receives the P&T Committee\u2019s recommendations, it  provides comments on behalf of beneficiaries. It reviews each  recommendation and determines whether it agrees or disagrees with the  P&T Committee. As of October 2007, the BAP and the P&T Committee  disagreed about 17 percent of the time, mostly about the length of  implementation periods. For example, the P&T Committee recommended  that formulary and nonformulary designations for drugs used to treat  overactive bladder conditions become effective about 60 days after the  final formulary decision was made. The BAP stated that additional time  was needed to notify beneficiaries currently using drugs within the class,  suggesting that the formulary designations become effective about   120 days after the final formulary decision was made.

DOD officials stated that on the basis of the results  of the 2006 survey and feedback from military associations, they learned  DOD beneficiaries wanted an easy method to transfer their prescriptions  from retail pharmacies to the TMOP. In August 2007, DOD launched the  Member Choice Center, where beneficiaries can call for assistance,  register online for the TMOP, and transfer their prescriptions from retail  pharmacies. The center contacts the beneficiary\u2019s physician, at the  beneficiaries\u2019 request, to obtain new prescriptions and forward them to the  TMOP for processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Uses Pharmacy Data to Identify Beneficiaries for Disease Management Programs", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD officials, DOD uses PDTS data to identify beneficiaries  who might benefit from participating in DOD\u2019s disease management  program, an organized effort to achieve desired health outcomes in  populations with prevalent, often chronic diseases, for which care  practices may be subject to considerable variation. The PDTS contains  data on specific drugs, dosages, and dispensing dates. So, for example,  DOD uses PDTS data on drugs dispensed for asthma to identify  beneficiaries who have asthma. DOD uses this information and other  criteria to determine whether a beneficiary is a candidate for the asthma  disease management program. Once identified, DOD provides patient lists  to the managed care support contractors, who also provide the  information to MTFs. Providers are encouraged to support their patient\u2019s  active participation in the disease management program and to facilitate  care, such as needed laboratory tests or screening examinations.", "DOD implemented disease management programs for congestive heart  failure and asthma in September 2006 and diabetes in June 2007, which are  administered by the managed care support contractors. MTFs are required  to provide disease management programs for asthma, diabetes, and  screening mammograms. DOD conducts annual comprehensive analyses  to quantify the effect of the disease management programs. The NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2007 required that DOD\u2019s disease management program  address, at a minimum: diabetes, cancer, heart disease, asthma, chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder, and depression and anxiety disorders.

Retail pharmacy spending drove most  of the increase, primarily due to the lack of federal pricing arrangements  and increased beneficiary utilization at these pharmacies. In contrast,  increases in pharmacy spending at MTFs and the TMOP, typically the more  cost-effective points of service, were less pronounced. DOD has taken  steps to curtail its rising pharmacy spending, including using its uniform  formulary to obtain lower drug prices and creating a rebate program for  retail pharmacies\u2014efforts that have saved the agency hundreds of millions  of dollars. More recently, DOD established an outreach program to  encourage beneficiaries to transfer their prescriptions from retail  pharmacies to the TMOP, which has been a less costly option for both  DOD and its beneficiaries.", "DOD\u2019s ongoing efforts are important to limit future prescription drug  spending. In addition, the agency has its task force\u2019s proposals to consider,  which include changes to the copayment and tier structures aimed at  shifting beneficiary utilization away from retail pharmacies. The agency is  also undertaking a fundamental reform\u2014the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008  requirement to apply federal pricing arrangements to drugs dispensed at  retail pharmacies\u2014that could have an even greater effect on spending.  DOD will need to carefully monitor the effect of this new requirement  along with its ongoing efforts in order to assess the progress in controlling  spending.

DOD acknowledged that, when  fully implemented, this authority will have a significant impact on  controlling the growth in retail pharmacy costs. While this may likely be  the case, we reiterate the need for DOD to monitor the extent to which the  federal pricing reduces growth in pharmacy spending in order to  determine whether additional efforts to reduce spending are warranted.  With regard to our recommendation to implement other efforts, as needed,  to reduce growth in retail pharmacy spending, DOD responded that the  recommendations of its task force would have an impact on overall DOD  pharmacy costs in general and retail pharmacy costs in particular.  However, DOD stated that congressional action is necessary for these  measures to be implemented and that it stands ready to implement them if  granted the authority to do so. Nonetheless, our recommendation was not  limited solely to the task force recommendations. DOD could explore  other cost saving initiatives, similar to its outreach efforts to encourage  beneficiaries\u2019 use of the TMOP, which do not require congressional action.
