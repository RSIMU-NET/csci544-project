Exporters, including universities, are subject to these regulations if they ship export-controlled items overseas or if they share such items, including technology or source code, with foreign persons in the United States. University and association officials raised concerns that State and Commerce guidance and outreach does not adequately address export compliance issues that are more common to universities than to industry, such as fundamental research\u2014i.e., research that is ordinarily published and not subject to export control regulations. Without additional guidance and outreach that addresses such issues, universities may not have the information they need to adequately comply with these regulations and properly safeguard export-controlled items.", "Officials from selected universities and university associations identified three export control-related challenges in working with other federal agencies. For example, university and association officials asserted that Department of Defense (DOD) officials misunderstand the term fundamental research, which may limit universities' ability to conduct research for DOD. DOD acknowledged that some officials have inconsistently interpreted the regulations and that it has not yet fully addressed this challenge. Additionally, university and association officials expressed concerns that threat briefings and other guidance that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Homeland Security provide are not helpful because, for example, they do not contain unclassified information that can be shared widely. To address these concerns, the FBI partnered with a university association to produce a series of unclassified \u201cawareness-raising\u201d materials for university audiences, among other efforts.", "Seven of the nine universities GAO visited have export compliance policies and practices that generally align with State's and Commerce's export compliance guidelines. For example, most have demonstrated a strong management commitment to export compliance and have robust practices for tracking export-controlled items, recordkeeping, and reporting potential violations.

However, there is a risk that some foreign  students and scholars will transfer or \u201cexport\u201d sensitive information they  gain through their research in the United States back to their home  countries, which may be hostile to U.S. interests. If such transfers include  information about sensitive civilian or defense-related technologies, they  could have significant consequences for U.S. national security.

In a 2019 hearing before Congress, for example, an Acting  Assistant Director for Homeland Security Investigations at the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) testified that exploitation of academia is one  way in which adversaries are obtaining access to sensitive U.S. research.  He noted that China, Iran, and Russia are actively working to illicitly  acquire and transfer technologies whose export from the United States is  subject to government controls. Similarly, in its 2019 Worldwide Threat  Assessment, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence warned  that numerous foreign intelligence services continue to target national  security information and proprietary technology from U.S. research  institutions.

State and Commerce each play a significant role  in the implementation of U.S. export controls. State controls the export of  sensitive military items, known as defense articles and defense services,  such as tanks, fighter aircraft, missiles, and military training, which it lists  on the U.S. Munitions List (USML). Commerce controls the export of U.S.-origin items with both commercial and military applications (known  as \u201cdual-use\u201d items), such as computers, sensors and lasers, and  telecommunications equipment, as well as less sensitive military items,  which it lists on the Commerce Control List (CCL).", "Items subject to State and Commerce jurisdiction are governed by  separate laws and regulations. The Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as  amended, provides the statutory authority to control the export of defense  articles and services, which the President delegated to the Secretary of  State. State\u2019s ITAR implements this authority and identifies the specific  types of items subject to control in the USML. Within State, the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) is responsible for  implementing controls on the export of these items. The Export Control  Reform Act of 2018 provides the statutory authority for Commerce to  control the export of less sensitive military items not on the USML, dual- use items, and basic commercial items. In general, items subject to the  EAR include commodities, software, and technology. Commerce\u2019s EAR,  which contains the CCL, implements this authority.

Generally, unless a license exemption or  exception applies, exporters submit a license application to DDTC if their  items are controlled on the USML, or to BIS if their items are controlled on  the CCL. In addition to the shipment of tangible commodities or the  tangible or intangible transfer of software or technology outside of the  United States, export control regulations also consider the transfer or  release of certain U.S. technology or source code to a foreign person in  the United States to be an export.

Specifically, university and association officials noted that  companies are typically focused on developing proprietary technologies,  whereas universities are primarily focused on expanding knowledge through fundamental and collaborative research.

Representatives from one university association  explained that these new requirements are especially challenging for  universities because they typically accept funding from multiple agencies.  In addition, officials from one university stated that the variation across  the agencies\u2019 reporting requirements makes it difficult to develop one  process to support researchers\u2019 efforts to comply with them.

One university official said that it  would be helpful if agencies, where possible, could also provide some  unclassified information with clear examples that could then be shared  with researchers about current threats and what these threats may  look like in a university setting. Without such information, university  officials are restricted in how they can use the threat-related  information they obtain for raising awareness on campus, according to  a university association official.

For example, an  official from one association explained that in 2015 the FBI provided a  threat briefing at an association meeting and requested that university  officials contact the FBI if a researcher had, among other things,  published in an international scientific journal or attended an  international conference, or if any graduate students worked in  university laboratories late at night. This official noted that these FBI  officials did not understand that researchers must undertake such  activities to obtain tenure and that it is common for students to work  late at night. In addition, according to an official from one association,  when university officials ask the FBI to provide recent examples of  foreign students stealing sensitive or export-controlled items from U.S.  universities, the FBI often cites cases that occurred more than 10  years ago. He further stated that federal agencies are raising alarms  that universities are vulnerable to foreign theft of export-controlled  items without any concrete, recent examples.", "FBI threat briefings lack actionable guidance: University officials  told us that many FBI threat briefings are not helpful because they do  not provide actionable guidance for addressing identified threats,  which limits universities\u2019 understanding of how to address them.

According to FBI officials and a member of the  Academic Security and Counter Exploitation Executive Committee, the  FBI recognized that university officials were frustrated that relevant FBI  documents regarding the foreign threat to U.S. research were classified.  The association\u2019s Executive Committee member further explained that  this created significant restrictions on the way university officials could  use the materials for awareness and training efforts on campus. He  further noted that many of these \u201cawareness-raising\u201d materials were tone- deaf to the needs of academia and did not explain how the threats were  related to university researchers\u2019 work. The Academic Security and  Counter Exploitation Executive Committee worked with the FBI to revise  existing FBI handouts to create a series of academic-focused,  unclassified documents suitable for inclusion in awareness and training  programs on university campuses.

Officials at two universities  further stated that there appears to be an internal disagreement between  the program officers and contracting officers about how to interpret some  aspects of export control regulations. One university official said the  university tries to negotiate with DOD when contracts that the university  perceives as only containing fundamental research include export control- related clauses; however, the official said these types of delays slow the  pace of research.", "Moreover, university association officials noted that member universities  are reporting that DOD is increasingly including publication restrictions in  research contracts for projects that the universities believe only entail  fundamental research. Research does not qualify as fundamental  research if the researcher accepts any restrictions on the publication of  the information resulting from the research. Officials from one association  stated that DOD is reluctant to remove publication restrictions from award  contracts even when it acknowledges that the work may only involve  fundamental research. As a result, universities that only accept  contracts for fundamental research may decline an awarded contract if  the conditions for the award vary from initial expectations, which may lead  to a loss in research funding for many universities focused on  fundamental research.", "In 2008 and 2010, DOD issued memoranda to its personnel providing  clarifying guidance concerning fundamental research and directed that  information about contracted fundamental research be included in general  training modules for research program personnel. For example, these  memoranda state that DOD must not place restrictions on subcontracted  unclassified research that has been scoped, negotiated, and determined  to be fundamental research within the definition of National Security  Decision Directive 189 according to the prime contractor and research  performer and certified by the contracting component, except as provided  in applicable federal statutes, regulations, or executive orders. These  memoranda also state that the effective implementation of the guidance  requires that all DOD personnel involved in the acquisition and monitoring  of fundamental research have a clear and common understanding of the  relevant statutes, regulations, and policies, including the definitions of key  terms. To implement these memoranda, DOD also amended the defense  federal acquisition regulations in 2013 to update the relevant contract  clause for inclusion in DOD contracts.", "The Deputy Director for Basic Research at DOD stated that most program  officers and contracting officers are familiar with the export control  regulations and understand the term fundamental research and how to  interpret it in the context of university research, but acknowledged that  some officials have inconsistently interpreted the regulations and  misinterpreted the term fundamental research. Specifically, DOD officials  stated that program officers and contracting officers who frequently work  with universities through basic research grants understand what  constitutes fundamental research; however, program officers and  contracting officers working with applied research contracts may not be  as familiar with it or with engaging with universities.", "Furthermore, DOD officials acknowledged that although DOD has  developed export control-related training, it does not require program  officers and contracting officers to take this training. Officials stated that  not all program officers and contracting officers work with universities, so  they do not all need to take training on export control regulations.", "To address these and other research-related concerns, DOD\u2019s Office of  Basic Research convened a workshop for basic research program  officers in October 2019 to facilitate the sharing of best practices and  identify any concerns. According to DOD, program officers raised a  concern that they need to constantly ensure that the research being  conducted is properly categorized as basic or fundamental research and  has not transitioned into applied or non-fundamental research in the  course of the contract. DOD\u2019s Office of Basic Research is planning to  develop a checklist based on input from program officers that program  officers can use when determining whether the scope of a research  project meets the definition of fundamental research. Following this  workshop, a DOD official stated that program officers are best suited to  make technical and nuanced fundamental research determinations  because program officers have first-hand knowledge about the scope of  the research project.", "These actions, however, may not address the concerns universities  raised, because they do not include any effort to further educate  contracting officers. Contracting officers may add export control clauses  or publication restrictions to a contract award after the program officer  writes the original solicitation.

Hence, a checklist for program officers  may not fully address program officers\u2019 and contracting officers\u2019  inconsistent interpretation of the regulations, including determining  whether university research constitutes fundamental research. Without  additional efforts to educate all relevant DOD officials on a clear and  common understanding of the relevant statutes, regulations, and policies,  as identified by the department\u2019s 2010 memorandum, universities may  continue to perceive that DOD officials inconsistently interpret the  regulations and misunderstand whether research constitutes fundamental  research, potentially hindering DOD-funded research at universities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Universities We Visited Generally Have Developed Export Compliance Policies and Practices Aligned with Agency Guidelines, Though Some Gaps Exist", "paragraphs": ["The nine universities we visited have generally developed export  compliance policies and practices to safeguard export-controlled items  that align with State\u2019s DDTC and Commerce\u2019s BIS export compliance  guidelines, but some of the universities\u2019 compliance efforts have  weaknesses in certain areas (see fig. 2).", "We reviewed DDTC\u2019s and BIS\u2019s export compliance guidelines to identify  common elements and developed a list of eight elements that the  agencies classified as critical for an effective compliance program, such  as recordkeeping and training, among others.

All nine of the universities we visited  require the lead researcher on a project to submit research  proposals to an office charged with reviewing proposals and  awards for grants and contracts, which we refer to as the Office of  Grants and Contracts. The office also reviews the terms and  conditions for awards\u2014contracts, grants, or cooperative  agreements\u2014to ensure there is nothing in the paperwork that  necessitates additional negotiation or that raises a concern related  to export controls.

The universities we  visited have developed a variety of tools to support officials\u2019 export  control reviews of proposals and awards. For example, seven of  the nine universities we visited require the lead researcher on a  project to complete a questionnaire that includes export control- related questions when submitting research proposals for review.  This questionnaire identifies research proposals that may be  subject to export control regulations earlier in the process. In  addition, at least four of the universities\u2019 export control officers  have developed flowcharts or checklists to help the Office of  Grants and Contracts understand when to flag research proposals  or awards for further review by the export control officer. In  addition, seven of the nine universities we visited require that  researchers obtain university approval to conduct research  involving export-controlled items. For example, one university\u2019s  export control officer said that flagged proposals are sent to an  export control review committee for review and approval. The  committee reviews the risk associated with each of these research  projects and determines whether the university is willing to accept  the export control-related risks for that project. Another university  requires the lead researcher to obtain approval from the  university\u2019s board before accepting an award for research  involving export-controlled items.", "Monitors research to determine whether a license is required  after the project starts. Officials at five of the nine universities  described practices they had developed to monitor research projects  in order to determine whether an export license is required after a  research project is underway. For example, one university\u2019s export  control officer said her department monitors all research teams that  intend to develop hardware or technology during their research  because the resulting hardware or technology could be subject to  export control regulations. These projects are flagged in the electronic  system used to track research projects and the export control officer  checks in with the lead researcher periodically to determine the status  of the research. An official at another university explained that the  university conducts periodic audits of timecards to see if any foreign  persons have started charging time to ongoing projects involving  export-controlled items. In contrast, one official at another university  stated that the university relies on the lead researcher to alert the  compliance office of any changes to the research team or research  objectives, which may then require a license before continuing  research. This official suggested that the lead researchers are better  positioned than the export control officer to identify changes to the  research that might necessitate obtaining an export license.", "Tracking and Safeguarding Export-Controlled Items  Seven of the nine universities we visited used a variety of mechanisms to  track and safeguard export-controlled items, including manual locks,  electronic access systems, and other physical security systems, as well  as separate computer networks to protect data subject to export control  regulations. Under this category, we assessed universities\u2019 activities in  the following three areas:", "Tracks export-controlled items used at the university. Officials at  seven of the nine universities we visited said they had developed  mechanisms to track any export-controlled items being used or  developed by the university. These mechanisms range from  maintaining paper files to using electronic systems to track such  information. For example, some of the universities maintain physical  copies of documents they use to identify and track export-controlled  items on campus. Other universities have developed electronic  databases to track this information. One university maintains all  records related to research projects in one electronic system,  including technology control plans. Electronic databases and systems  allow the export control officer to quickly identify the on-campus  location of export-controlled items and who is working with these  items.", "Safeguards export-controlled items. Eight of the nine universities  we visited employ various security mechanisms to protect export- controlled items, including physical and information technology  security mechanisms. For example, officials at seven of the nine  universities we visited said their university protects export-controlled  items by limiting access to spaces where these items are housed with  locks or access cards, depending on the space. Three of these  universities also require researchers to store export-controlled items  in a locked box or storage space, in a locked room, when it is not in  use. Some universities also use signs to indicate which spaces are  restricted; however, officials at one university said that they do not use  signage to indicate restricted spaces because it would draw more  attention to the space. Some university officials also described  information technology security mechanisms in place to protect data  that may be subject to export control regulations. For example,  officials at two universities noted the use of isolated or separate  networks for researchers working with such data to limit access to this  data.", "Uses technology control plans to document and safeguard  export-controlled items. Officials at all nine of the universities we  visited stated that researchers used export-controlled items on  campus, and officials at eight of these universities said that their  universities had developed and implemented technology control plans  to safeguard such items. According to Commerce\u2019s export compliance  guidelines, organizations that possess or work with export-controlled  items and either employ foreign persons or have frequent meetings  with foreign persons should create a technology control plan. These  plans should include a physical security plan, an information security  plan, and training programs, among other components. According to  the university officials we interviewed, the export control officer  typically works with the lead researcher to develop the technology  control plan. Six of the nine universities we visited require the lead  researchers to sign the technology control plan to acknowledge that  they understand their responsibilities for protecting the export- controlled items identified in the plan, and at least four of these  universities require all the members of the research team to sign it as  well. In addition, some of the universities we visited conduct annual  audits of the technology control plans to ensure proper  implementation. For example, an official at one of these universities  explained that the university\u2019s annual audit of the technology control  plans verifies that security practices outlined in the plan are being  followed by the research team and that only those researchers who  signed the technology control plan have access to the export- controlled items. An official at another university said he reviews the  human resources account information for projects involving export- controlled items annually to verify that only those individuals who have  signed the technology control plan are working on those projects.", "Under this category, we assessed universities\u2019 activities in the following  two areas:", "Screens and monitors foreign visitors. All but one of the nine  universities we visited screen and monitor foreign visitors to some  extent. Specifically, four of these universities conduct restricted party  screenings on all foreign visitors prior to their visit to verify that  potential visitors are not on any U.S. government list of restricted or  proscribed parties. The other four universities conduct restricted  party screenings on some foreign visitors. Three of these four  universities said that they do not have a formal process for reviewing  foreign visitors and that the effort to invite and review visitors is  decentralized. Some of the universities we visited also described how  they monitor foreign visitors on campus. For example, officials at two  universities said that the foreign visitors\u2019 sponsor is responsible for  monitoring their access. The export control officer at a third university  told us that he briefs foreign persons visiting restricted spaces on the  rules of their visit, including restrictions on camera usage.", "Screens foreign parties associated with research projects. All  nine of the universities we visited use restricted party screening  software, which searches several lists that U.S. agencies continually  update to screen for restricted or denied parties. Universities and  other exporters may be prohibited or restricted from doing business  with any individuals or entities identified on one of these lists. Eight of  the nine universities we visited screen all foreign individuals and  entities associated with a research project using such software.  Entities associated with a research project may include foreign  researchers on the research team, foreign sponsors, or foreign  collaborators, among others. Officials at the ninth university stated  that they conduct ad hoc screening for research collaborations with  foreign entities. Additionally, one of the universities has compiled a list  of all the foreign entities the university works with and conducts  weekly restricted party screenings of the foreign entities on this list.  Although we focused our assessment on universities\u2019 export  compliance policies and practices in place to limit unauthorized  deemed exports to foreign persons, officials at some of the  universities we visited discussed their efforts to conduct restricted  party screenings for other process areas, such as shipping,  procurement, and gifts.
