Operating such a large number of centers is a significant cost to the  federal government, including costs for hardware, software, real estate,  and cooling. For example, according to the Environmental Protection  Agency, the electricity cost to operate federal servers and data centers  across the government is about $450 million annually. According to the  Department of Energy, data center spaces can consume 100 to 200 times  more electricity than a standard office space.

In addition, agencies were required to  submit an asset inventory baseline and other documents that would result  in a plan for consolidating their data centers. The asset inventory baseline  was to contain detailed information on each data center and identify the  consolidation approach to be taken for each one. It would serve as the  foundation for developing the final data center consolidation plan. The  data center consolidation plan would serve as a technical road map and  approach for achieving the targets for infrastructure utilization, energy  efficiency, and cost efficiency.", "While OMB is primarily responsible for FDCCI, the agency designated  two agency CIOs to be executive sponsors to lead the effort within the  Federal CIO Council, the principal interagency forum to improve IT- related practices across the federal government.

For example,  while most agencies provided complete information on their  virtualization efforts, network storage, and physical servers, 18 agencies  did not provide complete data center information, such as data center  type, gross floor area, and target date for closure. In particular, several  agencies fully reported on gross floor area and closure information, but  partially reported data center costs. In addition, 17 agencies did not  provide full information on their IT facilities and energy usage. For  example, the Department of Labor partially reported on total data center  IT power capacity and average data center electricity usage and did not  report any information on total data center power capacity.

However, most notably, 21  agencies did not fully report their expected cost savings; of those, 13  agencies provided partial cost savings information and 8 provided none.  Among the reasons that this information was not included, a Department  of Defense official told us that it was challenging to gather savings  information from all the department\u2019s components, while a National  Science Foundation official told us the information was not included  because the agency had not yet realized any cost savings and so had  nothing to report. Other significant weaknesses were that many agencies\u2019  consolidation plans did not include a full cost-benefit analysis that  included aggregate year-by-year investment and cost savings  calculations through fiscal year 2015, a complete master program   and quantitative goals, such as complete savings and  schedule,utilization forecasts.

While  almost 20 areas of success were reported, the 2 most often cited focused  on virtualization and cloud services as consolidation solutions, and  working with other agencies and components to find consolidation  opportunities. Further, while multiple challenges were reported, the two  most common challenges were both specifically related to FDCCI data  reporting required by OMB: obtaining power usage information and  providing a quality data center asset inventory.", "We further reported that, to assist agencies with their data center  consolidation efforts, OMB had sponsored the development of a FDCCI  total cost of ownership model that was intended to help agencies refine  their estimated costs for consolidation; however, agencies were not  required to use the cost model as part of their cost estimating efforts. We  stated that, until OMB requires agencies to use the model, agencies will  likely continue to use a variety of methodologies and assumptions in  establishing consolidation estimates, and it will remain difficult to  summarize projections across agencies.", "Accordingly, we reiterated our prior recommendation that agencies  complete missing plan and inventory elements and made new  recommendations to OMB to publically post guidance updates on the  FDCCI website and to require agencies to use its cost model.

The staff member added that, although data  center consolidation involves reductions in costs for existing facilities and  operations, it also requires investment in new and upgraded facilities and,  as a result, any current savings are often offset by the reinvestment of  those funds into ongoing consolidation efforts.

Because closing facilities is a  significant driver in realizing consolidation savings, the time required to  realize planned cost savings will likely extend beyond the current 2015  time frame. With at least one agency not planning on realizing savings  until after 2015 and other agencies having not yet reported on planned  savings, there is an increased likelihood that agencies will either need  more time to meet the overall FDCCI savings goal or that there are  additional savings to be realized in years beyond 2015. Until OMB tracks  cost savings data, the agency will be limited in its ability to determine  whether or not FDCCI is on course toward achieving planned  performance goals.

Regarding the second recommendation, OMB neither  agreed nor disagreed. However, the Federal CIO stated that, as the  FDCCI and PortfolioStat initiatives proceed and continue to generate  savings, OMB will consider whether updates to the current time frame are  appropriate.", "In summary, after more than 3 years into FDCCI, agencies have made  progress in their efforts to close data centers. However, many key  aspects of the integration of FDCCI and PortfolioStat, including new data  center consolidation and cost savings goals, have not yet been defined.  Further compounding this lack of clarity, total cost savings to date from  data center consolidation efforts have not been determined, creating  uncertainty as to whether OMB will be able to meet its original cost  savings goal of $3 billion by the end of 2015. In the absence of tracking  and reporting on cost savings and additional time for agencies to achieve  planned savings, OMB will be challenged in ensuring that the initiative,  under this new direction, is meeting its established objectives.", "Recognizing the importance of effective oversight of major IT initiatives,  OMB directed that three oversight organizations\u2014the Task Force, the  GSA FDCCI Program Management Office, and OMB\u2014be responsible for  federal data center consolidation oversight activities. These organizations  have performed a wide range of FDCCI responsibilities, including  facilitating collaboration among agencies and developing tools to assist  agencies in their consolidation efforts. However, other key oversight  activities have not been performed. Most notably, the lack of formal  guidance for consolidation plan peer review and approval increases the  risk that missing elements will continue to go undetected and that  agencies\u2019 efforts will not fully support OMB\u2019s goals. Further, OMB\u2019s March  2013 memorandum does not address whether the Task Force and GSA\u2019s  Program Management Office will continue their oversight roles, which  does not help to mitigate this risk. Finally, while OMB has put in place  initiatives to track consolidation progress, consolidation inventories and  plans are not being reviewed for errors and cost savings are not being  tracked or reported. The collective importance of these activities to  federal data center consolidation success reinforces the need for  oversight responsibilities to be fulfilled in accordance with established  requirements.", "Chairman Mica, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
