GAO examined a nonprojectable sample of 22 critical transportation assets, reviewed relevant DOD guidance and documents, and interviewed cognizant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TRANSCOM has taken some actions to identify, prioritize, and assess its critical transportation assets but, according to officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs (ASD[HD&ASA]), its methodology for doing so, until recently, has been inconsistent with the intent of DOD's various DCIP guidance and with the approach adopted by some of the other combatant commands and military services. TRANSCOM considers entire installations--military air bases, seaports, and commercial airports--as critical assets, rather than identifying assets with greater specificity, such as individual runways, navigation aids, and fuel storage facilities. This methodology diminishes the reliability of the critical transportation asset list, a condition that impedes DOD's ability to prioritize its critical assets departmentwide and effectively target spending on risk-reduction efforts. Further, TRANSCOM was using its vulnerability assessments to identify specific critical transportation assets on the installations. This practice conflicts with DOD's DCIP guidance not to use vulnerability assessments to identify critical assets. Though TRANSCOM officials stated that they now plan to discontinue this practice, they were unable to provide ASD(HD&ASA) or GAO with any documentation to confirm that this decision had occurred officially. Further, TRANSCOM's memorandum of understanding with the Joint Staff to participate as transportation subject matter experts on the Joint Staff's vulnerability assessments with a DCIP module is still in draft. In May 2008, TRANSCOM officials told GAO that they now plan to use the draft DCIP critical asset identification process to reevaluate its 300 identified critical transportation assets; however, a timeline to complete this has not yet been determined. DOD installation personnel at the 22 sites GAO visited have taken actions to help assure the availability of critical transportation assets; however, these actions have routinely occurred independent of DCIP. Consequently, they do not consider the full spectrum of threats and hazards and they tend to focus on preventing mass personnel casualties instead of critical asset assurance. DCIP's impact at the installations where the assets are located was negligible because of the lack of service-specific guidance. This gap in guidance hinders installation personnel's ability to make informed risk management decisions based on asset criticality. Coordination efforts between installation personnel and non-DOD owners of critical transportation assets and supporting public works infrastructure were substantial, but have been focused on the protection of people and not on asset assurance. DOD has allocated approximately $283 million for DCIP from fiscal years 2004 to 2008, including $8.6 million to TRANSCOM for its combatant command and defense sector responsibilities. Critical infrastructure assurance efforts also have been funded through other DOD complementary programs, such as the Antiterrorism Program, and through foreign government contributions. Although existing DCIP funding does not include funding for remediating asset vulnerabilities, remediation has been funded from these other sources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on a global network of critical  surface, sea, and air transportation infrastructure\u2014such as roads,  railways, seaports, military air bases, and commercial airports\u2014to carry  out its missions. The incapacitation or destruction of one or more of the  assets constituting this network of critical infrastructure could have a  debilitating effect on DOD\u2019s ability to project, support, and sustain its  forces and operations worldwide. DOD\u2019s critical transportation  infrastructure is owned by both DOD and non-DOD entities, including  private companies, state and local governments, and foreign governments.  Because of its importance to DOD operations, this critical infrastructure  represents an attractive target to adversaries, and may also be vulnerable  to a host of natural disasters and accidents. DOD has recognized and  emphasized the importance of assuring the availability of mission-critical  infrastructure in the most recent versions of the National Military Strategy  and the Quadrennial Defense Review. Critical assets in the Transportation  Defense Sector depend on public works infrastructure that provides the  utilities needed for many transportation critical assets to remain  operational. To identify and help assure the availability of mission-critical  infrastructure, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense  and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs (ASD) was assigned  responsibility for the risk-based Defense Critical Infrastructure Program  (DCIP) in September 2003. ASD(HD&ASA) subsequently issued guidance  in August 2005 articulating the roles and responsibilities for DOD  organizations involved in the program.", "Under DCIP, DOD created 10 functionally based defense sectors and  designated a Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead Agent (sector lead agent)  for each sector. The U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) is the  sector lead agent for the Transportation Defense Sector. DOD Directive  3020.40 assigns the sector lead agent responsibility for, in collaboration  with other DCIP stakeholders, identifying the interdependencies among  infrastructure that crosses DOD sector boundaries, and for maintaining a  characterization of sector support functions, systems, assets, and  dependencies as they relate to identified operational capabilities and  assets. Because TRANSCOM also is a combatant command, it is  responsible for preventing and mitigating the loss of DOD-owned critical  assets, within its assigned area of responsibility, and for coordinating with  the military services and other sector lead agents in identifying and  assessing critical assets. In addition to DCIP, DOD has established several  other complementary programs, such as the Antiterrorism Program, that  predate DCIP but contribute indirectly to the protection and assurance of  critical assets.", "You requested that we review a number of issues related to DOD\u2019s  mission-critical infrastructure. To date, we have issued four reports in  response to that request. Our first report examined the extent to which  DOD has developed a comprehensive management plan for DCIP and the  actions needed to identify, prioritize, and assess defense critical  infrastructure. The second report examined DOD\u2019s efforts to implement a  risk management approach for defense industrial base critical assets. The  third report examined the extent to which DOD included highly sensitive  assets in its critical infrastructure program. Finally, the fourth report  focused on threats and vulnerabilities affecting intelligence, surveillance,  and reconnaissance operations at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. As  agreed with your offices, we plan to issue two additional reports later this  year. The first report evaluates DOD\u2019s efforts to assure the availability of  critical infrastructure in the Space; Intelligence, Surveillance, and  Reconnaissance; and Global Information Grid Defense Sectors. The other  report examines the extent to which DOD has trained key personnel and  developed expertise to assist DOD organizations across five defense  sectors in assuring the availability of critical infrastructure and has  incorporated the assurance of critical infrastructure into exercises.", "In 2007, we reported that DCIP implementation at the department, military  service, and combatant command headquarters levels was relatively  immature. To understand what impact this was having on the availability  of mission-essential transportation and supporting public works assets,  this report focuses on DOD and non-DOD (i.e., foreign) installations where  the critical transportation assets are located. Specifically, we evaluated   (1) the extent to which TRANSCOM has identified, prioritized, and  assessed its critical transportation assets; (2) the extent to which DOD  installation personnel have taken actions to help assure the availability of  critical transportation assets, both within and independent of DCIP; and  (3) how DOD is funding critical transportation asset assurance.", "We drew a nonprobability sample of critical transportation assets in the  United States and abroad, using draft critical asset lists developed by the  Joint Staff, each of the four military services, and TRANSCOM. We  selected assets based on (1) overlap among the various critical asset lists;  (2) geographic dispersion among geographic combatant commands\u2019 areas  of responsibility; (3) representation from each military service; and          (4) representation in the three asset categories\u2014air bases, seaports, and  commercial airports\u2014TRANSCOM identified in the continental United  States, and in the European, Middle Eastern, and Pacific regions.

We  reviewed Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessments that  focus on critical infrastructure, when available, for those DOD and foreign  installations we visited. Also, we analyzed relevant Office of the Secretary  of Defense (OSD), military service, and combatant command guidance and  funding data. Within DOD, we interviewed officials from OSD, the Joint  Staff, defense agencies, the military services, combatant commands,  subcomponent commands, sector lead agents, and installation-level  organizations in the United States and abroad. In addition, we interviewed  officials at the Department of Homeland Security, at three U.S. embassies  and three commercial airports; host nation officials; and officials in both  the private sector and academia.

Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Currently, the Transportation  Defense Sector consists of 300 critical air bases, seaports, and commercial  airports worldwide and owned by DOD, other U.S. governmental  organizations, private companies, and foreign governments. According to  TRANSCOM officials, the Transportation Defense Sector is highly resilient  because of significant redundancy among the various modes of  transportation, particularly as it relates to surface transportation. For  example, the size and capabilities of the U.S. rail and highway networks  afford ability to reroute shipments via alternate roads and rail lines in the  event of disruptions, a key reason why surface transportation assets were  not identified as critical.", "In addition to DCIP, DOD has established other complementary programs  that help assure critical assets, including the Antiterrorism Program and  the Defense Continuity Program. The Antiterrorism Program is intended  to establish protection standards for DOD assets against terrorist attacks.  The Defense Continuity Program is intended to ensure that DOD mission- essential functions continue under all circumstances, such as a man-made  or natural disaster. DCIP supports a risk-management process that seeks  to ensure defense critical infrastructure availability. The risk-management  process is comprised of a risk assessment component that identifies  critical assets and infrastructure interdependencies that support DOD  missions. Applicable follow-on threat and vulnerability assessments are  then conducted on those assets to complete the risk assessment. The risk  response component ensures that limited resources are optimally  allocated towards those assets deemed most important to overall mission  success for DOD, and for which it has been determined that the identified  level of risk is unacceptable.", "Several DOD organizations have key roles in helping assure the availability  of DOD\u2019s transportation critical assets.

TRANSCOM officials told us that they identified larger systems of assets\u2014 categorized as air bases, seaports, and commercial airports\u2014based on  their interpretation of the definition of an asset as outlined in DOD  Directive 3020.40. TRANSCOM officials explained that these types of  installations are part of its worldwide Defense Transportation System that  is necessary to carry out TRANSCOM\u2019s missions. This broad list of assets  has been submitted to the Joint Staff for inclusion in DOD\u2019s overall draft  critical asset list. Because of TRANSCOM\u2019s interpretation of the guidance,  its critical asset list lacks the specificity of the critical asset lists prepared  by some of the other combatant commands and military services.  Moreover, according to ASD(HD&ASA) officials, TRANSCOM\u2019s decision to  identify entire installations was inconsistent with the intent of DCIP  guidance. While TRANSCOM is not the only combatant command or  military service to identify an entire installation as critical, it is the only  organization that has done so for its entire list. DOD guidance requires  combatant commands to first identify their missions, the critical assets  that support those missions, and the threats and hazards to those critical  assets, and then assess the vulnerability of the critical assets to the threats  and hazards identified (see fig. 2).", "TRANSCOM skips steps two and three listed in figure 2 and instead has  been using Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessments to  identify specific critical assets.

As a result of  continued submission of entire installations as critical assets,  ASD(HD&ASA) published in March 2008 the Strategy for Defense Critical  Infrastructure to reiterate the need for greater specificity in critical asset  identification. Further, ASD(HD&ASA) is developing the DOD Critical  Asset Identification Process manual, which is still in draft, but also notes  that stopping the asset identification process at the system level (e.g., an  air base, seaport, or commercial airport) does not meet the needs of DCIP,  and that rarely is an entire system essential to mission success. For  example, it is insufficient to identify an air base as a critical asset; rather,  more specific assets, such as a runway, should be identified as  appropriate. Figure 3 illustrates the DCIP critical asset identification  process and where TRANSCOM\u2019s previous efforts have stopped.", "TRANSCOM officials stated that because the DOD Critical Asset  Identification Process manual was still in draft, they had initially chosen  not to implement its contents until its formal publication. According to  TRANSCOM officials, beginning in May 2008, TRANSCOM began the  process to develop coordination methods to facilitate the use of the  criteria in the draft DOD Critical Asset Identification Process manual for  the identification and validation of assets prior to submitting them to the  Joint Staff. TRANSCOM has recognized that this process will require time  to complete a meaningful critical transportation asset list; however, a  timeline to complete this process has not yet been established.", "Complicating the process of identifying and prioritizing critical assets has  been TRANSCOM\u2019s use of Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability  Assessments. Though contrary to DCIP guidance, TRANSCOM has been  using its vulnerability assessments to identify specific critical assets rather  than using the process outlined in DCIP guidance to identify specific  critical assets. As a result, TRANSCOM officials could not tell us what  specific transportation assets at a given site were critical, stating that in  the absence of a Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment it  could be, though not necessarily, assumed that what was identified as  critical at one location might be critical at another. For example, if a  Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment identified specific  critical assets (such as a runway, navigation aids, or a fuel depot) at an air  base as critical, it could be reasonably assumed that the same assets  would probably be critical at other air bases.

However, while TRANSCOM officials agreed during our  review to begin reevaluating their critical assets using established criteria  in the draft manual, our recommendation also calls for TRANSCOM to  develop a timeline for completing this action. DOD acknowledged in its  written comments that while the draft manual provides a process for  critical asset identification, it has not yet provided timelines for the  various milestones. DOD\u2019s comments stated that ASD(HD&ASA) will work  with the various components to establish timelines, but estimated that the  manual will require approximately 1 year to complete, and will require  timely cooperation and participation by numerous stakeholders. We  believe that establishing these timelines is essential so that TRANSCOM  can reevaluate and update the identification of all critical transportation  assets in a timely manner.", "DOD partially concurred with our draft recommendation that TRANSCOM  finalize the memorandum of understanding with the Joint Staff to  discontinue the use of Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability  Assessments as its primary tool for identifying its critical assets. In its  written comments, DOD noted that this recommendation contained two  separate issues: (1) the discontinuation of the Transportation  Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessments as means to identify critical  assets and (2) the finalization of a memorandum of understanding between  TRANSCOM and the Joint Staff. DOD noted in its written comments that  the purpose of the memorandum of understanding is to define the roles  and responsibilities of transportation subject matter experts to augment  the enhanced DCIP module rather than to discontinue the use of the  Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessments. In response to  DOD\u2019s comments and to reflect this distinction, we made this two  recommendations rather than one. DOD also stated that no additional  direction on ASD(HD&ASA)\u2019s part is required because TRANSCOM has  already taken steps to address both of these issues. As noted in our report,  however, TRANSCOM officials were unable to provide ASD(HD&ASA) or  us with any documentation to confirm that they have discontinued the use  of the Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessments.  TRANSCOM\u2019s discontinuation of the Transportation Infrastructure  Vulnerability Assessments as a means of identifying critical transportation  assets and its adoption of the manual\u2019s methodology are both key to  TRANSCOM\u2019s ability to provide DOD with an accurate list of critical  transportation assets. Further, while we recognize that TRANSCOM has  taken steps to coordinate with the Joint Staff to define its roles and  responsibilities for the DCIP module to the Joint Staff Integrated  Vulnerability Assessment, the memorandum of understanding remains in  draft. Timely completion of the draft memorandum of understanding is  important so that TRANSCOM\u2019s expertise can be adequately leveraged on  future vulnerability assessments of critical transportation infrastructure.  Therefore, we believe this recommendation remains valid.", "Finally, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to develop and  implement service-specific guidance based on published DOD DCIP  guidance. In its written response, DOD stated that the Army has already  developed and is implementing service-specific guidance, and it noted that  the military departments prefer to wait for the official publication of the  draft DOD Critical Asset Identification Process manual before  implementing service-specific guidance. We acknowledge the Army\u2019s  efforts and recognize that other military services may prefer to wait until  the manual is published before they implement service-specific guidance.  However, our recommendation is based on the entire body of DOD\u2019s DCIP  guidance\u2014not just the draft DOD Critical Asset Identification Process  manual, which is focused primarily on identification of critical assets and  will take at least another year to complete. In our view, service-specific  DCIP guidance should be issued promptly based on DOD Directive 3020.40  and DOD Instruction 3020.45, which have been finalized at the OSD level.  In the absence of timely service-specific DCIP guidance, installation  personnel will continue to rely primarily on antiterrorism plans instead of  on an all-hazards approach to remediate, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the  vulnerabilities to critical transportation infrastructure.", "As agreed with your offices, we are sending copies of this report to the  Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Committees on  Appropriations, Senate and House Committees on Armed Services, and  other interested congressional parties.

Further, to become  more familiar with additional work being conducted on defense critical  infrastructure, we met in Arlington, Virginia, with officials from the George  Mason University School of Law\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection  Program and in Washington, D.C., with the Congressional Research  Service (Resources, Science, and Industry Division).", "We drew a nonprobability sample of critical transportation assets located  in the United States and abroad, using several critical asset lists developed  by the Joint Staff, each of the four military services, and TRANSCOM. The  assets we selected for review were initially drawn from the Joint Staff\u2019s list  of Tier 1 critical transportation assets; however, the list includes only 4  Tier 1 critical transportation assets worldwide. To increase the size of our  sample, we used TRANSCOM\u2019s Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical asset lists, which  together total 300 critical assets. Further, we analyzed critical asset lists  from each of the four military services for overlap with TRANSCOM\u2019s  critical asset list. From this, we selected 22 assets for review that included  geographic dispersion among two countries in each geographic region  (Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific). We also selected assets from  each military service and that were representative of the three principal  types of assets identified by TRANSCOM\u2014air base, seaport, commercial  airport. Our cases for review included two of the four Tier 1 critical  transportation assets. The specific assets we reviewed, their locations, and  the missions that they support are omitted from this appendix, since that  information is classified.

For the critical transportation assets that we selected, we also spoke with  the asset owners and operators about their reliance on public works assets  that support the critical assets.", "To evaluate TRANSCOM\u2019s identification and assessment efforts of its  critical transportation assets, we reviewed documentation and guidance  and met with officials from ASD(HD&ASA), the Joint Staff, the military  services, and TRANSCOM. We analyzed critical asset identification criteria  and guidance and compared the guidance with current asset identification  efforts. In addition, we spoke with DOD installation and U.S. embassy  personnel to discuss their involvement with various DOD critical asset  data calls and other efforts they participated in to identify critical assets.  We reviewed TRANSCOM\u2019s Transportation Infrastructure Vulnerability  Assessments for assets we selected for review to determine if specific  critical transportation assets below the installation level were identified.  We also attempted to match these critical assets identified through the  TRANSCOM\u2019s vulnerability assessments with assets listed on  TRANSCOM\u2019s critical asset list.", "To determine the extent to which DOD installation personnel have taken  actions to help assure the availability of critical transportation assets, both  within and independent of DCIP, we reviewed DOD guidance on risk  management and other complementary programs. In addition, we  reviewed and analyzed installation emergency management plans and  continuity of operations plans to determine how, if at all, critical assets  were incorporated. We also interviewed combatant command,  subcomponent, and installation personnel responsible for assuring the  availability of critical transportation assets to ascertain the adequacy of  guidance, assessments, inspections, funding, and other processes to  enhance asset availability. Finally, we assessed the supporting public  works infrastructure for the 22 assets we selected for review to determine  their impact on the availability of the critical asset.", "To determine how DOD is funding critical transportation asset assurance,  we reviewed and analyzed DCIP funding data and we interviewed officials  from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief  Financial Officer. Additionally, we interviewed officials from  ASD(HD&ASA) and TRANSCOM to verify that the funding data were  comprehensive and reflected DCIP funding from all sources.
