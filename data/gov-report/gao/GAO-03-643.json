Of the land disputes the plan did not address, the most politically significant, complex, and expensive dispute involves the potential relocation of U.S. forces from Yongsan Army Garrison, located in the Seoul metropolitan area. As a result, the LPP, as approved, covered about 37 percent of the $5.6 billion in construction costs planned at U.S. military installations in South Korea over the next 10 years. Ongoing reassessments of U.S. overseas presence and basing requirements could diminish the need for and alter the locations of many construction projects in South Korea, both those associated with the LPP and those unrelated to it. For example, over $1 billion of ongoing and planned construction associated with improving military infrastructure at Yongsan Army Garrison and U.S. installations located north of Seoul--areas where there is uncertainty about future U.S. presence--has recently been put on hold, canceled, or redirected to an installation located south of Seoul. GAO identified some key challenges that could adversely affect the implementation of the LPP and future U.S. military construction projects throughout South Korea. First, the plan relies on various funding sources, including funding realized through land sales from property returned by the United States.

The LPP, as originally approved, promised to reduce the number  of U.S. military troop installations from 41 to 23 and to consolidate many  U.S. facilities north of Seoul (the capital of South Korea), along with other  facilities south of Seoul. Under the plan, financing of new construction to  support consolidations and relocations of U.S. forces in South Korea was  expected to rely on revenue generated from land sales following U.S.  return of selected facilities and training lands to South Korea, on host  nation funding, and on U.S. military construction funding. The LPP was  predicated on continuing to maintain U.S. bases and facilities north of  Seoul (near the demilitarized zone that separates North Korea from South  Korea). Since passage of the LPP by the South Korea National Assembly  on October 30, 2002, there have been various indications that the United  States is re-examining how and where it may want to station its forces  overseas in the future. Prominent among them have been statements by  U.S. officials that the United States is considering a range of options for its  troops in South Korea, including repositioning them away from Seoul and  from areas north of Seoul (near the demilitarized zone).", "The Senate report on military construction appropriations for fiscal year  2003 directed us to review the LPP to provide the Congress with a better  understanding of the plan, associated costs, burden-sharing implications,  and other related factors that the plan may not address.

We  visited 16 U.S. military installations and facilities in South Korea that  would be affected by the plan, including sites that will be closed, partially  closed, or expanded. We also visited land transfer sites that remain  unresolved and military construction projects that are not addressed in the  plan, and we met with officials from the Department of Defense and the  Department of State to identify challenges that could also affect future  military construction projects throughout South Korea. In addition, we  interviewed officials and reviewed documents from the Department of  Defense, which provided perspective on the department\u2019s studies  concerning a potential change to the role, size, and basing of U.S. forces in  South Korea.

At the same time, rapid growth and  urbanization in South Korea during the last several decades have created a  greater demand for land and increased encroachments on areas used by  U.S. forces. Consequently, many of the smaller U.S. camps and training  areas that were originally located in isolated areas are now in the middle  of large urban centers, where their presence has caused friction with local  residents; urban locations also limit the ability of U.S. forces to train  effectively.

A DOD survey conducted in 2001 found that Army and  Air Force personnel considered South Korea as the least desirable  assignment and that many soldiers were avoiding service in South Korea  by various means, including retirement and declining to accept command  assignments. U.S. Forces Korea has wanted to make South Korea an  assignment of choice by improving living and working conditions,  modifying assignment policies to increase accompanied tours to  25 percent by 2010, and reducing the out-of-pocket expenses for personnel  to maintain a second household in South Korea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Korea Land Partnership Plan", "paragraphs": ["To address these problems, military officials from the United States and  South Korea signed the Land Partnership Plan on March 29, 2002.

According to U.S. Forces Korea officials, there have always been groups in  South Korea that have criticized the U.S. presence and have claimed that  the U.S. presence hinders reconciliation between North and South Korea.  Demonstrations against American military presence increased sharply  during last year\u2019s South Korean presidential election. South Koreans  were angered in November 2002 by a U.S. military court\u2019s acquittal of  two American soldiers charged in association with a tragic training  accident that claimed the lives of two South Korean schoolgirls in  June 2002. The South Korean government wanted the two American  soldiers who had been operating the vehicle involved in the accident  turned over to South Korean authorities; however, they were tried in a  U.S. military court. As a result, South Koreans demonstrated against  U.S. forces in Korea, carried out isolated violence directed at U.S. soldiers,  and practiced discrimination against Americans (such as businesses  refusing to serve them). Subsequently, other groups demonstrated in  support of the U.S. government. At the same time, the United States and  South Korea were working to strengthen their alliance and to address  issues involving North Korea\u2019s active nuclear weapons program and the  proliferation of its missile programs.", "In December 2002, the Secretary of Defense and the Defense Minister of  South Korea agreed to conduct a Future of the Alliance study to assess the  roles, missions, capabilities, force structure, and stationing of U.S. forces,  including having South Korea assume the predominant role in its defense  and increasing both South Korean and U.S. involvement in regional  security cooperation. The results of the Future of the Alliance study  are not expected until later this year. In February 2003, the Secretary  of Defense testified before the Congress that the United States was  considering the relocation of U.S. troops now based within and north of  Seoul, including those near the demilitarized zone. Consideration of such  a move would be in keeping with a broader reassessment of U.S. presence  overseas that is now underway. In April 2003, the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs and other U.S. officials  met with officials of the South Korean Ministry of National Defense to  discuss redeploying U.S. troops and relocating key military bases in South  Korea. Following these discussions, the U.S. and Korean press reported  that the United States would relocate from Yongsan Army Garrison in  Seoul to an area located south of Seoul. According to the U.S. Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs, both  South Korea and the United States have decided that this is an issue that  cannot wait any longer for resolution. U.S. and South Korean officials  are expected to hold more discussions to finalize the realignment of  U.S. troops by fall 2003.", "Moreover, the Secretary of Defense has recently directed acceleration  on work that began during the development of the 2001 Quadrennial  Defense Review, related to the global positioning of U.S. forces and their  supporting infrastructure outside the United States. In March 2003, the  Secretary of Defense requested that the Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, develop a comprehensive  and integrated presence and basing strategy for the next 10 years.

As far back as  far as 1982, negotiations over some land returns have been deadlocked  and left unresolved. For example, the relocation of Yongsan Army  Garrison remained unresolved because of its projected financial cost to  South Korea. The relocation of the garrison has been and continues to be a  politically sensitive, complex, and expensive issue for U.S. Forces Korea  and the South Korean government. In 1991, the governments of the United  States and South Korea signed an agreement to relocate the garrison by  1996. In 1993, the plan was suspended, largely because of the anticipated  high cost and the lack of alternative locations for the garrison. More than  a decade later, the relocation of Yongsan is an ongoing, contentious  issue. Since the 1990s, U.S. military and South Korean officials have  held discussions on moving the military base out of the city, including  screening various suburb locations.

While U.S. officials expect the South  Korean government to fund much of the cost of these additional basing  changes, details have not yet been finalized. The South Korean  government is also expected to remain responsible for providing funding  for the relocation of forces now based at the Yongsan Army Garrison  property, although those costs could be reduced by the fact that a residual  number of U.S. and United Nations personnel are expected to remain at  Yongsan. It should also be noted that the Yongsan Garrison property is  expected to be used for municipal purposes and is not subject to resale to  provide funding to support relocation of U.S. forces. At this point,  insufficient information is available to determine precisely how many  replacement facilities will be required for U.S. troops moving out of  Yongsan Garrison and to anticipate any difficulties that might be  encountered in obtaining the funding. However, if South Korea encounters  problems or delays in acquiring needed lands and providing replacement  facilities, future projects could be delayed.

Historically, the stability of host nation funding from South Korea has  been subject to some uncertainty because international economic factors  have played a part in determining the level of funding. South Korea host  nation payments are paid in both South Korean won and U.S. dollars;  consequently, a downturn in the South Korean economy or a sharp  fluctuation in the South Korean currency could affect the South Korean  government\u2019s payments. For example, during South Korea\u2019s economic  downturn in 1998, host nation payments were less than expected (the  United States received from South Korea $314.2 million of the $399 million  that had been agreed to).", "Designating up to 50 percent of host nation funding for the LPP would also  limit funding for readiness and other needs. Non-LPP readiness-related  infrastructure funding shortages previously identified in readiness reports  at the time of our visit to South Korea in November 2002 were estimated  to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and represented competing  requirements for limited funding. Such needs included Air Force facilities  at Osan and Kunsan ($338.2 million), Navy facilities at Pohang and  Chinhae ($10.3 million), and Army facilities at Humphreys, Carroll, and  Tango ($25.2 million). Recently, U.S. Forces Korea officials have also  expressed the desire to increase from 10 percent to 25 percent the number  of servicemembers in South Korea who are permitted to be accompanied  by their families. While these expressions have not been finalized, such an  increase could be expected to cause a significant increase in the demand  for housing, schools, and other support services and could result in greater  competition for U.S. and Korean funding. For example, U.S. Forces Korea  officials estimated that the increased demand for housing alone would  cost $900 million in traditional military construction funding and, to  reduce costs, officials were exploring a build-to-lease program using  Korean private-sector funding and host-nation-funded construction,  where possible.", "In the past, funding from U.S. military construction accounts, which  represent 13 percent of funding for the LPP as originally approved, has  fluctuated.

We selected these installations and facilities because they provided a  cross-section of the activities that are covered by the plan (i.e., some that  will be closed, some that will be scaled back, some that will be expanded,  some where new construction will take place, and some possible new  installation locations). We also visited land transfer sites that remain  unresolved and military construction projects that are not addressed in the  plan to gain an understanding and perspective on the wide range of  infrastructure issues affecting U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.", "To determine the implications of potential basing changes on the plan  and other construction projects in South Korea, we obtained the views of  officials from the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Logistics Directorate and Strategy  Division); Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (Office of Asia-Pacific  Affairs); and U.S. Forces Korea on the potential impact of changing  defense policies. We conducted a literature review of U.S. and South  Korean publications to collect information on the LPP and possible basing  changes in South Korea. We also attended various congressional hearings,  which discussed funding for U.S. Forces Korea construction projects and  potential basing changes. We used this information to identify the costs  of ongoing and planned construction associated with improving  military infrastructure in areas where there is uncertainty about future  U.S. presence\u2014such as Yongsan Army Garrison and U.S. installations  located north of Seoul. We did not verify the accuracy and completeness  of this information.", "To identify implementation challenges associated with the plan that could  affect future U.S. military construction projects in South Korea, we met  with officials from the above organizations and reviewed the Status of  Forces Agreement, an agreement under Article IV of the Mutual Defense  Treaty between South Korea and the United States, and other related  agreements and defense guidance. We discussed challenges that must be  addressed during implementation of the LPP and implementation issues  associated with the plan that could affect future construction projects  throughout South Korea.", "We performed our review from September 2002 through May 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of the Land Partnership Plan", "paragraphs": ["The Land Partnership Plan (LPP) provides a comprehensive plan for  more efficient and effective stationing of U.S. Forces in South Korea. The  LPP is intended to strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance, improve the  readiness posture of combined forces, reduce the overall amount of land  granted for U.S. Forces Korea use, and enhance public support for both  the South Korean government and U.S. Forces Korea, while positioning  U.S. forces to meet alliance security requirements well into the future.", "According to U.S. Forces Korea officials, LPP imperatives are as follows:    The agreement should be based on readiness and security, not the amount  of land involved.", "The agreement should be comprehensive, allowing for land issues that  cannot be resolved independently to be resolved as part of a package and  ensuring stationing decisions that fit into a comprehensive vision for the  disposition of U.S. forces.", "When new land and facilities are ready for use, U.S. Forces Korea can  release old land and facilities. U.S. Forces Korea needs all existing  facilities and areas and can only return them when replacement facilities  are available or the requirement is met in another manner.", "The agreement should be binding under the Status of Forces Agreement.  The LPP is not just an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d but also a commitment to  take action, and it operates within the Status of Forces Agreement\u2014which  means there are no new rules.", "The agreement should be self-financing\u2014the costs of the LPP must be  shared between the United States and South Korea. U.S. funding is  provided from the military construction account. The South Korean  government provides host nation funds and funding obtained from sales  of property returned to South Korea by the United States.", "As a general rule, the United States funds the relocation of units from  camps the United States wishes to close, and South Korea funds the  relocation of units from camps that South Korea has asked the United  States to close. The execution of the LPP is shown in figure 1.", "The LPP has been negotiated under the authority of the Joint Committee  under the Status of Forces Agreement. The Status of Forces Agreement  gives the Joint Committee the authority and responsibility to determine  the facilities and areas required for U.S. use in support of the United  States/South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty. The Joint Committee  established the Ad-hoc Subcommittee for LPP to develop and manage  the LPP. The LPP components address installations, training areas, and  safety easements.", "Installations: The LPP reduces the number of U.S. installations from  41 to 23 and consolidates U.S. forces onto enduring installations. The LPP  establishes a timeline for the grant of new land, the construction of new  facilities, and the closure of installations. Figure 8 illustrates the sequence  in which new lands are to be granted to the United States and their  relationship to facilities that will be returned to South Korea from calendar  years 2002 through 2011.", "Training Areas: The LPP returns U.S. training areas in exchange for  guaranteed time on South Korean ranges and training areas. To ensure  the continued readiness of U.S. Forces Korea, the United States agrees  to return certain granted facilities and areas and to accept the grant of  joint use of certain South Korea military facilities and areas on a limited  time-share basis as determined by the Status of Forces Agreement Joint  Committee. The United States is expected to return approximately  32,186 acres, or 39,396,618 pyong, of granted training areas. Table 1  shows the exclusive use of existing grants retained by U.S. Forces Korea.", "Table 2 shows training areas that will be provided on a temporary basis to  U.S. Forces Korea.", "Table 3 shows new safety easements to be designated for training areas.", "Table 4 shows training areas that will be returned to South Korea under  the LPP.", "Table 5 shows training areas where parts of the land will be returned to  South Korea.", "Table 6 shows training facilities and areas that the South Korean  government is expected to grant to the U.S. for joint use for the  time specified.", "Safety Easements: According to U.S. Forces Korea officials, a safety  easement is a defined distance from an explosive area that personnel and  structures must be kept away from and is directly related to the quantity  and types of explosives and ammunition present. The presence of Korean  citizens in areas requiring explosive safety easements has placed them at  risk of injury or death in the event of an explosion. Tables 7, 8, and 9 show  the various tiers of easements established under the LPP at U.S. military  installations. Upper tier easements are those required at enduring  installations; middle tier easements are required during armistice, but will  not be required after a change in the armistice condition; and lower tier  easements are those required at closing installations. U.S. Forces Korea  shall enforce safety easements inside U.S. installations, while South Korea  will enforce safety easements outside U.S. installations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
