The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires GAO to compare CHS program payment rates with those of other public and private payers. GAO examined (1) how payments to physicians by IHS's federal CHS programs compare with what Medicare and private health insurers would have paid for the same services, (2) physicians' perspectives about how a cap on payment rates could affect them, (3) hospitals' perspectives about how the MLR requirement affected them, and (4) IHS and tribal officials' perspectives about the MLR requirement and a potential cap on nonhospital services. GAO compared 2010 physician claims data for federal CHS programs with the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and claims from private insurers. GAO also spoke to a nongeneralizable sample of 10 physicians and 9 hospitals that interacted frequently with IHS and spoke to IHS and tribal officials where these providers practiced."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Indian Health Service's (IHS) federal contract health services (CHS) programs primarily paid physicians at their billed charges, which were significantly higher than what Medicare and private insurers would have paid for the same services. IHS's policy states that federal CHS programs should purchase services from contracted providers at negotiated, reduced rates. However, of the almost $63 million that the federal CHS programs paid for physician services provided in 2010, they paid about $51 million (81 percent) to physicians at billed charges and about $12 million (19 percent) to physicians at negotiated, reduced rates. Payments for other types of nonhospital services followed similar trends, with about $40 million out of $52 million (77 percent) paid at billed charges. GAO estimated that IHS's federal CHS programs paid two times as much as what Medicare would have paid and about one and a quarter times as much as what private insurers would have paid for the same physician services provided in 2010. If federal CHS programs had paid Medicare rates for these services, they could have used an estimated $32 million in savings to pay for many of the services that IHS is unable to fund each year. Savings for the overall CHS program may be even higher, as this analysis does not include other types of nonhospital services or the CHS program funding that goes to tribal CHS programs, which the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Inspector General found also paid for nonhospital care above Medicare rates.", "Although the 10 physicians GAO interviewed were among those most frequently paid by federal CHS programs, 8 said their CHS program payments constituted 10 percent or less of their total payments. Some physicians identified ways that capping CHS program payments for nonhospital services, including physician services, at Medicare rates could benefit the CHS program and physician practices. However, other physicians were concerned that reducing payment rates to Medicare levels could negatively affect their practices.", "Seven of nine hospitals GAO interviewed said the Medicare-like rates (MLR) required by statute had little negative effect, generally because they already had contracts with the CHS program to be paid Medicare rates. While two hospitals previously paid by the CHS program at or near billed charges said they were financially affected by the MLR requirement, both said it had not affected their delivery of care to CHS program patients.", "IHS and tribal officials GAO interviewed said the MLR requirement for hospital services generated savings that allowed CHS programs to expand access to health care. They said that a cap on nonhospital service payments, including physician services, could have benefits and challenges. Most IHS officials indicated that it was unlikely they could negotiate many more contracts. Some tribal officials said that some physicians might think Medicare rates were too low and decide to no longer accept tribal patients, although they agreed that a cap at these rates could save money. IHS officials noted, however, that they would not be able to implement a cap for nonhospital services, including physician services, unless the agency received explicit statutory authority to do so.", "HHS stated in its comments that it concurred with GAO's conclusions and recommendation and added that imposing a cap at Medicare rates would allow IHS to fund additional services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider capping CHS program payments for nonhospital services, including physician services, at rates comparable to other federal programs.

These services are provided through direct care at federally or tribally  operated facilities\u2014such as hospitals and health centers. When services  are unavailable at these facilities, the facilities may use IHS contract  health services (CHS) program funds to pay for patients to obtain  services from external providers, including hospitals and office-based  physicians. The CHS program at each individual facility may be federally  or tribally operated and is responsible for managing program funds.  However, our prior work has found that available CHS program funds  have not been sufficient to ensure access to care for American Indians  and Alaska Natives. In 2005, we reported that the CHS program was not  able to pay for all eligible services, and that these gaps sometimes  resulted in diagnosis and treatment delays that could exacerbate the  severity of a patient\u2019s condition and thus the need for more intensive  treatment. Since then, funding for the CHS program has increased from  $498 million in fiscal year 2005 to almost $845 million in fiscal year 2012.  However, we recently reported that the CHS programs at federal and  tribal facilities continue to be unable to pay for all eligible services.", "This inability to pay for all eligible care underscores the need for the  agency to maximize its use of resources, and thus attention has been  paid to the rates the CHS program pays external providers. Providers set  billed charges\u2014the amounts they bill before any negotiated rates are  applied\u2014but the payments they receive vary by payer. Historically, the  CHS program paid providers for services at either their billed charges or  at lower rates negotiated with the providers. In comparison, Medicare and  private insurance are two of the largest sources of revenue for many  providers. Medicare pays providers according to a formula that includes  several factors, such as geographic location, and private insurers typically  have contractual arrangements with providers under which they negotiate  lower payment rates for services on behalf of their members or  beneficiaries. In 1986, IHS issued a policy stating that it should not  contract to pay more for services than other federal programs and that it  would contract to purchase services only with providers that agreed to  accept negotiated rates no higher than those paid by Medicare, which  covered almost 49 million people in 2011. The policy also stated that it  should only use noncontracted providers in certain situations. However, in  1999, HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that the CHS  program continued to pay most providers at rates that were higher than   It also reported that, because of the nature of  those paid by Medicare.care provided (often specialty or emergency services), IHS was not  always able to consider costs when purchasing services from providers  and that, because of the voluntary nature of the policy, many providers  did not respond to IHS\u2019s requests to negotiate reduced rates.", "In 2003, the Congress established a payment rate cap on CHS program  payments for hospital services so the program could use the resulting  savings to expand patient access to care. Specifically, the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required  that Medicare-participating hospitals accept patients of both federally and  tribally operated CHS programs and accept payment at no more than  Medicare rates\u2014referred to as Medicare-like rates (MLR)\u2014for services  provided. IHS implemented this MLR requirement in July 2007. This  requirement did not apply to physician services, including those provided  in hospitals, or to services by providers at other nonhospital service  locations. For care in these other settings, physicians and other  nonhospital providers would continue to be paid at either their billed  charges or at negotiated rates below their billed charges.", "In a September 2009 follow-up report, the OIG found that about   71 percent of payments for nonhospital claims were paid at rates higher  than the Medicare rates. It also reported that both federal and tribal  CHS programs faced challenges trying to negotiate lower rates with  providers, especially in rural areas with few providers. On the basis of  these results, the OIG recommended that IHS seek legislative authority to  cap CHS program payments for nonhospital providers. In a September  2009 study, IHS estimated that from fiscal years 2006 through 2008,  federal CHS programs paid a total of about $195 million to nonhospital  providers, which was about $85 million more than if these services had  been paid at the Medicare rates. As of January 2013, IHS had not  addressed the OIG\u2019s recommendation to seek legislative authority to cap  CHS program payments to nonhospital providers.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires GAO to study the  amounts paid for health care furnished by providers under the CHS  program, including a comparison with the rates paid by other public and  private payers. To respond to this mandate, this report examines  (1) how payments to physicians by IHS\u2019s federal CHS programs compare  with what Medicare and private health insurers would have paid for the  same services, (2) physicians\u2019 perspectives about how a federally  required cap on payment rates could affect them, (3) hospitals\u2019  perspectives about how the MLR requirement has affected them, and   (4) IHS and tribal perspectives about the effect of the MLR requirement  on hospitals and the potential effect of a MLR requirement on nonhospital  services.", "To examine how payments to physicians by IHS\u2019s federal CHS programs  compare with what Medicare and private health insurers would have paid  for the same services, we obtained paid federal CHS program claims  from IHS for health care services provided in calendar year 2010, the  most recent year for which the most complete data were available. These  claims data did not include claims paid by tribal CHS programs. We  examined payments for physician and other nonhospital services, which  were not subject to the MLR requirement. We excluded services for which  the patient had another form of insurance, because the CHS program is  generally a payer of last resort and the federal CHS programs\u2019 payments  would have reflected only the remaining balances after payments from  the primary payers. There were 372,840 nonhospital services where  federal CHS programs were the primary payer; payments for these  services constituted about 44 percent of total payments for all services  provided by federal CHS programs in 2010. From this group of  nonhospital services, we isolated physician services. Specifically, we  excluded nonhospital services that were not covered by the 2010  Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. We also excluded services provided  by anesthesiologists because the information collected by IHS about  these services did not contain all of the information necessary to  determine comparable Medicare rates. There were 246,273 remaining  physician services where federal CHS programs were the primary payer,  constituting about 24 percent of total payments for all services provided  by federal CHS programs in 2010. For each physician service, we  compared the CHS program payment amount to the corresponding rate  on the 2010 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. When determining the  Medicare rates, we priced the services as they were identified in the CHS  program claims and we did not independently verify the accuracy or  completeness of the CHS program claim information. As Medicare  does, we adjusted the payment rate for a given service according to the  physician\u2019s geographic location and the service setting, such as whether  the service was provided in a hospital or a physician\u2019s office. We also  compared the CHS program payments for physician services with those  of private insurers. To estimate the rates that private insurers paid, we  obtained the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims  and Encounters Database, which contains claims paid by 100 insurers  and includes enrollees located in 50 states in 2010. To account for any  variation in payments due to geographic location, we compared only  those physician services from the federal CHS program claims data that  were provided in the same county as those in the private insurance  claims data. Of the 246,273 total physician services in the federal CHS  program claims data, we identified 231,099 (about 94 percent) services  that were paid for by private insurers in the same counties. For each  county, we calculated an average rate paid by private insurers for a  service and compared that average rate with the federal CHS programs\u2019  payment for that service. We priced the services as they were identified in  the CHS program and private insurer claims and we did not  independently verify the accuracy or completeness of either payer\u2019s claim  information. We assessed the reliability of IHS\u2019s federal CHS program  claims data, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule data, and the Truven  Health Analytics MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and Encounters  Database by reviewing documentation and discussing the database with  knowledgeable officials. We also performed data reliability checks, such  as examining the data for missing values and obvious errors, to test the  internal consistency and reliability of the data. After taking these steps,  we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine physicians\u2019 perspectives about how a federally required cap  on payment rates could affect them, we interviewed a sample of 10  physicians paid by federal CHS programs for services provided in 2010.  To identify physicians located on or near reservations, we limited our  selection to those physicians located in counties designated by IHS as  CHS Delivery Areas (CHSDA). Of these, to ensure that our sample was  geographically diverse and contained physicians who interacted  frequently with federal CHS programs, we divided the physicians into  groups according to their urban or rural location and identified the top   25 percent of physicians according to their volume of paid CHS program  services provided in 2010. This gave us a list of 101 rural physicians and  a list of 757 urban physicians who interacted the most frequently with  federal CHS programs. From each list, we selected 4 rural physicians and  6 urban physicians, 2 of whom we selected from among the top 5 percent  of each list on the basis of their claims volume. The physicians we  interviewed represented a range of specialties, including radiology,  cardiology, ophthalmology, surgery, and primary care. Of the 10  physicians we selected, 5 worked in group practices, 3 in solo practices, 1  was a rural health clinic, and 1 was a billing-services company that  provided those services to the selected physician and more than 60 other  clients.

Patients must  meet certain requirements to have their services paid for by the CHS  program. For example, patients must be members of federally recognized  tribes and live in specific areas.

Further, savings for the overall CHS program may be  even higher, as this analysis does not include payments for other types of  nonhospital services paid by the federal CHS programs, as well as  payments by tribally operated CHS programs, which receive over half of  annual CHS program funding and have also been found to pay for  nonhospital services above the Medicare rates. For example, a 2009  OIG report found that there was no difference between federally and  tribally operated CHS programs in terms of the percentages of  nonhospital claims paid above Medicare rates. It estimated that  federally and tribally operated CHS programs could have saved almost  half of total spending on nonhospital services if nonhospital payments  were capped at Medicare rates. This suggests that both federally and  tribally operated CHS programs are likely to achieve significant savings if  they paid physicians and other nonhospital providers according to what  Medicare would have paid for the same services. The potential for  savings is particularly significant in light of the CHS program\u2019s inability to  pay for all needed services.", "IHS\u2019s federal CHS programs paid physicians at rates that were higher  than Medicare rates because they primarily paid physicians at their billed  charges.

One of these  physicians added that paying physicians according to Medicare rates  would allow all physicians to receive payment under a consistent  methodology. Another physician said he negotiated a contract with the  CHS program for lower, Medicare rates because, in his opinion, IHS  should not be paying physicians at billed charges that are higher than the  rates paid by Medicare. A physician paid by the CHS program at billed  charges higher than Medicare agreed that Medicare rates were  appropriate. He said that he is already receiving Medicare rates for many  patients because the majority of his work is done in a hospital and many  patients needing his services are older. Further, one physician noted that  such a cap could increase his practice\u2019s CHS program payment, as he  currently receives Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rates from the CHS  program, but a cap on payments for nonhospital services could allow him  to be paid at the higher cost-based reimbursement that he receives from  Medicare.", "Four of the physicians we interviewed, three of whom said they were paid  by the CHS program at billed charges higher than Medicare, did not  support such a cap and expressed varying concerns about its effect on  their finances and patient access to care.

The 2007 implementation of the MLR  requirement for hospitals allowed IHS and tribes to reduce the cost of  hospital services and use those savings to pay for more care. Nonhospital  services, including physician services, were not included in the scope of  the MLR requirement, and the CHS program continues to rely on the  ability of area offices to negotiate contracts with individual providers for  reduced rates that are lower than billed charges. Since 1986, IHS policy  has stated that area offices should attempt to negotiate with providers at  rates that are no higher than Medicare rates, and IHS officials we  interviewed described time-consuming efforts to establish such contracts.  However, in 2010, IHS still primarily paid nonhospital providers, including  physicians, at their billed charges. Our findings, which indicate that IHS  could have saved an estimated $32 million out of the $62.5 million that  federally operated CHS programs spent on physician services provided in  2010, are consistent with a 2009 OIG report and a 2009 internal IHS  study.
