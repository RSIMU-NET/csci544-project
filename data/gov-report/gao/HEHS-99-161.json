The demonstration is designed to test whether DOD, by forming Medicare Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) at six sites, can provide accessible and quality health care to military retirees and their survivors and dependents, while not increasing federal costs for either Medicare or DOD.", "Military health care and Medicare share a sizable service population. There are 1.3 million military retirees (including their dependents and survivors) who are 65 and older. Most of them are eligible for Medicare as well as for military health benefits\u2014dual eligibles\u2014and many of these dual eligibles are enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare or a Medicare HMO. Some of these Medicare enrollees obtain Medicare-covered health services at military treatment facilities (MTF) as well as from their private physician or HMO. However, legislation prior to this demonstration prohibited Medicare from reimbursing DOD, which had paid for these services from appropriated funds. DOD\u2019s 1999 appropriation for military health care was almost $16 billion, of which about $1.2 billion was spent on those 65 and older.", "Although retirees 65 and older have historically received some care at MTFs, prior to this demonstration DOD could not offer them comprehensive care. DOD had a managed care program (TRICARE Prime), but only for service members on active duty, retirees under 65, and their respective dependents and survivors. However, once they reached 65, retirees were no longer eligible for TRICARE Prime. The demonstration program, called TRICARE Senior Prime, extends DOD-provided managed care at the six sites to these older retirees.", "Senior Prime differs from TRICARE Prime in three important ways. First, Senior Prime covers Medicare benefits, such as care at a skilled nursing facility, in addition to TRICARE Prime benefits. Second, Senior Prime serves two masters. It must comply with Medicare as well as DOD requirements and answer to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which administers the Medicare Program, as well as to Defense health care officials. Third, Senior Prime involves Medicare subvention payments to DOD, provided that certain conditions are met.", "In principle, the subvention demonstration offers several advantages. It enables older military retirees to obtain Medicare managed care benefits within the military health care system, which is an option that military retiree groups have supported. It also enables DOD to receive Medicare funds for services to Medicare-eligible retirees, beyond what DOD was already providing at its own expense. Medicare might gain from the subvention demonstration if its payments to DOD are lower than what Medicare would otherwise have paid on behalf of these beneficiaries.", "However, key features of the demonstration are new and there were many questions as to how the program would work out. Accordingly, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which established this demonstration, directs us to evaluate the demonstration\u2019s results. The BBA poses 15 evaluation questions covering 3 key areas: feasibility of and difficulties in program implementation; costs to Medicare and DOD; and effects on beneficiaries (in terms of access to and quality of care). The questions also ask about possible side effects\u2014for example, whether the demonstration affects other users of DOD health care, military readiness and training, and private providers. We have already issued an initial report on cost information and related payment issues. Other interim reports on cost, access, and quality issues will follow this report. The BBA calls for us to issue a final report several months after the demonstration ends in December 2000.", "This report focuses on program implementation during the start-up phase of the demonstration. Our objectives were (1) to report on progress in establishing the ground rules for program operation, receiving HCFA approval, attracting enrollment, and starting to deliver health services; (2) to present information on useful practices and operational difficulties that emerged during program start-up; and (3) drawing on experience to date, to identify issues for the future.

DOD delivers health care through its system of almost 500 MTFs worldwide. These facilities include 15 medical centers that offer extensive specialty care and provide graduate medical education (GME), such as residency training. In addition, DOD operates 76 smaller community hospitals with less extensive service options and 374 clinics offering outpatient services only. Pharmacy services are available at most MTFs and are free-of-charge.", "The direct care provided at MTFs is supplemented with care provided by a network of contracted civilian providers through DOD\u2019s TRICARE program. TRICARE offers beneficiaries three options for health care delivery, including an HMO option called TRICARE Prime. There are 12 TRICARE regions within the U.S., each headed by a lead agent, who is usually the commander of the largest medical center in the region. Each region also has a managed care support contractor who manages the private provider network and performs various beneficiary assistance and management support services. The Office of the Lead Agent (OLA) oversees the TRICARE management support contractor for the region and coordinates TRICARE activities.", "Priority for military medical care is given to active-duty personnel and their dependents and retirees under 65 who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime, thus enabling them to receive comprehensive health care coverage. TRICARE Prime coverage ends when a retiree reaches 65. Older retirees are eligible to receive medical care at an MTF, but only when space is available. Some MTFs have considerable space available after high-priority beneficiaries have been served, and others have very little space."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program for the elderly, some disabled people, and people with end-stage kidney disease. Medicare covers 39 million beneficiaries and spends about $212 billion a year. Its benefits include hospital, physician, and other services, such as home health care and limited skilled nursing facility care. Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and hospice care; Medicare Part B covers physician and other outpatient services for beneficiaries who choose to pay a monthly premium.", "Traditional Medicare reimburses private providers on a fee-for-service basis and allows Medicare beneficiaries to choose their own providers without restriction. Beneficiaries who receive care are responsible for part of the charges. Medicare beneficiaries can also join a Medicare HMO, and Medicare+Choice provisions that took effect in January 1999 permit them to choose other private health plans as well. Currently, 17 percent of these beneficiaries use Medicare managed care. Most Medicare managed care plans have only modest beneficiary cost-sharing and some offer extra benefits, such as eyeglasses and prescription drugs. Military retirees are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as anyone else.", "HCFA administers Medicare and regulates participating providers and health plans. Both headquarters and regional office HCFA staff have oversight responsibilities regarding Medicare+Choice organizations. Headquarters staff handle legal and financial matters, while the regions are responsible for operational matters.", "HCFA\u2019s oversight of Medicare+Choice plans begins with the certification process. To receive certification and begin health care delivery, an organization must complete the following tasks, among others: submit a comprehensive application to HCFA and respond to HCFA\u2019s requests for clarification and additional information; develop an organizational structure, bylaws, and policies and procedures, which are subject to approval by HCFA; conduct training for all staff and providers, including making provisions for training of new staff as they come onboard; prepare for and participate in a HCFA site visit, during which a team of HCFA personnel examine policies and procedures to determine if the site has the potential to deliver health care according to HCFA regulations; upon HCFA approval, begin marketing activities to inform beneficiaries enroll beneficiaries and provide for coordination of their health care, by assigning each to a primary care manager or by other means; and begin delivery of health care.", "HCFA requires a variety of performance information from the plans once they are in operation and conducts both technical assistance and monitoring visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Demonstration", "paragraphs": ["To test a program granting Medicare-eligible military beneficiaries guaranteed access to health care provided through DOD but paid for by Medicare, Congress established the Medicare Subvention Demonstration Project.

The DOD Medicare demonstration program is known as Senior Prime.", "The goal of this demonstration is to provide a cost-effective alternative for accessible and quality health care while not increasing the federal cost for Medicare or DOD. HHS is to reimburse DOD from the Medicare Trust Funds for Medicare-covered health care services provided to Medicare- eligible military beneficiaries at an MTF or through contracts. However, to receive payment, DOD must at least match DOD\u2019s baseline cost for serving this dual-eligible population in the recent past.", "To be eligible for Senior Prime, dual-eligibles must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B, reside in one of the six geographic areas covered by the demonstration, and have used an MTF before July 1, 1997, or become Medicare-eligible after that date. Beneficiaries enrolled in the program will not have to pay a premium during this demonstration, but must pay any applicable cost-sharing amounts and must agree to receive all of their health care exclusively through Senior Prime. They will be subject to all of the Medicare+Choice requirements. Enrollees must have a primary care manager within the MTF. The benefit package for Senior Prime is the full Medicare benefits package supplemented by other benefits that DOD provides for its TRICARE Prime enrollees, such as prescription drugs.

For more specific information about each site, consult appendixes I through VI at the end of this report.", "The MTFs in the demonstration sites vary in size and types of services offered. The medical centers (Madigan, Brooke, Wilford Hall, San Diego, and Keesler) offer a wide range of inpatient services and specialty care, as well as primary care.  These centers also have GME training programs. The Sheppard, Reynolds, Evans, and Air Force Academy MTFs are smaller community hospitals with more limited capabilities. Much of the specialty care at these hospitals is contracted out to the civilian network. One site, Dover, is a clinic, offering only outpatient services at the MTF and thus requiring all inpatient and specialty care to be purchased from the civilian network.", "The six demonstration sites serve Senior Prime populations within the 40- mile radius, or catchment area, around each facility. All sites had served seniors to some extent before the demonstration. At the medical centers, seniors had been a substantial part of the workload to support GME in both primary and specialty care. Centers with GME in internal medicine had formed panels of seniors who regularly received primary care at the MTF. At most of the smaller sites, and in specialty areas in which a particular medical center did not have a GME program, care for seniors was more limited and likely to be episodic.", "Some demonstration sites are located in areas such as the Seattle-Tacoma area, San Diego, and San Antonio where seniors can choose among a number of private Medicare HMOs.

We then visited each of the six sites 8 to 12 weeks after the start of program operation at that location. At the sites, we conducted group interviews with administrators and staff, including the lead agent, medical director, health delivery staff, financial managers, and contractor officials as well as beneficiaries and representatives of retiree groups. We collected interview and documentary data on site features pertinent to this demonstration; processes used to set up the program and enroll and serve beneficiaries; issues that arose and how they were addressed; initial results, such as enrollees\u2019 use of health care and Senior Prime\u2019s impact on other patient populations and on MTF operations generally; and lessons learned.", "Follow-up teleconferences were conducted with the sites toward the end of the study period when the sites had from 4 to 8 months\u2019 experience with program operation. We analyzed documentary and interview data to identify crosscutting and site-specific issues as well as effective problemsolving strategies.", "The six sites we studied can support operational findings about the demonstration as a whole. However, the study has several limitations. Although they illustrate a variety of conditions, the six demonstration sites\u2014four of which are major medical centers\u2014are not representative of the universe of DOD health care facilities. A site\u2019s capacity to support the demonstration and its evaluation was a factor in site selection, so our findings will not necessarily apply to sites that do not meet this capacity threshold. We did not conduct interviews with network providers or providers outside of the demonstration plan, nor did we independently verify study data. These findings pertain to the start-up period but not to mature operation of the program. It is also too early to measure midterm or long-term results of the program. We have no comparable information about approval and early implementation for multisite, private Medicare+Choice organizations.", "We conducted our review from October 1998 through June 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Department of Defense, but none were provided.  We also requested comments from the Health Care Financing Administration, and their written responses are presented and evaluated in the final section of this report and reprinted in appendix VII."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Application Process Encountered Difficulties, But All Sites Earned HCFA Approval", "paragraphs": ["The process of securing HFCA certification for demonstration sites to receive Medicare contracts proved difficult in two respects. First, the process got off to a late start, and there was considerable pressure to complete it quickly. The demonstration could not get started until HHS and DOD had negotiated a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that set forth the basic conditions of the demonstration. Several complex issues had to be resolved along the way. The MOA spelled out the benefit package, rules for Medicare\u2019s payments to DOD, and the HCFA requirements DOD would have to meet, along with some exceptions, such as waivers of HCFA regulations concerning physician licensing and fiscal soundness. In general, DOD would be operating a Medicare+Choice plan following all of the HCFA requirements.", "Although the MOA certified that DOD had the resources and expertise to operate the demonstration program, the MOA still required that each demonstration site submit an application to be certified through the HCFA approval process. (In requiring each site to complete an application, HCFA was following the same procedure that it would use with any multisite, private Medicare+Choice organization, such as Kaiser Permanente.)", "The six sites were not officially announced until the MOA was signed on February 13, 1998, by which time 6 weeks of the demonstration period (which started Jan. 1, 1998) had already passed. DOD immediately directed sites to prepare application materials and submit them within a few weeks. Site officials commented that 3 months would have been a more reasonable length of time.", "Second, having had no prior experience with HCFA reviews, DOD initially underestimated the detailed and Medicare-specific nature of the information required. Given that the MOA had recognized that existing DOD and TRICARE procedures meet many of HCFA\u2019s requirements, DOD officials had thought that the applications could be based largely on central- and site-level documents that were already on hand. The applications initially submitted consisted largely of such documents, and thus described procedures and service provider networks that predated Senior Prime. These applications did not include signed contracts with network providers of Medicare services as HCFA requires, nor did they describe the site-level policies and procedures through which Medicare requirements would be met. From HCFA\u2019s viewpoint, these applications were incomplete and, if not part of a demonstration, would have been sent back for further development.", "In view of the pressure of time and considering that demonstration programs are often given extra assistance, HCFA officials agreed to proceed with the application review and scheduling of site visits despite the deficiencies in the applications. However, these officials emphasized that signed contracts would have to be available for inspection during the site visit and that standard review criteria and procedures would be applied. To further speed the reviews, HCFA scheduled site visits sooner than usual after the application review, gave the demonstration sites priority over other applicants and contributed extra central staff to the site reviews where a particular regional office did not have sufficient staff available, and permitted two sites to proceed with marketing on the basis of verbal approval so as to enable services to start by selected target dates.", "DOD, in turn, provided funding for sites to retain consultants experienced in Medicare to help the sites prepare for the reviews. The demonstration sites varied in their initial knowledge of HCFA requirements and in the amount of work (especially network development) that remained to be done. Each site team mounted an all-out effort to prepare for the site visits. The first sites were visited in June 1998. DOD staff from the earlier sites gave later sites the benefit of their experience, and the last two site visits were completed by the end of September 1998.", "The sites\u2019 efforts were ultimately successful. All of the sites received certification. However, because of the time required to develop the MOA and complete the application and review process, the demonstration will cover 24 to 28 months of service rather than 3 years.", "The first site certified, Madigan, began service September 1, 1998, and all of the sites had begun delivering services by January 1, 1999. HCFA reviewers found the site visit presentations and staff commitment to the program impressive. But two lessons from the experience stood out in our review. First, the application process was more demanding and time- consuming\u2014and required more reworking of existing procedures\u2014-than DOD had envisioned. Officials at nearly every site told us that completing all of the work required in the short time available was a major difficulty they faced in implementing the program. Second, HCFA facilitation of the process was critical. HCFA officials indicated that under normal circumstances, the process would have taken considerably longer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Levels Reflected Both General and Local Factors", "paragraphs": ["Initial enrollment in the demonstration was lower than DOD officials and other observers expected, and enrollment rates varied considerably from site to site. The demand for enrollment appeared to reflect both the temporary nature of the demonstration and site-specific factors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Temporary Nature of the Demonstration Affected Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["At every demonstration site, we heard either directly from beneficiaries or from Senior Prime staff that many retirees were reluctant to enroll in Senior Prime because of the temporary nature of the demonstration. Some took a \u201cwait and see approach,\u201d wanting some time to observe the demonstration before committing themselves. Other beneficiaries were concerned about how they would receive medical care after the demonstration was over and whether they would be able to affordably re- enroll in their previous Medigap (supplementary insurance) plans or other Medicare HMOs when the demonstration ended. The fact that the temporary nature of this demonstration reduced enrollment numbers to an unknown degree argues that the demonstration may not be an accurate indicator of the number of people who would enroll in a permanent program.", "The Medigap issue was a major concern to retirees who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. Medigap policies are private health insurance policies that require a monthly premium and cover certain expenses not covered by fee-for-service Medicare. The BBA provided that participants in demonstration programs would be guaranteed issuance of a Medigap policy and protected against price discrimination if they applied for Medigap insurance after leaving the demonstration. However, implementation of this \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d provision required action by state insurance commissioners. The timing of such actions was uncertain at the beginning of the demonstration. Accordingly, DOD\u2019s marketing materials warned potential enrollees that it may be difficult for them to obtain Medigap coverage under previous terms and conditions when they disenrolled from the demonstration. Beneficiaries told us that a couple pays as much as $190 per month for Medigap coverage. Some beneficiaries did not drop their Medigap policies when enrolling in Senior Prime because of their concern that Medigap re-enrollment would be at a higher rate. However, this problem is being worked out as the demonstration continues. As of the end of July 1999, guaranteed issue protections were in place in each state that includes a demonstration site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Site Factors Also Made a Difference", "paragraphs": ["Our interviews indicated that there were also variables at each site that affected enrollment, such as the breadth of services available at the MTF, amount of space-available care at the MTF, health care environment in the area, and maturity of the TRICARE program.", "The demonstration sites varied in the number of eligible beneficiaries within each catchment area, the enrollment capacity, and the number enrolled, as shown in table 2 below.", "Site officials told us that they arrived at their Senior Prime capacity figure by estimating the workload capability of physicians in the primary care clinics. Financial considerations played a role at some sites, as discussed in a later section of this report. As shown in table 2, the percentage of the eligible population that a site could accommodate if filled to capacity varied from 11 percent to 42 percent. The lowest capacity percentages were at Madigan and San Diego. The highest were at Keesler, Dover, and the Texoma sites, where Senior Prime is the only Medicare HMO in the market area.", "Although most sites anticipated that there would be a high initial demand for enrollment, only two MTFs filled up within the first few months\u2014 Madigan reached capacity the 3rd month of operation, and Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio reached capacity the 4th month. The Air Force Academy Hospital reached capacity after 6 months, and Brooke Army Medical Center reached capacity at 8 months. By the end of June, Keesler and Evans Army Community Hospital were over 80-percent full, San Diego was over 75-percent full, the Texoma sites were over 65-percent full, and Dover was just under 50 percent full.", "One site factor that apparently affected enrollment was the breadth of services available at an MTF, where Senior Prime beneficiaries receive care at no charge. (See apps. I through VI for services available at each site.) For example, at the large medical centers with many specialties, most medical services needed by seniors could be within the MTF. Thus, very little specialty care would need to be referred to the civilian network, where beneficiaries would be required to make co-payments for their care. Smaller hospitals, such as those in Colorado Springs (Air Force Academy and Evans) and Texoma (Fort Sill and Sheppard), needed to refer seniors to the civilian network for most specialty care, and the Dover clinic needed to refer all inpatient care to the network. Co-payments, ranging from $12 to $40 for outpatient services, could be a disincentive to enrollment for some retirees.", "Also influencing enrollment was the likely availability or shortage of space- available care at an MTF. We found that some MTFs with GME programs had substantial space-available care in specialty areas. For example, the Naval Medical Center in San Diego had ample space-available care in some specialties (such as cardiology) at the MTF, and we were told that some seniors felt they could get the specialty care they needed without joining Senior Prime. Other sites, such as Madigan, Sheppard, and the Air Force Academy Hospital, were nearly full before Senior Prime and warned beneficiaries that there would be little space-available care left after Senior Prime reached its enrollment capacity. In this case, retirees realized that if they did not enroll in Senior Prime, they would probably not be able to receive care at the MTF.", "The health care environment for seniors at each site was also a factor. In some areas, seniors could choose from several Medicare HMOs as well as fee-for-service Medicare. For example, in San Diego, private HMOs have a 48-percent market share of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. This high penetration rate brings with it much competition for beneficiaries. To attract customers, San Diego area HMOs offered enhanced benefits, compared to which the Senior Prime plan was perhaps less attractive. In other demonstration areas (Keesler, the Texoma sites, and Dover), Senior Prime was the only Medicare HMO option for most potential beneficiaries. In these areas, being an HMO was not necessarily an advantage for Senior Prime: some retirees at these sites expressed reluctance to enroll because of their discomfort and unfamiliarity with managed care plans in general. These retirees would be returning to fee-for-service care if the demonstration were not continued, and concerns about the future availability of Medigap insurance added to their reluctance. However, MTF officials told us that some seniors had difficulty finding fee-for-service care in these areas (and sometimes at the MTF) and welcomed the ready access to care that Senior Prime offered.", "The maturity of DOD\u2019s managed care program, TRICARE Prime, in an area also apparently affected enrollment in Senior Prime. In sites where TRICARE Prime had been in operation for 3 or 4 years, such as Madigan, initial problems had been resolved and seniors could see how the program was working. TRICARE Prime was new in the area where Dover is located, having begun in June 1998. This new program brought new and unfamiliar procedures and encountered some start-up difficulties, and TRICARE Prime enrollment was low. Thus, Dover staff predicted that Senior Prime enrollment would be well below capacity, and that most enrollees would be those who had already been regularly receiving care at Dover."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aging-in May Stretch Capacity", "paragraphs": ["When TRICARE Prime enrollees at demonstration sites turn 65, those who are Medicare-eligible and assigned to a primary care manager in the MTF are guaranteed enrollment in Senior Prime\u2014a process called \u201caging in.\u201d Age-ins do not count toward capacity levels at demonstration sites.

Many sites combined this educational orientation with identifying the health care needs of enrollees through administering a health assessment survey and/or holding individual health screenings in one-on-one meetings between enrollees and medical staff.

Another obtained this information through telephone calls to all new enrollees.", "Madigan\u2019s experience also illustrated the difficulties of starting services for large numbers of new enrollees on a single start date. Serving 3,000 new enrollees led to bulges in demand that strained the capacity of primary care clinics and made it difficult for them to meet access standards.

(Senior Prime beneficiaries were entitled to a health evaluation within 90 days and an eye examination during the course of the demonstration, for which space- available care had previously been scarce.) However, phased-in enrollment was disadvantageous for applicants who needed a firm start date. For example, applicants in Colorado whose former HMOs withdrew from Medicare December 31, 1998, needed to know in advance whether, if accepted into Senior Prime, their services would start January 1, 1999. Start dates were phased in on a first-come, first-served basis, and program officials were unable to tell which applicants were in the January group until late December, when the list of approved applicants arrived from HCFA.", "Sites employed several strategies to deal with the tight timelines for processing enrollments, including preparing enrollment materials for every applicant in advance and then removing the packets for the few who were not approved, immediately sending approved enrollees a letter of acceptance that also served as a temporary ID until their full enrollment packet arrived, and seeking access to a HCFA data system (the MCCOY system) that would allow site officials to track approvals as they were made rather than waiting for a batched report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Difficulties Were Linked to Central Direction, Policy, or Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["Other operational difficulties were linked to central direction, policy, or information systems.

Because distance can lead to insufficient oversight, HCFA approves such arrangements only when there is evidence of close communication, as there was in San Antonio.
