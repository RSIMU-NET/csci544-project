However, ISCD used unverified and self-reported data to categorize the risk level for facilities evaluated for a toxic release threat. A toxic release threat exists where chemicals, if released, could harm surrounding populations. One key input for determining a facility's toxic release threat is the Distance of Concern (distance) that facilities report\u2014an area in which exposure to a toxic chemical cloud could cause serious injury or fatalities from short-term exposure. ISCD requires facilities to calculate the distance using a web-based tool and following DHS guidance. ISCD does not verify facility-reported data for facilities it does not categorize as high-risk for a toxic release threat. However, following DHS guidance and using a generalizable sample of facility-reported data in a DHS database, GAO estimated that more than 2,700 facilities (44 percent) of an estimated 6,400 facilities with a toxic release threat misreported the distance. By verifying that the data ISCD used in its risk assessment are accurate, ISCD could better ensure it has identified the nation's high-risk chemical facilities.", "ISCD has made substantial progress approving site security plans but does not have documented processes and procedures for managing facilities that are noncompliant with their approved site security plans. Site security plans outline, among other things, the planned measures that facilities agree to implement to address security vulnerabilities. As of April 2015, GAO estimates that it could take between 9 and 12 months for ISCD to review and approve security plans for approximately 900 remaining facilities\u2014a substantial improvement over the previous estimate of 7 to 9 years GAO reported in April 2013. ISCD officials attributed the increased approval rate to efficiencies in ISCD's security plan review process, updated guidance, and a new case management system. Further, ISCD began conducting compliance inspections in September 2013, but does not have documented processes and procedures for managing the compliance of facilities that have not implemented planned measures outlined in their site security plans. According to the nature of violations thus far, ISCD has addressed noncompliance on a case-by-case basis. Almost half (34 of 69) of facilities ISCD inspected as of February 2015 had not implemented one or more planned measures by deadlines specified in their approved site security plans and therefore were not fully compliant with their plans. GAO found variations in how ISCD addressed these 34 facilities, such as how much additional time the facilities had to come into compliance and whether or not a follow-on inspection was scheduled. Such variations may or may not be appropriate given ISCD's case-by-case approach, but having documented processes and procedures would ensure that ISCD has guidelines by which to manage noncompliant facilities and ensure they close security gaps in a timely manner. Additionally, given that ISCD will need to inspect about 2,900 facilities in the future, having documented processes and procedures could provide ISCD more reasonable assurance that facilities implement planned measures and address security gaps."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that DHS (1) verify the Distance of Concern reported by facilities is accurate and (2) document processes and procedures for managing compliance with site security plans.

While the  CFATS program covers facilities with certain thresholds of ammonium  nitrate, the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program is to regulate the sale  and transfer of ammonium nitrate by an ammonium nitrate facility for the  purpose of preventing the misappropriation or use of ammonium nitrate in  an act of terrorism. Among other things, the statute authorizing the  ammonium nitrate program authorizes DHS to require individuals who  purchase, sell, or transfer ammonium nitrate to register with DHS and  submit to vetting against the Terrorist Screening Database, and requires  the owners of ammonium nitrate facilities to maintain records on each  sale or transfer of ammonium nitrate and to report any identified theft or  loss of ammonium nitrate to appropriate federal authorities.

According to these officials, as of April 2015, ISCD had  received most Top-Screens within the first 3 years of the program;  specifically, ISCD received about 88 percent of Top-Screens from 2007  through 2009. ISCD officials told us they believe the 37,000 facilities  that have submitted Top-Screens represent most facilities subject to  CFATS.

These efforts included comparing  facilities data from relevant federal partners and from state entities  against ISCD\u2019s current database of chemical facilities to identify  potentially noncompliant chemical facilities, among others. ISCD officials told us ISCD consulted with the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration; the Department of Transportation; the Department of  Agriculture; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives;  and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine the extent  to which ISCD could identify all chemical facilities using data held by  those agencies. According to ISCD officials, ISCD also reached out to all  50 states\u2019 Homeland Security Advisors to request lists of chemical  facilities maintained by the states.", "According to ISCD officials, as of April 2015, ISCD completed some of  these efforts, such as conducting cross-agency compliance analysis with  EPA and analyzing facility lists provided by New York, New Jersey, and  Texas. Although these efforts resulted in the identification of chemical  facilities subject to CFATS that had not submitted a Top-Screen, ISCD  officials told us the work resulted in few new covered facilities. For  example, in 2013, after conducting cross-agency compliance analysis  with EPA, ISCD identified and notified about 3,300 chemical facilities as  potentially noncompliant with the requirement to submit a Top-Screen. As  shown in figure 2, in response to notification by ISCD 1,571 facilities  reported they had previously submitted a Top-Screen and another 361  claimed they are not currently subject to the requirement to submit a Top- Screen. An additional 374 facilities have not submitted a Top-Screen for  other reasons such as the facility closed or the facility does not have  chemicals of interest above the screening threshold quantity. Of the 1,056  facilities required to submit a Top-Screen as a result of ISCD\u2019s  notification, representing approximately 30 percent of all facilities notified,  ISCD categorized 2.3 percent, 24 facilities, as high-risk.", "ISCD officials told us that although the effort to compare EPA and CFATS  facility data did result in more than 1,000 chemical facilities submitting  Top-Screens, they noted that efforts to identify chemical facilities have  resulted in few new covered facilities. Because of this, ISCD officials are  reevaluating how ISCD conducts federal-and state-level cross-agency  compliance analysis as a method for identifying chemical facilities. While  they plan to continue these efforts and the California Environmental  Protection Agency recently provided ISCD with information on over  46,000 facilities regulated by the state, ISCD is currently assessing which  approaches for identifying potentially noncompliant facilities will result in a  high return on investment. The officials cited two challenges to cross- agency matching. First, while other federal agencies collect some  information on chemical facilities, differing program goals and data  formats may limit the utility of these data in identifying chemical facilities  for the CFATS program. Second, according to ISCD officials, 14 of 50  states responded to ISCD\u2019s request for facility lists. To continue  identifying chemical facilities for which the submission of a Top-Screen is  required, ISCD plans to designate a lead staff member to oversee efforts  to identify such facilities, measure effectiveness of efforts relative to the  costs and benefits, and recommend a long-term future strategy. ISCD  officials told us they also have hired a third-party vendor to pilot an effort  to analyze supply-chain data to identify noncompliant facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISCD Used Self-Reported Data That Is Not Verified to Categorize Thousands of Facilities", "paragraphs": ["ISCD has used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk for  facilities with a toxic release threat. As described earlier, approximately  37,000 facilities have submitted Top-Screens to ISCD. Of these facilities,  we estimate that more than 6,400 facilities hold a chemical at or above  the screening threshold quantity that could pose a toxic chemical release  threat. As part of the Top-Screen, ISCD requires these facilities to self- report the Distance of Concern, which represents the radius of an area in  which exposure to a toxic chemical cloud from a release event could  cause serious injury or fatalities from short-term exposure. As part of its  risk assessment of facilities with toxic release chemicals, ISCD uses the  Distance of Concern to determine the consequences from an intentional  toxic release. Using DHS guidance and Top-Screen information stored in  a DHS database\u2014which contains facility-reported information such as  chemicals and quantities in their possession, and the Distance of  Concern\u2014we recalculated the Distance of Concern for a generalizable  sample of facilities and compared these results to what facilities reported.  On the basis of these results, we estimate more than 2,700 facilities, or at  least 44 percent of facilities with a toxic release chemical, misreported the  Distance of Concern. We further estimate that at least 1,200 of the  2,700 misreporting facilities, or about 43 percent, underestimated the  Distance of Concern. Figure 3 depicts an example of 1 facility with more  than 200,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia that reported a Distance of  Concern of 0.9 miles compared to a minimum possibly correct Distance of  Concern of 2.4 miles.", "ISCD officials acknowledged that some facilities may have erred when  reporting the Distance of Concern. However, ISCD officials told us that  they do not verify the Distance of Concern on the Top-Screen because  they believe that most facilities with toxic release chemicals above the  screening threshold quantities would be familiar with RMP*Comp.  According to ISCD officials, chemical facilities use the RMP*Comp for  purposes of meeting EPA regulatory requirements. However, guidance  published on the DHS web-site directs facilities to calculate the Distance  of Concern in a manner that is different from EPA reporting requirements.  For example, to satisfy EPA reporting requirements, facilities can include  in their Distance of Concern calculation information about passive  mitigation systems (such as dikes, enclosures, berms, and drains) that  may reduce the output RMP*Comp generates. Conversely, according to  DHS guidance, because the Top-Screen is evaluating an intentional  release rather than an accidental release, facilities are not to include  passive mitigation systems to calculate the Distance of Concern. ISCD  officials stated that because RMP*Comp is outside the domain of ISCD  oversight, they cannot say with full certainty that the information facilities  use to generate the Distance of Concern is accurate. Nevertheless, ISCD  has retained all Top-Screen data, including the necessary information that  can be used to verify the accuracy of Distances of Concern provided by  relevant facilities. ISCD officials also stated that they plan to develop a  new model that will incorporate a Distance of Concern calculation into the  next iteration of the Top-Screen, originally scheduled to be operational by  September 2015, which will not require facilities to calculate and provide  a Distance of Concern using RMP*Comp. Instead, the new Top-Screen  will calculate the Distance of Concern using chemical information, such  as the quantity of chemicals, reported by facilities. However, officials  stated ISCD has not yet decided whether to re-screen facilities that hold  toxic release chemicals that have already submitted a Top-Screen. As of  May 2015, ISCD officials stated that implementation of the new Top- Screen is delayed, and ISCD officials did not have a timeline for  implementation.", "As described earlier, the Distance of Concern is one key input in the risk  assessment approach that ISCD uses to preliminarily categorize facilities  that could pose a toxic chemical release threat. Facilities ISCD  categorizes as high-risk are covered facilities subject to additional  requirements under the CFATS regulation, while facilities not categorized  as high-risk are, in general, not subject to additional requirements under  the CFATS program. According to ISCD officials, ISCD only verifies  information in the Top-Screens reported by high-risk facilities, including  the Distance of Concern. ISCD officials also told us that because ISCD  takes other factors into account, errors in the Distance of Concern may  not necessarily result in changes in ISCD\u2019s risk-assessment of facilities  that misreport the Distance of Concern. According to ISCD, within our  sample 1 high-risk facility could be miscategorized based upon an  erroneous Distance of Concern.  On the basis of ISCD\u2019s finding of 1  potentially miscategorized facility within our sample, we estimate that  ISCD could have miscategorized 85 high-risk facilities, but potentially up  to 543 high-risk facilities that have previously submitted Top-Screens.Additionally, because implementation of the new Top-Screen is delayed,  ISCD cannot provide reasonable assurance it will categorize facilities with  release toxic chemicals using reliable Distance of Concern data as these  facilities submit new Top-Screens.", "Standard project management practices include activities such as  developing a schedule with milestone dates to identify points throughout  the project to reassess efforts under way to determine whether project  changes are necessary. Practices such as developing a new target  schedule with a forecasted finish date would provide ISCD a more  realistic plan to guide the implementation of the new Top-Screen.Additionally, the NIPP risk management framework calls for risk  assessment approaches\u2014such as ISCD\u2019s risk-based implementation of  CFATS\u2014to be reproducible and defensible. Specifically, the NIPP states  the risk assessment methodology must produce comparable, repeatable  results free from significant errors or omissions. In the interim, before  ISCD implements the new Top-Screen and determines whether to re- screen facilities that have already submitted a Top-Screen, identifying  potentially miscategorized facilities that may pose a significant security  risk and verifying the Distance of Concern these facilities report is  accurate could help ensure that ISCD has accurately categorized facilities  with the potential to cause the greatest harm.

For example, ISCD has  continued the revised site security plan review process implemented  in July 2012 in which teams of ISCD headquarters officials review  plans by assessing how layers of security measures meet the intent of  each of the performance standards;  issued updates to the online Chemical Security Assessment Tool  (CSAT) beginning in March 2014 to make the system more user- friendly and improve facility data collection; distributed updated internal guidance and lessons learned on plan  approvals to inspectors and plan reviewers;  transitioned to a new internal case management system in December  2013 that provides improved program and facility management  capabilities; begun using inspectors alongside ISCD headquarters officials to  review site security plans in order to leverage inspectors\u2019 knowledge  of facility security and role conducting CFATS inspections;  implemented changes to inspection processes, such as employing  smaller inspection teams, conducting preinspection phone calls with  facilities to help them prepare for inspections, and enabling inspectors  to help facility personnel edit their site security plans during  inspections; distributed updated guidance to facilities to help them improve their  site security plans and worked to expand the use of alternative  security programs; and worked with corporations that have multiple covered chemical facilities  to leverage inspection documents and security procedures that are  standard across corporations to expedite the inspection process.", "While ISCD has taken actions to reduce the backlog of site security plans,  our estimate that ISCD could complete its approval of all current site  security plans within 9 to 12 months does not take into account the  potential impact of other tasks central to the CFATS program and  additional compliance activities for which ISCD is responsible.  Specifically, our estimate does not include the time required to:  identify, categorize, review, and approve site security plans for  facilities that have not yet submitted Top-Screens or those that ISCD  previously did not categorize as high risk but may now qualify as high- risk in light of the aforementioned errors in the Top-Screen  submissions we identified related to toxic release Distance of Concern  calculations, and  review approved site security plans to resolve issues relating to one  requirement of the personnel surety performance standard, under  which covered facilities are to perform background checks and ensure  appropriate credentials for personnel and visitors at their facilities. As  part of the personnel surety standard, DHS plans to check for terrorist  ties by comparing certain employee information against the Terrorist  Screening Database. ISCD currently has measures in place for other  screening requirements under the personnel surety standard, and as  of May 2015, ISCD was determining how the terrorist screening  requirement will be implemented.", "In addition, our estimate assumes that the pace of site security plan  approvals will not be affected by ISCD\u2019s implementation of the  Ammonium Nitrate Security Program. As described earlier, ISCD  released a proposed rule on August 3, 2011, for how it plans to  implement the program. According to ISCD officials, the final rule was  initially scheduled to be released in April 2015; as of May 2015, the rule  had not been released but, according to the DHS semiannual regulatory  agenda published in June 2015, a final rule for the program is anticipated  in October 2015. Although the rule has not yet been released, DHS has  stated that development and implementation of the ammonium nitrate  requirements would be resource-intensive and require trade-offs with  ISCD\u2019s responsibilities under the CFATS program. For example, ISCD  officials estimated that approximately 1,000 or more ammonium nitrate  facilities would need to be inspected annually, which would likely increase  ISCD\u2019s inspectors\u2019 workload since they would be responsible for both the  CFATS program and the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program. According  to ISCD officials, it will take at least 1 year from issuance of the final rule  to establish the ammonium nitrate regulatory program. As a result, we  could not assess the impact of the pending ammonium nitrate regulations  on ISCD\u2019s approval of site security plans or on the CFATS program as a  whole."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISCD Is Conducting Compliance Inspections but Does Not Have Documented Processes and Procedures for Managing Facilities That Are Noncompliant with Security Plans", "paragraphs": ["The CFATS regulation, consistent with the program\u2019s underlying statutory  authority, authorizes ISCD to take enforcement action, such as issuing  orders to assess civil penalties or to cease operations, against a covered  chemical facility if, for example, a compliance inspection finds a facility to  be noncompliant with its approved site security plan. The regulation also  provides, however, that if a facility is found to be noncompliant, the facility  shall be provided written notification, an opportunity for consultation, and  time frames within which the facility is to ensure compliance. According to  ISCD officials, based on the nature of the violations found thus far, it has  been ISCD practice to exercise the discretion afforded to it under law and  regulation and not to take enforcement actions but to instead work with  noncompliant facilities on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance.  However, ISCD does not have documented processes and procedures to  track facilities that are noncompliant with their approved site security  plans and ensure facilities implement planned measures to become  compliant.", "ISCD standard operating procedures for inspections of covered facilities  provide that inspectors are to report to ISCD, among other things, any  recommended enforcement actions resulting from a compliance  inspection. The CFATS regulation also provides that if a facility is in  violation of any part of the regulation, appropriate action may be taken,  including the issuance of an order, compelling a facility to take actions  necessary to become compliant. For example, if a compliance  inspection determines that a facility does not fully implement security  measures as outlined in its site security plan, an order may be issued  specifying actions the facility must take to remedy the instances of  noncompliance, along with timeframes for coming into compliance. If a  noncompliant facility does not comply with such an order, an order  assessing a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day for as long as the  violation continues or, if warranted, an order to cease operations may be  issued. ISCD officials stated that they consider an approved site security  plan to be a contract between a facility and ISCD and a facility is  therefore required to implement planned security measures by the  deadlines specified in its site security plan\u2014commonly between 6 and 12  months after plan approval. According to ISCD officials, facilities that do  not implement planned measures by these deadlines are noncompliant  with their requirements under CFATS.", "ISCD began conducting compliance inspections in September 2013 and  as of April 2015 had conducted 83 compliance inspections out of 1,727  facilities with approved site security plans. Our analysis of these  compliance inspections found that nearly half of facilities did not fully  implement security measures needed to satisfy the risk-based  performance standards\u2014as required by the CFATS regulation\u2014and  therefore were not fully compliant with their approved site security plans.  Specifically, 34 of 69 facilities that underwent compliance inspections and  had completed compliance inspection reports as of February 2015 had  not implemented one or more planned measures by deadlines specified  in their approved plans.", "According to ISCD officials, ISCD has not exercised its authority to issue  orders and take enforcement actions based on the nature of violations  identified through compliance inspections it has conducted as of May  2015. Instead, ISCD officials told us they track noncompliant facilities  individually and work with the facilities on a case-by-case basis to help  ensure compliance. According to ISCD officials, as part of ISCD\u2019s review  process following compliance inspections, officials track noncompliant  facilities on a case-by-case basis using individual compliance inspection  reports and do not close out a facility\u2019s report until issues of  noncompliance are resolved. ISCD officials stated that, thus far, they  have provided additional time to noncompliant facilities and conducted  follow-on inspections to ensure implementation of planned measures.  ISCD officials also stated that, thus far, it has been more productive to  work with facilities on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance than to  use enforcement actions. However, we found that ISCD does not have  documented processes and procedures for how officials and inspectors  are to track noncompliant facilities and ensure that they take actions  towards compliance when ISCD exercises its discretion not to take  enforcement actions. According to ISCD officials, ISCD provided written  guidance on this issue to inspectors in the March 2015 update to ISCD\u2019s  inspections and approvals lessons-learned guidance. However, this  guidance outlines requirements for the proper submission of compliance  inspection reports by inspectors but does not provide documented  guidance for how officials and inspectors are to ensure noncompliant  facilities take actions to become compliant, such as how much additional  time to provide to facilities to implement planned measures.", "Our analysis of compliance inspections conducted by ISCD as of  February 2015 indicated that inspectors made varying recommendations  relating to the 34 facilities that inspectors found had not implemented  planned measures as outlined in their site security plans by deadlines and  therefore were not fully compliant with their approved site security plans:  Inspectors recommended both a follow-on compliance inspection and  an enforcement action for 1 of the 34 noncompliant facilities.  However, ISCD officials later elected not to take an enforcement  action in that instance and determined that they would instead work  with the facility to ensure it implemented planned measures.", "Inspectors recommended a follow-on compliance inspection to verify  the implementation of planned measures for 12 of the 34  noncompliant facilities.", "Inspectors did not recommend an enforcement action or follow-on  compliance inspection for the remaining 21 of 34 noncompliant  facilities.", "Inspectors reported that the 34 noncompliant facilities required  additional time, beyond their compliance inspection date, to  implement planned measures that were not implemented by deadlines  in their site security plans. Among the 34 noncompliant facilities,  additional time to implement these planned measures as intended  ranged from 3 weeks to another year.", "Figure 5 summarizes our analysis of compliance inspections conducted  by ISCD.", "Compliance inspections\u2014after which ISCD makes compliance  determinations to either mitigate or accept risk at facilities\u2014are a critical  stage in ISCD\u2019s risk management approach to implementing the CFATS  program. The NIPP risk management framework states that risk  assessment approaches should be documented, reproducible, and  defensible\u2014common principles that are broadly applicable to all parts of  a risk methodology. Specifically, the NIPP calls for risk assessment  approaches to clearly document what information is used, and that  subjective judgments need to be transparent to minimize their impact and  help ensure comparable results. In addition, Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that all organizational  transactions\u2014which can include processes and procedures for dealing  with regulated entities\u2014need to be clearly documented and that this  documentation should be readily available for examination in  administrative policies or operating manuals. According to ISCD  officials, ISCD\u2019s processes and procedures\u2014although not documented\u2014 track noncompliant facilities through the compliance process and ensure  they implement planned measures. According to ISCD officials, ISCD\u2019s  current method of tracking noncompliant facilities on a case-by-case  basis using individual compliance inspection reports is sufficient. ISCD  officials also stated that inspectors and ISCD headquarters officials  evaluate the significance of security gaps and facilities\u2019 ability to  implement planned measures when working to bring facilities into  compliance.", "By documenting its processes and procedures for tracking noncompliant  facilities and ensuring planned measures are implemented, ISCD could  better ensure consistency in how officials and inspectors address  noncompliance in the CFATS program. Variations in the process for  addressing noncompliant facilities\u2014such as facilities having widely  varying amounts of time to implement measures\u2014may be warranted on a  case-by-case basis. However, according to ISCD officials, facilities that  do not implement planned security measures in accordance with their  approved site security plans remain vulnerable to security threats until  such measures are implemented. Such vulnerabilities could increase over  time as the CFATS program matures and ISCD conducts compliance  inspections for the approximately 2,900 additional facilities that, as of  April 2015, had an approved site security plan or were assigned a final  tier and awaiting approval of the site security plan. Documented  processes and procedures that prescribe how to address noncompliance  in lieu of taking enforcement actions, including the establishment of time  frames to implement planned measures, would better position ISCD to  achieve its broader mission of securing chemical facilities in a consistent  and timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Performance Measure for CFATS Does Not Accurately Reflect Program Results", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s performance measure for the CFATS program, which was  developed by ISCD and is intended to reflect security measures  implemented by facilities and the overall impact of the CFATS regulation  on facility security, does not solely capture security measures that are  implemented by facilities and verified by ISCD. Instead, DHS\u2019s  performance measure reflects both existing security measures that were  in place when facilities completed their site security plans and planned  security measures approved by ISCD that facilities intend to implement  within the fiscal year. DHS reported this performance measure for the  CFATS program in its Annual Performance Report for Fiscal Years 2013- 2015 as the percent of performance standards implemented by the  highest risk chemical facilities and verified by ISCD. According to ISCD,  the performance measure reflects the value of the CFATS program and  its impact on reducing risk at facilities.", "ISCD officials stated that they calculate the performance measure based  on existing and planned measures identified in each facility\u2019s site security  plan rather than based on the results of compliance inspections, at which  ISCD verifies that facilities have implemented planned measures as  intended. According to ISCD officials, they count the planned measure as  having been implemented once the implementation date listed in a  facility\u2019s site security plan has passed. However, according to ISCD  officials, ISCD does not adjust the performance measure if it later  determines that a facility did not implement a planned measure on time.  In our analysis of compliance inspections conducted as of February 2015,  we identified that 34 of 69 facilities did not implement one or more  planned measures by intended deadlines. As a result, ISCD may have  improperly counted some planned measures as implemented in the  performance measure and therefore overstated the CFATS program\u2019s  progress in reducing risk.", "According to ISCD officials, when ISCD developed the performance  measure, in fiscal year 2013, it had not yet begun conducting compliance  inspections, at which ISCD verifies that facilities have implemented  planned measures as intended. As a result, the performance measure  does not take into account information gathered during compliance  inspections, such as if facilities had implemented planned measures by  the intended date. Since developing the performance measure, ISCD  began conducting compliance inspections in September 2013, but ISCD  officials stated that they did not begin verifying that planned measures  had been implemented before including them in the performance  measure at that point because they had conducted too few compliance  inspections to produce meaningful performance data. ISCD officials also  told us that the performance measure includes existing measures that  were in place when facilities completed their site security plans because  the goal of the performance measure is to capture the overall extent of  security implemented by facilities. According to ISCD officials, it is difficult  to assess the source of existing security measures because facilities  could anticipate CFATS requirements and make enhancements prior to  becoming a covered facility under CFATS. As a result, ISCD officials  stated that it is a challenge to assess the baseline security measures  already in place at facilities and therefore the impact of the CFATS  program on improving those security measures. However, while it may be  illustrative to report the overall extent of security implemented, including  all existing measures does not reflect the value of the CFATS program  and its impact on reducing risk at facilities, as ISCD\u2019s current  performance measure is intended to do.", "The NIPP calls for evaluating the effectiveness of risk management  efforts by collecting performance data to assess progress in achieving  identified outputs and outcomes. In addition, the purpose of CFATS, as  stated in its regulation, is to enhance national security by furthering DHS\u2019s  mission and lowering the risk posed by certain chemical facilities.  Measuring the effectiveness of the CFATS program requires that facilities  implement planned security measures identified as necessary to address  vulnerabilities and that DHS evaluate implementation of these measures  against CFATS performance standards. However, because ISCD\u2019s  performance measure reflects both existing security measures that had  not necessarily been implemented in response to CFATS and planned  security measures that have not yet been verified as implemented,  ISCD\u2019s performance measure does not reflect the value of the CFATS  program and its impact on reducing risk at facilities, as stated in  performance reports. As the CFATS program matures and ISCD  conducts compliance inspections in greater numbers, revising current  performance measures or adding new ones to accurately reflect only  security measures that have been implemented and verified would help  provide a more accurate picture of ISCD\u2019s progress and help ISCD  ensure that the program is meeting its goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Individuals intent on using or gaining access to hazardous chemicals to  carry out a terrorist attack continue to pose a threat to the security of  chemical facilities and surrounding populations.

In the interim, NPPD will verify the  accuracy of Distances of Concern submitted in new Top-Screens. These  actions, if fully implemented, should address the intent of the  recommendation.", "Regarding the first recommendation, DHS indicated in its letter that the  impact from the erroneous Distance of Concern data is likely extremely  minimal because only 85 of approximately 37,000 facilities that submitted  Top-Screens were likely to have been assigned a lower risk status had  they correctly reported their Distances of Concern, with potentially as few  as two facilities actually having been impacted. However, as stated in our  report, we based our estimates on a simple random sample and followed  a probability procedure based on random selections. Our sample is only  one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn, each of  which could have provided different estimates. Therefore, the number of  facilities affected by this issue may be as low as two or as high as 543.", "DHS also stated that the erroneous Distance of Concern data impacts  only preliminary tiering (categorization) results and additional information  submitted through a security vulnerability assessment will affect the final  tiering decision. As stated in our report, according to DHS data, 80  percent of facilities were determined not to be high-risk based upon  information provided in the Top-Screen, which made those facilities not  subject to additional requirements under the CFATS regulation. Thus,  only a minority of facilities that submitted a Top-Screen were ultimately  required to submit a security vulnerability assessment.", "Regarding the second recommendation that NPPD identify potentially  miscategorized facilities with the potential to cause the greatest harm and  verify the Distance of Concern these facilities report is accurate, DHS  stated that NPPD will review facilities that submitted Top-Screens with  release-toxic chemicals of interest. NPPD will determine which facilities  are most likely to potentially cause the greatest harm and will verify the  Distances of Concern reported by the facilities. These actions, if fully  implemented, should address the intent of the recommendation.", "In response to the third recommendation that NPPD develop documented  processes and procedures to track noncompliant facilities and ensure  they implement planned measures, DHS stated that NPPD was in the  process of developing and documenting such procedures. DHS also  stated that NPPD has drafted requirements to update its case  management system to separately track noncompliant facilities, a function  not currently available in the system. According to DHS, in the interim,  NPPD will monitor noncompliant facilities through a function in the case  management system that keeps compliance inspection reports open until  a facility implements all aspects of its site security plan. These actions, if  fully implemented, should address the intent of the recommendation.", "Finally, for the fourth recommendation that NPPD improve the  measurement and reporting of the CFATS program performance by  developing a performance measure that includes only planned measures  that have been implemented and verified, DHS stated that NPPD will  develop a performance measure that will provide an additional means to  evaluate and illustrate the value of the CFATS program.

To address how ISCD has identified facilities that could  potentially be subject to CFATS but have not yet self-identified or been  identified by ISCD as being required to submit information to ISCD  pursuant to CFATS, we reviewed and analyzed ISCD documentation  related to its efforts to identify facilities, including documentation on  coordinating with other federal agencies that regulate chemical facilities,  and the Executive Order 13650 Report for the President: Actions to  Improve Chemical Facility Safety and Security\u2014a Shared Commitment.  To address how ISCD has categorized chemical facilities, we reviewed  and analyzed documentation ISCD provides to facilities intended to guide  them in submitting data that ISCD uses to preliminarily categorize  facilities as high-risk, which renders them subject to additional  requirements under the CFATS regulation during its preliminary screening   We reviewed ISCD applications and documents including web- process.based Chemical Security Assessment Tools (CSAT) applications\u2014such  as the Top-Screen\u2014used to collect security information from facilities, the  ISCD risk assessment approach used to determine a facility\u2019s preliminary  risk tier, and policies and procedures on preliminary tiering. As part of this  effort, we obtained and analyzed data submitted by facilities to ISCD as  required by CFATS. First, to assess the reliability of data we obtained  from CSAT, we reviewed system documentation, compared similar data  sets for consistency, and interviewed knowledgeable ISCD officials about  system controls and determined that CSAT data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. Second, we outlined the CFATS risk  assessment approach and the three security issues upon which it is  based\u2014release-toxic/flammable/explosive, theft or diversion, and  sabotage.", "Finally, we analyzed a sample of ISCD data and compared it to criteria in  the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), Supplemental Tool:  Executing a Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Approach, to  determine the extent to which ISCD used facility-reported data to make  categorization decisions that are documented and reproducible.  Specifically, we selected a simple random sample of 475 facilities from  the population of 36,811 facilities that submitted Top-Screens since the  inception of the CFATS program in 2007 through January 2, 2015. During  our review we identified 91 facilities from among the sample of 475  facilities that indicated that their facility had toxic release chemicals of  interest above the screening threshold quantity. For these 91 facilities we  tested the reliability of the Distance of Concern reported in Top-Screens.  To determine how DHS intended respondents to calculate the Distance of  Concern, we reviewed DHS guidance that directs facilities to use an  online tool, RMP*Comp. We also reviewed instructions for using this tool.  Using RMP*Comp, DHS guidance, and data from their most recently  submitted Top-Screen (the type and quantity of chemical that could be  released and terrain type surrounding facility), we calculated the Distance  of Concern for the 91 facilities and compared these results to what  facilities reported.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the lower of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 7  percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. For  our determination of facilities potentially at risk of being missed by DHS  because of errors in their RMP*Comp calculations we provide the 95  percent confidence interval associated with each estimate.", "To corroborate and confirm our understanding of ISCD\u2019s approach to  identify and categorize chemical facilities, we also interviewed ISCD  officials knowledgeable about the processes to identify and categorize  chemical facilities to corroborate our understanding of the program.", "To address our second objective, on the extent to which DHS has  approved site security plans, conducted compliance inspections, and  measured results, we reviewed laws and regulations on how DHS is to  approve site security plans and ensure compliance with the CFATS  program. We analyzed ISCD data to identify the number of site security  plans approved per month, and used the results of our analysis to  estimate the number of months it could take ISCD to approve remaining  site security plans. To assess the reliability of data we obtained from  ISCD\u2019s case management system, we reviewed system documentation,  conducted data and logic testing, and interviewed knowledgeable ISCD  officials about system controls and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We note limitations in  our analysis, including that our estimate does not take into consideration  resource constraints ISCD may face as it implements the pending   We analyzed 69 of 74 compliance  Ammonium Nitrate Security Program.inspection reports completed as of February 2015 to identify the extent to  which the reports identify noncompliance among facilities that have  reached the compliance inspection phase of the CFATS program. When  we conducted our analysis, in February 2015, ISCD inspectors had not  completed compliance inspection reports outlining the results of the  inspections for 5 of the 74 facilities, so we did not include these facilities  in our analysis. We compared ISCD\u2019s processes and procedures for  tracking and monitoring noncompliant facilities to criteria in the NIPP for  documented, reproducible, and defensible risk assessment approaches  and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for  documenting transactions and significant decisions. To determine how  DHS has measured results, we compared ISCD\u2019s performance measure  with criteria in the NIPP for evaluating the effectiveness of risk  management efforts by, among other things, collecting performance data  to assess progress in achieving outputs and outcomes. We also  interviewed ISCD headquarters officials regarding their processes and  systems for authorizing, approving, and inspecting facilities for  compliance. Finally, we conducted four site visits to observe (1) two  authorization inspections and (2) two compliance inspections. We  selected inspection locations in California, Oregon, Maryland, and Texas  based on geographic dispersion and to cover different types of chemical  facilities regulated by the CFATS program. While the information obtained  from these inspections cannot be generalized to all inspections, it  provides insight and context on how ISCD conducts CFATS inspections.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to July 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
