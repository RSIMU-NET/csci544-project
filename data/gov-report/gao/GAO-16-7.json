Officials from all four state educational agencies with which we  conducted interviews told us they faced challenges in ensuring that  geography standards remained an integral part of the state curriculum.  For example, one state official told us how the state had eliminated  geography from the curriculum for over a decade, and only recently  added geography courses back amid concerns from the community that  students were lacking essential geography skills. Similarly, all 10 teachers  we spoke with reported that geography instruction has decreased in  recent years due to a greater emphasis on teaching math and reading.

Even key education stakeholders such  as teachers, principals, and parents mistakenly think geography  education involves fact-based memorization, according to officials we  interviewed from three of our selected national geography  organizations. According to one report, this view has likely persisted  because it was the stakeholders\u2019 personal experience when they were  students. Officials we interviewed from the three geography  organizations reported that this limited view of geography has made  the subject easier to dismiss or ignore. In addition, among the state  officials and teachers we interviewed, several confirmed that this  public perception of geography makes obtaining support and  resources more difficult.", "Teacher Preparation \u2013 Many teachers who teach geography do not  have an educational background in the subject and take few, if any,  geography courses in college, according to a 2013 geography  education report. Teachers and state education officials we  interviewed similarly stated that not enough professional development  is devoted to the subject, and many teachers are not comfortable  teaching geography. Our analysis of Education\u2019s 2014 NAEP data  shows variation in the amount and types of professional development  activities that teachers reported participating in during the previous  two years related to the teaching of civics, geography, history, or  social studies.", "Instructional Materials \u2013 Geography instructional materials do not  often showcase the depth and breadth of the subject or offer hands- on learning opportunities for students, according to officials from  national groups we interviewed. One report noted that K-12  geography instructional materials\u2014which largely consist of textbooks,  atlases, and ancillary materials, such as workbooks or teacher  PowerPoint presentations\u2014must move beyond activities that require  students to solely label maps. However, all of the state officials we  interviewed said many districts do not have the resources to upgrade  their instructional materials in geography. In addition, among the 10 K- 12 teachers we interviewed, seven reported they do not have time to  search for better lessons and materials in geography, although they  acknowledged that there are many resources and materials available  online at low or no cost. The report also noted that when teachers are  not well-prepared to teach geography, instructional materials become  especially important.", "Technology \u2013 While technology can present opportunities to better  engage students, using technology to teach geography can also  present challenges. Our analysis of Education\u2019s NAEP data show that  in 2014 more teachers reported using technology-based geography  instruction than in 2010. One report notes that there are a growing  number of K-12 geography lessons using geospatial technologies,  such as GIS and remote sensing; however, geography classrooms  still largely depend on textbooks and lecture-based instruction.  Further, officials we interviewed from three of our selected states  described wide variation in the use of technology across districts and  schools and expressed concern that many teachers did not receive  training on how to incorporate the technology into their lessons.  Among the 10 teachers we interviewed, seven reported frustrations  with using technology to teach geography, such as outdated software,  lack of technical support at their school, and poor internet  connections.", "Other Challenges \u2013 State officials and teachers we interviewed also  identified other challenges.

NCES communicates the findings of NAEP to the  public by publishing the Nation\u2019s Report Card, which provides summary  information on how well students are performing in geography based on a  common test. NCES also provides restricted-use and public-use NAEP  data and tools for running statistical analyses, and guidance on how  researchers and other stakeholders can use these data for their own  analyses. Along with the Nation\u2019s Report Card, the NAEP frameworks, as  developed by the National Assessment Governing Board, outline the  content and skills assessed in each NAEP subject. These NAEP  frameworks are available to the public and can serve as guidelines for  planning other assessments or revising curricula.

Specifically, the NAEP geography assessment has been  conducted in 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2014. As a result of budget  constraints, the 2014 NAEP geography assessment tested eighth grade  students but not fourth and 12th grade students, as had been the case for  previous assessments (see fig. 8). According to NCES officials we  interviewed, the eighth grade was chosen because most students would  have exposure to geography by that grade level. Officials said there was  a risk that fourth graders may not have been exposed to geography and  insufficient funding precluded them from assessing students in the 12th  grade. Officials we interviewed from four of our selected national  geography organizations reported that not assessing fourth and 12th  grade students in geography will hinder research efforts related to K-12  geography education by making trend analyses for these grade levels  impossible.", "The Governing Board and NCES officials told us there are plans to  bolster the 2018 NAEP in geography, contingent on funding. NCES plans  to test 12th grade students in the next geography assessment, and  officials told us it is important to assess the geography skills students  have upon leaving high school. In addition, officials said if funding allows,  that the 2018 geography NAEP will be digitally based and administered  on tablets. NCES officials told us the geography assessment, and content  in particular, can benefit from the digital format by allowing the use of  more interactive maps and geographic technology.", "Other than NAEP, Education has no initiatives or programs specific to K- 12 geography education. Officials told us that although the agency  previously supported some activities related to geography through a  program focused on civics, funding for this program is no longer available.  Similarly, Education funded a research grant involving the use of software  in social studies and geography classrooms, but this project ended in  2011. In addition, Education\u2019s technology initiatives do not incorporate  or include information about geography education or geographic  technology in K-12 classrooms. As part of the President\u2019s ConnectED  Initiative, Education\u2019s Office of Technology provides general guidance to  states, school districts, and schools on how existing federal funds can  support digital learning. However, this office does not provide guidance  specific to geographic technologies in the classroom. Further, Education  officials said they sometimes receive requests from external parties,  including teachers and school districts, asking about resources for  geography.

These teachers were identified with  assistance from the National Council for Social Studies\u2014an organization  with a membership of approximately 15,000 teachers of history, civics,  geography, and related subjects. In response to our request, staff at the  National Council for Social Studies sent an interview request, prepared by  GAO, to 1,150 of their members. These members received an email, at  random, with equal proportions falling in the elementary, middle, and high  school levels. We conducted a total of 10 interviews with teachers who  responded to this email request. While teachers self-selected for our  interviews provide some insight into the views and experiences of  teachers, their responses are not generalizable to all teachers of  geography.", "We also coordinated with or interviewed representatives from a broad  range of national groups in K-12 geography education and K-12  education, including: National Geographic Society, Association of  American Geographers, National Council for Geographic Education,  American Geographic Society, National Council for Social Studies,  National Science Teachers Association, Council of Chief State School  Officers, Grosvenor Center for Geographic Education, RAND, and ESRI.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to October  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Sherri Doughty (Assistant  Director), Alison Gerry Grantham (Analyst-in-Charge), Claudine Pauselli,  and Josiah Williams made key contributions to this report.
