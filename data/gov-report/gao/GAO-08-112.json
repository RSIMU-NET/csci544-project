More than 80 percent had no spouse or dependent children. Three-fourths of veteran pensioners had multiple impairments. After reaching a peak of almost 2 million in 1978, the overall size of the pensioner population has gradually decreased, although the number of pensioners from more recent service periods has been increasing. VA policies and procedures are not sufficient to ensure sound decisions on new pension claims. Unlike other federal agencies with similar income-based programs, VA largely does not independently verify the accuracy of financial information provided by claimants to support initial pension program eligibility. In addition, the guidance used by staff to make pension eligibility decisions is not always current or clear. Further, VA's quality assurance review process for initial claims does not select a sufficient number of pension cases to ensure the accuracy of pension claims decisions. Finally, VA does not adequately evaluate training for pension staff. VA procedures for assessing whether pensioners continue to receive the proper benefits have significant limitations. Although the agency requires pensioners to report changes that might affect their pensions, VA does not require documentation such as bank or asset statements when pensioners report financial changes.

(App. II provides a summary  of this process.) Eligibility for pension benefits is restricted to veterans  who are at least 65 or have total and permanent disabilities unrelated to  their military service. Also, VA considers the income of all family  members, including spouses and children, but excludes the income of  other individuals residing in the household. Various sources of income are  considered when determining income eligibility, including employment,  interest and dividends, retirement, annuities, workers\u2019 compensation,  Social Security retirement and Disability Insurance benefits.  Unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 5 percent of the maximum  pension amount may be deducted from income in determining eligibility.  Eligibility for the surviving spouses and children of such veterans is based  on similar factors. Once pensioners have been awarded benefits, VA  makes ongoing eligibility determinations and adjusts benefit levels as  needed. Pensioners are required to inform VA of any changes in their  circumstances\u2014such as hospitalization or incarceration, as well as  changes in income and assets\u2014that could affect their eligibility or benefit  levels.

This leaves the agency heavily  dependent on the pensioner for self-reporting financial updates. The  exception is Social Security income, which VA staff verify using a direct  computer link to SSA benefit data. Pensioner reports of other financial  changes, however, need not be accompanied by such documents as pay  stubs, bank statements, or tax returns. This is in contrast to other income- based federal programs that typically ask for verification of key financial  information. For example, SSA requires Supplemental Security Insurance  (SSI) recipients to document their earnings on a regular basis.", "Similarly, VA does not ask pensioners for financial documentation when  completing the annual Eligibility Verification Report (EVR), the requested  update that the agency sends out annually to those who have previously  reported having income and assets other than their pensions and Social  Security benefits. VA uses information collected from the EVR responses  to adjust or, if necessary, terminate VA pension benefits. (See table 4 for  an overview of the EVR steps.) VA has indicated that the pension program  is prone to overpayments caused by pensioners failing to report income  changes as they occur. One agency official responsible for the  management of the EVR process told us that the EVR process provides the  agency an opportunity to adjust the pension benefits as pensioner status  changes, thus preventing higher overpayments.", "In addition to VA not asking respondents to submit financial  documentation, we found a number of other deficiencies in the EVR  process that may likely limit VA\u2019s ability to make timely and accurate  adjustments to benefits. First, the EVR process only queries pensioners  who have previously reported income to VA, so the agency fails to reach  pensioners who may acquire new sources of income, such as earnings  from new employment. Second, during the annual review of EVRs, VA  does not attempt to corroborate via independent third-party sources any  information that pensioners report on the EVR beyond SSA benefits.  Third, the EVR asks pensioners to estimate their income for the year, and  the agency adjusts their pensions based on these estimates. Yet pensioner  estimates could prove to be incorrect. For example, income estimates for  the coming year could change due to the death of a spouse. Fourth, the  narrow seasonal window within which pension maintenance center (PMC)  staff attempt to review and process the EVRs\u2014the first 3 months of the  year\u2014postpones other pension-related activities, including data  comparisons with other federal agencies that could provide third-party  verification.

Through formal agreements, VA compares its electronic data on  pensioners\u2019 reported income, and other eligibility information, to similar  information from a number of federal agencies, as shown in table 5. VA  identifies discrepancies and, after due process, uses this information to  adjust or terminate pension benefits. VA projects that its data-matching  activities save the pension program millions of dollars annually.", "Nevertheless, VA\u2019s key data match, the Income Verification Match  program (IVM), which uses SSA and IRS data to detect pensioners who  have failed to report earned or unearned income, is running far behind  schedule. This match is scheduled to occur on an annual basis. However,  since 2006, VA has attempted to become current by conducting 2 years\u2019  worth of IVM data matches simultaneously. Yet combining data match  records for multiple years has added to the complexity and the length of  case evaluations, according to officials we interviewed.", "VA estimates that the IVM data match has the potential of saving the  program over $10 million each year, which suggests that a delay of 2 years  could delay saving as much as $25 million dollars in payment errors. Such  errors include both underpayments, which require VA staff to make  retroactive payments or benefit adjustments, and overpayments, which  can be burdensome for VA to recover from such a low-income population  of pensioners and which threaten the financial stability of pensioners.  While VA officials told us they plan to have all IVM data match cases  entered into their system by the end of 2007, they could not provide  assurance that these cases will be completed in the same year.", "The effectiveness of the IVM is also undermined by the fact that the data  used are not current. VA uses income data that are about 2 years old,  despite the fact that the SSA data are available earlier and that more  recent earned income data are available from another federal database,  the NDNH. Moreover, while VA could make use of SSA earned income  data as early as September following the end of the tax year, it postpones  the match of pension benefits and waits for unearned income from IRS so  that it can simultaneously evaluate eligibility for pension and Individual  Unemployability (IU) benefits. We determined that the combination of  old earned income data, along with the delays noted above, means that  individuals with unreported earned income could continue to receive  benefits for at least 2 years before VA can determine that their pension  benefits should be adjusted or terminated.", "We also found that VA\u2019s handling of the IVM data match results is  inefficient because the dollar threshold used to select pensioners for  review of ongoing pension eligibility has not kept pace over nearly two  decades with wages necessary for a person to sustain a living. Specifically,  the IVM data match threshold in use until December 2006\u2014which VA told  us was meant to represent wages for marginal employment\u2014was set in  1988 (when VA\u2019s maximum annual pension rate for a veteran with no  dependents was $6,463). Yet between 1988 and 2006, the U.S. Census  Bureau\u2019s poverty threshold had increased over 70 percent. As a result of  VA\u2019s continued reliance upon the 1988 threshold, PMC staff told us that  they manually reviewed many more cases than necessary in order to find  and delete those cases that did not warrant a review. In fact, staff typically  eliminated about one-third of the initial matches because their combined  countable income and pension did not exceed their maximum allowable  pension benefit. VA increased the $6,000 threshold to $9,383 in December  2006, but has not decided whether it would make such changes to update  the threshold on a regular basis in the future.", "The timeliness of the IVM process is also hampered by the fact that VA\u2019s  match records are paper based and lack the organizing and transmission  efficiencies of an electronic database.

According to VA estimates, about  8.4 to 11 percent of pension program payments were made in error each  year between 2003 and 2006, with most of these being overpayments, as  shown in table 6. Specifically, VA estimated a total of almost $1.2 billion in  overpayments and about $44 million in underpayments during this period.  Such payment errors, particularly underpayments, can have a negative  impact on pensioners living on very low incomes. By contrast, the agency  has estimated that only about 1 percent of disability compensation  program payments were made in error, with about $730 million in  overpayments and $375 million in underpayments for the same period.", "Furthermore, according to VA officials, less than 30 percent of the  overpayments for compensation and pension are recovered.  We found  that VA has not been successful in collecting overpayments. In fact, a  significant portion of overpayments are written off because of pensioners\u2019  death or bankruptcy, or because the overpayment is considered  uncollectible. For example, in cases where VA\u2019s Committee on Waivers  concludes that repayment of the overpayment debt would cause undue  financial hardship for the pensioner, the debt may be waived. Most of the  remaining overpayments remain on VA\u2019s financial account for up to 10  years, at which time VA discontinues its collection efforts.", "Despite VA\u2019s estimates of relatively high amounts in improper payments  for the pension program, the agency lacks a process for determining the  nature and actual extent of payment errors. For example, VA currently  does not have the ability to identify the dollar amount of overpayments  generated because of a failure to report income, gambling winnings, or  death of a spouse. Likewise, VA cannot identify the amount of improper  payments caused by administrative factors, such as those associated with  VA delays in conducting the IVM data matches. Although the agency has  identified several causes for improper payments, such as inaccurate  reporting of Social Security benefits, remarriage of surviving spouse, or  change in dependents, it has not developed a system to assess the degree  to which they occur, and therefore cannot develop strategies to target  problems and take steps to correct them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s pension eligibility operations currently provide a limited return on  investment when it comes to making appropriate payments. The agency\u2019s  financial verification processes are heavily weighted toward detection of  payment errors late in the process rather than up-front prevention of  errors. By not requiring supporting financial documentation from  individuals at the time of application, and relying much later in the process  on untimely data matching for this information, VA increases the  likelihood of making improper payments. Additionally, VA concentrates  staff resources in the first 3 months of each year on a process for updating  eligibility that is time-consuming and still lacks for financial  documentation or independent verifications. Meanwhile, the data- matching operations that do offer third-party verifications on financial  status are delayed until after the EVR process is completed. A key data  match procedure, the IVM, has been delayed in the past, and the agency  continues to be at risk of making improper payments as it tries to rectify  the situation. Even when the IVM data match becomes current, VA\u2019s ability  to use it in a timely way will be limited if processing of the information  remains grounded in a manual handling of paper documents. Moreover, if  VA does not regularly update its IVM data match threshold in its incoming  financial information system, the agency will continue to have an  inefficient procedure for selecting cases for IVM review.", "In view of the fact that the program incurs a proportionately high level of  improper payments\u2014about 8.4 to 11 percent of annual program benefits\u2014 VA\u2019s investment in the prevention of errors seems too modest. VA could  readily justify increasing its investment in the error prevention process.  The agency does not have a quality assurance process robust enough to  ensure with a high degree of confidence the accuracy of decisions made in  initial pension cases, it has not developed a consistently rigorous approach  to the evaluation of training, and it does little to identify and analyze the  causes of improper payments.", "Taken together, VA forfeits the opportunity to address administrative  weaknesses and prevent payment errors. Unless these weaknesses are  addressed, VA pension benefit payments will remain vulnerable to a  relatively high rate of errors. Reconciling improper payments draws  resources from the agency that could be better utilized elsewhere, and to  the extent overpayments are never collected, they undermine the agency\u2019s  financial stewardship over public funds. Moreover, underpayments can  lead to hardships among this low-income segment of the veteran  population. Certainly, the program is not too small to ensure that  appropriate levels of assistance are provided to a vulnerable and deserving  population. This can and should be done with a level of efficiency that  minimally burdens all concerned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to enhance VA\u2019s management of the pension eligibility process,  we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Benefits take the following actions.  1.  Take steps to make more accurate and timely decisions about  initial and ongoing pension eligibility and payment levels. Such  actions might include requiring pensioners to submit supporting  documentation of their income and assets, conducting a more  robust independent verification with third parties, or maximizing  process automation.  2.  Take steps to improve its quality assurance review of initial claims,  which could include reviewing a larger sample of pension claims.  3.  Incorporate evaluative feedback more consistently into the  planning, design, and implementation of its training efforts.  4.  Evaluate options for improving the effectiveness of its annual  eligibility verification review. This effort could involve  reformulating the EVR process by (a) surveying every pensioner  rather than a selected subset; (b) performing reviews on a rolling  basis, such as on an individual\u2019s anniversary date, rather than  diverting staff for this activity for a 3-month period; (c) reviewing  pensioners\u2019 eligibility once every few years rather than every year;  or (d) focusing on verifying pensioners\u2019 income and assets.  5.  Update the IVM data match threshold level to be in line with the  U.S. Census Bureau poverty threshold or a comparable measure.  6.

In its written comments on a draft of this report  (see app. III), VA agreed in part or fully with our recommendations.   Although VA raised concern with some of the options we present to help  implement several of the recommendations, the agency\u2019s comments  indicate it will take steps to implement these recommendations.", "Regarding our recommendation that VA should take steps to make more  accurate and timely pension eligibility and payment decisions, the agency  agreed in part but took exception with several of the actions we suggested.   VA noted that requiring pensioners to provide documentation of income  and net worth could be onerous to individuals and possibly diminish the  timeliness of initial pension eligibility decisions.  However, VA also stated  elsewhere in its comments that pensioners use the end-of-year tax  statements (Form 1099) to accurately report income from all sources.   This indicates that it may not be an added burden to pensioners to include  a Form 1099 in their initial claim.  But to the extent that burden is added to  preparing the initial application, the possible gains in accuracy and  avoidance of corrective actions later taken to address improper payments  need to be considered. Additionally, VA cited its data-matching process  with SSA as an existing mechanism to independently verify income.   However, as we point out in this report, other federal agencies with similar  income-based programs independently verify self-reported information to  support initial eligibility decisions.  By verifying claims up front, rather  than years after the claim is established, the agency can effectively save  the program millions of dollars that it might never recover otherwise.   Moreover, VA does not always require documentation of unreimbursed  medical expenses, which can be deducted from income for pension  eligibility. It is important for VA to gather supporting documentation in  this area as well. The agency may consider piloting the feasibility of  requiring additional documentation of key financial information.", "Regarding our recommendation that VA take steps to improve its quality  assurance review of initial claims, which could include reviewing a larger  sample of pension claims, the agency agreed with this recommendation  and indicated it will double the entire rating sample size in 2008.  While we  commend VA\u2019s effort to increase the overall number of claims reviewed in  its quality assurance review of rating-related decisions, we remain  concerned that this approach will not ensure that enough initial pension  claims are reviewed for quality assurance. As we point out in this report,  VA samples 10 claims from most regional offices\u2019 caseload of  compensation and initial pension claims. Given that initial pension claims  constitute about 11 percent of the caseload, a regional office, on average,  would likely have only 1 pension claim selected for review. Doubling the  sample size would increase the expected number of claims to 2, which we  believe is too few. Alternatively, VA might consider increasing the number  of pension claims in the overall sample, such as weighing the sample size  to include more pension claims or conducting stand-alone reviews of  pension claims.", "The agency agreed with our recommendation to incorporate evaluative  feedback more consistently into the planning, design, and implementation  of its training efforts.", "The agency agreed with our recommendation that VA evaluate options for  improving the effectiveness of its annual eligibility verification review.
