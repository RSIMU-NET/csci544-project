In 2001, SSA upgraded its 800-number network so that all callers could either access its automated services or be routed to the next available agent at any site in the network--a feat not possible under the previous system. The new network also enhanced SSA's ability to monitor and manage call traffic, agent availability, and network operations in real-time to ensure the network's integrity and the consistent delivery of services. SSA also expanded its automated and agent-assisted services accessible through the 800-number network. However, SSA's expansion of its automated services to reduce agent call burden has not had its intended effect, as callers continue to show a strong preference for agent assistance. In fiscal year 2004, about 51 million of the more than 71 million callers requested to speak to an agent. However, 8.7 million, or 17 percent, of these calls did not get through to an agent--a 2 percentage point increase over the previous year. SSA has taken steps to help agents provide callers with accurate information and consistent services, but still has problems with agents assisting callers in line with agency policies and procedures. SSA's training curriculum provides agents with a comprehensive overview of SSA programs. Agents are also encouraged to use available on-the-job resources, including a customized computer application that helps agents provide consistent service and accurate responses. Nevertheless, from 2001 through 2003, SSA did not meet its 90 percent target for service accuracy--that is, agents' performance in handling non-payment related issues in accordance with agency requirements. Although SSA has taken several actions to help agents improve their performance, including mandating agent use of the computer application, it has not yet determined why agent compliance with agency policies continues to fall short. SSA trains and monitors agents for courtesy and conducts periodic customer satisfaction surveys, but does not routinely capture all customer complaints about alleged agent discourtesy. Agents receive training on developing their interviewing and interpersonal skills, and SSA monitors agents to determine whether or not they are providing courteous service to callers. SSA monitoring indicates that agent courtesy levels are high. SSA solicits limited customer feedback on agent courtesy in its annual surveys and compiles general ratings, but these surveys do not ask callers for the reasons behind the ratings. Callers to the 800 number do complain of agent discourtesy, but SSA does not routinely document and assess all complaints. Some call center staff told us that when they receive allegations of agent discourtesy, they typically apologize for the discourteous service and may proceed to assist the caller without recording the complaint. SSA has feedback mechanisms in place to capture caller complaints, but these mechanism do not do so in a manner that allows SSA to assess complaints and identify corrective actions needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Administration (SSA) at some point touches the life of  nearly every American.

In  1989, SSA implemented a national, toll-free 800 number to better enable  individuals to request information on SSA programs or report events that  affect their own or someone else\u2019s SSA records or payments. SSA set up  the 800-number service with the expectation that callers would ask basic  questions and conduct simple business transactions, such as reporting  address changes and scheduling field office appointments. When a call  came into the 800 number, it would be routed to a local SSA call center.  This strategy resulted in a high busy rate. Troubled by high busy-signal  rates, SSA in 1996 added a nationwide automated menu to the 800 number  that allowed callers to conduct a limited number of transactions without  speaking to an agent.", "In 1997, we identified a number of conditions that limited the effectiveness  of SSA\u2019s 800-number service. For one, callers often reached a busy signal  instead of the automated menu or an agent. In addition, the automated  menu offered only a limited number of services. To reach an agent, callers  were required to select a specific topic about which they wished to speak  to an agent so that the system could direct their call to an agent in a call  center with the requisite subject matter expertise. This routing strategy led  to some call centers being overwhelmed with calls. Also, because agents  could not transfer calls, callers sometimes were inconvenienced by having  to redial the 800 number to complete their business.", "Since the introduction of its nationwide 800-number service, SSA has  worked to keep pace with the public\u2019s growing demand for telephone  services and interests in conducting more complex transactions over the  telephone. Today, calls made to the 800 number are answered at   44 geographically dispersed locations. A call placed to the 800 number  may be answered by agents located in any one of SSA\u2019s 36 teleservice  centers, 6 Program Service Centers; or at one of 2 components within  SSA\u2019s Office of Central Operations. Figure 1 shows the locations of these  call centers within the 10 SSA regions.", "SSA staffs its 36 teleservice centers with approximately 4,060 teleservice  representatives who answer incoming calls to the 800 number. In addition,  each of SSA\u2019s six program service centers, which are co-located on  teleservice center sites, has designated specialists, called \u201cSPIKES,\u201d who  have been cross-trained to provide back-up support in answering   800-number calls during peak call volume periods. The SPIKE staff is  comprised of various technical staff in the program service centers whose  routine responsibilities include processing claims, mailing out notices,  managing SSA\u2019s debt collection activities, and handling reports of non- receipt of checks and representative payee issues.", "SSA employs a cadre of approximately 2,030 trained SPIKES in its six  program service centers. When the volume of calls is expected to exceed  the levels that teleservice representatives can handle, SSA activates  SPIKES, diverting them from their routine responsibilities to answer  incoming 800-number calls. These peak calling periods typically occur on  the first day of the week, the first week of the month, and the first 3  months of the year. In this report, we refer to teleservice representatives  and SPIKES as \u201cagents\u201d and to teleservice centers and program service  centers as \u201ccall centers.\u201d", "SSA\u2019s Office of Telephone Services (OTS) plans, implements, operates,  and evaluates SSA telephone service to the public delivered by way of the  national 800 number and field offices.

In recent years, to measure access, SSA  calculated the number of calls handled, the number of calls that reach the  800 number on their first attempt, and the number of calls that reach an  agent within 5 minutes of selecting the option to speak with an agent. In  fiscal year 2005, SSA replaced these measures with two new access  performance measures\u2014the average speed of answer and the agent busy  rate\u2014consistent with standards in the telecommunications industry. SSA  also expects agents to adhere to agency guidance and procedures and sets  standards and measures agent accuracy (i.e., compliance with SSA\u2019s  requirements when serving callers) and agent courtesy. The Office of  Quality Assurance and Performance Assessment (OQA) measures the  accuracy of information agents provide callers by listening in daily to a  statistical random sample of calls handled by agents nationwide. OQA  assesses accuracy based on whether agents adhered to SSA requirements  when responding to callers\u2019 inquiries.

One  major upgrade was the replacement of the geographically based routing  system with a nationwide routing system capable of distributing calls to  any agent within the network. This change gave SSA the ability to monitor  call traffic and agent availability in real time at each call center and receive  \u201ccradle to grave\u201d management information on a call\u2019s movement from the  time the caller dials the 800 number until the call is terminated. The  network also effectively eliminated the busy signal that callers  encountered when using the older system. The new system accepts all  calls made to the 800-number network and provides callers with a broad  range of automated services. Calls seeking agent assistance are distributed  to 1 of SSA\u2019s 44 answering sites.", "When callers dial the 800 number, the network provides a series of  prompts to direct them to the desired services. The network uses recorded  announcements and pre-set menu prompts to separate callers according to  language preference (i.e., English or Spanish) or type of telephone service  (i.e., touchtone or rotary dial). The network uses a digitized voice to read  menu selections to the caller and responds to caller-entered touch-tone  digits. The caller\u2019s selection can invoke a number of options, such as  playing a recorded announcement (e.g., on cost-of-living adjustments) or  transferring a call to an agent. SSA provides callers with an extensive  menu of available automated services before offering them the option of  acquiring agent assistance. SSA told us that the menus were set up this  way to offer callers an opportunity to conduct their business using  automated services before forwarding their calls to agents.", "When a caller indicates a preference for agent assistance, the network  determines the optimum destination for the call. It reviews among other  factors agent availability, the number of calls in queue, and the minimum  expected delay. If all agents are busy and call queues are filled to capacity,  the network delivers an agent busy message to callers, advising them that  heavy call volume prohibits the transfer of their call to an agent and  encouraging them to call back during periods of typically lower call  volumes.", "A call placed in agent queue remains queued until an agent becomes  available. The network applies treatments to calls waiting in agent queue,  such as announcements promoting the use of SSA\u2019s Web site. According to  SSA, if the wait time in an agent\u2019s queue exceeds 15 minutes, the call is re- routed to another agent and given priority over other incoming calls. The  network continually tracks the status of each call until the caller  disconnects. Although the network was designed to hold one call per  agent in queue, the vendor told us that it typically holds up to 1.65 calls in  queue per agent.", "SSA and the vendor have taken measures to ensure the integrity of  network-generated data and the continuous operation of the network.  Both SSA and the vendor conduct ongoing tests of the accuracy and  completeness of the network-generated data on which so much of SSA\u2019s  800-number related performance measurement, management decisions,  and staffing levels depend. The vendor told us that redundancy was built  into the network to ensure that the failure of any one component only  affected existing calls. For example, if one component fails, the network  automatically employs a backup execution path to bypass the problem  location and reroutes calls to one of the remaining call centers. According  to the vendor, the redundancy built into the 800-number network and the  geographical dispersion of its redundant functions would make a complete  system outage almost unimaginable. Vendor staff told us that the local  outages that occur on occasion are mainly caused by loss of network  facilities, extended local power failures, or hardware issues. SSA and the  vendor maintain back up databases critical to network operations.", "SSA takes several additional steps to help ensure that callers can access  800-number services. SSA network operations staff frequently calls the  800-number network to test the integrity of the main menu scripts and the  routing of calls to both automated and agent services. They evaluate calls  for proper routing through the option choices; proper functionality of the  automated scripts; proper functionality of routing to agents; proper  routing to agents and agent queues; and the quality and clarity of the  connection. Call centers also have systems administrators who monitor  the performance of the equipment used on the premises and notify  headquarters when any anomalies appear. System administrators are  responsible for keeping the phones and headsets working, troubleshooting  problems with desktop applications, monitoring computers, printers, or  management information data.

Agents have been  trained to answer a wide range of inquiries and have the capacity to  transfer calls they cannot handle to others who handle these calls. For  example, in 1998, SSA began allowing callers to file claims for retirement  and survivors\u2019 benefits immediately through the 800 number, eliminating  the need for the caller to leave a message and wait for another SSA agent  to return the call. In 1999, SSA gave agents access to a computer-based  application to assist them in handling telephone calls more efficiently. In  2002, SSA provided callers the option of having their call routed to a  designated group of bilingual agents. SSA also extended the hours of agent  availability nationwide. Agents are now available weekdays from 7 a.m. to  7 p.m. in each time zone. In addition, SSA provides unadvertised agent  service for extended hours on weekday nights and weekends. SSA also  provides agent service for the hearing impaired through a separate toll- free number.", "In following SSA\u2019s instructions to handle all of the caller\u2019s business needs,  agents may be performing tasks that limit their availability to answer calls.   During site visits, we observed agents who filled out forms by hand,  retrieved printouts, placed the mailings in an envelope, addressed the  envelopes by hand, and put the envelope in the mail slot, while the caller  remained on hold.  While these steps may help give callers the assurance  that their business is being completed, such manual tasks are time- consuming and potentially limit the number of calls that agents can  handle.", "Although the number of calls placed to the 800 number has increased  slightly since fiscal year 2002 and SSA has expanded services available  through automation, the agency continues to have difficulty keeping pace  with caller demand for live agent assistance. Figure 3 shows the calls  made to the 800 number since fiscal year 2002 when SSA\u2019s most recent  telephone network upgrade was fully implemented. The proportion of  calls to the 800 number indicating a preference for agent assistance has  been relatively consistent, whereas SSA had hoped that the introduction of  automated services would divert calls away from agents to the less costly,  self-service automated system.  Such a reduction would be consistent with  the call center industry trend toward self-service with minimal agent  intervention.  However, agents continue to answer the majority of calls,  including some calls that, according to agents, could easily be handled  through automation. The percentage of calls seeking agent assistance but  not getting through declined from 22.7 percent in fiscal year 2002 to   15.2 percent in 2003, but rose 2 percent in fiscal year 2004. Specifically, as  figure 4 shows, 8.7 million (or 17.2 percent) of the 51 million calls seeking  agent assistance in fiscal year 2004 did not get through. About half of these  calls encountered a busy message and the other half abandoned the call  while waiting in queue.  Managers of private call centers do not place a lot  of importance on call abandonment rates for several reasons, including  their belief that callers terminate calls to visit the Web site.  Some callers  that request SSA agent assistance may be able to satisfy their needs  through the automated menu or Web site. However, if callers\u2019 business  require agent assistance, they will not be able satisfy their needs if they  unable to get reach an agent.", "SSA offers a variety of possible reasons why callers abandon their calls  after being placed in queue for an agent, one being that customers simply  do not want to continue waiting any longer before having an opportunity  to speak to an agent. SSA has several initiatives underway to reduce the  number of abandoned calls in queue, including a call-back service, which  will provide callers kept in queue beyond a certain threshold with an  opportunity to enter their telephone number and select a contact time so  that an agent can call them back. While providing convenience to callers  and potentially using any agent \u201cdown\u201d time more efficiently, a call back  option also has the potential to increase agent workload.", "Since 2002, SSA\u2019s 800-number automated menus have received  progressively higher call volumes but handled fewer calls to completion.  In addition, as shown in figure 5, the number of calls being abandoned  without completing a transaction in the automated menus has steadily  increased, culminating in fiscal year 2004, when nearly half of calls to  automation were abandoned.", "Although SSA offers a number of possible reasons, it is unable to say with  any degree of certainty why calls continue to be abandoned. In the past,  SSA has conducted follow-up caller surveys to ask callers what had  prompted them to abandon the automated services. The primary reason  that callers gave for hanging up after an initial selection of an automated  service was their desire to speak to an agent. According to SSA, many  callers simply desire the security of human contact when leaving personal  information that is required to transact business. SSA has now eliminated  the need for callers to redial; callers may now have their calls transferred  from automated services to agent queue. However, this option will likely  increase agents\u2019 call burden. SSA intends to make its automated menu  selections more accessible by introducing a speech-enabled main menu  that would allow callers to simply speak their needs in response to  directed questions. For example, rather than listening to a list of options,  callers will be able to use their voice to narrow down available options and  find the ones relevant to the services they seek. SSA plans to implement  this feature nationwide later in this fiscal year.  SSA also redesigned its  Web site in 2003 to improve its accessibility and usability in the hope of  relieving the burden on the 800 number. The Web site now attracts over   30 million visitors a year, which SSA says has reduced the demand for  direct service from 800-number and field office agents. SSA\u2019s customer  satisfaction surveys from 2002 and 2003 show that the percentage of the  survey respondents who said they would likely use the 800 number the  next time they contacted SSA decreased from 75 to 61 percent.

As part of their basic training, agents take frequent tests, conduct  mock interviews, observe experienced agents handling calls, and answer  calls. The basic training curriculum for full-time agents at the call centers  we visited ranged from 11 to 16 weeks. In addition, call center officials  told us that they taught a modified 11- to 12-week course to back-up agents  to augment their existing technical skills.

At the sites we visited, agents were mentored or closely  supervised during a transitional period. For example, some call centers  assigned a personal mentor to sit and observe agents handling calls and to  provide prompt assistance, as needed. After spending a number of weeks  with a mentor, agents are evaluated to determine their readiness to handle  calls on their own. As another transitional step, one call center placed  agents in a training unit that had a higher supervisor-to-agent ratio to allow  closer supervision and monitoring of agents\u2019 work. Floor support staff in  one training unit said that, in addition to providing technical assistance,  they review the accuracy of agents\u2019 data entries for events, such as direct  deposit requests and death reports.

For example,  training can occur during the 3-hour allotments reserved for monthly staff  meetings. Call center staff and officials told us that these meetings were  used as a forum to provide agents information on emerging issues such as  national and regional initiatives and changes in operating procedures, as  well as feedback on the call center\u2019s performance. During the workday,  supervisors may provide agents with important information that agents  need to know, such as generic responses to calls triggered by current  media reports on Social Security solvency.

SSA also assesses agents\u2019 performance for service  accuracy to determine whether or not the services they provide  correspond with SSA policies and procedures. When assessing service  accuracy, SSA considers whether agents provided accurate information as  well as performed all other related actions that the agency requires. Some  of these actions are required as a matter of convenience to callers or to  avoid the potential need for follow-up contact.", "SSA conducts random, remote monitoring of agents handling calls for  various purposes. OQA is responsible for two types of monitoring. First,  OQA monitors a statistical national sample of calls handled by agents  throughout the year to develop both agencywide and regional assessments  of agent performance. This type of monitoring serves as SSA\u2019s means of  assessing agent payment accuracy and service accuracy. OQA officials told  us that such monitoring had the capacity to reveal issues that needed to be  addressed at the agency level, such as pinpointing areas needing policy  clarification. However, the responsibility for agent performance, including  improving performance to meet agency targets, rests with the various  regions and individual call centers. Second, if requested by regional  officials, OQA occasionally monitors a small number of calls handled by  individual call centers and visits the call centers to brief managers and  agents on its findings. Call center staff also randomly monitor calls  handled by their call center for payment accuracy and service accuracy  and to identify training needs for their agents. SSA does not specify the  number of calls that should be monitored for this purpose. Call center  officials told us that the number of calls they monitored do not provide a  statistically valid assessment of their center\u2019s performance.", "Designated call center personnel also monitor individual agents to provide  agents individualized feedback on their telephone performance. Monitors  may point out positive aspects of agents\u2019 performance as well as suggest  additional training. Agents are given advance notice of when monitoring  will occur and are allowed to choose whether to have monitors sit with  them or to have monitors listen in from a remote location. For full-time  agents, SSA guidance recommends monitoring as many as five calls per  month for agents with more than 1 year of experience and unlimited calls  for agents with less than 1 year.

SSA protects individuals\u2019  privacy by limiting disclosure of the personal information in its records to  individuals for whom the agency maintains the records and to others  authorized. Agents committed an error each time they failed to collect the  requisite six identifying pieces of information to verify a caller\u2019s identity  before accessing or disclosing information from SSA records (i.e.,  improper handling of access and disclosure).", "Managers at the sites we visited have taken actions to reduce the number  of service errors, particularly access and disclosure errors. For example,  some call centers provided CHIP refresher training, designed desk aids  reminding agents of the steps for proper disclosure, placed \u201chot pink\u201d  sheets detailing the service errors on the desks of agents who commit  them, or established a \u201cCHIP doctor\u201d to provide agents with technical  assistance to help navigate the CHIP computer application. However, the  effectiveness of these actions to improve service accuracy for agents  within the respective call center is unknown because the monitoring that  occurs at the call center level does not provide a statistically valid  measurement to make such an assessment.", "OQA has reported that the lower service accuracy rate primarily stemmed  from agents\u2019 failure to follow SSA\u2019s requirements when asking callers to  verify their identities.

A good management complaint system can provide  data and information on complaints that can be compiled and analyzed to  give insight into where problems are recurring and what needs to be done  to fix them or prevent them from happening in the future. A good  complaint system also facilitates the filing of complaints using simple, yet  comprehensive complaint forms.", "SSA\u2019s 800-number customer satisfaction surveys are one means of  gathering feedback from callers on agent courtesy. However, the survey  does not ask why some respondents rate agent courtesy as poor. In  addition, the agency does not routinely collect or analyze all caller  complaints placed through the 800 number. Our visits to call centers found  variation in how they handled such calls. When customers call the   800 number to report agent-related complaints, SSA guidance requires  agents to refer calls to supervisors or floor-support staff.

Improvements to the 800-number network have not necessarily ensured  that callers receive the help they seek, given the number of calls not  reaching an agent. This may not be a mounting problem if callers follow  the general trend in the call center industry toward automation and self- service as they grow more comfortable with these options. However, the  impending increase in the size of the retiree and disability populations,  and anticipated changes to the Social Security system suggest that SSA  may continue to experience a substantial proportion of callers who  request agent assistance. Measures to improve customer access to agents  may therefore be needed. In addition, SSA\u2019s many benefit programs will  continue to generate some complex questions that require agent  assistance. Currently, the prevalence of service accuracy errors diminishes  the quality of service that callers receive when they do reach an agent  through the 800 number. Finally, although SSA\u2019s estimates show instances  of agent discourtesy to be rare among all calls, such instances could  nonetheless affect tens of thousands of callers.

Accordingly, SSA said it would convene a workgroup to obtain feedback  on the source of agent service errors and make recommendations as  appropriate to improve the agency service accuracy level.", "SSA disagreed with our recommendation to establish procedures for  documenting and assessing customer complaints. SSA said that its findings  that agent courtesy levels are consistently high demonstrate that its  present approach to ensuring agent courtesy\u2014which combines training,  monitoring, and customer surveys\u2014is working. Moreover, SSA said that  based on its experience with prior initiatives, a nationwide reporting  system would require heavy resource expenditures and be cost prohibitive  given current budget constraints. Furthermore, SSA stated that any use of  agent resources to document complaints would be counterproductive to  improving caller access to agent services.", "While we agree that agent courtesy levels are high and state this in the  report, given the sheer volume of 800-number calls SSA receives, even  relatively small percentages of callers encountering agent discourtesy  could result in tens of thousands of callers not getting the service they  deserve. Thus, we believe that SSA can benefit from having uniform  procedures for documenting and assessing customer complaints and have  added additional information for further clarification. Experts believe that  paying attention to customer complaints, however minor, and working to  quickly resolve them is important to building relationships with  customers. In addition, having information on complaints helps identify  recurring problems and potential fixes as well as help prevent future  occurrences. Under SSA\u2019s current practices, because the decision to  document a complaint lies with the individual agent handling the call,  customers contacting the 800 number have no assurance that SSA will  review the merits of their complaints. Routinely documenting and  assessing customer-initiated feedback could help the agency identify areas  of concern to callers and reinforce the agency\u2019s commitment to providing  quality \u201ccitizen centered\u201d service.", "While we understand SSA\u2019s concerns about resource constraints, we  maintain that SSA can implement a system to document complaints using  existing mechanisms, such as its 800-number feedback form and Internet  form for complaints reported to its 800 number and Web site, respectively.  As we state in the report, SSA already devotes time and staff to the  documentation and handling of customer-reported complaints; however,  such efforts are not done routinely. SSA states that its agents provide more  efficient service when they keep the caller on the phone until the caller\u2019s  business and all agent actions are completed.  We believe routinely  documenting callers\u2019 concerns would take no more time than completing  callers\u2019 other business. Further, the information could be collected  uniformly in an electronic format that would facilitate analysis that could  be used to improve service.

We also reviewed GAO and the Office of  the Inspector General (OIG) reports and SSA annual performance plans to  identify what is currently known about SSA telephone service operations.  To evaluate the quality of the 800-number service, we compared telephone  system performance data compiled by a contractor for SSA and SSA\u2019s  Office of Quality Assurance and Performance Assessment (OQA)  assessments of agent accuracy and courtesy to SSA\u2019s established  standards and, where applicable, to industry benchmarks.

SSA  uses the management data and information supplied by the vendor to  track all calls and transactions on the network, including data on overall  incoming calls and information on automation and to determine whether  calls were routed to an SSA call center or to a busy message. The vendor\u2019s  reporting system has internal alarms running on each server and an  application that periodically checks each server\u2019s vital functions, capacity,  and environmental operating conditions against a predetermined set of  normal operational conditions. Upon receipt, SSA runs the vendor- supplied data through a multistep automated procedure that backs up the  data, creates data storage files, extracts data to be stored in other datasets,  and recreates the data in a readable format. As part of this process, SSA  checks each record to ensure that all area codes are good, all phone  numbers are properly formatted, and all answering telephones originate in  the 800-number network. The vendor also generates separate reports on  automated services and agents. SSA reviews the reports and compares the  results with historical trends. Although SSA has no additional means of  verifying the reliability of the vendor-provided data or the results that  appear in report field outputs, both SSA and the vendor maintain that  these data are accurate and the vendor states that SSA has the source data  it needs to assess network performance. We reviewed SSA performance  data related to access and determined the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report.", "To assess the reliability of OQA\u2019s monitoring assessments of agents\u2019  performance, we examined data reliability issues identified in an OIG  report and interviewed OQA officials knowledgeable about the monitoring  process and resulting data. In addition, we reviewed documentation and  training materials, including monitoring instructions, evaluation data entry  forms and desk aids, corrective action and evaluation feedback forms, and  information regarding the statistical sampling of calls. In evaluating OQA\u2019s  sampling and weighting methodology, we determined that OQA\u2019s  methodology for monitoring agents\u2019 payment and service accuracy  appears to adequately represent the population of telephone calls.   Approximate confidence intervals were produced by OQA using standard  formulas for proportions based on a simple random sample.  As OIG  previously reported,  we also found that decisions regarding payment  accuracy and service accuracy continue to be unverifiable because SSA  does not maintain documentation of all monitored calls. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, given these  limitations.", "To assess the reliability of the survey of 800-number callers, we  interviewed OQA officials about the survey and resulting data and  reviewed documentation on the survey methodology, sampling, response  rates, and sampling variability. We also reviewed a report contracted by  the OIG regarding this measurement of customer satisfaction. This report  concluded that the 800-number caller survey produced a reliable  measurement of callers\u2019 views of agent courtesy for the period measured,  but that because the survey was administered only twice a year, it was  unlikely that the survey results matched the true customer satisfaction  across the entire year. Because the survey was recently limited to being  conducted during a single 4-week period in March, we found that the  survey results continue to be unrepresentative of callers\u2019 responses  throughout the year. We believe that seasonal events could affect  customer satisfaction in different ways throughout the year. The survey  response rate during the period 2001 through 2004, ranged from 53 percent  to 71 percent. Although response rates within these ranges are not  unexpected for this kind of telephone survey, it should be noted that as  the response rate decreases, the certainty that the survey results represent  the universe decreases.
