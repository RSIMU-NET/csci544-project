(2) To what extent are families with low-wage workers in poverty? and (3) To what extent do families with low-wage workers participate in selected social safety net programs and what factors affect their participation?", "GAO analyzed CPS data from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2016 on worker characteristics, family poverty, and participation in social safety net programs. GAO defined low-wage workers as those workers ages 25 to 64 earning $16 or less per hour. In addition, GAO interviewed officials with state and local social safety net programs and other experts in four metropolitan areas\u2014Atlanta, San Francisco, Santa Fe, and Washington, D.C.\u2014representing a range of local minimum wage levels relative to the federal minimum wage, costs of living, and participation rates in five selected federally funded social safety net programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to GAO's analysis of data in the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS), on average, low-wage workers worked fewer hours per week, were more highly concentrated in a few industries and occupations, and had lower educational attainment than workers earning hourly wages above $16 in each year GAO reviewed\u20141995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016. Their percentage of the U.S. workforce also stayed relatively constant over time. About 40 percent of the U.S. workforce ages 25 to 64 earned hourly wages of $16 or less (in constant 2016 dollars) over the period 1995 through 2016. The combination of low wages and few hours worked compounded the income disadvantage of low-wage workers and likely contributed to their potential eligibility for federal social safety net programs.", "About 20 percent of families with a worker earning up to the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25 per hour), 13 percent of families with a worker earning above federal minimum wage to $12.00 per hour, and 5 percent of families with a worker earning $12.01 to $16 per hour were in poverty in each year GAO reviewed (see figure).The extent of poverty varied considerably by the type of family in which a worker lived. For example, single-parent families earning the federal minimum wage or below comprised a higher percentage of families in poverty. In contrast, married families with no children comprised the lowest percentage of families in poverty, and generally had family incomes at or above the poverty line.", "Note: All references to the \u201cfederal minimum wage\u201d are based on 110 percent of the hourly federal minimum wage in effect that year or the equivalent hourly calculated wage for salaried workers. Brackets are used to represent margins of error of estimated percentages at a 95 percent confidence level.", "Families with a worker earning $16 or less per hour consistently used selected federally funded social safety net programs between 2005 and 2016, with varied factors affecting eligible families' participation. GAO estimated that the percentage of these families enrolled in Medicaid rose significantly over the past 2 decades, almost tripling among families with a worker earning more than the federal minimum wage between 1995 and 2016. In contrast, an estimated 5 percent or less of these families received cash assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program at least once in the prior calendar year from 1995 through 2016. A low-wage worker's family type also influenced the extent that families used selected social safety net programs. For example, among families with minimum wage earners in 2016, GAO estimated that about half or more married families used none of the programs GAO examined\u2014Medicaid, TANF, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Earned Income Tax Credit, and Additional Child Tax Credit\u2014while more than half of single-parent families used three or more. Program officials and others told GAO that eligible working families may not participate in programs for a variety of reasons, including time needed to apply for benefits, low benefit amounts, and assumed ineligibility."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Labor, private-sector employers have  added millions of jobs to the economy since the end of the most recent  recession in 2009; however, much of this job growth has been  concentrated in low-wage occupations that are less likely to provide full- time hours or employer-sponsored benefits. As a result, some workers  may face difficulty earning enough to meet their families\u2019 basic needs.", "Although working families may have one or more employed workers, a  family\u2019s combined income, if reliant on employment in low-wage  occupations, may keep the family in poverty. The Census Bureau  (Census) recently reported that 11.3 percent of families and 6.3 percent  of workers, including 2.4 percent of full-time workers, were in poverty in  2015. We previously reported that most people in poverty lived in  households with at least some earnings. By being in poverty, these  workers and their families may be eligible to participate in one or more  federally funded social safety net programs provided any other applicable  eligibility requirements are also met. These programs assist low-income  individuals and families with cash aid, food, shelter, health care, and other  support. Some programs are administered by the federal government;  others are administered by states.", "You asked us to examine several aspects of low-wage workers and their  families including their use of federally funded social safety net programs  over time. In this report, we answer the following questions: (1) What are  the characteristics of the low-wage workforce and how have they  changed over time? (2) To what extent are families with a low-wage  worker in poverty? and (3) To what extent do families with a low-wage  worker participate in selected social safety net programs and what factors  affect their participation?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed data from 1995 through 2016  included in the Current Population Survey (CPS)\u2014a national survey  designed and administered jointly by Census and the Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS) that serves as a key source of official government  statistics on employment and unemployment in the United States. After  discussions with Census and BLS officials, we selected the CPS and a  supplemental CPS survey\u2014the Annual Social and Economic Supplement  (ASEC)\u2014as the data sources best suited to answer our research  questions because together they included hourly wage data, large sample  sizes, data over time, and data on eligibility for and participation in social  safety net programs. We selected these years to provide a historical view  of the workforce at certain points in time extending across 2 decades. We  assessed the reliability of the CPS and ASEC data by reviewing data  documentation and interviewing officials at BLS and Census who use and  maintain the dataset. We determined that the data from these sources  were reliable for the purposes of our report. For the purposes of our  analysis, we defined a \u201cworker\u201d as a wage or salary earner ages 25 to 64  in the civilian labor force with positive weekly earnings. We defined a \u201clow  wage\u201d worker to be an individual who earned $16 per hour or less,  measured in constant 2016 dollars. We divided low-wage workers into  three mutually exclusive categories, based on their estimated hourly  wages:  federal minimum wage or below; above federal minimum wage to $12.00; and $12.01 to $16.00.", "For the first objective, we used CPS and ASEC data to describe selected  characteristics of low-wage workers, including the industries in which they  worked, their occupations, the number of jobs that they held, and the  number of hours that they worked. To determine if the characteristics of  low-wage workers changed over time, we examined these variables using  every fifth year of data from 1995 to 2015 (i.e., 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010,  and 2015), as well as the most recent CPS data from 2016.", "For the second objective, because poverty is determined on the basis of  annual family income we used \u201cfamilies\u201d as the unit of analysis. We  examined four different types of families with a low-wage worker: (1)  married families with children; (2) married families without children; (3)  single-parent families with children; and (4) other families. The \u201cother  families\u201d category covers a wide variety of living situations, such as single  adults living alone, but does not include married couples or a single  parent living with children. We determined the extent of poverty among  families with a low-wage worker using CPS variables on two poverty  measures\u2014the official poverty measure and the Supplemental Poverty  Measure (SPM). Our dataset derived from CPS data included families  with at least one low-wage worker. We placed families with more than  one low-wage worker in one or more of the categories we examined,  depending on that worker\u2019s wages. For example, we included the family  in both groups if a family had low-wage workers in more than one  category (such as a worker earning the federal minimum wage and a  worker earning between $12.01 and 16). To estimate the number and  percentage of families in our sample that were in poverty, we relied on the  CPS poverty variable which uses a modified poverty index adopted by a  Federal Interagency Committee in 1969 to provide a range of income  cutoffs or \u201cpoverty thresholds\u201d adjusted to take into account family size,  number of children, and age of the family householder or unrelated  individual. We calculated the percentage and number of these families in  poverty in each of the 6 years we analyzed from 1995 through 2016.", "For the third objective, we used the same CPS dataset on families with a  low-wage worker to examine the extent to which families with a low-wage  worker participated in five social safety net programs for low-income  individuals: (1) Medicaid (health care); (2) the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly food stamps); (3) Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) (cash assistance); (4) the Earned  Income Tax Credit (EITC); and (5) the Additional Child Tax Credit  (ACTC). We selected these five programs because they were large or  well known, and were included in the CPS data. For each of the selected  programs, we determined the number and types of families in each of our  three wage categories that, according to CPS, reported participating in  the program. We also analyzed whether families with a low-wage worker  participated in more than one of these programs and which combinations  of programs they used. We compared our results to existing reports, and  interviewed staff at BLS and Census. To examine what is known about  the reasons eligible working families do not participate in these selected  programs, we conducted a literature review and interviewed public policy  researchers and officials at state and local benefit agencies and/or  community nonprofit organizations, including interviews in four  metropolitan areas. We selected four locations\u2014Atlanta, San Francisco,  Santa Fe, and Washington, D.C.\u2014because they represented a range of  local minimum wage levels relative to the federal minimum wage, costs of  living, and participation rates in our five selected social safety net  programs. The content of our interviews and literature review is not  generalizable, but provides examples of factors affecting working families  who are eligible for, but do not receive assistance from social safety net  programs.", "Although CPS is a widely used source of labor force information, it is  important to note that these data have some limitations. CPS is self- reported survey data collected from a probability sample. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of the self-reported data. Specifically,  CPS data on program participation are known to be underreported, for  reasons that are not fully understood. In addition, Census officials told us  that CPS data on EITC and ACTC are modeled on who would be eligible  rather than reported participation in these tax credit programs. All  estimates produced from samples, such as the CPS data, are subject to  sampling error. In addition to percentage estimates, we calculated  margins of errors and include them in figures and tables. We include  standard errors associated with certain poverty and program participation  estimates in appendix II. The differences we discuss are statistically  significant unless otherwise noted.

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 first established a minimum  wage of 25 cents per hour, which has been raised numerous times  eventually reaching its current level of $7.25 per hour. Since 1980 the  federal government has increased the federal minimum wage various  times; however, the actual purchase power after adjusting for inflation  (i.e., the real value) of the minimum wage has trended downward (see fig.  1).", "Many states have enacted their own minimum wage laws, and under the  provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, an individual is  generally covered by the higher of the state or federal minimum-wage  rates. As of January 1, 2017, according to the Department of Labor, 29  states and the District of Columbia had minimum wage rates above the  federal minimum rate, and 2 states had minimum wage rates below the  federal minimum rate.

In 2016, the poverty thresholds ranged from $11,511 to $53,413,  depending on family size and the age of the head of household (see table  1).", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) uses these  poverty thresholds to update its poverty guidelines each year. These  guidelines are used as an eligibility criterion of a number of federal  programs, including certain low-income programs.", "We also previously reported that the official poverty measure had not  changed substantially since it was first developed, and concerns about its  inadequacies had resulted in efforts to develop a new measure. For  example, poverty threshold (the income level used to determine who is \u201cin  poverty\u201d each year) is based on three times the cost of food and does not  take into account the cost of other basic necessities, such as shelter and  utilities. Additionally, the official poverty measure considers cash income  in determining a household\u2019s income, but does not include additions to  income based on the value of noncash assistance (e.g., food assistance)  or reductions based on other necessary living expenses (e.g., medical  expenses or taxes paid). A National Academy of Sciences panel on  poverty and an interagency technical working group suggested ways that  a new poverty measure could address some of these concerns. Based on  these suggestions, Census, with support from BLS, developed a new  poverty measure\u2014the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)\u2014in 2010.

According  to the Congressional Research Service, five of these programs\u2014 Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, EITC, and ACTC\u2014accounted for $551.2 billion  in spending in fiscal year 2015, or two-thirds of total federal spending on  low-income assistance programs in that year.", "Eligibility criteria vary for these five federally funded programs and can  include both financial and nonfinancial criteria. As we have previously  reported, some programs are administered by states, which may apply  their own eligibility criteria. Assistance may be provided to an individual,  a family, or household. More recently, we reported that these programs\u2019  eligibility criteria varied significantly in terms of the income limits used.  In addition, we found that programs differed in the ways they measured  applicants\u2019 income, the standards and methods used to determine the  income limit (i.e., the maximum income an applicant may have and still be  eligible for the program), whether this limit is set nationwide or varies by  state or locality, and the amount of the income limit itself. We also found  that rules for determining the maximum allowable income that an  applicant may have a recipient could earn and still be eligible, the  amounts themselves, and whether they are set nationwide or vary by  state or locality, also varied significantly. For example, in TANF, income  limits are determined by states. We found that some states use HHS\u2019s  poverty guidelines, which are adjusted annually, while others had a limit  set in state law, which is not adjusted. In addition to having income tests,  we found that some programs limit assets that an eligible individual or  family may hold, while others do not.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers  SNAP, has reported that the overall increase in SNAP enrollment from  1995 to 2014 was influenced by economic conditions, such as higher  poverty rates during recessionary periods, and policy changes, such as  increases the value of a vehicle that could be excluded when calculating  a family\u2019s income. Finally, our estimates showed that EITC eligibility  generally increased among families with a worker earning above federal  minimum wage over this time frame, with an estimated 23 to 35 percent  of those families eligible in 2016; whereas eligibility for the ACTC  generally remained unchanged among families with a low-wage worker.", "A low-wage worker\u2019s family type also influenced the extent that families  used social safety net programs. When comparing program usage across  different family types, we generally found that regardless of the low-wage  workers\u2019 wages, a greater percentage of single-parent families used  selected programs than the other family types we examined. For  example, among families with a worker earning federal minimum wage or  below in 2016, our estimates showed that two-thirds of married families  without children and about half of married families with children used  none of the aforementioned programs. In contrast, more than half of  single-parent families used three or more of the programs (see fig. 11)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Several Factors May Affect Eligible Families\u2019 Participation in Social Safety Net Programs", "paragraphs": ["Agencies that administer the selected social safety net programs  indicated that eligible working families participate in these programs at a  lower rate than the total eligible population for reasons that are not well  known. For example, IRS reported that in 2013, 80 percent of eligible  filers\u2014all of whom had earnings\u2014claimed the EITC, with state rates  ranging from 72 percent in the District of Columbia to 85 percent in  Hawaii. Additionally, USDA estimates show that a significantly smaller  percentage of eligible households with a wage earner participated in  SNAP than other eligible households\u201470 percent compared to 83  percent in fiscal year 2014. Although some research has examined the  reasons why eligible people choose not to participate in social safety net  programs, our literature review found few studies that focused specifically  on working families rather than the general eligible population, none of  which had findings that were generalizable to the experiences of working  families nationwide.", "Our interviews with state and local officials for the selected social safety  net programs, representatives from nonprofit organizations, and  researchers helped provide additional context for the experiences of  working families. Specifically, the officials we interviewed identified  several reasons why families with a low-wage worker may decline to  participate in assistance programs for which they are eligible.", "Assumed ineligibility. Some workers may assume that earning  income at a job automatically makes them ineligible for benefits, even  if their earnings are low enough to qualify for assistance. A program  official in Atlanta told us that eligible families are generally aware of  the existence of a program, but assume they have to hit \u201crock bottom\u201d  before they can qualify for assistance. A researcher also told us that  families that had exceeded the eligibility threshold in the past may  assume they remain ineligible, even if their income has decreased.", "Lack of time. Some workers may find it difficult to take time off from  work to apply for benefits in person at a program office, if required.  Some states have implemented online or phone application processes  to make programs more accessible to working families. However, as  a nonprofit director in Santa Fe cautioned, not all families have  Internet access and the proficiency required to complete an  application online.", "Complex program requirements. Some families may find program  documentation requirements complex and difficult to fulfill. For  example, the state TANF application in one city we reviewed requires  applicants to provide information verifying their earned and unearned  income, money in the bank, immigration status, identity, vehicle  registration, and immunizations of children under 7 years of age.  Other program documents state that beneficiaries must also resubmit  financial information, along with verification of their children\u2019s school  attendance, semi-annually or whenever changes occur that would  affect their eligibility. Researchers have found that recent changes in  the SNAP income documentation requirements, such as requiring less  frequent recertification of income and eligibility, increased participation  and retention of SNAP benefits. In addition, some states have   combined applications for TANF, SNAP, and/or Medicaid into a single  form, reducing the amount of paperwork that applicants must  submit.", "Stigma. Some working families may be especially sensitive to the  stigma associated with some social safety net programs, because  their earnings did not make them as self-sufficient as they hoped. To  avoid this stigma, according to several officials we interviewed,  eligible working families may choose not to participate in a program if  their income is sufficient for them to survive without assistance. For  example, a 2007 study of 115 EITC recipients in the Boston area  found that respondents who had received TANF benefits desired to  leave the program as soon as possible. In contrast, according to a  caseworker in San Francisco, while unemployed families face the  same stigma, they cannot afford to refuse any benefits for which they  qualify.", "Minimal benefit amounts. SNAP, TANF, EITC, and ACTC have  means-tested structures that may reduce benefit levels as recipients\u2019  incomes increase. Several officials told us that at some point the  benefits may become too small to be worth the effort of obtaining  them. For example, a study of low-income customers of a large tax  preparation service in two counties in California during the 2007 tax  season found that 16 percent of those who had previously applied for  SNAP had stopped pursuing the benefits because the \u201chassle was not  worth it.\u201d", "Confusing tax rules. Some families may find the process of claiming  the EITC and ACTC on their tax returns to be confusing. For example,  a nonprofit director in the District of Columbia told us that applying for  these tax credits can be complex, especially the requirements for  qualifying children and filing status, and families claiming the credits  may need high quality and costly assistance to prepare their taxes. To  help mitigate this complexity, IRS encourages individuals who may  qualify for the tax credits to visit one of the more than 12,000 free tax  help locations across the country, but this task may also interfere with  some individuals\u2019 working hours."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Labor and the  Secretary of Commerce for comment.

The CPS is a national survey designed and  administered jointly by the Census Bureau (Census) and the Department  of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and it contains data on  individual earnings, as well as poverty rates of families and individuals.  CPS is a key source of official government statistics on employment and  unemployment in the United States and is the data source for several  BLS and Census reports addressing issues similar to those in our  objectives. For example, it is used to produce a BLS report on the  characteristics of minimum wage workers and a Census report on the  supplemental poverty rate.", "The CPS is conducted on a monthly basis, but different questions are  asked in different months during the year. Respondents are surveyed  over two separate 4-month periods. Information on hourly wages and  other labor force topics are collected on a monthly basis of a sub-sample  of respondents. Information on poverty, program participation and income  over the prior calendar year is collected annually in the Annual Social and  Economic Supplement (ASEC), conducted in March. In consultation with  Census officials, we combined information on hourly wages and poverty  and program participation, by linking respondents of the ASEC to the  months those respondents answered questions about hourly wages  (March, April, May, and June). We used the CPS years 1995, 2000,  2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016.", "Estimates produced from CPS data are subject to sampling error. For all  of our estimates we weighted observations based on the monthly weight  and generated standard errors under the assumption of with replacement  sampling using state as a stratification variable. To the extent possible,  we compared our estimates of values published by Census derived from  our weighting procedures and standard errors to reported values for that  year and found them to be consistent. In addition to estimates, we  generated standard errors or the margin of error for the 95 percent  confidence interval, and report them with estimates in figures and tables.  Based on our data checks, review of documentation and interviews with  agency officials, we found the CPS data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.

In addition, we reported that the Urban Institute staff found  that CPS data captured about 61 percent of TANF cash assistance  benefits received and 57 percent of SNAP benefits received in 2012. In  the case of EITC and ACTC, Census imputes eligibility for the credits  from reported income and other information about the family. According to  researchers, in some cases the CPS will overstate usage of the EITC, by  imputing the credit to those that do not claim it.
