This model is intended to address a variety of concerns about our educational system, including unresponsive school district bureaucracies, restrictive rules, limited choices among types of public schools, and a lack of accountability for student performance. Charter schools are generally designed to operate with more autonomy than are public schools. In exchange for varying degrees of autonomy from state and local rules and regulations, charter schools are held accountable for meeting the terms of their charters, which include achieving stipulated academic outcomes. Schools that do not meet the terms of their charters face having their charters revoked.", "While public schools are primarily financed with state and local revenues, the federal government provides several billion dollars annually to assist public schools in educating our children. For example, during fiscal year 1997, the federal government will provide over $7 billion under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to help schools provide additional services to disadvantaged children to help close the achievement gap that exists between them and their wealthier peers. In addition, under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal government helps schools pay for the additional costs incurred in providing a free, appropriate public education to disabled children. This year, the federal government is making $3.5 billion available for this program. While all public schools could be eligible for funds under these programs, concerns have been raised at recent congressional hearings about whether charter schools, as public academic institutions, are receiving an equitable share of these federal funds. states accounted for 91 percent of the charter schools operating during the 1996-97 school year. To date, we have completed about 30 of 50 planned telephone surveys of charter schools. Because of the sampling methodology used, our results cannot be applied to the 9 percent of charter schools that operate outside our sample states.", "In summary, title I and IDEA funds are allocated to schools that meet established federal, state, and local demographic criteria. These criteria relate to the number of enrolled children from low-income families and the number of enrolled children with disabilities that require special education services. Although most public schools receive funding under these programs, some public schools\u2014including some charter schools\u2014do not meet eligibility criteria and, as a result, do not receive funding. Our preliminary work suggests that states are allocating federal funds to charter schools in much the same manner as they allocate funds to traditional public schools. In general, states either treat charter schools as individual school districts or as components of existing districts. Although charter schools treated as school districts avoid having to meet additional criteria used to distribute funds beyond the district level, our survey results thus far indicate that these schools were no more likely to have received title I and IDEA funds for the 1996-97 school year than were charter schools treated as components of existing school districts. Most charter school operators we surveyed who expressed an opinion told us that they believe they received an equitable share of federal title I and IDEA funds. education notifies them of funding opportunities and application requirements.

In school year 1996-97, over 100,000 students were enrolled in nearly 500 charter schools in sixteen states and the District of Columbia. Most charter schools are newly created. According to the Department of Education, of the charter schools operating as of January 1996, about 56 percent were newly created, while about 33 percent were converted from preexisting public schools and about 11 percent were converted from preexisting private schools. Appendix II shows the states that have enacted charter laws, and the number of charter schools in operation during the 1996-97 school year, by state.", "Both the Congress and the administration have shown support for charter schools. For example, in amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1994, the Congress established a grant program to support the design and implementation of charter schools. In addition, under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, states are allowed to use federal funds to promote charter schools. The administration proposed doubling the roughly $50 million made available under the new charter school grant program in fiscal year 1997 to $100 million for fiscal year 1998. Finally, in his 1997 State of the Union Address, the President called for the establishment of 3,000 charter schools nationwide by the next century. focused on the recent development of charter schools in various states. Concerns were raised during the hearings by charter school operators and others about whether charter schools were receiving equitable allocations of federal categorical grant funds. Recent research conducted by the Department of Education and by the Hudson Institute, a private, not-for-profit public policy research organization, raised similar concerns.

Nationwide, the Department of Education makes available to LEAs an annual average of about $800 for each child counted in the title I allocation formula.", "Under title I, the federal government awards grants to LEAs through state education agencies (SEA). SEAs are responsible for administering the grants and distributing the funds to LEAs. About 90 percent of the funds the Congress appropriates is distributed in the form of basic grants, while about 10 percent is distributed as concentration grants, which are awarded to LEAs serving relatively higher numbers of children from low-income families.

The LEA must rank its schools according to the proportion of children that come from low-income families enrolled in each school. LEAs must use the same measure of poverty in ranking all their schools, but LEAs have some discretion in choosing a particular measure. LEAs must allocate title I funds or provide title I services first to schools that have more than 75 percent of their students coming from low-income families. After providing funds or services to these schools, LEAs have the option of serving schools that do not meet the 75-percent criterion with remaining funds.

The Congress appropriated $3.5 billion for the program in fiscal year 1997.

States must provide at least 75 percent of the IDEA funds they receive to eligible LEAs or other public authorities, and they may reserve the rest for statewide programs. Before the 1997 IDEA reauthorization, an LEA entitled to an allotment of less than $7,500 could not receive funding directly, according to federal statutory provisions. Instead, the LEA had to either rely on the state for services or join with other LEAs to collectively meet the $7,500 threshold and receive funds to serve eligible students. In reauthorizing IDEA, the Congress removed the $7,500 threshold. As a result, LEAs, including charter schools that are treated as LEAs, are no longer required to join with other LEAs in order to meet that threshold.", "Each state has different procedures for allocating special education aid to LEAs.

Charter schools, along with other public schools in the district, then receive their share of funds or services from their parent LEAs. The third approach for allocating funds to charter schools involves a mixture of the first and second approaches. In general, a charter school in a state using this approach receives federal funds directly from the SEA\u2014and thus is treated as an LEA\u2014if the school was chartered by a state agency, or through a parent LEA, if the school was chartered by a district or substate agency. States using this model include Arizona, Michigan, and Texas.", "Regardless of which of the three approaches states use, individual charter schools are generally allocated funds on the basis of whether they are treated as (1) an independent LEA, or school district (independent model), or as (2) a dependent of an LEA\u2014that is, as a public school component of a preexisting school district (dependent model).

Because LEAs are allowed some discretion in allocating funds to individual schools within their districts, whether a charter school is treated as an LEA or as a dependent of an LEA is important.", "Under the title I program, SEAs distribute funds directly to eligible LEAs. To be eligible for funds, LEAs\u2014including charter schools operating under the independent model\u2014must meet the minimum statutory eligibility criteria of having enrolled at least 10 children from low-income families and having their low-income children constitute more than 2 percent of their school-aged population.

The federal statute and regulations lay out a complex set of criteria and conditions that LEAs use in deciding how to allocate funds to their schools. The intent of the statute is to shift title I funds received by LEAs to individual schools with relatively higher numbers and percentages of students from low-income families. Individual schools\u2014including charter schools\u2014within a multiple-school LEA, therefore, must potentially meet higher eligibility thresholds than they would if they were each considered an independent LEA. As a result, some charter schools that would have received title I funds under the independent model may not receive such funds because they are components of LEAs.", "Under the IDEA program, states have greater latitude than under title I to develop systems of their own to distribute program funds or special education services to schools and school districts. Given this latitude, the manner in which charter and other public schools receive these funds varies by state. For example, Arizona is currently in the process of allocating IDEA funds to charter schools on a pro-rata (per-eligible-student) basis. In Minnesota, the state reimburses charter schools for IDEA-eligible expenses. Yet another state\u2014California\u2014allocates its share of funds to so-called \u201cspecial education local plan areas.\u201d Special education local plan areas are typically composed of adjacent school districts that jointly coordinate special education programs and finances in that state.

Title I funding for these schools ranged from $96 to $941 per eligible student; the average was $499 per eligible student, and the median was $435. The difference in per-student funding is related to the allocation formulas, which take into account the number and proportion of low-income children in the school, district, and county.

However, our survey has identified a variety of barriers that made it difficult for charter school operators to apply for and receive title I and IDEA funds. For example, three officials told us that because they had no prior year\u2019s enrollment or student eligibility data, they were not eligible under state guidelines for federal funds. In its July 1997 report, the Hudson Institute also found that title I funds were typically allotted on the basis of the previous year\u2019s population of title I-eligible children, \u201cleaving start-up charters completely stranded for their first year.\u201d Two of our three respondents for whom lack of prior year\u2019s enrollment data was a problem were newly created schools, while the third was converted from a formerly private institution.", "Start-up eligibility issues are not always limited to a school\u2019s first year of operations. Some officials noted that their schools are incrementally increasing the number of grades served as the original student body progresses. For example, one school official told us that while the school currently serves grades 9 and 10, the school will eventually serve grades 9 through 12. about 40 newly enrolled students. But because of the time lag in reporting data, the school will have to wait until the following year for the additional funds. Over time, as enrollment stabilizes, these issues will pose fewer problems for school officials. Charter schools that were converted from traditional public schools generally do not have this problem when current enrollment is at or near full capacity and title I eligibility has previously been established.", "Moreover, some school officials reported difficulty obtaining the student eligibility data required to receive title I funds. In some states, school officials themselves must collect data on students\u2019 family incomes in order to establish eligibility for federal funds. Some officials told us that because of privacy concerns, some families are reluctant to return surveys sent home with students that ask for the income levels of students\u2019 households. An official told us that he believed parents may not understand that such data are used to qualify children for free and reduced-price lunches for schools that operate such programs, as well as for establishing the schools\u2019 eligibility for federal grant funds.", "In other cases, charter school officials must take additional steps to establish their eligibility for title I funds over and above those faced by their traditional public school counterparts. For example, in one state, charter school officials must manually match their student enrollment records against state and local Aid to Families With Dependent Children records to verify student eligibility. The business administrator for a charter school with an enrollment of about 1,000 students told us that it takes him and another staff person approximately 2 full days to complete this process. He said that while this procedure is accomplished electronically for traditional public schools, city officials told him that he had no such option.", "Another charter school official told us that timing issues prevented her from being able to access federal funds. For example, she said that her school\u2019s charter was approved after the deadline had passed for the state allocation of title I funds to public schools. The same school official said that her lack of awareness of what was required to obtain IDEA funds led her to underestimate the time required to prepare and submit applications, and she was thus unable to submit them on time. access these funds. For example, the business administrator at a charter school we visited told us that it took numerous visits and phone calls to district officials to understand the allocation processes and procedures, as well as to negotiate what he thought was an equitable share of federal funding for his school. District officials we spoke with noted that because their school district had approved and issued several charters to individual schools with varying degrees of fiscal autonomy, working out allocation issues has taken some time. District officials noted that they have limited time and resources to use in developing new policies and procedures for charter schools, especially because the number of charter schools and their student populations constitute a very small portion of their overall operations.", "In some cases, charter school officials noted that they did not receive funds because they failed to meet federal or district qualifying requirements. For example, current federal requirements mandate that LEAs\u2014charter schools operating under the independent model\u2014have at least 10 children from low-income families enrolled and that such children constitute more than 2 percent of their school-aged population. Of 32 schools responding to our survey, 9 had fewer than 10 students who were eligible for title I funds.", "Schools operating under the dependent funding model may face more barriers than do schools operating under the independent funding model because dependent-model schools must go through an intermediary\u2014or school district\u2014in accessing federal funds, rather than receiving funds directly from the state. One charter school operator told us that she believed that her school\u2019s parent LEA unfairly used its discretion in allocating funds to schools within its district. She said that other schools in the district received higher funding levels than did her school. Even though state officials told her that it was within the LEA\u2019s discretion to allocate funds the way it did, she believes that district officials were singling her school out for disparate treatment because it is a charter school. Another charter school operator told us that uncooperative district officials were an obstacle in accessing federal funds because they were unwilling to provide assistance in obtaining funding for her school. $7,500 threshold and collectively file a joint application. Given recent federal IDEA appropriations, a school district, or group of districts, is required, in effect, to have enrolled approximately 20 to 25 eligible students to meet the $7,500 threshold. Of the charter schools responding to our survey, 17 enrolled 20 or fewer IDEA-eligible students. Two survey respondents told us that the requirement for schools to join consortiums to access IDEA funds discouraged or prevented them from pursuing these funds.", "Moreover, some charter school officials have philosophical differences with IDEA requirements and forego IDEA funding because it does not accommodate their educational methods, according to a charter school technical assistance provider we visited. She said that IDEA requires schools to develop written individualized education programs (IEP) for disabled children, and requires schools to follow specified processes in developing these IEPs. In order to receive IDEA funds, schools must have prepared these IEPs for disabled students. In contrast to preparing IEPs for disabled children only, she said some charter schools approach to education includes considering that all children have special needs. Accordingly, they develop a unique education plan for each child, stressing individualized instruction. The Hudson Institute, in conducting its study, visited charter schools and spoke with school officials and parents who said they preferred that their children not be \u201clabeled\u201d and did not want their educational needs met in \u201ccumbersome, standardized ways.\u201d order to receive IDEA funding until the state informed her of the requirement.

These officials often played multiple roles at their schools, including principal, office manager, nurse, and janitor. One operator told us that it would not be stretching the truth much to say that if all he was required to do was to sign on a dotted line, stuff an envelope, and lick a stamp, he would not have time. Another operator told us that if she receives anything in the mail with the words \u201ctitle I\u201d on it, she throws it away because she has so little time to attend to such matters.
