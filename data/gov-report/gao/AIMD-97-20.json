Sustained growth in air traffic and aging equipment have strained the current ATC system, limiting the efficiency of ATC operations. To combat these trends, in 1981 FAA embarked on an ambitious ATC modernization program. FAA estimates that it will spend about $34 billion on the program between 1982 and 2003.", "Our work over the years has chronicled many FAA failures in meeting ATC projects\u2019 cost, schedule, and performance goals.

These facilities\u2019 ATC functions are described below.", "About 90 flight service stations provide pre-flight and in-flight services, such as flight plan filing and weather report updates, primarily for general aviation aircraft.", "Airport towers control aircraft on the ground and before landing and after take-off when they are within about 5 nautical miles of the airport, and up to 3,000 feet above the airport. Air traffic controllers rely on a combination of technology and visual surveillance to direct aircraft departures and approaches; maintain safe distances between aircraft; and communicate weather-related information, clearances, and other instructions to pilots and other personnel.", "Approximately 180 TRACONs sequence and separate aircraft as they approach and leave busy airports, beginning about 5 nautical miles and ending about 50 nautical miles from the airport, and generally up to 10,000 feet above the ground, where en route centers\u2019 control begins.", "Twenty en route centers control planes over the continental United States in transit and during approaches to some airports. Each en route center handles a different region of airspace, passing control from one to another as respective borders are reached until the aircraft reaches TRACON airspace. En route center controlled airspace usually extends above 18,000 feet for commercial aircraft. En route centers also handle lower altitudes when dealing directly with a tower, or when agreed upon with a TRACON.", "Two en route centers\u2014Oakland and New York\u2014also control aircraft over the ocean. Controlling aircraft over oceans is radically different from controlling aircraft over land because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore.

FAA recognized that it could increase ATC operating efficiency by increasing automation. Additionally, FAA forecasted increased future demand for air travel, brought on by airline deregulation of the late 1970s. It also anticipated that meeting the demand safely and efficiently would require improved and expanded services, additional facilities and equipment, improved workforce productivity, and the orderly replacement of aging equipment. Accordingly, in December 1981, FAA initiated its plan to modernize, automate, and consolidate the existing ATC system by the year 2000.", "This ambitious modernization program includes the acquisition of new radars and automated data processing, navigation, and communication equipment in addition to new facilities and support equipment. FAA estimates that the modernization will cost over $34 billion through the year 2003 and total over 200 separate projects. ATC information systems make up a large portion of this total, accounting for 169 projects costing $20.7 billion. The Congress will have provided FAA with approximately $14.7 billion of the $20.7 billion through fiscal year 1997.", "Over the past 15 years, FAA\u2019s modernization projects have experienced substantial cost overruns, lengthy schedule delays, and significant performance shortfalls. To illustrate, the long-time centerpiece of this modernization program\u2014the Advanced Automation System\u2014was restructured in 1994 after estimated costs tripled from $2.5 billion to $7.6 billion and delays in putting significantly less-than-promised system capabilities into operation were expected to run 8 years or more. Similarly, increases in per-unit costs for five other major ATC projects have ranged from 50 to 511 percent, and schedule delays have averaged almost 4 years.", "Our past work on the ATC modernization raised a number of concerns, including concerns about the reliability of projects\u2019 cost estimates. For example, our review of FAA\u2019s Oceanic Display and Planning System found that cost and schedule estimates were questionable because they were based solely on managers\u2019 judgments and were not revised to reflect changing project demands and conditions. Also, our work on AAS highlighted that FAA underestimated the complexity of the system development and relied on its contractor\u2019s deficient cost estimating systems. In its internal risk management guidance, FAA acknowledges that it has a history of unreliable project cost estimates, attributing some of its unenviable record in ATC projects\u2019 cost growth to setting unrealistically low cost estimates, either because of poor cost estimating processes or inadequate system descriptions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ATC Modernization and Maintenance Management Structure", "paragraphs": ["Two major FAA organizations play key roles in the modernization and evolution of ATC systems\u2014the Office of the Associate Administrator for Research and Acquisitions (ARA) and the Office of the Associate Administrator for Air Traffic Services (ATS). The first, ARA, manages the research, development, and acquisition of modernization projects. Within ARA, two groups are responsible for acquiring systems, while the others handle cross-cutting management functions (e.g., budget formulation, cost estimation, and program evaluation). Also, the William J. Hughes Technical Center is the ATC system test and evaluation facility and supports ATC systems\u2019 research, engineering, and development.", "ARA employs an Integrated Product Development System (IPDS) approach. A key component of IPDS is the use of Integrated Product Teams (IPT), which are cross-functional teams aligned with major business and functional areas (i.e., en route, terminal, weather and flight services, air traffic management, oceanic, communications, navigation, surveillance, infrastructure, and information systems). IPT members include systems and specialty engineers, logistics personnel, lawyers, contract specialists, and representatives from the organization responsible for the system\u2019s operations and maintenance. IPTs are responsible for systems research, development, acquisition, and installation. Product teams within these IPTs are responsible for individual ATC system acquisitions or projects.

Once the decision was made to invest in a given alternative, the IPTs assumed responsibility for updating the cost estimates. However, IPTs could also choose to develop their own cost estimates prior to the investment decision point, rather than have ASD prepare them.", "Of the six projects we reviewed, four used ASD- at some point in the project\u2019s life cycle. The other two did not. In addition, some project managers updated the acquisition phase portion of the life cycle cost estimates periodically between the times that the full life cycle cost estimates were revised.", "FAA\u2019s organizational responsibilities for cost estimating have recently changed. In October 1995, the Congress instructed FAA to develop and implement a new acquisition management system, which would not be subject to various existing acquisition laws. On November 15, 1995, the President signed this bill into law. FAA began implementing this new acquisition management system in April 1996 with the issuance of broad policies, guiding principles, and internal procedures. While not yet fully implemented, these specify that two key decisions be made at the corporate level by the Joint Resources Council (JRC), a newly formed body comprised of the associate administrators for operations and acquisitions as well as officials responsible for acquisitions, financial services, and legal counsel. These decisions are (1) whether mission needs warrant entry into investment analysis and (2) whether to invest in the project at the conclusion of investment analysis. FAA identified the latter as the most important decision in the life cycle acquisition management process. Accordingly, FAA plans to establish a \u201ccenter of excellence\u201d for investment analysis with experts in cost estimating, risk assessment, market analysis, and affordability analysis.", "Under this new scenario, investment analysis will be conducted as a joint enterprise by the FAA organization sponsoring the system (i.e., ATS) and the FAA organization responsible for acquiring it (i.e., ARA). The purpose is threefold: to ensure that (1) users buy into the solution, (2) acquisition specialists have a voice in the cost, schedule, and performance baselines they will have to live with, and (3) the investment analysis staff understands the concerns of the operations and acquisitions organizations. Under this approach, the sponsoring organization, with technical support from the investment analysis staff, develops and approves its requirements in the form of a Requirements Document. The investment analysis staff leads the effort to identify and analyze candidate solutions through market surveys, alternatives analysis, and affordability assessments, with support from the sponsoring organization and the ARA IPT responsible for acquiring it. This effort culminates in the Investment Analysis Report, which is to contain comprehensive quantitative data for each alternative, such as life cycle cost, cost-benefit ratios, and risk. The IPTs use this information to generate cost and schedule baselines for each alternative in the form of an Acquisition Program Baseline. At the investment decision point, the JRC decides on an alternative; baselines the project\u2019s requirements, costs, schedules, performance, and benefits; and commits the agency to full funding of the program. Thereafter, any changes to these baselines must be approved by the JRC. In fact, no funding may be committed or obligated that would exceed the program cost baseline until the increase is approved by the JRC and included in agency plans and budgets.", "The success of FAA\u2019s new investment analysis and decision-making approach depends on many factors, not the least of which is the reliability of ATC project cost information discussed in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sound Investment Decisions Require Reliable Cost Estimating and Accounting Practices and Data", "paragraphs": ["Reliable cost estimates and monitoring of actual costs are essential to informed investment decision-making throughout the development and maintenance of capital items, such as ATC systems.

Among other things, we reported that successful organizations manage information system projects as investments, and continually assess the quality of projects\u2019 estimated costs and carefully monitor projects\u2019 actual costs against these estimates. Furthering this initiative, OMB\u2019s 1995 guidance, Evaluating Information Technology Investments, calls for selecting information technology project investments on the basis of cost, benefit, risk, and return; controlling projects by comparing ongoing actual results being achieved with projected costs, benefits, and risks; and, finally, evaluating projects after they have been implemented to determine actual cost, benefits, risks, and returns, and modifying the selection and control processes based on lessons learned. This guidance has since been embodied in (1) the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which requires the selection of information technology investments on the basis of competing projects\u2019 estimated costs, benefits, and risks, and (2) the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, which requires federal agencies to maintain integrated accounting and financial management systems that permit systematic and reliable measurement of projects\u2019 cost and performance. Additionally, OMB Circular A-11, Part 3, requires agencies to request full up-front budget authority for all ongoing and new fixed assets (including information technology) in their fiscal year 1998 budget submission.

As a result, there is no analytical way to determine the credibility of the original estimate or estimating approach. Moreover, without documentation, FAA cannot systematically use its ASR-In addition, project estimators derived official WAAS life cycle cost estimates based on experiences with the National Satellite Test Bed, a precursor to the WAAS development. However, little documentation exists on how the original WAAS size estimates were derived and what assumptions and parameters were used to estimate costs. Project officials are currently updating estimates using a published sizing methodology and the Software Life Cycle Intermediate Model (SLIM) cost model, and stated that they believe this is a much more rigorous approach than prior estimating efforts. However, this more structured approach also falls short of SEI requirements. For example, the project software estimator stated that one cost model parameter (input variable) is a ranking of the sophistication of the developer\u2019s software environment. The estimator scored the WAAS contractor as very high on this parameter and showed us where this information was captured in the SLIM database. However, the estimator went on to explain that he chose a high score based on the contractor\u2019s rating as a level 3 organization on SEI\u2019s CMM and the fact that they have and use Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools. This explanatory information was not recorded in the SLIM database or in any other documentation, and thus is not available to anyone trying to understand or validate the estimate or learn from this estimating experience.", "The current official estimate for the last of the six systems, DSR, was derived using an approach that partially or fully satisfied six of the seven SEI reliability questions.
