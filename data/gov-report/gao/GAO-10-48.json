The United States has generated 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste and is expected to generate 153,000 metric tons by 2055. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to dispose of the waste in a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. However, the repository is more than a decade behind schedule, and the nuclear waste generally remains at the commercial nuclear reactor sites and DOE sites where it was generated. This report examines the key attributes, challenges, and costs of the Yucca Mountain repository and the two principal alternatives to a repository that nuclear waste management experts identified: storing the nuclear waste at two centralized locations and continuing to store the waste on site where it was generated. GAO developed models of total cost ranges for each alternative using component cost estimates provided by the nuclear waste management experts. However, GAO did not compare these alternatives because of significant differences in their inherent characteristics that could not be quantified."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Yucca Mountain repository is designed to provide a permanent solution for managing nuclear waste, minimize the uncertainty of future waste safety, and enable DOE to begin fulfilling its legal obligation under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to take custody of commercial waste, which began in 1998. However, project delays have led to utility lawsuits that DOE estimates are costing taxpayers about $12.3 billion in damages through 2020 and could cost $500 million per year after 2020, though the outcome of pending litigation may affect the government's total liability. Also, the administration has announced plans to terminate Yucca Mountain and seek alternatives. Even if DOE continues the program, it must obtain a Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction and operations license, a process likely to be delayed by budget shortfalls. GAO's analysis of DOE's cost projections found that a repository to dispose of 153,000 metric tons would cost from $41 billion to $67 billion (in 2009 present value) over a 143-year period until the repository is closed. Nuclear power rate payers would pay about 80 percent of these costs, and taxpayers would pay about 20 percent. Centralized storage at two locations provides an alternative that could be implemented within 10 to 30 years, allowing more time to consider final disposal options, nuclear waste to be removed from decommissioned reactor sites, and the government to take custody of commercial nuclear waste, saving billions of dollars in liabilities. However, DOE's statutory authority to provide centralized storage is uncertain, and finding a state willing to host a facility could be extremely challenging. In addition, centralized storage does not provide for final waste disposal, so much of the waste would be transported twice to reach its final destination. Using cost data from experts, GAO estimated the 2009 present value cost of centralized storage of 153,000 metric tons at the end of 100 years to range from $15 billion to $29 billion but increasing to between $23 billion and $81 billion with final geologic disposal. On-site storage would provide an alternative requiring little change from the status quo, but would face increasing challenges over time. It would also allow time for consideration of final disposal options. The additional time in on-site storage would make the waste safer to handle, reducing risks when waste is transported for final disposal. However, the government is unlikely to take custody of the waste, especially at operating nuclear reactor sites, which could result in significant financial liabilities that would increase over time. Not taking custody could also intensify public opposition to spent fuel storage site renewals and reactor license extensions, particularly with no plan in place for final waste disposition. In addition, extended on-site storage could introduce possible risks to the safety and security of the waste as the storage systems degrade and the waste decays, potentially requiring new maintenance and security measures. Using cost data from experts, GAO estimated the 2009 present value cost of on-site storage of 153,000 metric tons at the end of 100 years to range from $13 billion to $34 billion but increasing to between $20 billion to $97 billion with final geologic disposal."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["High-level nuclear waste consists mostly of spent nuclear fuel removed  from commercial power reactors and is considered one of the most  hazardous substances on earth. The U.S. national inventory of 70,000  metric tons of nuclear waste\u2014enough to fill a football field more than 15  feet deep\u2014has been accumulating at 80 sites in 35 states since the mid- 1940s and is expected to more than double to 153,000 metric tons by 2055.  The current national policy of constructing a federal repository to dispose  of this waste at Yucca Mountain\u2014which is about 100 miles northwest of  Las Vegas, Nevada\u2014has already been delayed more than a decade. As a  result, nuclear waste generally remains at the sites where it was generated.  Experts and regulators believe the nuclear waste, if properly stored and  monitored, can be kept safe and secure on-site for decades; but  communities across the country have raised concerns about the waste\u2019s  lethal nature and the possibility of natural disasters or terrorism,  particularly at sites near urban centers or sources of drinking water.  Industry has also raised concerns that local communities will not support  the expansion of the nuclear energy industry without a final waste  disposition pathway. Many experts and communities view nuclear energy  as a potential means of meeting future energy demands while reducing  reliance on fossil fuels and cutting carbon emissions, a key contributor to  climate change.", "In addition to the spent nuclear fuel generated by commercial power  reactors, the Department of Energy (DOE) owns and manages about 19  percent of the nuclear waste\u2014referred to as DOE-managed spent nuclear  fuel and high-level waste\u2014which consists of spent nuclear fuel from  power, research, and navy shipboard reactors, and high-level nuclear  waste from the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program. (See fig. 1 for the  locations where nuclear waste is stored.)", "Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), as amended, DOE  was to evaluate one or more national geologic repositories that would be  designated to permanently store commercial spent nuclear fuel and DOE- managed spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. NWPA was amended in  1987 to direct DOE to evaluate only the Yucca Mountain site. In 2002, the  president recommended and the Congress approved the Yucca Mountain  site as the nation\u2019s geologic repository. The repository is intended to  isolate nuclear waste from humans and the environment for thousands of  years, long enough for its radioactivity to decay to near natural  background levels. NWPA set January 31, 1998, as the date for DOE to  start accepting nuclear waste for disposal. To meet this goal, DOE has  spent more than $14 billion for design, engineering, and testing activities.  In June 2008, DOE submitted a license application to the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC) for approval to construct the repository. In  July 2008, DOE reported that its best achievable date for opening the  repository, if it receives NRC approval, is in 2020. Delays in the Yucca  Mountain repository have resulted in a need for continued storage of the  waste onsite, leaving industry uncertain regarding the licensing of new  nuclear power reactors and the nation uncertain regarding a final  disposition of the waste.", "In March 2009, the Secretary of Energy testified that the administration  planned to terminate the Yucca Mountain repository. Since then, the  administration has announced plans to study alternatives to geologic  disposal at Yucca Mountain before making a decision on a future nuclear  waste management strategy, which the administration said could include  reprocessing or other complementary strategies.", "In this context, you asked us to identify key aspects of DOE\u2019s nuclear  waste management program and other possible management approaches.  Specifically, you asked us to examine (1) the key attributes, challenges,  and costs of the Yucca Mountain repository; (2) and identify alternative  nuclear waste management approaches; (3) the key attributes, challenges,  and costs of storing the nuclear waste at two centralized sites; and (4) the  key attributes, challenges, and costs of continuing to store the nuclear  waste at its current locations. The centralized storage and onsite storage  options\u2014both with disposal scenarios\u2014were the two most likely  alternative approaches identified by the experts we interviewed. We are  also providing information on what is known about sources of funding\u2014 primarily taxpayers and nuclear power rate payers\u2014for the Yucca  Mountain repository and the two alternative approaches.", "To examine the key attributes, challenges, and costs of the Yucca  Mountain repository, we obtained reports and supporting documentation  from DOE, NRC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Nuclear  Waste Technical Review Board. Specifically, we used DOE\u2019s report on the  Yucca Mountain repository\u2019s total lifecycle cost to analyze the cost for  disposing of either (1) 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste, which is the  statutory cap on the amount of waste that can be disposed of at Yucca  Mountain, or (2) 153,000 metric tons, which is the estimated total amount  of nuclear waste that has already been generated and will be generated if  all currently operating commercial reactors operate for a 60-year lifespan.  We then discounted these costs to 2009 present value.", "To identify alternative nuclear waste management approaches, we  interviewed DOE officials, experts at the National Academy of Sciences  and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and executives at the  Nuclear Energy Institute, among others. Based on their comments, we  identified two generic alternative approaches for managing this waste for  at least a 100-year period before it is disposed in a repository: storing the  nuclear waste at two centralized facilities\u2014referred to as centralized  storage\u2014and continuing to store the nuclear waste on site at their current  facilities\u2014referred to as on-site storage. To examine the key attributes,  challenges, and costs of each alternative, we asked nuclear waste  management experts from federal agencies, industry, academic  institutions, and concerned groups to comment on the attributes and  challenges of each alternative, provide relevant cost data, and comment on  the assumptions and cost components that we used to develop cost  models for the alternatives. We then used the models to produce the total  cost ranges for each alternative with and without final disposal in a  geologic repository at the end of a 100-year specific time period. In  addition, we analyzed onsite storage for longer periods than 100 years. We  analyzed costs associated with storing 70,000 metric tons and 153,000  metric tons and discounted the costs to 2009 present value.", "We did not compare the Yucca Mountain cost range to the ranges of other  alternatives because of significant differences in inherent characteristics  of these alternatives that our modeling work could not quantify. For  example, the safety, health, and environmental risks for each are very  different, which needs to be considered in the policy debate on nuclear  waste management decisions. (See app. I for additional information about  our scope and methodology, app. II for our methodology for soliciting  comments from nuclear waste management experts, and app. III for a list  of these experts.)", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2008 to October 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear waste is long-lived and very hazardous\u2014without protective  shielding, the intense radioactivity of the waste can kill a person within  minutes or cause cancer months or even decades after exposure. Thus,  careful management is required to isolate it from humans and the  environment. To accomplish this, the National Academy of Sciences first  endorsed the concept of nuclear waste disposal in deep geologic  formations in a 1957 report to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, which  has since been articulated by experts as the safest and most secure  method of permanent disposal. However, progress toward developing a  geologic repository was slow until NWPA was enacted in 1983. Citing the  potential risks of the accumulating amounts of nuclear waste, NWPA  required the federal government to take responsibility for the disposition  of nuclear waste and required DOE to develop a permanent geologic  repository to protect public health and safety and the environment for  current and future generations. Specifically, the act required DOE to study  several locations around the country for possible repository sites and  develop a contractual relationship with industry for disposal of the nuclear  waste. The Congress amended NWPA in 1987 to restrict scientific study  and characterization of a possible repository to only Yucca Mountain. (Fig.  2 shows the north crest of Yucca Mountain and a cut-out of the proposed  mined repository.)", "After the Congress approved Yucca Mountain as a suitable site for the  development of a permanent nuclear waste repository in 2002, DOE began  preparing a license application for submittal to NRC, which has regulatory  authority over commercial nuclear waste management facilities. DOE  submitted its license application to NRC in June 2008, and NRC accepted  the license application for review in September 2008. NWPA requires NRC  to complete its review of DOE\u2019s license application for the Yucca  Mountain repository in 3 years, although a fourth year is allowed if NRC  deems it necessary and complies with certain reporting requirements.", "To pay the nuclear power industry\u2019s share of the cost for the Yucca  Mountain repository, NWPA established the Nuclear Waste Fund, which is  funded by a fee of one mill (one-tenth of a cent) per kilowatt-hour of  nuclear-generated electricity that the federal government collects from  electric power companies. DOE reported that, at the end of fiscal year  2008, the Nuclear Waste Fund contained $22 billion, with an additional  $1.9 billion projected to be added in 2009. DOE receives money from the  Nuclear Waste Fund through congressional appropriations. Additional  funding for the repository comes from an appropriation which provides  for the disposal cost of DOE-managed spent nuclear fuel and high-level  waste.", "NWPA caps nuclear waste that can be disposed of at the Yucca Mountain  repository at 70,000 metric tons until a second repository is available.  However, the nation has already accumulated about 70,000 metric tons of  nuclear waste at current reactor sites and DOE facilities. Without a change  in the law to raise the cap or to allow the construction of a second  repository, DOE can dispose of only the current nuclear waste inventory.  The nation will have to develop a strategy for an additional 83,000 metric  tons of waste expected to be generated if NRC issues 20-year license  extensions to all of the currently operating nuclear reactors. This amount  does not include any nuclear waste generated by new reactors or future  defense activities, or greater than class C nuclear waste. According to  DOE and industry studies, three to four times the 70,000 metric tons\u2014and  possibly more\u2014could potentially be disposed safely in Yucca Mountain,  which could address current and some future waste inventories,  potentially delaying the need for a second repository for several  generations.", "Nuclear waste has continued to accumulate at the nation\u2019s commercial  and DOE nuclear facilities over the past 60 years. Facility managers must  actively manage the nuclear waste by continually isolating, confining, and  monitoring it to keep humans and the environment safe. Most spent  nuclear fuel is stored at reactor sites, immersed in pools of water designed  to cool and isolate it from the environment. With nowhere to dispose of  the spent nuclear fuel, the racks holding spent fuel in the pools have been  rearranged to allow for more dense storage of assemblies. Even with this  re-racking, spent nuclear fuel pools are reaching their capacities. Some  critics have expressed concern about the remote possibility of an  overcrowded spent nuclear fuel pool releasing large amounts of radiation  if an accident or other event caused the pool to lose water, potentially  leading to a fire that could disperse radioactive material. As reactor  operators have run out of space in their spent nuclear fuel pools, they have  turned in increasing number to dry cask storage systems that generally  consist of stainless steel canisters placed inside larger stainless steel or  concrete casks. (See fig. 3.) NRC requires protective shielding, routine  inspections and monitoring, and security systems to isolate the nuclear  waste to protect humans and the environment.", "NRC has determined that these dry cask storage systems can safely store  nuclear waste, but NRC considers them to be interim measures. In 1990,  NRC issued a revised waste confidence rule, stating that it had co that the waste generated by a reactor can be safely stored in either wet or  dry storage for 30 years beyond a reactor\u2019s life, including license  extensions. NRC further determined that it had reasonable assurance thate  safe geologic disposal was feasible and that a geologic repository would b operational by about 2025. More recently, NRC has published a notice of  proposed rulemaking to revise that rule, proposing that waste generated  by a reactor can be safely stored for 60 years beyond the life of a reac tor  and that geologic disposal would be available in 50 to 60 years beyond a  NRC is currently considering whether to republish its  reactor\u2019s life. proposed rule to seek additional public input on certain issues.

In addition, states that have DOE facilities with nuclear  waste storage are concerned because of possible contamination to  aquifers, rivers, and other natural resources. DOE\u2019s Hanford Reservation,  located near Richland, Washington, was a major component of the nation nuclear weapons defense program from 1943 until 1989, when operat ions  ceased. In the settlement of a lawsuit filed by the state of Washin 2003, DOE agreed not to ship certain nuclear waste to Hanford until  environmental reviews were complete. In August 2009, the U.S.  government stated that the preferred alternative in DOE\u2019s environmen review would include limitations on certain nuclear waste shipments to  Hanford until the process of immobilizing tank waste in glass begins,  tal  expected in 2019. Moreover, some commercial and DOE sites where the  nuclear waste is stored may not be able to accommodate much additional  waste safely because of limited storage space or community objections.  These sites will require a more immediate solution.", "The nation has considered proposals to build centralized storage facilities  where waste from reactor sites could be consolidated. The 1987  amendment to NWPA established the Office of the Nuclear Waste  Negotiator to try to broker an agreement for a community to host a  repository or interim storage facility. Two negotiators worked with local  communities and Native American tribes for several years, but neither was  able to conclude a proposed agreement with a willing community by  January 1995, when the office\u2019s authority expired. Subsequently, in 2006  after a 9-year licensing process, a consortium of electric power companies  called Private Fuel Storage obtained a NRC license for a private  centralized storage facility on the reservation of the Skull Valley Band of  the Goshute Indians in Utah. NRC\u2019s 20-year license\u2014with an option for an  additional 20 years\u2014allows storage of up to 40,000 metric tons of  commercial spent nuclear fuel. However, construction of the Private Fuel  Storage facility has been delayed by Department of the Interior decisions  not to approve the lease of tribal lands to Private Fuel Storage and  declining to issue the necessary rights-of-way to transport nuclear waste to  the facility through Bureau of Land Management land. Private Fuel Storage  and the Skull Valley Band of Goshutes filed a federal lawsuit in 2007 to  overturn Interior\u2019s decisions.", "Reprocessing nuclear waste could potentially reduce, but not eliminate,  the amount of waste for disposal. In reprocessing, usable uranium and  plutonium are recovered from spent nuclear fuel and are used to make  new fuel rods. However, current reprocessing technologies separate  weapons usable plutonium and other fissionable materials from the spent  nuclear fuel, raising concerns about nuclear proliferation by terrorists or  enemy states. Although the United States pioneered the reprocessing  technologies used by other countries, such as France and Russia,  presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter ended government support for  commercial reprocessing in the United States in 1976 and 1977,  respectively, primarily due to proliferation concerns. Although President  Ronald Reagan lifted the ban on government support in 1981, the nation  has not embarked on any reprocessing program due to proliferation and  cost concerns\u2014the Congressional Budget Office recently reported that  current reprocessing technologies are more expensive than direct disposal  of the waste in a geologic repository. DOE\u2019s Fuel Cycle Research and  Development program is currently performing research in reprocessing  technologies that would not separate out weapons usable plutonium, but it  is not certain whether these technologies will become cost-effective.", "The general consensus of the international scientific community is that  geologic disposal is the preferred long-term nuclear waste management  alternative. Finland, Sweden, Canada, France, and Switzerland have  decided to construct geologic disposal facilities, but none have yet  completed any such facility, although DOE reports that Finland and  Sweden have announced plans to begin emplacement operations in 2020  and 2023, respectively. Moreover, some countries employ a mix of  complementary storage alternatives in their national waste management  strategies, including on-site storage, consolidated interim storage,  reprocessing, and geologic disposal. For example, Sweden plans to rely on  on-site storage until the waste cools enough to move it to a centralized  storage facility, where the waste will continue to cool and decay for an  additional 30 years. This waste will then be placed in a geologic repository  for disposal. France reprocesses the spent nuclear fuel, recycling usable  portions as new fuel and storing the remainder for eventual disposal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Yucca Mountain Repository Would Provide a Permanent Solution for Nuclear Waste, but Its Implementation Faces Challenges and Significant Upfront Costs", "paragraphs": ["The Yucca Mountain repository\u2014mandated by NWPA, as amended\u2014 would provide a permanent nuclear waste management solution for the  nation\u2019s current inventory of about 70,000 metric tons of waste. According  to DOE and industry studies, the repository potentially could be a disposal  site for three to four times that amount of waste. However, the repository  lacks the support of the administration and the state of Nevada, and faces  regulatory and other challenges. Our analysis of DOE\u2019s cost projections  found that the Yucca Mountain repository would cost from $41 billion to  $67 billion (in 2009 present value) for disposing of 153,000 metric tons of  nuclear waste. Most of these costs are up-front capital costs. However,  once the Yucca Mountain repository is closed\u2014in 2151 for our 153,000- metric-ton model\u2014it is not expected to incur any significant additional  costs, according to DOE."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "As Designed, the Yucca Mountain Repository Would Be a Permanent Solution and Would Reduce the Uncertainty Associated with Future Nuclear Waste Safety", "paragraphs": ["The Yucca Mountain repository is designed to isolate nuclear waste in a  safe and secure environment long enough for the waste to degrade into a  form that is less harmful to humans and the environment. As nuclear  waste ages, it cools and decays, becoming less radiologically dangerous. In  October 2008, after years of legal challenges, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated standards that require DOE to  ensure that radioactive releases from the nuclear waste disposed of at  Yucca Mountain do not harm the public for 1 million years. This is  because some waste components, such as plutonium 239, take hundreds of  thousands of years to decay into less harmful materials. To meet EPA\u2019s  standards and keep the waste safely isolated, DOE\u2019s license application  proposes the use of both natural and engineered barriers. Key natural  barriers of Yucca Mountain include its dry climate, the depth and isolation  of the Death Valley aquifer in which the mountain resides, its natural  physical shape, and the layers of thick rock above and below the  repository that lie 1,000 feet below the surface of the mountain and 1,000  feet above the water table. Key engineered barriers include the solid  nature of the nuclear waste; the double-shelled transportation, aging, and  disposal canisters that encapsulate the waste and prevent radiation  leakage; and drip shields that are composed of corrosion-resistant  titanium to ward off any dripping water inside the repository for many  thousands of years.", "The construction of a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain would  provide a permanent solution for nuclear waste that could allow the  government to begin taking possession of the nuclear waste in the near  term\u2014about 10 to 30 years. The nuclear power industry sees this as an  important consideration in obtaining the public support necessary to build  new nuclear power reactors. The industry is interested in constructing  new nuclear power reactors because, among other reasons, of the growing  demand for electricity and pressure from federal and state governments to  reduce reliance on fossil fuels and curtail carbon emissions. Some electric  power companies see nuclear energy as an important option for  noncarbon emitting power generation. According to NRC, 18 electric  power companies have filed license applications to construct 29 new  nuclear reactors. Nuclear industry representatives, however, have  expressed concerns that investors and the public will not support the  construction of new nuclear power reactors without a final safe and  secure disposition pathway for the nuclear waste, particularly if that waste  is generated and stored near major waterways or urban centers. Moreover,  having a permanent disposal option may allow reactor operators to thin- out spent nuclear fuel assemblies from densely packed spent fuel pools,  potentially reducing the risk of harm to humans or the environment in the  event of an accident, natural disaster, or terrorist event.", "In addition, disposal is the only alternative for some DOE and commercial  nuclear waste\u2014even if the United States decided to reprocess the waste\u2014 because it contains nuclear waste residues that cannot be used as nuclear  reactor fuel. This nuclear waste has no safe, long-term alternative other  than disposal, and the Yucca Mountain repository would provide a near- term, permanent disposal pathway for it. Moreover, DOE has agreed to  remove spent nuclear fuel from at least two states by certain dates or face  penalties. Specifically, DOE has an agreement with Colorado stating that if  the spent nuclear fuel at Fort St. Vrain is not removed by January 1, 2035,  the government will, subject to certain conditions, pay the state $15,000  per day until the waste is removed. In addition, the state of Idaho sued  DOE to remove inventories of spent nuclear fuel stored at DOE\u2019s Idaho  National Laboratory. Under the resulting settlement DOE agreed to (1)  remove the spent nuclear fuel by January 1, 2035, or incur penalties of  $60,000 per day and (2) curtail or suspend future shipments of spent  nuclear fuel to Idaho. Some of the spent nuclear fuel stored at the Idaho  National Laboratory comes from refueling the U.S. Navy\u2019s submarines and  aircraft carriers, all of which are nuclear powered. Special facilities are  maintained at the Idaho National Laboratory to examine naval spent  nuclear fuel to obtain information for improving future fuel performance  and to package the spent nuclear fuel following examination to make it  ready for rail shipment to its ultimate destination. According to Navy  officials, refueling these warships, which necessitates shipment of naval  spent nuclear fuel from the shipyards conducting the refuelings to the  Idaho National Laboratory, is part of the Navy\u2019s national security mission.  Consequently, curtailing or suspending shipments of spent nuclear fuel to  Idaho raises national security concerns for the Navy.", "The Yucca Mountain repository would help the government fulfill its  obligation under NWPA to electric power companies and ratepayers to  take custody of the commercial spent nuclear fuel and provide a  permanent repository using the Nuclear Waste Fund. When DOE missed  its 1998 deadline to begin taking custody of the waste, owners of spent fuel  with contracts for disposal services filed lawsuits asking the courts to  require DOE to fulfill its statutory and contractual obligations by taking  custody of the waste. Though a court decided that it would not order DOE  to begin taking custody of the waste, the courts have, in subsequent cases,  ordered the government to compensate the utilities for the cost of storing  the waste. DOE projected that, based on a 2020 date for beginning  operations at Yucca Mountain, the government\u2019s liabilities from the 71  lawsuits filed by electric power companies could sum to about $12.3  billion, though the outcome of pending and future litigation could  substantially affect the ultimate total liability. DOE estimates that the  federal government\u2019s future liabilities will average up to $500 million per  year. Furthermore, continued delays in DOE\u2019s ability to take custody of  the waste could result in additional liabilities. Some experts noted that  without immediate plans for a permanent repository, reactor operators  and ratepayers may demand that the Nuclear Waste Fund be refunded.", "Finally, disposing of the nuclear waste now in a repository facility would  reduce the uncertainty about the willingness or the ability of future  generations to monitor and maintain multiple surface waste storage  facilities and would eliminate the need for any future handling of the  waste. As a 2001 report of the National Academies noted, continued  storage of nuclear waste is technically feasible only if those responsible  for it are willing and able to devote adequate resources and attention to  maintaining and expanding the storage facilities, as required to keep the  waste safe and secure. DOE officials noted that the waste packages at  Yucca Mountain are designed to be retrievable for more than 100 years  after emplacement, at which time DOE would begin to close the  repository, allowing future generations to consider retrieving spent  nuclear fuel for reprocessing or other uses. However, the risks and costs  of retrieving the nuclear waste from Yucca Mountain are uncertain  because planning efforts for retrieval are preliminary. Once closed, Yucca  Mountain will require minimal monitoring and little or no maintenance,  and all future controls will be passive.

First, in March 2009, the Secretary of Energy stated that the  administration planned to terminate the Yucca Mountain repository and to  form a panel of experts to review alternatives. During the testimony, the  Secretary stated that Yucca Mountain would not be considered as one of  the alternatives. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget request for  Yucca Mountain was $197 million, which is $296 million less than what  DOE stated it needs to stay on its schedule and open Yucca Mountain by  2020.", "In July 2009 letters to DOE, the Nuclear Energy Institute and the National  Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners raised concerns that,  despite the announced termination of Yucca Mountain, DOE still intended  on collecting fees for the Nuclear Waste Fund. The letters requested that  DOE suspend collection of payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund. Some  states have raised similar concerns and legislators have introduced  legislation that could hold payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund until DOE  begins operating a federal repository.", "Nevertheless, NWPA still requires DOE to pursue geologic disposal at  Yucca Mountain.

For example, NRC\u2019s  regulations require that DOE model its natural and engineered barriers in a  performance assessment, including how the barriers will interact with  each other over time and how the repository will meet the standards even  if one or more barriers do not perform as expected. NRC has stated that  there are uncertainties inherent in the understanding of the performance  of the natural and engineered barriers and that demonstrating a  reasonable expectation of compliance requires the use of complex  predictive models supported by field data, laboratory tests, site-specific  monitoring, and natural analog studies. The Nuclear Waste Technical  Review Board has also stated that the performance assessment may be  \u201cthe most complex and ambitious probabilistic risk assessment ever  undertaken\u201d and the Board, as well as other groups or individuals, have  raised technical concerns about key aspects of the engineered or natural  barriers in the repository design.", "DOE and NRC officials also stated that budget constraints raise additional  challenges. DOE officials told us that past budget shortfalls and projected  future low budgets for the Yucca Mountain repository create significant  challenges in DOE\u2019s ability to meet milestones for licensing and for  responding to NRC\u2019s requests for additional information related to the  license application. In addition, NRC officials told us budget shortfalls  have constrained their resources. Staff members they originally hired to  review DOE\u2019s license application have moved to other divisions within  NRC or have left NRC entirely. NRC officials stated that the pace of the  license review is commensurate with funding levels. Some experts have  questioned whether NRC can meet the maximum 4-year time requirement  stipulated in NWPA for license review and have pointed out that the longer  the delays in licensing Yucca Mountain, the more costly and politically  vulnerable the effort becomes.", "In addition, the state of Nevada and other groups that oppose the Yucca  Mountain repository have raised technical points, site-specific concerns,  and equity issues and have taken steps to delay or terminate the  repository. For example, Nevada\u2019s Agency for Nuclear Projects questioned  DOE\u2019s reliance on engineered barriers in its performance assessment,  indicating that too many uncertainties exist for DOE to claim human-made  systems will perform as expected over the time frames required. In  addition, the agency reported that Yucca Mountain\u2019s location near seismic  and volcanic zones creates additional uncertainty about DOE\u2019s ability to  predict a recurrence of seismic or volcanic events and to assess the  performance of its waste isolation barriers should those events occur  some time during the 1-million-year time frame. The agency also has  questioned whether Yucca Mountain is the best site compared with other  locations and has raised issues of equity, since Nevada is being asked to  accept nuclear waste generated in other states. In addition to the Agency  for Nuclear Projects\u2019 issues, Nevada has taken other steps to delay or  terminate the project. For example, Nevada has denied the water rights  DOE needs for construction of a rail spur and facility structures at Yucca  Mountain. DOE officials told us that constructing the rail line or the  facilities at Yucca Mountain without those water rights will be difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Based on DOE\u2019s Cost Estimates, Yucca Mountain Will Likely Cost from $41 Billion to $67 Billion for 153,000 Metric Tons of Nuclear Waste, but Costs Could Increase", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of DOE\u2019s cost estimates found that (1) a 70,000 metric ton  repository is projected to cost from $27 to $39 billion in 2009 present value  over 108 years and (2) a 153,000 metric ton repository is projected to cost  from $41 to $67 billion and take 35 more years to complete. These  estimated costs include the licensing, construction, operation, and closure  of Yucca Mountain for a period commensurate with the amount of waste.  Table 1 shows each scenario with its estimated cost range over time.", "As shown in figure 4, the Yucca Mountain repository costs are expected to  be high during construction, followed by reduced, but consistent costs  during operations, substantially reduced costs for monitoring, then a  period of increased costs for installation of the drip shields, and finally  costs tapering off for closure. Once the drip shields are installed, by  design, the waste packages will no longer be retrievable. After closure,  Yucca Mountain is not expected to incur any significant additional costs.", "Costs for the construction of a repository, regardless of location, could  increase based on a number of different scenarios, including delays in  license application, funding shortfalls, and legal or technical issues that  cause delays or changes in plans. For example, we asked DOE to assess  the cost of a year\u2019s delay in license application approval from the current 3  years to 4 years, the maximum allowed by NWPA. DOE officials told us  that each year of delay would cost DOE about $373 million in constant  2009 dollars. Although the experts with whom we consulted did not agree  on how long the licensing process for Yucca Mountain might take, several  experts told us that the 9 years it took Private Fuel Storage to obtain its  license was not unreasonable. This licensing time frame may not directly  apply to the Yucca Mountain repository because the repository has a  significantly different licensing process and regulatory scheme, including  extensive pre-licensing interactions, a federal funding stream, and an  extended compliance period and, because of the uncertainties, could take  shorter or longer than the Private Fuel Storage experience. A nine-year  licensing process for construction authorization would add an estimated  $2.2 billion to the cost of the repository, mostly in costs to maintain  current systems, such as project support, safeguards and security, and its  licensing support network. In addition to consideration of the issuance of  a construction authorization, NRC\u2019s repository licensing process involves  two additional licensing actions necessary to operate and close a  repository, each of which allows for public input and could potentially  adversely affect the schedule and cost of the repository. The second action  is the consideration of an updated DOE application for a license to receive  and possess high-level radioactive waste. The third action is the  consideration of a DOE application for a license amendment to  permanently close the repository. Costs could also increase if unforeseen  technical issues developed. For example, some experts told us that the  robotic emplacement of waste packages could be difficult because of the  heat and radiation output from the nuclear waste, which could impact the  electronics on the machinery. DOE officials acknowledged the challenges  and told us the machines would have to be shielded for protection. They  noted, however, that industry has experience with remote handling of  shielded robotic machinery and DOE should be able to use that experience  in developing its own machinery.", "The responsibility for Yucca Mountain\u2019s costs would come from the  Nuclear Waste Fund and taxpayers through annual appropriations. NWPA  created the Nuclear Waste Fund as a mechanism for the nuclear power  industry to pay for its share of the cost for building and operating a  permanent repository to dispose of nuclear waste. NWPA also required the  federal taxpayers to pay for the portion of permanent repository costs for  DOE-managed spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE has  responsibility for determining on an annual basis whether fees charged to  industry to finance the Nuclear Waste Fund are sufficient to meet  industry\u2019s share of costs. As part of that process, DOE developed a  methodology in 1989 that uses the total system life cycle cost estimate as  input for determining the shares of industry and the federal government by  matching projected costs against projected assets. The most recent  published assessment, published in July 2008, showed that 80.4 percent of  the disposal costs would come from the Nuclear Waste Fund and 19.6  percent would come from appropriations for the DOE-managed spent  nuclear fuel and high-level waste.", "In addition, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s judgment fund will pay the  government\u2019s liabilities for not taking custody of the nuclear waste in 1998,  as required by DOE\u2019s contract with industry. Based on existing judgments  and settlements, DOE has estimated these costs at $12.3 billion through  2020 and up to $500 million per year after that, though the outcome of  pending litigation could substantially affect the government\u2019s ultimate  liability.

We also reviewed documents they provided  or referred us to.", "Based on this information, we chose to analyze (1) centralized interim dry  storage and (2) on-site dry storage (both interim and long-term).  Centralized storage has been attempted to varying degrees in the United  States, and on-site storage has become the country\u2019s status quo.  Consequently, the experts believe these two alternatives are currently  among the most likely for this country in the near-term, in conjunction  with final disposal in the long-term. The experts also told us that current  nuclear waste reprocessing technologies raise proliferation concerns and  are not considered commercially feasible, but they noted that reprocessing  has future potential as a part of the nation\u2019s nuclear waste management  strategy. Because nuclear waste is not reprocessed in this country, we  found a lack of sufficient and reliable data to provide meaningful analysis  for this alternative. Experts have largely dismissed other alternatives that  have been identified, such as disposal of waste in deep boreholes, because  of cost or technical constraints.", "We developed a set of key assumptions to establish the scope of our  alternatives by initially consulting with a small group of nuclear waste  management experts. For example, we asked the experts about how many  storage sites should be used and whether waste would have to be  repackaged. These discussions occurred in an iterative manner\u2014we  followed up with experts with specific expertise to refine our assumptions  as we learned more. Based on this input, we formulated several key  assumptions and defined the alternatives in a generic manner by taking  into account some, but not all, of the complexities involved with nuclear  waste management (see table 2). We made this choice because experts  advised us that trying to consider all of the variability among reactor sites  would result in unmanageable models since each location where nuclear  waste is currently stored has a unique set of environmental, management,  and regulatory considerations that affect the logistics and costs of waste  management. For example, reactor sites use different dry cask storage  systems with varying costs that require different operating logistics to load  the casks.", "In addition, there were some instances in which we made assumptions  that, while not entirely realistic, were necessary to keep our alternatives  generic and distinct from one another. For example, some electric power  companies would likely consolidate nuclear waste from different locations  by transporting it between reactor sites, but to keep the on-site storage  alternative generic and distinct from the centralized storage alternative,  we assumed that there would be no consolidation of waste. These  simplifying assumptions make our alternatives hypothetical and not  entirely representative of their real-world implementation.", "We also consulted with experts to formulate more specific assumptions  about processes that reflect the sequence of activities that would occur  within each alternative (see fig. 5). In addition, we identified the  components of these processes that have associated costs. For example,  one of the processes associated with both alternatives is packaging the  nuclear waste in dry storage canisters from the pools of water where they  are stored. The component costs associated with this process include the  dry storage canisters and operations to load the spent nuclear fuel into the  canisters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "We Developed Cost Ranges for Each Alternative Using Models Large-scale Cost that Addressed Uncertainties and Discounted Future Costs", "paragraphs": ["To generate cost ranges for the centralized storage and on-site storage  alternatives, we developed four large-scale cost models that analyzed the  costs for each alternative of storing 70,000 metric tons and 153,000 metric  tons of nuclear waste and created scenarios within these models to  analyze different storage durations and final dispositions. (See table 3.) We  generated cost ranges for each alternative for storing 153,000 metric tons  of waste for 100 years followed by disposal in a geologic repository. We  also generated cost ranges for each alternative of storing 70,000 metric  tons and 153,000 metric tons of nuclear waste for 100 years, and for  storing 153,000 metric tons of waste on site for 500 years without including  the cost of subsequent disposal in a geologic repository. For each of the  models, which rely upon data and assumptions provided by nuclear waste  management experts, the cost range was based on the annual volume of  commercial spent nuclear fuel that became ready to be packaged and  stored in each year. In general, each model started in 2009 by annually  tracking costs of initial packaging and related costs for the first 100 years  and for every 100 years thereafter if the waste was to remain on site and  be repackaged. Since our models analyzed only the costs associated with  storing commercial nuclear waste management, we augmented them with  DOE\u2019s cost data for (1) managing its spent nuclear fuel and high-level  waste and (2) constructing and operating a permanent repository.  Specifically, we used DOE\u2019s estimated costs for the Yucca Mountain  repository to represent cost for a hypothetical permanent repository.", "One of the inherent difficulties of analyzing the cost of any nuclear waste  management alternative is the large number of uncertainties that need to  be addressed. In addition to general uncertainty about the future, there is  uncertainty because of the lack of knowledge about the waste  management technologies required, the type of waste and waste  management systems that individual reactors will eventually employ, and  cost components that are key inputs to the models and could occur over  hundreds or thousands of years. Given these numerous uncertainties, it is  not possible to precisely determine the total costs of each alternative.  However, much of the uncertainty that we could not easily capture within  our models can be addressed through the use of several alternative models  and scenarios. As shown in table 3, we developed two models for each  alternative to address the uncertainty regarding the total volume of waste  for disposal. We then developed different scenarios within each model to  address different time frames and disposal paths. Furthermore, we used a  risk analysis modeling technique that recognized and addressed  uncertainties in our data and assumptions. Given the different possible  scenarios and uncertainties, we generated ranges, rather than point  estimates, for analyzing the cost of each alternative.", "One of the most important uncertainties in our analysis was uncertainty  over component costs. To address this, we used a commercially available  risk analysis software program that enabled us to model specific  uncertainties associated with a large number of cost inputs and  assumptions. Using a Monte Carlo simulation process, the program  explores a wide range of values, instead of one single value, for each cost  input and estimates the total cost. By repeating the calculations thousands  of times with a different set of randomly chosen input values, the process  produces a range of total costs for each alternative and scenario. The  process also specifies the likelihood associated with values in the  estimated range.", "Another inherent difficulty in estimating the cost of nuclear waste  management alternatives is the fact that the costs are spread over  hundreds or thousands of years. The economic concept of discounting is  central to such long-term analysis because it allows us to convert costs  that occur in the distant future to present value\u2014equivalent values in  today\u2019s dollars. Although the concept of discounting is an accepted and  standard methodology in economics, the concept of discounting values  over a very distant future\u2014known as \u201cintergenerational discounting\u201d\u2014is  still subject to considerable debate. Furthermore, no consensus exists  among economists regarding the exact value of the discount rate that  should be used to discount values that are spread over many hundreds or  thousands of years.", "To develop an appropriate discounting methodology and to choose the  discount rates for our analysis, we reviewed a number of economic studies  published in peer-reviewed journals that addressed intergenerational  discounting. Based on our review, we designed a discounting methodology  for use in our models. Because our review did not find a consensus on  discount rates, we used a range of values for discount rates that we  developed based on the economic studies we reviewed, rather than using  one single rate. Consequently, because we used ranges for the discount  rate along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, the present value of  estimated costs does not depend on one single discount rate, but rather  reflect a range of discount rate values taken from peer-reviewed studies.

In addition, centralized storage faces several implementation  challenges including that DOE (1) lacks statutory authority to provide  centralized storage under NWPA, (2) is expected to have difficulty finding  a location willing to host a centralized storage facility, and (3) faces  potential transportation risks. The estimated cost of implementing  centralized storage for 100 years ranges from $15 billion to $29 billion for  153,000 metric tons of nuclear waste, and the total cost ranges from $23  billion to $81 billion if the nuclear waste is centrally stored and then  disposed in a geologic repository."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Centralized Storage Would Provide a Near-Term Alternative to Managing Nuclear Waste but Does Not Eliminate the Need for Final Disposal", "paragraphs": ["As the administration re-examines the Yucca Mountain repository and  national nuclear waste policy, centralized dry cask storage could provide a  near-term alternative for managing the waste that has accumulated and  will continue to accumulate.

For example,  centralized storage would maintain nuclear waste in interim dry storage  configurations so that it could be easily accessible for reprocessing in case  the nation decided to pursue reprocessing as a waste management option  and developed technologies that address current proliferation and cost  concerns. In fact, reprocessing facilities could be built near or adjacent to  centralized facilities to maximize efficiencies. However, even with  reprocessing, some of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste in  current inventories would require final disposal.", "Centralized storage would consolidate the nation\u2019s nuclear waste after  reactors are decommissioned, thereby decreasing the complexity of  securing and overseeing the waste and increasing the efficiency of waste  storage operations. This alternative would remove nuclear waste from all  DOE sites and nine shutdown reactor sites that have no operations other  than nuclear waste storage, allowing these sites to be closed. Some of  these storage sites occupy land that potentially could be used for other  purposes, imposing an opportunity cost on states and communities that no  longer receive the benefits of electricity generation from the reactors. To  compensate for this loss, industry officials noted that at least two states  where decommissioned sites are located have tried to raise property taxes  on the sites, and at one site, the state collects a per cask fee for storage. In  addition, the continued storage of nuclear waste at decommissioned sites  can cost the power companies between about $4 million and $8 million per  year, according to several experts.", "Centralized storage could allow reactor operators to thin-out spent nuclear  fuel assemblies from densely packed spent fuel pools and may also  prevent operating reactors from having to build the additional dry storage  capacity they would need if the nuclear waste remained on site. According  to an industry official, 28 reactor sites could have to add dry storage  facilities over the next 10 years in order to maintain a desired capacity in  their storage pools. These dry storage facilities could cost about $30  million each, but this cost would vary widely by site. In addition, some  current reactor sites use older waste storage systems and are near large  cities or large bodies of fresh water used for drinking or irrigation.  Although NRC\u2019s licensing and inspection process is designed to ensure  that these existing facilities appropriately protect public health and safety,  new centralized facilities could use state-of-the-art design technology and  be located in remote areas with fewer environmental hazards, in order to  protect public health and enhance safety.", "Finally, if DOE uses centralized facilities to store commercial spent  nuclear fuel, this alternative could allow DOE to fulfill its obligation to  take custody of the commercial spent nuclear fuel until a long-term  strategy is implemented. As a result, DOE could curtail its liabilities to the  electric power companies, potentially saving the government up to $500  million per year after 2020, as estimated by DOE. The actual impact of  centralized storage on the amount of the liabilities would depend on  several factors, including when centralized storage is available, whether  reactor sites had already built on-site dry storage facilities for which the  government may be liable for a portion of the costs, how soon waste could  be transported to a centralized site, and the outcome of pending litigation  that may affect the government\u2019s total liability. DOE estimates that if  various complex statutory, regulatory, siting, construction, and financial  issues were expeditiously resolved, a centralized facility to accept nuclear  waste could begin operations as early as 6 years after its development  began. However, a centralized storage expert estimated that the process  from site selection until a centralized facility opens could take between 17  and 33 years.", "Although centralized storage has a number of positive attributes, it  provides only an interim alternative and does not eliminate the need for  final disposal of the nuclear waste. To keep the waste safe and secure, a  centralized storage facility relies on active institutional controls, such as  monitoring, maintenance, and security. Over time, the storage systems  may degrade and institutional controls may be disrupted, which could  result in increased risk of radioactive exposure to humans or the  environment. For example, according to several experts on dry cask  systems, the vents on the casks\u2014which allow for passive cooling\u2014must  be periodically inspected to ensure no debris clogs them, particularly  during the first several decades when the spent nuclear fuel is thermally  hot. If the vents become clogged, the temperature in the canister could  rise, which could impact the life of the dry cask storage system. Over a  longer time frame, concrete on the exterior casks could degrade, requiring  more active maintenance. Although some experts stated that the risk of  radiation being released into the environment may be low, such risks can  be avoided by permanently isolating the waste in a manner that does not  require indefinite, active institutional controls, such as disposal in a  geologic repository."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal and Community Challenges Contribute to the Complexity of Implementing Centralized Storage", "paragraphs": ["A key challenge confronting the centralized storage alternative is the lack  of authority under NWPA for DOE to provide such storage. Provisions in  NWPA that allow DOE to arrange for centralized storage have either  expired or are unusable because they are tied to milestones in repository  development that have not been met. For example, NWPA authorized DOE  to provide temporary storage for a limited amount of spent nuclear fuel  until a repository was available, but this authority expired in 1990. Some  industry representatives have stated that DOE still has the authority to  accept and store spent nuclear fuel under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,  as amended, but DOE asserts that NWPA limits its authority under the  Atomic Energy Act. In addition, NWPA provided authority for DOE to  site, construct, and operate a centralized storage facility, but such a facility  could not be constructed until NRC authorized construction of the Yucca  Mountain repository, and the facility could only store up to 10,000 metric  tons of nuclear waste until the repository started accepting spent nuclear  fuel. Therefore, unless provisions in NWPA were amended, centralized  storage would have to be funded, owned, and operated privately. A  privately operated centralized storage facility alternative, such as the  proposed Private Fuel Storage Facility in Utah, would not likely resolve  DOE\u2019s liabilities with the nuclear power companies.", "A second, equally important, challenge to centralized storage is the  likelihood of opposition during site selection for a facility. Experts noted  that affected states and communities would raise concerns about safety,  security, and the likelihood that an interim centralized storage facility  could become a de facto permanent storage site if progress is not being  made on a permanent repository. Even if a local community supports a  centralized storage facility, the state may not. For example, the Private  Fuel Storage facility was generally supported by the Skull Valley Band of  the Goshute Indians, on whose reservation the facility was to be located,  but the state of Utah and some tribal members opposed its licensing and  construction. Other states have indicated their opposition to involuntarily  hosting a centralized facility through means such as the Western  Governors\u2019 Association, which issued a resolution stating that \u201cno such  facility, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be located within the  geographic boundaries of a Western state without the written consent of  the governor.\u201d Some experts noted that a state or community may be  willing to serve as a host if substantial economic incentives were offered  and if the party building the site undertook a time-consuming and  expensive process of site characterization and safety assessment.  However, DOE officials stated that in their previous experience\u2014such as  with the Nuclear Waste Negotiator about 15 to 20 years ago\u2014they have  found no incentive package that has successfully encouraged a state to  voluntarily host a site.", "A third challenge to centralized storage is that nuclear waste would likely  have to be transported twice\u2014once to the centralized site and once to a  permanent repository\u2014if a centralized site were not colocated with a  repository. Therefore, the total distance over which nuclear waste is  transported is likely to be greater than with other alternatives, an  important factor because, according to one expert, transportation risk is  directly tied to this distance. However, according to DOE, nuclear waste  has been safely transported in the United States since the 1960s and  National Academy of Sciences, NRC, and DOE-sponsored reports have  found that the associated risks are well understood and generally low. Yet,  there are also perceived risks associated with nuclear waste  transportation that can result in lower property values along  transportation routes, reductions in tourism, and increased anxiety that  create community opposition to nuclear waste transportation. According  to experts, transportation risks could be mitigated through such means as  shipping the least radioactive fuel first, using trains that only transport  nuclear waste, and identifying routes that minimize possible impacts on  highly populated areas. In addition, the hazards associated with  transportation from a centralized facility to a repository would decline as  the waste decayed and became less radioactive at the centralized facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Ranges for Centralized Storage Will Vary Depending on Waste Volume and Final Disposition", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 4, our models generated cost ranges from $23 billion to  $81 billion for the centralized storage of 153,000 metric tons of spent  nuclear fuel and high-level waste for 100 years followed by geologic  disposal. For centralized storage without disposal, costs would range from  $12 billion to $20 billion for 70,000 metric tons of waste and from $15  billion to $29 billion for 153,000 metric tons of waste. These centralized  model scenarios include the cost of on-site operations required to package  and prepare the waste for transportation, such as storing the waste in dry- cask storage until it is transported off site, developing and operating a  system to transport the waste to centralized storage, and constructing and  operating two centralized storage facilities. (See app. IV for information  about our modeling methodology, assumptions, and results.)", "Actual centralized storage costs may be more or less than these cost  ranges if a different centralized storage scenario is implemented. For  example, our models assume that there would be two centralized facilities,  but licensing, construction, and operations and maintenance costs would  be greater if there were more than two facilities and lower if there was  only one facility. Some experts told us that centralized storage would  likely be implemented with only one facility because it would be too  difficult to site two. But other experts noted that having more sites could  reduce the number of miles traveled by the waste and provide a greater  degree of geographic equity. The length of time the nuclear waste is stored  could also impact the cost ranges, particularly if the nuclear waste were  stored for less than or more than the time period assumed in our model.  For periods longer than 100 years, experts told us that the dry storage cask  systems may be subject to degradation and require repackaging,  substantially raising the costs, as well as the level of uncertainty in those  costs. Transportation is another area where costs could vary if, for  example, transportation was not by rail or if the transportation system  differed significantly from what is assumed in our models.", "Furthermore, costs could be outside our ranges if the final disposition of  the waste is different. Our scenario that includes geologic disposal is  based on the current cost projections for Yucca Mountain, but these costs  could be significantly different for another repository site or if much of the  nuclear waste is reprocessed. A different geologic repository would have  unique site characterization costs, may use an entirely different design  than Yucca Mountain, and may be more or less difficult to build. Also,  reprocessing could contribute significantly to the cost of an alternative.", "For example, we previously reported that construction of a reprocessing  plant with an annual production throughput of 3,000 metric tons of spent  nuclear fuel could cost about $44 billion. Studies analyzed by the  Congressional Budget Office estimate that once a reprocessing plant is  constructed, spent nuclear fuel could be reprocessed at between $610,000  and $1.4 million per-metric-ton, when adjusted to 2009 constant dollars.  This would result in an annual cost of about $2 billion to $4 billion,  assuming a throughput of 3,000 metric tons per year.", "Finally, the actual cost of implementing one of our centralized storage  scenarios would likely be higher than our estimated ranges indicate  because our models omit several location-specific costs. These costs could  not be quantified in our generic models because we did not make an  assumption about the specific location of the centralized facilities. For  example, a few experts noted that incentives may be given a state or  locality as a basis for allowing a centralized facility to be built, but the  incentive amount may vary from location to location based on what  agreement is reached. Also, several experts said that rail construction may  be required for some locations, which could add significant cost  depending on the distance of new rail line required at a specific location.  Experts could not provide data for these location-dependent costs to any  degree of certainty, so we did not use them in our models. Also, the  funding source for government-run centralized storage is unclear. The  Nuclear Waste Fund, which electric power companies pay into, was  established by NWPA to fund a permanent repository and cannot be used  to pay for centralized storage without amending the act.

Some experts believe that legal,  community, and technical challenges associated with on-site storage will  intensify as the waste remains on site without plans for final disposition  because, for example, communities are more likely to oppose  recertification of on-site storage. The estimated cost to continue storing  153,000 metric tons of nuclear waste on site for 100 years range from $13  billion to $34 billion, and total costs would range from $20 billion to $97  billion if the nuclear waste is stored on site for 100 years and then  disposed in a geologic repository."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "On-Site Storage Would Require Minimal Near- Term Logistics and Provide Time to Decide on Long- Term Waste Management Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Because of delays in the Yucca Mountain repository, on-site storage has  continued as the nation\u2019s strategy for managing nuclear waste, thus its  continuation would require minimal near-term effort and allow time for  the nation to consider alternative long-term nuclear waste management  options. This alternative maintains the waste in a configuration where it is  readily retrievable for reprocessing or other disposition, according to an  expert. However, like centralized storage, on-site storage is an interim  strategy that relies on active institutional controls, such as monitoring,  maintenance, and security. To permanently isolate the waste from humans  and the environment without the need for active institutional controls  some form of final disposal would be required, even if some of the waste  were reprocessed.", "The additional time in on-site storage may also make the waste safer to  handle because older spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste has had a  chance to cool and become less radioactive. As a result, on-site storage  could reduce transportation risks, particularly in the near-term, since the  nuclear waste would be cooler and less radioactive when it is finally  transported to a repository. In addition, some experts state that older,  cooler waste may provide more predictability in repository performance  and be some degree safer than younger, hotter waste. However, NRC  cautioned that the ability to handle the waste more safely in the future also  depends on other factors, including how the waste or waste packages  might degrade over time. In particular, NRC stated that there are many  uncertainties with the behavior of spent nuclear fuel as it ages, such as  potential fracturing of the structural assemblies, possibly increasing the  risks of release. If the waste has to be repackaged, for example, the  process may require additional safety measures. Some experts noted that  continuing to store nuclear waste on site would be more equitable than  consolidating it in one or a few areas. As a result, the waste, along with its  associated risks, would be kept in the location where the electrical power  was generated, leaving the responsibility and risks of the waste in the  communities that benefited from its generation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On-Site Storage Poses Legal, Community, and Technical Challenges that Are Likely to Intensify over Time", "paragraphs": ["With on-site storage of DOE-managed spent nuclear fuel and high-level  waste, DOE would have difficulty meeting enforceable agreements with  states, which could result in significant costs being incurred the longer  spent nuclear fuel remains on site. In addition to Idaho\u2019s agreement to  impose a penalty of $60,000 per day if spent nuclear fuel is not removed  from the state by 2035, DOE has an agreement with Colorado stating that if  the spent fuel at Fort St. Vrain is not removed by January 1, 2035, the  government will, subject to certain conditions, pay the state $15,000 per  day until it is removed. Other states where DOE spent nuclear fuel and  high-level waste are currently stored may seek similar penalties if the  spent fuel and waste remain on-site with no progress toward a permanent  repository or centralized storage facility.", "A second challenge is the cost due to the government\u2019s possible legal  liabilities to commercial reactor operators. Leaving waste on site under  the responsibility of the electric power companies does not relieve the  government of its obligation to take custody of the waste, thus the liability  debt could continue to mount. For every year after 2020 that DOE fails to  take custody of the waste in accordance with its contracts with the reactor  operators, DOE estimates that the government will continue to accumulate  up to $500 million per year beyond the estimated $12 billion in liabilities  that will have accrued up to that point; however, the outcome of pending  litigation could substantially affect the government\u2019s total liability. The  government will no longer incur these costs if DOE takes custody of the  waste. Some representatives from industry have stated that it is not  practical for DOE to take custody of the waste at commercial reactor sites.  Moreover, some electric power company executives have stated that their  ratepayers are paying for DOE to provide a geologic repository through  their contributions to the Nuclear Waste Fund, and the executives believe  that simply taking custody of the waste is not sufficient. A DOE official  stated that if DOE were to take custody of the waste on site, it would be a  complex undertaking due to considerations such as liability for accidents.", "Third, continued use of on-site storage would likely also face community  opposition. Some experts noted that without progress on a centralized  storage facility or repository site to which waste will be moved, some state  and local opposition to reactor storage site recertification will increase,  and so will challenges to nuclear power companies\u2019 applications for  reactor license extensions and combined licenses to construct and operate  new reactors. Also, experts noted that many commercial reactor sites are  not suitable for long-term storage, and none has had an environmental  review to assess the impacts of storing nuclear waste at the site beyond  the period for which it is currently licensed. One expert noted that if on- site storage were to become a waste management policy, the long-term  health, safety, and environmental risks at each site would have to be  evaluated. Because waste storage would extend beyond the life of nuclear  power reactors, decommissioned reactor sites would not be available for  other purposes, and the former reactor operators may have to stay in  business for the sole purpose of storing nuclear waste.", "Finally, although dry cask storage is considered reliable in the short term,  the longer-term costs, maintenance requirements, and security  requirements are not well understood. Many experts said waste packages  will likely retain their integrity for at least 100 years, but eventually dry  storage systems may begin to degrade and the waste in those systems  would have to be repackaged. However, commercial dry storage systems  have only been in existence since 1986, so nuclear utilities have little  experience with long-term system degradation and requirements for  repackaging. Some experts suggested that only the outer protective cask  would require replacement, but the inner canister would not have to be  replaced. Yet, other experts said that, over time, the inner canister would  also be exposed to environmental conditions by vents in the outer cask,  which could cause corrosion and require a total system replacement. In  addition, experts disagreed on the relative safety risks and costs  associated with using spent fuel pools to transfer the waste during  repackaging compared to using a dry transfer system, which industry  representatives said had not been used on a commercial scale. Finally,  future security requirements for extended storage are uncertain because  as spent nuclear waste ages and becomes cooler and less radioactive, it  becomes less lethal to anyone attempting to handle it without protective  shielding. For example, a spent nuclear fuel assembly can lose nearly 80  percent of its heat 5 years after it has been removed from a reactor,  thereby reducing one of the inherent deterrents to thieves and terrorists  attempting to steal or sabotage the spent nuclear fuel and potentially  creating a need for costly new security measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Ranges for On-Site Storage Will Vary Depending on Waste Volume, Final Disposition, and Duration of Storage", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 5, our models generated cost ranges from $20 billion to  $97 billion for the on-site storage of 153,000 metric tons of spent nuclear  fuel and high-level waste for 100 years followed by geologic disposal. For  only on-site storage for 100 years without disposal, costs would range from  $10 billion to $26 billion for 70,000 metric tons of waste and from $13  billion to $34 billion for 153,000 metric tons of waste. On-site storage costs  would increase significantly if the waste were stored for longer periods\u2014 storing 153,000 metric tons on site for 500 years would cost from $34  billion to $225 billion\u2014because it would have to be repackaged every 100  years for safety. The on-site storage model scenarios include the costs of  on-site operations required to package the waste into dry canister storage,  build additional dry storage at the reactor sites, prepare the waste for  transportation, and operate and maintain the on-site storage facilities.  Most of the costs for the first 100 years would result from the initial  loading of materials into dry storage systems. (See app. IV for information  on our modeling methodology, assumptions, and results.)", "Actual on-site storage costs may be more or less than these cost ranges if a  different on-site storage scenario is implemented. For example, to keep it  distinct from the centralized storage models, our on-site storage models  assume that there would be no transportation or consolidation of waste  between the reactor sites. However, several experts noted that in an actual  on-site storage scenario, reactor operators would likely consolidate their  waste to make operations more efficient and reduce costs. Also, as with  the centralized storage alternative, costs for the on-site storage scenario  that includes geologic disposal could differ for a repository site other than  Yucca Mountain or for additional waste management technologies.", "Finally, our models did not include certain costs that were either location- specific or could not be predicted sufficiently to be quantified for our  purposes, which would make the actual costs of on-site storage higher  than our cost ranges. For example, the taxes and fees associated with on- site storage could vary significantly by state and over time. Also,  repackaging operations in our 500-year on-site storage scenario would  generate low-level waste that would require disposal. However, the  amount of waste generated and the associated disposal costs could vary  depending on the techniques used for repackaging. Finally, the total  amount of the government\u2019s liability for failure to begin taking spent  nuclear fuel for disposal in 1998 will depend on the outcome of pending  and future litigation.", "Like the centralized storage alternative, the funding source for the on-site  storage alternative is uncertain. Currently, the reactor operators have been  paying for the cost to store the waste, but have filed lawsuits to be  compensated for storage costs of waste that the federal government was  required to take title to under standard contracts. Payments resulting from  these lawsuits have come from the Department of the Treasury\u2019s judgment  fund, which is funded by the taxpayer, because a court determined that  the Nuclear Waste Fund could not be used to compensate electric power  companies for their storage costs. Without legislative or contractual  changes\u2014such as allowing the Nuclear Waste Fund to be used for on-site  storage\u2014taxpayers would likely bear the ultimate costs for on-site  storage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Developing a long-term national strategy for safely and securely managing  the nation\u2019s high-level nuclear waste is a complex undertaking that must  balance health, social, environmental, security, and financial factors.

Any strategy selected will  need to have geologic disposal as a final disposition pathway. In the case  of the Yucca Mountain repository, these challenges have left the nation  with nearly three decades of experience. In moving forward, whether the  nation commits to the same or a different waste management strategy,  federal agencies, industry, and policy makers at all levels of government  can benefit from the lessons of Yucca Mountain.

We asked DOE officials to provide a breakdown of  the component costs on a per-metric-ton basis that DOE used in the Total  System Lifecycle Cost report. We used this information to calculate the  costs of a repository at Yucca Mountain for 70,000 metric tons and 153,000  metric tons, changing certain component costs based on the ratio between  70,000 and 122,100 or 153,000 and 122,100. For example, we modified the  cost of constructing the tunnels for emplacing the waste for the 70,000- metric-ton scenario by 0.57, the ratio of 70,000 metric tons to 122,100  metric tons. We applied this approach to component costs that would be  impacted by the ratio difference, particularly for transporting and  emplacing the waste and installing drip shields. We also incorporated  DOE\u2019s cost estimates for potential delays to licensing the Yucca Mountain  repository into our analysis and made modifications to the analysis based  on comments by cognizant DOE officials.

To  better understand how commercial spent nuclear fuel is stored, we visited  the Dresden Nuclear Power Plant in Illinois and the Hope Creek Nuclear  Power Plant in New Jersey, which both store spent nuclear fuel in pools  and in dry cask storage. We also visited DOE\u2019s Savannah River Site in  South Carolina and Fort St. Vrain site in Colorado to observe how DOE- managed spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste are processed and stored.", "As we began to identify potential alternatives to analyze, we shared our  initial approach and methodology with nuclear waste management  experts\u2014including members of the National Academy of Sciences and the  Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board to obtain their feedback\u2014and  revised our approach accordingly. Many of these experts advised us to  develop generic, hypothetical alternatives with clearly defined  assumptions about technology and environmental conditions. Industry  representatives and other experts advised us that trying to account for the  thousands of variables relating to geography, the environment, regional  regulatory differences, or differences in business models would result in  infeasible and unmanageable models. They also advised us against trying  to predict changes in the future for technologies or environmental  conditions because they would purely conjectural and fall beyond the  scope of this analysis.", "Based on this information, we identified two generic, hypothetical  alternatives to use as the basis of our analysis: centralized storage and on- site storage. Within each of these alternatives, we identified different  scenarios that examined the costs associated with the management of  70,000 metric tons and 153,000 metric tons of nuclear waste and whether  or not the waste is shipped to a repository for disposal after 100 years.", "Once we identified the alternatives, we again consulted with experts to  establish assumptions regarding commercial spent nuclear fuel  management and its associated components to define the scope and  specific processes that would be included in each alternative. To identify a  more complete, qualified list of nuclear waste management experts with  relevant experience who could provide and critique this information, we  used a technique known as snowballing. We started with experts in the  field who were known to us, primarily from DOE, NRC, National Council  of State Legislators, the State of Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, the  Nuclear Energy Institute, and the National Association of Regulatory  Utility Commissioners and asked them to refer us to other experts,  focusing on U.S.-based experts.

Does your expertise allow you to comment on  planning assumptions and costs of waste management related to storage,  disposal, or transport?", "If you were to classify yourself in relation to the Yucca Mountain  repository, would you classify yourself as a proponent, an opponent, an  independent, an undecided or uncommitted, or some combination of  these?", "We then narrowed our list down to those individuals who identified  themselves or whom others identified as having current, nationally  recognized expertise in areas of nuclear waste management that were  relevant to our analysis.

We worked closely with these  experts to identify the key assumptions that would establish the scope of  our alternatives, the more specific assumptions to identify the processes  associated with each alternative, the components of these processes that  we could quantify in terms of cost, and the level of uncertainty associated  with each component cost. For example, two of the experts in this first  group told us that for the on-site alternative, commercial reactor sites that  did not already have independent spent nuclear fuel storage installations  would have to build them during the next 10 years and that the cost for  licensing, design, and construction of each installation would range from  $24 million to $36 million.
