Transit rail cars in the U.S. comprise about 5 percent of the worldwide fleet. Transit agencies' purchases vary considerably over time: A large transit agency may replace its entire fleet in 1 year, contributing to a spike in the market, whereas in other years, there may be only a fraction of that demand for the U.S. market. Transit agencies often request custom car designs to address not only legacy infrastructure requirements and interoperability issues with existing fleets, but also preferences. Rail car orders of small size and demand for customized cars can increase the price per car by, for example, concentrating design costs among fewer cars. The federal government provides some funding for transit rail cars and has varying levels of involvement in setting design standards for transit rail cars. More than half of the transit agencies GAO interviewed purchased rail cars with some type of federal funding, such as formula or discretionary capital funds. When transit agencies use federal funds to purchase rail cars, certain requirements apply, such as \"Buy America\"--which requires, among other things, that rail cars be assembled in the United States. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) ensures that these requirements are met by overseeing new transit projects and through periodic reviews. The federal government's role in setting design standards for transit cars depends on the type of rail. For commuter rail, the Federal Railroad Administration has established safety standards that must be met, since these cars are intended to run on the same tracks as freight rail traffic. For other rail transit, FTA provided funds to help APTA--the standard-setting industry group--develop voluntary standards, including those for safety. However, the Secretary of Transportation proposed legislation in December 2009, which was introduced in Congress in February 2010, to give FTA more regulatory authority in relation to safety. Transit agency officials identified several challenges in procuring rail cars, including securing funding, given all of their competing needs. Manufacturers and transit agencies also face legal and regulatory requirements, such as \"Buy America\" requirements, but have generally adapted to challenges posed by them. However, market challenges still exist, including the small size of many orders that may affect price. Joint procurements, whereby transit agencies combine orders, can help them increase their order sizes; however, they can only combine orders if a design exists that meets both agencies' needs. While a few transit agencies have become aware of opportunities to jointly procure rail cars through informal mechanisms, such as industry meetings, there is currently no formal mechanism to identify mutually beneficial opportunities for joint procurement. As FTA helps fund many procurements, it may be in the best position to help transit agencies identify joint procurement opportunities. Furthermore, FTA and APTA have efforts under way to standardize light rail cars to make rail car procurement more efficient and cost-effective. Standards also might be beneficial for other types of systems, such as streetcars, particularly for those without existing infrastructure limitations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Transportation direct DOT to work with APTA to (1) develop a process to systematically identify and communicate opportunities for transit agencies with similar needs to participate in joint procurement and (2) identify additional opportunities for standardization, especially for new systems. DOT reviewed a draft of this report, generally concurred with its contents, and agreed to consider the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Rail transit offers passengers and society a number of benefits, including  reduced congestion and pollution, and increased mobility. However, these  systems are costly and challenging to build and maintain. In particular, the  cost of individual rail cars\u2014which transit agencies purchase to equip new  systems and replace existing fleets\u2014can be high, typically $1.5 million to  $3.4 million per car for recent procurements, depending on the number  and type of cars purchased. In 2008, U.S. transit agencies spent over $2.3  billion on rail cars. Transit rail cars can vary substantially in design across  systems and, sometimes even within systems, requiring manufacturers to  build customized cars, which can drive up the cost of procurement. In fact,  procuring standardized vehicles could reduce costs per car up to 20  percent, according to a recent Department of Transportation (DOT) report  to Congress. This issue affects not only the 54 U.S. transit agencies  operating at least one rail transit line as of the end of 2008, but will affect  new rail systems, including new streetcar systems. Since most transit  agencies we contacted use Federal Transit Administration (FTA)- administered grant funds to purchase rail cars, reducing the cost of rail  cars would allow for more efficient use of federal funds. The Federal  Railroad Administration (FRA) typically does not fund transit rail cars, but  the agency does oversee commuter rail safety.", "In response to your request, we addressed the following objectives:   (1) What are the key characteristics of the U.S. market for transit rail cars,  and how do they compare with international markets? (2) What is the  federal government\u2019s role in funding and setting standards for transit rail  car procurement and design? (3) What challenges, if any, do transit  agencies face when procuring transit rail cars, and what actions have they  and other stakeholders taken to help address them?", "To determine the characteristics of the U.S. market for transit rail cars, we  reviewed two databases\u2014the FTA\u2019s National Transit Database and the  American Public Transportation Association\u2019s (APTA) transit database\u2014 to determine the number and types of passenger transit rail cars in the  United States. We also interviewed officials from 23 of the 54 U.S. rail  transit agencies as of 2008. We judgmentally selected these agencies on the  basis of their size; rail transit modes (commuter rail, heavy rail, and light  rail); and geographic distribution. These transit agencies were operating 33  systems among the major transit rail modes, compared with 68 systems  operated by all U.S. transit agencies. The results of our work are not  generalizeable to all transit agencies. Furthermore, we interviewed  officials from existing and potential transit rail car manufacturers, transit  agency consultants, FTA, and APTA. To determine how the U.S. market for  transit rail cars compares with international markets, we obtained  worldwide rail car data from SCI Verkehr in Cologne, Germany, and  interviewed rail car manufacturers; transit officials from Canada, Japan,  New Zealand, and Portugal; and European railway associations. To assess  the reliability of data from FTA\u2019s National Transit Database, APTA\u2019s 2009  Public Transportation Vehicle Database (APTA\u2019s transit database), and  SCI Verkehr, we spoke with officials from each organization about data  quality control procedures and reviewed relevant documentation. For each  data set, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To determine the federal government\u2019s role in  funding and setting standards, we reviewed applicable federal law,  regulations, and grant documents and interviewed FTA officials. Finally, to  identify any challenges transit agencies face when procuring transit rail  cars, we met with transit agency officials representing 33 transit systems  across the country, transit rail car manufacturers, transit agency  consultants, and FTA and APTA officials. Appendix I contains additional  information about our scope and methodology, including lists of the  organizations we contacted.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2009 through June  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. rail transit system consists of the following three primary modes:  commuter rail, heavy rail transit, and light rail transit (see figs. 1 to 3).

(See fig. 4.) Agencies in these six  cities manage over 16,000 rail cars, or more than 80 percent of all the  active U.S. transit rail cars.", "The number of transit systems is increasing beyond the large metropolitan  areas that currently dominate the market, although new systems tend to be  small. For example, the Utah Transit Authority began operating a 45-car  commuter rail system for Salt Lake City in April 2008. The Puerto Rico  Highway and Transportation Authority began operating a 74-car heavy rail  system in San Juan in December 2004. The Valley Metro in Phoenix began  operating a 50-car light rail system in December 2008. In addition, several  new streetcar systems have opened within the last decade in cities such as  Portland, Oregon; Tampa, Florida; and Little Rock, Arkansas.  Furthermore, additional cities\u2014such as Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Boise,  Idaho; and Cincinnati, Ohio\u2014have plans for transit-oriented development  that include new streetcar lines.", "Rail car procurements generally take years to complete and can involve  many technical experts, including consultants. A time frame of 3 to 4 years  is considered quick for a complete procurement, and many take much  longer. For example, according to officials at one transit agency, it can  take about 8 years from design to final acceptance for heavy rail cars. The  procurement process is lengthy because it involves four phases: the transit  agency\u2019s initial design; advertising, communication, and contract award;  the manufacturer\u2019s detailed car design, prototype development, and  testing; and production. (See table 1.)", "Foreign-based companies supply most of the U.S. market for passenger  rail transit cars. Over the last decade, foreign-based companies, with U.S.  plants, have produced almost all of the more than 8,000 new rail cars  purchased by U.S. transit agencies. For example, Bombardier (Canada)  has been a major builder of commuter cars for U.S. transit agencies.  Alstom (France) and Kawasaki (Japan) have been major suppliers of  heavy rail cars, and Siemens (Germany) and Kinki Sharyo (Japan) have  been major suppliers of light rail cars. U.S.-based rail car manufacturers  serve niche markets for streetcars or unconventional commuter rail cars,  with typically sporadic and small orders\u2014fewer than 20 cars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the U.S. Transit Rail Car Market May Have Implications for Car Procurement", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Transit Rail Car Demand Is Small and Erratic over Time", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. rail car market is a small percentage of the world market for rail  cars. In particular, the U.S. transit rail car fleet constitutes about 5 percent  of the worldwide total. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany,  which have smaller populations than the United States, account for a  larger percentage of the world transit rail car fleet. Officials from rail car  manufacturers said that these countries have relatively more resources  invested in public transit infrastructure compared with the United States.  The small fleet size of the United States also correlates with a small share  of the annual world demand for newly manufactured cars by U.S. transit  agencies due to the limited extent of our transit rail systems, relative to  other countries. See figure 5 for percentages of the worldwide transit rail  car fleet in different locations.", "In addition to the relatively small overall demand for rail cars in the United  States, individual rail car orders are often small. Almost half of the transit  agencies we interviewed procure rail cars in relatively small quantities.  For example, United Streetcar, a streetcar producer, told us that it expects  orders of just three to six cars at a time.", "The level of U.S. rail car purchases is also uneven over time. See figure 6  for the number of rail cars produced per year for U.S. transit agencies  from 1970 through 2008.", "The erratic nature of the U.S. market is primarily due to the following  reasons:    Large transit agencies, such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  (MTA) New York City Transit, procuring cars in large orders that cause  spikes in the market. For example, over half of the cars built in 2001 and  2002 were for a MTA New York City Transit procurement of over 1,600  cars.", "Replacements of existing fleets, which are dependent upon the life cycle  of the fleets. Transit agencies generally do not procure rail cars on an  annual basis, and transit rail cars typically last 25 years or more with a  midlife overhaul, depending upon the materials used and the car design.  Some individual transit agencies may replace their fleets of rail cars at the  same time. For example, the Bay Area Rapid Transit is in the process of  purchasing 775 cars to replace and expand its entire fleet of 669 cars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Rail Car Designs Have a Great Deal of Customization", "paragraphs": ["U.S. rail car designs have a great deal of customization that differs among  transit agencies due to legacy infrastructure design, interoperability  concerns with existing fleets, and local preferences. In particular, many  heavy rail transit agencies have systems that require rail cars with  customized designs, rather than standard designs. Most of these systems  were built long ago, and their designs have unique characteristics, such as  tunnel size, curve radii, and the ability to support rail car weight. The  unique features of many systems can limit the ability of a car manufacturer  to produce cars for more than one agency from one car design. For  example, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA)  could not purchase the Chicago Transit Authority\u2019s (CTA) cars because  they were too tall for WMATA\u2019s tunnels, and CTA could not purchase  WMATA\u2019s cars because they were too long to make the sharp turns of the  Chicago system, according to officials from both agencies. Furthermore,  when procuring rail cars for existing transit systems, agency officials  generally must include specifications to ensure that the new cars will be  interoperable with their existing fleets. In addition to design features  based on infrastructure requirements, transit agencies may also request  other local preferences, such as rail car compatibility with platform  heights, door requirements, and certain safety features. This level of  specificity in transit rail car design is more common in the U.S. market  than it is in other countries\u2019 markets. Transit agency, transit association,  and manufacturing officials said that rail car designs tend to be more  similar among transit agencies in Western Europe and within some Asian  countries, in part, because some countries have established standard  performance specifications or designs that manufacturers must follow  prior to building systems.", "While rail car manufacturer and transit agency officials said that unique  infrastructure requirements are most prevalent in heavy rail systems, light  rail and streetcar systems can also have unique requirements. For  example, transit agency officials said that differences, such as the length  of the city blocks where the cars travel, may influence the car length and  overall design for light rail and streetcars. Furthermore, although officials  from almost half of the commuter rail agencies we interviewed said they  either had borrowed rail cars from another commuter rail agency or had  jointly purchased cars with another commuter agency, other officials  described unique infrastructure requirements, such as tunnel size, that  necessitate customized designs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of U.S. Transit Agencies\u2019 Rail Car Orders Have Implications for the Price of Rail Cars", "paragraphs": ["According to rail car manufacturer and transit agency officials, certain  characteristics of U.S. transit agencies\u2019 rail car orders have implications  for the per-car prices that transit agencies pay for their cars.  Manufacturers said that certain fixed costs related to manufacturing start- up and rail car design are key factors in the per-car price of an order. Rail  car manufacturer officials said that the order size necessary to capitalize  on economies of scale varies from a few cars to over 100 cars, depending  upon the transit mode, the degree of customization of the car design, and  certain production costs. In general, as manufacturers and component  suppliers\u2014such as door manufacturers\u2014produce more cars using the  same design and production line, the cost per car is reduced due to the  manufacturers\u2019 ability to spread the design and other fixed production  costs over a larger number of cars. Additionally, if more units are  purchased, component costs are usually lower on a per-unit basis because  suppliers are also able to capture greater economies of scale in component  production. As a result, transit agencies with large orders, such as the  MTA New York City Transit, have been able to get relatively low per-car  prices. However, certain characteristics of other U.S. transit agencies\u2019  demand for rail cars may prevent manufacturers and suppliers from  capitalizing on these benefits.", "These characteristics include the following:    Small orders and customized designs: U.S. rail car orders tend to be small  and customized, which results in higher per-car costs. First, officials from  all four of the major manufacturers we interviewed said that the cost to  design cars for a particular procurement is a significant up-front cost, and  that it is important to be able to spread design costs over a number of cars  to obtain economies of scale. Officials from several manufacturers said  that designing a rail car on the basis of unique specifications can add from  $20 million to $100 million to the cost of the order. However, the degree of  design specificity is also a factor. If the design is fairly standard, the design  costs will be lower, enabling the efficient production of a smaller order of  cars. However, if the design is highly customized, design costs are greater,  and it may be very expensive to produce a small order. Second, to build  customized cars, manufacturers may have to retool their production lines  for each procurement. This retooling results in start-up costs that are  embedded in the price per car. Manufacturers said that once there is a  break in production, expenses are incurred because manufacturers and  component suppliers may need to reconfigure or retool their production  line before they can begin producing rail cars and their component parts.  For example, officials from the Virginia Railway Express (VRE), a  commuter rail system, said that when they purchased one set of cars in  2006, they were able to obtain a price of approximately $1.6 million per  car, which was considered to be a favorable price, because the  manufacturer had recently finished production of similar cars for  Chicago\u2019s Metra. However, in a later procurement in 2010, VRE paid  approximately $2.2 million per car, which was significantly higher, in part  because the manufacturer had to restart the production line for this car  design. The impact of design and start-up costs are exacerbated by the  small order sizes that are typical in the United States.", "Erratic nature of transit agencies\u2019 procurements: The uneven nature of  the U.S. transit agencies\u2019 procurements also impacts the price of rail cars.  Officials from five of the six manufacturers we interviewed said that the  erratic nature of U.S. rail car demand reduced their ability to maintain  continuous production, which likely results in higher production costs per  rail car. Because transit agencies in the United States may procure many  cars in some years but few in others, manufacturers and component  suppliers may have to close production facilities or produce other goods  during the years that fewer cars are procured. Therefore, as we have  previously mentioned, they may have additional start-up costs when  demand recovers, and they increase their rail car production capacity to  meet this demand. In contrast, rail car manufacturers said that in other  markets (e.g., Europe), there may be a more stable demand, which allows  them to maintain more consistent operations and avoid the costs of  increasing and decreasing capacity. For example, according to a transit  association official who we interviewed, there is a large tramway system in  D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, that orders about 15 to 20 cars per year. Although  this is not a large order, it is continuous and helps the manufacturer  maintain consistent operations.", "Because of the lengthy rail car procurement and manufacturing process,  manufacturers also face financial risks from the volatile nature of the  prices of the commodities used to manufacture rail cars; and rail car  prices reflect these risks. Officials from one transit agency said that it can  take a transit agency up to 8 years from when the decision is made to  purchase new cars to when the cars are delivered. However, in the United  States, contracts for rail cars are usually negotiated as a fixed price\u2014 meaning that manufacturers bid on a price for a set of cars that remains  the same, even if certain costs of producing the cars change during the  lengthy production. Rail car manufacturers estimate future prices of key  commodities, such as copper and steel, when entering a proposal to build  rail cars, but they maintain risk that these commodity prices could change  in ways they did not expect. Officials from all six of the manufacturers and  almost half of the transit agencies we interviewed said that manufacturers  face significant risk related to variable prices for commodities such as  steel. For example, on the MTA New York City Transit\u2019s current heavy rail  car procurement, the recent fluctuation in commodity prices for copper  and steel surprised one manufacturer. The manufacturer had locked in to  a price for the cars in the base contract, so the price fluctuations caused  the order to be less profitable. While manufacturers said that they may  engage in hedging strategies\u2014such as buying futures contracts on  commodities\u2014to mitigate these risks, they also said that adequately  hedging these risks can be difficult."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Government Is Involved to Varying Degrees in Funding and Setting Design Standards for Transit Rail Car Procurement", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government Funds Pay for a Portion of Most Transit Agencies\u2019 Rail Car Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Most of the transit agencies we contacted used some type of federal  funding, such as the New Starts program, to purchase rail cars for their  systems.", "FTA\u2019s New Starts program provides federal funding for the initial rail car  purchases needed to support service on a newly constructed line or  extension.", "Transit agencies can use FTA\u2019s Fixed Guideway Modernization Funds or  Section 5307 (Urbanized Area) formula funds to purchase additional or  replacement rail cars.", "More recently, transit agencies and municipalities have used funding from  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  specifically made available for transit projects or Recovery Act  Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (also known as  TIGER) grants. For example, the city of Houston received a Recovery Act  grant for $87 million to expand its system and purchase additional  vehicles.", "Some of the transit agencies we contacted used state or local funds for  subsequent rail car purchases, either to replace aging rail cars or to  provide additional capacity to their systems. State or local governments  fund rail car purchases with local revenues, state grants, or bonds\u2014such  as those that are repaid from transit agency revenues or taxes levied on  real estate located in special tax districts.

Transit agency and FTA officials identified some of  the procurement requirements that apply to transit rail car procurements.  These requirements center on compliance with \u201cBuy America\u201d legislation  and on whether contracts are awarded in a manner that promotes free and  open competition. FTA relies primarily on self-certification, but also  conducts triennial and periodic procurement reviews to help ensure  compliance with these requirements.", "The \u201cBuy America\u201d requirement specifies that the cost of rail car  components manufactured in the United States must be more than 60  percent of the cost of all component parts, and that the rail cars  themselves must be assembled in the United States. Under certain  circumstances, FTA has the authority to grant waivers to transit agencies,  allowing them to purchase rail cars that may not fully meet \u201cBuy America\u201d  requirements. Specifically, a waiver can be granted if (1) a product  manufactured in the United States was not available, (2) the cost of U.S.- made rail car component parts was prohibitive, or (3) FTA deems a  purchase from a foreign manufacturer to be in the best interest of the  public. For example, FTA granted a waiver for a transit agency to  purchase diesel-powered transit cars manufactured in another country  because that type of vehicle was not manufactured in the United States. In  another case, FTA approved a waiver for a transit agency\u2019s purchase of a  prototype rail car made in another country because it would be used for  testing the vehicle\u2019s performance. As part of this agreement, the remainder  of the cars in the order was assembled in the United States and complied  with the 60 percent domestic content requirement, which is computed on  the cost of components and subcomponents. According to DOT officials,  these waivers are considered on a case-by-case basis.", "Transit agencies also must comply with other requirements\u2014described in  FTA guidance\u2014when they use federal funds to purchase rail cars. For  example, Congress has placed a 5-year limit on transit agencies exercising  options to purchase additional rail cars under an existing contract.  According to FTA officials, this limitation promotes free and open  competition because it presents other manufacturers with the opportunity  to bid on rail car purchases that would otherwise go to a single company  year after year.", "In addition, to assist transit agencies FTA has issued a manual\u2014the Best  Practices Procurement Manual\u2014that describes various procurement  requirements and how they can be met. For example, FTA\u2019s guidance  encourages transit agencies to jointly procure rail cars with other transit  agencies in order to save money, if possible. However, there are certain  limitations and procedures that must be followed. FTA\u2019s manual provides  a roadmap on how to conduct joint procurements as well as how options  to purchase additional vehicles under one contract can be assigned to  another agency.", "Finally, for FTA New Starts and major capital projects costing over $100  million, FTA monitors the project\u2019s progress to determine whether a  project is on time, within budget, in conformance with design criteria,  constructed to approved plans and specifications, and efficiently and  effectively implemented. FTA\u2019s review of these projects includes a review  of fleet management plans to ensure that transit agencies will be capable  of operating and maintaining their rail cars, and that the number of rail  cars to be purchased is justified by the anticipated ridership.

FRA sets regulations for commuter  rail safety and also enforces ADA requirements.", "The federal government has had a more active role in setting safety  standards for some rail cars. Specifically:    FRA has established safety standards for commuter passenger rail cars  that travel on tracks that also carry freight rail traffic. FRA enlisted APTA\u2019s  assistance to help develop safety standards for commuter rail cars and  then expanded the effort to establish industry standards and  recommended practices for commuter rail car safety. According to FRA  and APTA officials, this has led to greater uniformity in the design and  production of commuter rail cars. This greater uniformity could alleviate  some of the market difficulties that we previously discussed resulting from  customized designs. These standards and recommended practices do not  apply to heavy or light rail transit systems because these transit systems  do not share tracks with freight train traffic, which is generally a  prerequisite for FRA oversight.", "While FRA sets safety standards for commuter rail cars, FTA has adopted  APTA \u201cindustry standards\u201d and recommendations for transit rail car safety  into its safety requirements. Consequently, transit agencies are required to  follow the industry standards and recommended practices for safety, but,  unlike FRA, FTA does not have direct oversight of compliance or  enforcement authority. Instead, FTA requires states to set up safety  oversight organizations to ensure compliance. However, in December  2009, the Secretary of Transportation proposed legislation that would give  FTA the authority to establish and enforce minimum federal safety  standards for rail transit systems that received federal transit funding.

Specifically, the requirement limits agencies\u2019 ability to exercise  options to a 5-year period once a contract is signed if federal funds are  used. Although this requirement is in place to ensure that the rail car  market is fair and open, transit agency officials report this is burdensome,  because if they decide to procure new cars after the 5th year, they must  the initiate the procurement process\u2014which is both lengthy and costly\u2014 all over again."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal, Regulatory, and Other Issues Also Create Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Some of the transit agencies and manufacturers we interviewed identified  specific legal and regulatory factors that pose challenges in the  procurement process.", "Transit agency officials identified some federal requirements that impact  their rail car procurements.

For example, to meet \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements,  which require final assembly in the United States, some manufacturers  have decided to build permanent facilities in the United States; others  have built temporary facilities in the location where the order is filled. A  manufacturer\u2019s decision to build a temporary facility can impact transit  agencies if, once the cars are built, manufacturers close the facilities and  transit agencies have to buy certain spare parts from overseas or order  them from specialty manufacturers. Because of the unique designs of rail  cars, the parts may have to be specially made for the individual car design  when replacement parts are needed.", "Some transit agency officials and manufacturers told us that they can also  face difficulties when following state or local requirements. For example, a  transit agency and a manufacturer said that a state law that requires full  disclosure of all information, including potentially proprietary information,  in the negotiation process can make it difficult to conduct negotiations  and may limit the numbers of proposals received when purchasing new  rail cars. Officials from another transit agency said that a state law  requiring more than 9 percent sales tax on rail car purchases results in  significant costs that other transit agencies do not have to pay.", "Another factor that affects some transit agencies\u2014particularly new or  small agencies\u2014is a lack of experience with the procurement process.  Given the 25-year expected lifespan of most rail cars, some transit agency  officials may participate in only one or two procurements in an entire  career and, therefore, have limited experience and must rely on design  consultants. For example, the Port Authority Trans Hudson\u2019s consultant is  heavily involved in developing specifications for the current procurement  to replace its entire fleet. The last time the agency procured cars was in  1967, and the staff that worked on the procurement are no longer with the  agency. Transit agency officials with limited procurement experience may  not recognize opportunities for cost savings when specifying their design  requirements, and it may not be in the design consultant\u2019s best interest to  identify and encourage the use of standard designs. In addition, since  many transit agencies procure rail cars in relatively small quantities, these  agencies may not be in a position to negotiate for rail car prices in line  with those of the larger agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Stakeholders Have Identified Opportunities for Economies of Scale through Standardization and Joint Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Although rail car procurement can be challenging for both manufacturers  and transit agencies, industry stakeholders, manufacturers, and transit  agencies have identified opportunities to reduce costs through  standardization and joint purchases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Standardization", "paragraphs": ["To a certain extent, increasing the standardization of transit rail cars could  benefit transit agencies. First, it would enable manufacturers to produce  rail cars for numerous agencies without incurring start-up costs resulting  from breaks in the manufacturing process. Once there is a break in  production, the manufacturer must arrange for rail car components to be  delivered from suppliers, and some of these components have long lead  times before they can be delivered. Furthermore, time is lost and expenses  incurred because manufacturers need to reconfigure or retool their  production line before they can begin producing a rail car. Second,  standardization can benefit manufacturers and transit agencies by  decreasing design costs and may enable manufacturers to take advantage  of economies of scale in the manufacturing process by producing more  vehicles with similar parts.", "However, there are arguments against standardization. Specifically, one  rail expert stated that adopting a standard design can discourage  innovation and inhibit research and development. Also, he reported that  a standard design may include features that are unnecessary for all  systems and could add to the price of each car. In addition,  standardization is not possible for all systems. As we have previously  described, many heavy rail systems have unique infrastructure designs.  Transit agencies would need to make major infrastructure changes in  order to use rail cars that are compatible with other agencies\u2019 cars.  According to FTA officials, the cost savings associated with the use of a  standard design would not offset the cost of making these system changes.  There may be more opportunities to standardize light rail or streetcar  systems, particularly in new systems where the infrastructure has not yet  been constructed.", "Although current U.S. transit rail car designs differ substantially among  systems, past efforts have attempted to standardize transit car designs.", "One successful effort was the Presidents\u2019 Conference Committee (PCC)  streetcar, which was first built in 1934. The committee, which consisted of  industry representatives, produced a standardized design that permitted  the use of assembly line techniques by multiple manufacturers and  allowed for wide variation to meet the needs of various transit agencies.  The design was widely accepted, but U.S. manufacturers stopped  producing PCC cars in the 1950s. However, a few PCC streetcars are still  operating in the United States. For example, the Massachusetts Bay  Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Southeastern Pennsylvania  Transportation Authority both have active PCC cars on certain lines. A  later effort to create standardized transit rail car designs was less  successful. In the 1970s, the Standard Light Rail Vehicle was promoted by  the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, which created a  committee to develop the car design. A company called Boeing Vertol  started building cars of this design in 1973 for MBTA and the San  Francisco Municipal Railway, but the cars were prone to problems that led  to their early retirement.", "Industry associations\u2014including APTA and the Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers\u2014continue to promote standardization in transit rail  car procurement to make transit rail car procurement more cost-effic As part of its standards development program, APTA convened two  working groups in 2009 to develop (1) technical standards and (2) a set of  standard terms and conditions for transit agencies to use when procuring  light rail vehicles. These efforts are funded through membership dues and  grants from FTA, the Transit Cooperative Research Program, and the Joint  Program Office of the Department of Transportation. The goal of the  working group is to produce a set of technical standards that transit  agencies can use when procuring new light rail vehicles and that FTA  could apply to light rail cars, rather than establish federal requirements.These standards may result in reduced design costs for transit agencies  and allow manufacturers  to take advantage of economies of scale in the  manufacturing process.  ient.", "The goal of the second working group is to develop a set of standard term and conditions that agencies can use when procuring light rail vehicles.  One of the biggest challenges for transit agencies\u2014particularly for  s  agencies with limited procurement experience\u2014is writing a contract that  makes it easy to identify its terms, including each party\u2019s financial risks.  Currently, each agency addresses risk in its Request for Proposals (RFP)  and contracts in a different format, which makes it difficult for  manufacturers to identify each party\u2019s risks and may slow down the  procurement process. The standard terms and conditions document  should (1) reduce ambiguities in procurement documents, (2) allow tra agencies and manufacturers to save time, and (3) reduce the need for  consultants. According to APTA officials, they expect to have a draft of  standards and a draft of the contract terms and conditions guidance to  industry stakeholders for their comment by late summer 2010.", "In addition, there appears to be a push for standardizing high-speed  intercity passenger rail cars. Specifically, the Passenger Rail Investment  and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) required Amtrak to establish a  committee to design, set specifications for, and procure standardized nex generation train corridor equipment\u2014such as high speed rail. Although  this effort does not affect transit rail cars, it could reduce rail car design  costs for intercity passenger rail.", "Some manufacturers have also attempted to increase the standardiza of rail cars, while providing flexibility to their clients. For example,  officials from one manufacturer told us that their company has develo two standard designs that they believe can be customized to meet 80  percent of U.S. transit agencies\u2019 needs for new light rail cars. One is a high- platform car and the other is a low-floor car. The design for a low-floor car  can also be used for a streetcar. These basic designs can be custom ized by  changing the components as required\u2014for example, stronger air  conditioning systems for vehicles to be used in warm weather climates.  Another manufacturer has developed a basic, more affordable design commuter rail cars that can be customized to meet transit agencies\u2019  needs\u2014for example, a customer can change seating and interior materials,  but not the shape of the car. The manufacturer also offers custom des igns,  but at a higher cost. Manufacturers may have more opportunities for  for  standardization if transit agencies seek bids based on performance  specifications that detail agencies\u2019 needs in terms of car performance, as  opposed to design specifications that detail how a car should be built."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Procurement and \u201cPiggybacking\u201d", "paragraphs": ["Transit agencies have attempted to decrease costs by jointly procuring  transit rail cars or \u201cpiggybacking\u201d on another transit agency\u2019s contract to  take advantage of economies of scale. A joint procurement means that rail  cars are purchased by two or more agencies under the same contract. Fo r  example, the Miami-Dade Transit jointly purchased heavy rail cars with  the Maryland Mass Transit Administration in the 1980s. \u201cPiggybacking\u201d  means that one transit agency exercises the options on another transit  agency\u2019s contract for rail cars of the same design. For example, the Utah  Transit Authority piggybacked on San Diego Metropolitan Transit System contract for light rail vehicles. In joint procurements, all transit agencies  must be named in the original contract, and the car designs must no substantially different. In piggybacking, all transit agencies and all  potential option quantities must be named in the RFPs and again in the  contract. Transit agencies can benefit from both of these options through  reduced rail car costs resulting from economies of scale in the production  process as well as reduced design costs per car and procurement costs.", "However, transit agency and FTA officials said that the opportunitie joint procurement and piggybacking are limited by several factors:    First, some transit agencies\u2014particularly those with heavy rail system have infrastructure that requires specific rail car features that are not  common in other systems. For example, officials at the Bay Area Rapid  Transit in San Francisco explained that their transit rail cars must be built  from aluminum to meet weight restrictions of the infrastructure, where most other heavy rail cars in the United States are built from stainless  steel.", "Second, transit agencies may have customized design requirements ba on local preferences that limit their opportunities for joint purchases.  Officials from one transit agency told us that their riders were accustomed to rail cars with passenger-loading in the center of the car, and, therefore,  they included this feature in their design specifications. The transit agency  vehicles with another agency, unless  would not be able to jointly purchase  they both had the same basic design.", "Third, transit agency and FTA officials also told us that it is difficult for  transit agencies to at the same time. coordinate their purchases and have funding available    Finally, transit agencies are not generally aware of other transit agencies\u2019  procurement plans, and there is no entity to formally help facilitate joint  purchases. According to FTA officials, they are aware of two informal  mechanisms for discussing the potential for joint procurement\u2014FTA\u2019s  semiannual New Starts Construction Roundtable conference and APTA  meetings. For example, the Agence M\u00e9tropolitaine de Transport (AMT) in  Canada identified an opportunity to purchase commuter cars at a reduced  price at an APTA meeting. According to AMT officials, while this was not a  joint procurement, they saved money because they had a similar design to  the New Jersey Transit\u2019s commuter cars that were currently under  production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Activities", "paragraphs": ["FTA, recognizing the financial benefits of joint procurements,  piggybacking, and standardized rail cars, has recently looked for ways to  encourage these activities. FTA studied the feasibility of creating an  incentive system in conjunction with Section 5307 (Urbanized Area)  formula grants to encourage and reward transit agencies to take the lead  on joint or piggybacked procurements for buses and rail cars. As part of  this study, FTA implemented a pilot program for joint procurement of  buses. Three of the five pilot projects did not result in successful joint  procurements, but demonstrated some of the difficulties of joint  procurement. Specifically, the study found that (1) the incentives provided  must be significant, (2) it is not adequate to increase the federal matching  portion of existing formula funds, and (3) and it is important to maintain  continuous production without significant changes to achieve potential  savings. FTA did not implement a similar pilot of rail cars as part of this  study.", "As a result of the study, FTA recommended to Congress, in a 2008 report,  three alternatives to provide financial incentives to and compensate  agencies that jointly procure transit rail cars:  1.  FTA would award incentive grants to transit agencies that lead joint  procurements to cover a portion of their program management cost.  2.  FTA would award additional federal funding on the basis of the  percentage of the rail car\u2019s contract cost for transit agencies that  participate in a joint procurement.  3.

However, efforts are under way to promote  standardized design, including APTA\u2019s efforts to develop procurement  standards for light rail cars and PRIIA\u2019s requirement for Amtrak to set up a  committee to look into designs for high speed rail systems. DOT\u2019s support  of these efforts could pay dividends into the future by making rail cars  more widely available at a lower cost. In particular, systems built in the  future may benefit from increased standardization if they are not limited  by existing infrastructure.", "Joint procurements and piggybacking also have the potential to increase  the financial advantages of purchasing large numbers of cars. These  advantages typically have been limited to a handful of larger transit  agencies, since smaller transit agencies have not purchased a sufficient  amount of cars to benefit from economies of scale. While FTA\u2019s  procurement guidance encourages joint procurement, it has not  established a mechanism to assist transit agencies to successfully pool  their orders, and transit agencies have reported difficulties in this area.  Often, transit agencies are not aware of the activities of other agencies in  the procurement arena. Without a process for coordinating performance  and design standards and a means of encouraging joint procurements,  current practices may not substantially change. A more systematic  approach to linking agencies with similar infrastructure and rail car needs  could identify even more of these opportunities.
