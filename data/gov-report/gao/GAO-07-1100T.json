Fewer than half the items GAO selected for testing could be located. Most of the missing items were information technology (IT) equipment. In light of these concerns and recent thefts of laptops and data breaches at VA, this testimony focuses on (1) the risk of theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment at selected locations; (2) whether selected locations have adequate procedures in place to assure accountability and physical security of IT equipment in the excess property disposal process; and (3) what actions VA management has taken to address identified IT inventory control weaknesses. GAO statistically tested inventory controls at four case study locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A weak overall control environment for VA IT equipment at the four locations GAO audited poses a significant security vulnerability to the nation's veterans with regard to sensitive data maintained on this equipment. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government requires agencies to establish physical controls to safeguard vulnerable assets, such as IT equipment, which might be vulnerable to risk of loss, and federal records management law requires federal agencies to record essential transactions. However, GAO found that current VA property management policy does not provide guidance for creating records of inventory transactions as changes occur. GAO also found that policies requiring annual inventories of sensitive items, such as IT equipment; adequate physical security; and immediate reporting of lost and missing items have not been enforced. GAO's statistical tests of physical inventory controls at four VA locations identified a total of 123 missing IT equipment items, including 53 computers that could have stored sensitive data. The lack of user-level accountability and inaccurate records on status, location, and item descriptions make it difficult to determine the extent to which actual theft, loss, or misappropriation may have occurred without detection. GAO also found that the four VA locations reported over 2,400 missing IT equipment items, valued at about $6.4 million, identified during physical inventories performed during fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Missing items were often not reported for several months and, in some cases, several years. It is very difficult to investigate these losses because information on specific events and circumstances at the time of the losses is not known. GAO's limited tests of computer hard drives in the excess property disposal process found hard drives at two of the four case study locations that contained personal information, including veterans' names and Social Security numbers. GAO's tests did not find any remaining data after sanitization procedures were performed. However, weaknesses in physical security at IT storage locations and delays in completing the data sanitization process heighten the risk of data breach. Although VA management has taken some actions to improve controls over IT equipment, including strengthening policies and procedures, improving the overall control environment for sensitive IT equipment will require a renewed focus, oversight, and continued commitment throughout the organization."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent audit of controls over  information technology (IT) equipment at the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA).

Today, I will summarize the  results of our recent work, the details of which are included in our audit  report, which the Subcommittee is releasing today. This audit followed a  July 2004 report in which we identified weak practices and lax  implementation of controls over equipment at the six VA medical centers  we audited. As a result, personnel at the VA medical centers located fewer  than half of the 100 items we selected for testing at each of five medical  centers and 62 of 100 items at the sixth medical center. Most of the items  that could not be located were computer equipment.", "For today\u2019s testimony, I will provide the highlights of our current findings  related to  the risk of theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment at selected  VA locations;    whether selected VA locations have adequate procedures in place to  assure physical security and accountability over IT equipment in the  excess property disposal process; and    what actions VA management has taken to address identified IT  equipment inventory control weaknesses.", "My statement is based on our report on VA IT inventory controls, which  you are releasing today.

Because of a lack of user-level accountability and  the failure to consistently update inventory records for inventory status  and user location changes, VA officials at our test locations could not  determine the user or type of data stored on this equipment and therefore  the risk posed by the loss of these items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pervasive Lack of User- Level Accountability for IT Equipment at Case Study Locations", "paragraphs": ["VA management has not enforced VA property management policy and has  generally left implementation decisions up to local organizations, creating  a nonstandard, high-risk environment. Although VA property management  policy establishes guidelines for user-level accountability, the three  medical centers we tested assigned accountability for most IT equipment  to their information resource management (IRM) or IT Services  organizations, and VA headquarters organizations tracked IT equipment  items through their IT inventory coordinators. However, because these  personnel did not have possession (physical custody) of all IT equipment  under their purview, they were not held accountable for IT equipment  determined to be missing during physical inventories. Because of this  weak overall control environment, we concluded that at the four case  study locations essentially no one was accountable for IT equipment.", "Absent user-level accountability, accurate information on the using  organization and location of IT equipment is critical to maintaining  effective asset visibility and control over IT equipment items. However, as  table 1 shows, we identified high failure rates in our tests for correct user  organization and location of IT equipment. Because property management  system inventory records were inaccurate, it is not possible to determine  the timing or events associated with lost IT equipment as a basis for  holding individual employees accountable.", "Although our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  requires timely recording of transactions as part of an effective internal  control structure and safeguarding of sensitive assets, we found that VA\u2019s  property management policy neither specified what transactions were to  be recorded for various changes in inventory status nor provided criteria  for timely recording.

As of February 28, 2007, the four case study  locations covered in our current audit reported over 2,400 missing IT  equipment items with a combined original acquisition value of about      $6.4 million as a result of inventories they performed during fiscal years  2005 and 2006. Based on information obtained through March 2, 2007, the  five case study locations we previously audited had identified over 8,600  missing IT equipment items with a combined original acquisition value of  over $13.2 million, $12.4 million of which was identified at the Los Angeles  medical center. Because inventory records were not consistently updated  as changes in user organization or location occurred and none of the  locations we audited required accountability at the user level, it is not  possible to determine whether the missing IT equipment items represent  recordkeeping errors or the loss, theft, or misappropriation of IT  equipment. Further, missing IT equipment items were often not reported  for several months and, in some cases, several years. Although physical  inventories should be performed over a finite period, at most of the case  study locations, these inventories were not completed for several months  or even several years while officials performed extensive searches in an  attempt to locate missing items before preparing Reports of Survey to  write them off. According to VA Police and security specialists, it is very  difficult to conduct an investigation after significant amounts of time have  passed because the details of the incidents cannot be determined.", "The timing and scope of the physical inventories performed by the case  study locations varied. For example, the Indianapolis medical center had  performed annual physical inventories in accordance with VA policy for  several years. The Washington, D.C., medical center performed a wall-to- wall physical inventory in response to our July 2004 report. In this case,  inventory results reflected several years of activity involving IT inventory  records that had not been updated and lost and missing IT equipment  items that had not previously been identified and reported.

However, not all of the formally designated storage locations at two  medical centers had required motion detection alarm systems and special  door locks. We also found numerous instances of informal IT storage areas  at VA headquarters that did not meet VA physical security requirements. In  addition, although VA requires that hard drives of IT equipment and  medical equipment be sanitized prior to disposal to prevent unauthorized  release of sensitive personal and medical information, we found  weaknesses in the disposal process that pose a risk of data breach related  to sensitive personal information residing on hard drives in the property  disposal process that have not yet been sanitized."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weaknesses in Procedures for Controlling Excess Computer Hard Drives", "paragraphs": ["VA requires that hard drives of excess computers be sanitized prior to  reuse or disposal because they can store sensitive personal and medical  information used in VA programs and activities, which could be  compromised and used for unauthorized purposes.

For  example, at the VA headquarters building, our investigator found that the  physical security specialist was unaware of the existence of IT equipment  in some storerooms. Consequently, these storerooms had not been  subjected to required physical security inspections. Further, during our  statistical tests, we observed one IT equipment storeroom in the VA  headquarters building IT Support Services area that had a separate wall,  but no door. The wall opening into the storeroom had yellow tape labeled  \u201cCAUTION\u201d above the doorway. The storeroom was within an IT work  area that had dropped ceilings that could provide \u201cup and over\u201d access  from adjacent rooms, and it did not meet VA\u2019s physical security  requirements for motion intrusion detection and alarms and secure doors,  locks, and special access keys. In another headquarters building, we  observed excess IT equipment stacked in the corners of a large work area  that had multiple doors and open access to numerous individuals. We also  found that VA headquarters IT coordinators used storerooms and closets  with office-type door locks and locked filing cabinets in open areas to  store IT equipment that was not currently in use.

For example, pursuant to recommendations made in our July 2004  report, VA updated its property management policy to clarify that IT  equipment valued at under $5,000 is to be included in annual inventories.  However, as noted in this testimony and described in more detail in our  companion report, VA had not taken action to assure that these items  were, in fact, subjected to physical inventory. In addition, the new CIO  organization has no formal responsibility for medical equipment that  stores or processes patient data and does not address roles or necessary  coordination between IRM and property management personnel with  regard to inventory control of IT equipment. The Assistant Secretary for  Information and Technology, who serves as the CIO, told us that the new  CIO organization structure will include a unit that will have responsibility  for IT equipment asset management once it becomes operational.

To provide  a framework for accountability and security of IT equipment, the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs needs to establish clear, sufficiently detailed  mandatory agencywide policies rather than leaving the details of how  policies will be implemented to the discretion of local VA organizations.  Keys to safeguarding IT equipment are effective internal controls for the  creation and maintenance of essential transaction records; a disciplined  framework for specific, individual user-level accountability, whereby  employees are held accountable for property assigned to them, including  appropriate disciplinary action for any lost equipment; and maintaining  adequate physical security over IT equipment items. Although VA  management has taken some actions to improve inventory controls,  strengthening the overall control environment and establishing and  implementing specific IT equipment controls will require a renewed focus,  oversight, and continuing commitment throughout the organization. We  appreciate VA\u2019s positive response to our current recommendations and  planned actions to address them.
