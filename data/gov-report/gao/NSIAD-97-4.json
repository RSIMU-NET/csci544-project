Depending on the item involved and the country of destination, an exporter may be required to submit a license application to Commerce to obtain government approval for the export. The U.S. government controls the export of sophisticated machine tools for national security and nuclear nonproliferation reasons. Commerce, in consultation with other agencies such as the Department of Defense (DOD), reviews license applications and makes licensing decisions. Complex or sensitive export cases can be escalated to interagency export licensing review committees for discussion and resolution. Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, along with the U.S. Customs Service, is responsible for ensuring adherence to license provisions by investigating suspected export control violations and pursuing criminal and administrative sanctions.", "McDonnell Douglas and CATIC entered into an agreement in 1992 to co-produce 40 MD-80 and MD-90 aircraft in China for the country\u2019s domestic \u201ctrunk\u201d routes. A contract revision signed in November 1994 reduced the number of aircraft to be built in China to 20 and called for the direct purchase of 20 U.S.-built aircraft. The four Chinese factories involved in the Trunkliner program include the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation, Xian Aircraft Company, Chengdu Aircraft Company, and Shenyang Aircraft Company. The Shanghai facility is responsible for final assembly of the aircraft. All of these factories are under the direction of Aviation Industries Corporation of China (AVIC) and CATIC. CATIC is the principal purchasing arm of China\u2019s military as well as many commercial aviation entities.", "In May 1994, McDonnell Douglas submitted license applications for exporting machine tools to China. The machine tools were to be wholly dedicated to the production of 40 Trunkliner aircraft and related work. Under the Trunkliner program, the Chinese factories were responsible for fabricating and assembling about 75 percent of the airframe structure and the tools were required to produce parts to support the planned 10 aircraft per year production rate.", "The machine tools were to be exported to the CATIC Machining Center. At the time the license applications were being considered, the Machining Center did not yet exist. McDonnell Douglas informed the U.S. government that the Machining Center would be located in Beijing and construction would begin in October 1994. Aircraft parts production would start  14 months later. McDonnell Douglas requested Commerce to approve these applications quickly so that it could export the machine tools to China, where they could be stored at CATIC\u2019s expense until the new facility in Beijing was ready. Appendix I contains a chronology of key events associated with the machine tools McDonnell Douglas exported to China."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Machine Tools Have Military and Civilian Applications", "paragraphs": ["Advanced machine tools have military and civilian applications and are sought by China for industrial modernization efforts. The McDonnell Douglas export license applications included 10 five-axis machines and  2 coordinate measuring machines. (See table 1 for a list of the equipment licensed for export.) The United States controls all these machines for national security or nuclear nonproliferation reasons. China has limited indigenous capability to produce comparable machine tools and, therefore, relies primarily on foreign imports.", "The machine tools McDonnell Douglas exported to China had been used at a U.S. government-owned plant to produce parts for the B-1 bomber, C-17 military transport aircraft, and the Peacekeeper missile. The more advanced machine tools manufactured such items as military aircraft wing structures, fuselage components, and landing gear and engine parts. For example, five-axis machine tools simultaneously cut and form metal in five different directions producing parts with minimal weight and maximum strength, which improves aircraft performance (see fig.1).", "McDonnell Douglas sold machine tools to China to manufacture parts for commercial aircraft. All of these machine tools can manufacture components for commercial aircraft and other products. For example, a stretch press, which forms sheet metal around a three dimensional mold, can form relatively large parts for aircraft fuselage sections and other aircraft structures. Five-axis machine tools can also be used to make tools and dies for auto body panels, medical and industrial equipment, and molds for consumer products.", "According to DOD, the Chinese government wants to buy five-axis machine tools and related equipment to upgrade its military aerospace production facilities as well as its commercial aviation industry. China\u2019s modernization program has emphasized joint military-civilian production and self-sufficiency through the acquisition of key Western dual-use technologies.", "China has had difficulty acquiring advanced machine tools because of multilateral export controls. Until 1994, the United States and other member countries of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls tightly controlled the export of five-axis machine tools to China and other countries. Such sales required prior notification and unanimous consent from the other members. In March 1994, the Committee disbanded, but former members agreed to continue controlling the export of five-axis machine tools, but eliminated prior notification requirements. Industry officials said that China has the capability to manufacture less sophisticated machine tools, but cannot currently mass produce four- and five-axis machine tools that meet Western standards. However, they noted that Japan, Germany, and other countries are marketing advanced machine tools in China."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk of Diversion Recognized and Debated During Licensing Process", "paragraphs": ["Commerce approved the export applications with conditions after about  3 months of interagency discussions and review. During this review process, DOD officials raised several questions about the justification for the export. Their concerns primarily focused on (1) whether the stated end-use on the license applications justified the export; (2) the legitimacy of the CATIC Machining Center, the stated end user of the equipment; and (3) the quantity and capabilities of the machine tools. Prior to approving the licenses, the reviewing agencies added numerous conditions to mitigate the risks identified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Applications Went Through Interagency Review Process", "paragraphs": ["Commerce, State, Energy, DOD, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency officials recognized the risk of diversion, considered it in their deliberations, and added conditions to the licenses to minimize this risk. The export applications were discussed, debated, and ultimately agreed upon at senior levels at these agencies. Because of the significance and complexity of the export, the case was immediately escalated to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP). ACEP is chaired by Commerce and is composed of senior officials from Commerce, State, Energy, DOD, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. It provides a forum for senior-level debate on significant export licensing issues.", "McDonnell Douglas export applications were discussed and debated at several ACEP meetings in the summer of 1994. Commerce and DOD were the primary agencies in the debate about these license applications. Many of the questions raised at these meetings were subsequently addressed by staff at Commerce, DOD, State, or Energy, often after requesting additional information from McDonnell Douglas. To assist in the interagency deliberations, the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency were asked to provide additional information on Chinese acquisition of machine tools and Chinese aviation facilities. The economic impact on McDonnell Douglas of delaying or denying this export was also considered during deliberations.", "DOD\u2019s Defense Technology Security Administration distributed the applications for comment to groups within the agency and throughout DOD. Initially, the Navy, Air Force, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Intelligence Agency raised strong objections or recommended denial of these export applications. Senior officials in the agencies that initially recommended denial eventually agreed to approve these licenses once conditions were added. Several DOD officials noted that approving the licenses with conditions was the best strategy for DOD since the licenses would likely be approved at the ACEP. DOD began to consider what conditions could mitigate the apparent risks almost immediately after receiving the applications from Commerce in June 1994."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commerce Argued the Export Had a Low Risk of Diversion", "paragraphs": ["During the interagency discussions, Commerce officials argued the export of the machine tools involved a low risk of diversion since McDonnell Douglas officials were to be located at the CATIC Machining Center for at least 4 years. They also believed that the machine tools were needed to produce parts for Trunkliner aircraft in China. They noted that, according to McDonnell Douglas officials, the machine tools were between 9 and  26 years old, were not state-of-the-art equipment, and similar or more capable machine tools could be purchased from foreign sources.", "Commerce initially recommended that the applications be approved with conditions restricting the end use to commercial aircraft production and that McDonnell Douglas be required to provide a semi-annual certification that this condition was being met. Commerce urged the other reviewing agencies to act quickly on these licenses. McDonnell Douglas claimed that the Air Force was requiring it to vacate the plant in Ohio by July 5, 1994, and it would be forced to pay high storage fees for the machine tools after that date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Machine Tools Questioned", "paragraphs": ["During the interagency review of the export applications, various DOD officials commented that there was little justification supporting the need for the export. Officials noted that the machine tools would provide substantial excess production capacity to the Chinese aircraft industry that could be directed toward satisfying military requirements. The Defense Intelligence Agency reported that the machine tools represented production capacity above and beyond the requirements necessary for exclusive production of 40 Trunkliner aircraft. DOD also obtained limited documentation indicating that CATIC asked other aircraft facilities in China if they needed any of the machine tools from the Ohio facility.", "DOD concerns were heightened in July 1994 when press reports noted that the production of Trunkliner aircraft in China was to be reduced from 40 to 20 aircraft. During the summer of 1994, in response to questions from DOD, McDonnell Douglas officials stated that they were discussing a reduction to the Trunkliner program with CATIC. In August, however, McDonnell Douglas assured DOD that it had \u201ca firm binding contract for the coproduction of 40 aircraft with CATIC that was agreed to and signed in March 1992.\u201d In other correspondence, McDonnell Douglas noted that in many cases the machines, including the five-axis machine tools, were necessary to supply specific parts whether 1 or 100 aircraft were built.", "Subsequent events indicated that not all of the exported equipment was needed to support Trunkliner aircraft production. After some of the machine tools were diverted to a Chinese military facility not involved in the Trunkliner program, McDonnell Douglas submitted license applications to Commerce to maintain the equipment at this facility to manufacture parts for trainer aircraft and motorcycles. Although all the equipment was eventually transferred to a facility involved in the Trunkliner program, Chinese officials acknowledged they did not need the stretch press."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns About the End User Raised", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials questioned the credibility of the end user of the machine tools\u2014the CATIC Machining Center.

Officials also questioned how these machine tools would be used after the Trunkliner program ended.", "Commerce officials told us that they had previously approved other exports of machine tools for installation at factories not yet built. Commerce officials said that they had done so because machine tools are very large and are easier to install in a new building as construction progresses. However, they could not readily provide us any specific examples where this had been done.

According to senior Commerce officials, it took time to process the amended licenses partly because they wanted to ensure that the Shanghai facility was an acceptable location to transfer the equipment. In response to officials\u2019 questions, McDonnell Douglas indicated the facility had a very small inventory of advanced machine tools and needed the exported equipment to complete its requirements for the Trunkliner program. McDonnell Douglas officials also assured government officials that they had 14 U.S. personnel on site at the Shanghai facility and could monitor the equipment.", "The reviewing agencies agreed in February 1996 that the 12 export license amendments, permitting transfer of all the exported equipment to the Shanghai facility, should be approved with certain conditions.

Later, it subsequently approved relocating the equipment to the Shanghai aviation facility with similar conditions. 1. The only parts programs authorized to be loaded and run in the numerical control device are those authorized for \u201cTrunkline\u201d aircraft and \u201coffset\u201d from McDonnell Douglas project as negotiated with McDonnell Douglas Corporation. 2. Where applicable, the numerical control device (machine control unit) must be modified to provide password protection. Password access is granted to authorized personnel only for authorized parts. 3. The machine tools approved for export must be installed at the CATIC Machining Center. McDonnell Douglas must provide written certification of delivery and installation to Commerce. Should the CATIC facility not be ready when the equipment arrives, the equipment will be stored in one facility. That facility will be subject to the inspection requirements stated in condition no. 5. McDonnell Douglas will notify the U.S. government of the location of the machine tools and notify it if the equipment is moved before the plant is completed. 4. The machines must have a metering device that measures operating time (e.g., a Hobbs Meter). The elapsed operating time will be read and logged into a production logbook on a daily basis. The logbook will be furnished to DOD and the Office of Export Enforcement on a quarterly basis. 5. After installation of the machines, McDonnell Douglas must submit quarterly reports for the next 2 years to the Office of Export Enforcement and DOD. The reports must include information as to whether the equipment is still being used for the purposes approved under the conditions of the licenses, and any discrepancies must be noted in the use of the timing device, password, or other security requirements. A McDonnell Douglas representative will have the right of access to inspect the equipment at any time, wherever located, during normal working hours and whenever the equipment is in operation. Should McDonnell Douglas wish to withdraw its personnel, it must notify the U.S. government well in advance. As agreed with arrangements with the Chinese government, a U.S. government representative will conduct a post-shipment verification visit to the facility after the equipment is installed. 6. None of the equipment may be resold, transferred, or reexported without prior written approval from the U.S. government. 7. This equipment is licensed exclusively for the civilian use of implementing the MD80/90 series McDonnell Douglas design for the development of the Chinese Trunkline and offset from McDonnell Douglas. 8. The equipment will not be used by or for military or nuclear end users or uses. 10. McDonnell Douglas must inform the end user of all conditions. 11. The licenses will be approved only after senior CATIC officials provide assurance that these machines will be used only by the end user for the end uses specified in these licenses. 12. Employees of or contractors to McDonnell Douglas who visit the CATIC facility will report on the use of the equipment as observed during their visits. Such reports will be available to Commerce. Those who observe unauthorized use of the equipment must report these discrepancies immediately to Commerce. 13. No parts produced by this equipment that are on the U.S. commodity control list for national security or nuclear nonproliferation reasons can be exported by CATIC to Libya, Cuba, or North Korea (country groups S or Z). 14. McDonnell Douglas must advise the U.S. government of any changes in the negotiated contract for 40 Trunkline aircraft. Notification must include any increase or reduction in aircraft or offset production requirements. If the McDonnell Douglas Trunkline contract is renegotiated below 40 aircraft, these machine tools could still only be used to produce parts for the Trunkline aircraft and McDonnell Douglas offsets. Any machining capacity freed up by a reduction in the production requirements will be viewed as excess capacity by the U.S. government and considered in any future Chinese machine tool licensing actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Commerce\u2019s letter dated October 11, 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The report accurately notes that the equipment was relocated before it was misused. The diversion of the machine tools to Nanchang, a facility engaged in military production, does not support Commerce\u2019s statement that concerns over the military utility of this equipment was overstated. The Chinese were only able to partially install the stretch press and did not uncrate the other equipment because the diversion was discovered. 2. We have modified the text of the report to address this comment. 3. We agree that a court of law may ultimately examine whether a legal violation occurred and who was responsible and have modified the report accordingly. However, Commerce, in a letter to McDonnell Douglas, indicated that the movement of the equipment to Nanchang and the partial installation of the stretch press was a \u201cdirect violation of the conditions under which the equipment was originally authorized for export to China.\u201d 4. Commerce stated that its top priority was to quickly relocate the equipment to an acceptable facility. As discussed in our report, all the equipment was relocated to an approved facility about 17 months after the diversion was first reported. Commerce also noted in its comments that it needed to continue the investigation in a way that did not adversely affect cooperation from McDonnell Douglas. As discussed in our report, Commerce\u2019s enforcement office did not begin an official investigation until 6 months after the reported diversion and only after requested by DOD. During this time, Commerce\u2019s licensing group worked with McDonnell Douglas on export license amendments to transfer the equipment to an acceptable facility. 5.

McDonnell Douglas makes this generalized statement several times in its letter. However, we have carefully reviewed its specific comments as well as the evidence we obtained from multiple sources and continue to believe that the presentation in the report is accurate. 2. Although the amendment to the Trunkliner agreement was signed in November 1994, Commerce documents clearly indicate that an agreement in principle to amend the contract had been reached as early as May 1994. DOD licensing officials first learned of the possible reduction in the Trunkliner program in July 1994 from press reports, not McDonnell Douglas. However, McDonnell Douglas in an August letter to DOD, assured DOD that it had a firm binding contract for the coproduction of 40 aircraft. 3. The reduction in the number of aircraft to be built in China is relevant to CATIC\u2019s need for the machine tools. The amendment to the Trunkliner agreement calling for the direct purchase of 20 U.S.-built aircraft meant that most of the parts for these aircraft would come from existing McDonnell Douglas suppliers, not from new production facilities to be built in China. According to a government official, one of the reasons for the contract amendment was to speed up deliveries of aircraft to Chinese airlines rather than wait until the Chinese Trunkliner factories were able to produce complete aircraft. By August 1996, deliveries of the 20 U.S.-built aircraft had already begun under this amended contract even though none of the exported machine tools were yet operational.", "The report acknowledges that McDonnell Douglas noted in its export applications that the machine tools would also be used by CATIC to perform related offset work (i.e., production of parts for U.S.-built McDonnell Douglas aircraft). However, during the licensing review process, neither McDonnell Douglas nor the reviewing agencies took the position that offset work was the major justification for approval of these export license applications. 4. The observation that not all of the equipment was needed to support Trunkliner aircraft production is supported by more than just the observation that existing Trunkliner factories had stretch presses with sufficient capacity to perform Trunkliner work. As noted in the report, CATIC, McDonnell Douglas\u2019 partner in producing Trunkliner aircraft in China, diverted not only the stretch press but also one five-axis machine tool, three three-axis machine tools, and one coordinate measuring machine to the Nanchang Aircraft Company\u2014a factory not involved in Trunkliner production. McDonnell Douglas then asked the Commerce Department to allow these machine tools to remain at Nanchang for production unrelated to the Trunkliner program. The diversion of the tools to Nanchang and the submission of license amendments to permit the tools to remain in a non-Trunkliner factory do not support the statement that all of these tools were required for Trunkliner production as McDonnell Douglas indicated during the export application process. 5. We agree that McDonnell Douglas was to vacate the Ohio plant in the summer of 1994. However, as noted in the report, McDonnell Douglas told the reviewing agencies that the Air Force, not McDonnell Douglas, was requiring it to leave the plant in Ohio by July 5, 1994, and it would be forced to pay high storage fees for the machine tools after that date. Further, in August 1994, McDonnell Douglas told DOD that \u201cstorage is running at $45,000 per month\u201d and urged action on the licenses so that \u201cmounting storage costs can be curtailed.\u201d As noted in the report and acknowledged by McDonnell Douglas in its comments, McDonnell Douglas, not the Air Force, set the dates it had to leave the plant in Ohio. Further, as noted in our report, beginning in September 1994, the Air Force actually charged the company about $7,500 per month for storage fees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Karen S.
