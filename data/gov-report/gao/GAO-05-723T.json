The report released today highlights that DOD still does not have management controls to ensure that its business systems investments are directed towards integrated corporate system solutions. GAO's reports continue to show that fundamental problems with DOD's financial management and related business operations result in substantial waste and inefficiency, adversely impact mission performance, and result in a lack of adequate accountability across all major business areas. Over the years, DOD leaders attempted to address these weaknesses and transform the department. For years, GAO has reported that DOD is challenged in its efforts to effect fundamental financial and business management reform and GAO's ongoing work continues to raise serious questions about DOD's chances of success. Congress asked GAO to provide information on the (1) pervasive long-standing financial and business management weaknesses that affect DOD's efficiency, (2) cost of and control over the department's business systems investments, and (3) legislative actions needed to enhance the success of DOD's business transformation efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overhauling the financial management and business operations of one of the largest and most complex organizations in the world represents a daunting challenge. Eight DOD program areas, representing key business functions, are on GAO's high-risk list, and the department shares responsibility for six other governmentwide high-risk areas, meaning that DOD is fully or partially responsible for 14 of the 25 high-risk areas in the federal government. DOD's substantial financial and business management weaknesses adversely affect not only its ability to produce auditable financial information, but also to provide accurate, complete, and timely information for management and Congress to use in making informed decisions. Further, the lack of adequate accountability across all of DOD's major business areas results in billions of dollars in annual wasted resources in a time of increasing fiscal constraint and has a negative impact on mission performance. The department has recently taken several steps to address provisions of the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act which are aimed at improving DOD's business systems management practices. For example, DOD has established the Defense Business Systems Management Committee to oversee its business systems modernization efforts. However, DOD's overall transformation efforts have not adequately addressed the key causes of past reform failures. Lessons learned from these previous reform attempts include the need for sustained leadership at the highest level and a strategic and integrated plan. The seriousness of DOD's weaknesses underscores the importance of no longer condoning the \"status quo.\" To improve the likelihood that DOD's transformation efforts will succeed, GAO proposes that business systems funding be appropriated to the approval authorities responsible for business systems investments. Additionally, GAO suggests that a senior management position be established to provide sustained leadership for DOD's overall business transformation. Absent this unified responsibility, authority, accountability, and control of funding, DOD's transformation efforts are likely to fail."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It is a pleasure to be back before this Subcommittee to discuss business  transformation efforts at the Department of Defense (DOD).

DOD spends billions  of dollars each year to sustain key business operations that support our  forces, including systems and processes related to acquisition and contract  management, financial management, supply chain management, support  infrastructure management, human capital management, and other key  areas. Recent and ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and  new homeland defense missions have led to higher demands on our forces  in a time of growing fiscal challenges for our nation. In an effort to better  manage DOD\u2019s resources, the Secretary of Defense has appropriately  placed a high priority on transforming key business processes to improve  their efficiency and effectiveness in supporting the department\u2019s military  mission.", "However, as discussed in the report being released at this hearing and  previous reports and testimonies, fundamental problems with DOD\u2019s  financial management and related business operations continue to cause  substantial waste and inefficiency, have an adverse impact on mission  performance, and result in the lack of adequate transparency and  appropriate accountability across all major business areas. Of the 25 areas  on GAO\u2019s governmentwide high-risk list, 8 are DOD specific program areas  related to key business functions, and the department shares responsibility  for 6 other high-risk areas that are governmentwide in scope.   These  problems preclude the department from producing reliable and timely  information to make sound decisions and to accurately report on its  trillions of dollars of assets and liabilities.", "Today, my testimony will focus on two of the high-risk areas\u2014financial  management and business systems modernization.

For  fiscal year 2005, the department received an annual appropriation of about  $417 billion and was appropriated about $76 billion for the global war on  terrorism.  Execution of DOD\u2019s operations spans a wide range of defense  organizations, including the military services and their respective major  commands and functional activities, numerous large defense agencies and  field activities, and various combatant and joint operational commands  that are responsible for military operations for specific geographic regions  or theaters of operation.

We found a broad  range of reimbursement problems that included disputed amounts for  meals that we estimated to be as high as about $6,000 for each of  76 soldiers in one case study that remained unpaid by the end of our  review. Until DOD improves the antiquated process that requires Army  Guard soldiers to accumulate, retain, and submit numerous paper  documents, reimbursement problems and inefficiencies will likely  continue. Of approximately 930,000 travel vouchers received between  fiscal years 2002 and 2004, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  (DFAS) Contingency Travel Operations Office rejected and returned  about 139,000 vouchers to soldiers for additional paper documentation  or to correct other processing deficiencies.

The current  stovepiped, nonintegrated systems are labor-intensive and require  extensive error-prone manual entry and reentry.  Inadequate controls  resulted in some soldiers experiencing significant gaps in their pay and  medical benefits, causing hardships for the soldiers and their families.   In addition, because these soldiers no longer had valid active duty  orders, they did not have access to the commissary and post  exchange\u2014which allows soldiers and their families to purchase  groceries and other goods at a discount.  In one case we reviewed,  during a 12-month period, while attempting to obtain care for injuries  sustained from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, one Special Forces  soldier fell out of active duty status four times.  During the times he was  not recorded in the system as being on active duty, he was not paid and  he and his family experienced delays in receiving medical treatment.

These  problems distracted soldiers from their missions, imposed financial  hardships on their families, and may have a negative impact on  retention.  The processes and automated systems relied on to provide  active duty payments to mobilized Army Guard and Reserve soldiers are  so error-prone, cumbersome, and complex that neither DOD nor, more  importantly, the soldiers themselves could be reasonably assured of  timely and accurate payments.  Some of the pay problems soldiers  experienced often lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of time,  some for over a year.", "DOD continues to lack visibility and control over the supplies and spare  parts it owns. Therefore, it cannot monitor the responsiveness and  effectiveness of the supply system to identify and eliminate choke  points. Currently, DOD does not have the ability to provide timely or  accurate information on the location, movement, status, or identity of its  supplies. Although total asset visibility has been a departmentwide goal  for over 30 years, DOD estimates that it will not achieve this visibility  until the year 2010. DOD may not meet this goal by 2010, however,  unless it overcomes three significant impediments: (1) developing a  comprehensive plan for achieving visibility, (2) building the necessary  integration among its many inventory management information systems,  and (3) correcting long-standing data accuracy and reliability problems  within existing inventory management systems. A key to successful  implementation of a comprehensive logistics strategy will be addressing  these initiatives as part of a comprehensive, integrated business  transformation.", "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and each of the military services  experienced significant shortages of critical spare parts, even though  more than half of DOD\u2019s reported inventory\u2014about $35 billion\u2014 exceeded current operating requirements. In many cases, these  shortages contributed directly to equipment downtime, maintenance  problems, and the services\u2019 failure to meet their supply availability  goals. DOD, DLA, and the military services each lack strategic  approaches and detailed plans that could help mitigate these critical  spare parts shortages and guide their many initiatives aimed at  improving inventory management.", "The Navy did not know how much it spent on telecommunications and  did not have detailed cost and inventory data needed to evaluate  spending patterns and to leverage its buying power. At the four case  study sites we audited, management oversight of telecommunication  purchases did not provide reasonable assurance that requirements were  met in the most cost-effective manner. For example, cell phone usage at  three sites was not monitored to determine whether plan minutes met  users\u2019 needs, resulting in overpayment for cell phone services. In  addition, the Navy lacks specific policies and processes addressing the  administration and management of calling cards.  On one card alone, in  a 3-month period, the Navy paid over $17,000. Not until the vendor\u2019s  fraud unit raised questions about more than $11,000 in charges in a 6-day  period was the card suspended.", "Over the years, DOD recorded billions of dollars of disbursements and  collections in suspense accounts because the proper appropriation  accounts could not be identified and charged.  Because documentation  needed to resolve these payment recording problems could not be found  after so many years, DOD requested and received authority to write-off  certain aged suspense transactions.  While DOD reported that it wrote  off an absolute value of $35 billion or a net value of $629 million using  the legislative authority, neither of these amounts accurately represents  the true value of all the individual transactions that DOD had not  correctly recorded in its financial records.  Many of DOD\u2019s accounting  systems and processes routinely offset individual disbursements,  collections, adjustments, and correction entries against each other and,  over time, amounts might even have been netted more than once.  This  netting and summarizing misstated the total value of the write-offs and  made it impossible for DOD to identify what appropriations may have  been under- or overcharged or to determine whether individual  transactions were valid.  At December 31, 2004, DOD reports showed  that, even after the write-offs, more than $1.3 billion (absolute value)  remained in suspense accounts for longer than 60 days; however, DOD  has acknowledged that its suspense reports are incomplete and  inaccurate.  In addition, DOD is still not performing effective  reconciliations of its disbursement and collection activity.

This legislation defines the scope of the  various business areas (e.g., acquisition, finance, logistics, and etc.), and  established functional approval authority and responsibility for  management of the portfolio of business systems with the relevant under  secretary of defense for the departmental core business mission areas and  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information  Integration (information technology infrastructure). For example, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics is  now responsible and accountable for any defense business system  intended to support acquisition activities, logistics activities, or  installations and environment activities for DOD.", "This legislation also requires that the responsible approval authorities  establish a hierarchy of investment review boards, the highest level being  DBSMC, with DOD-wide representation, including the military services and  defense agencies. The boards are responsible for reviewing and approving  investments to develop, operate, maintain, and modernize business  systems for their business-area portfolio, including ensuring that  investments are consistent with DOD\u2019s BEA.", "Although this recently enacted legislation clearly defines the roles and  responsibilities of business systems investment approval authorities,  control over the budgeting for and execution of funding for business  systems investment activities remains at the DOD component level. As a  result, DOD continues to have little or no assurance that its business  systems investment money is being spent in an economical, efficient, and  effective manner. Given that DOD spends billions on business systems and  related infrastructure each year, we believe it is critical that those  responsible for business systems improvements control the allocation and  execution of funds for DOD business systems. However, implementation  may require review of the various statutory authorities for the military  services and other DOD components. Control over business systems  investment funds would improve the capacity of DOD\u2019s designated  approval authorities to fulfill their responsibilities and gain transparency  over DOD investments, and minimize the parochial approach to systems  development that exists today.", "In addition, to improve coordination and integration activities, we suggest  that all approval authorities coordinate their business systems  modernization efforts with a CMO who would chair the DBSMC. Cognizant  business area approval authorities would also be required to report to  Congress through a CMO and the Secretary of Defense on applicable  business systems that are not compliant with review requirements and to  include a summary justification for noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chief Management Official Is Essential for Sustained Leadership of Business Management Reform", "paragraphs": ["As DOD embarks on large-scale business transformation efforts, we believe  that the complexity and long-term nature of these efforts requires the  development of an executive position capable of providing strong and  sustained change management leadership across the department\u2014and  over a number of years and various administrations. One way to ensure  such leadership would be to create by legislation a full-time executive-level  II position for a CMO, who would serve as the Deputy Secretary of Defense  for Management. This position would elevate, integrate, and institutionalize  the high-level attention essential for ensuring that a strategic business  transformation plan\u2014as well as the business policies, procedures, systems,  and processes that are necessary for successfully implementing and  sustaining overall business transformation efforts within DOD\u2014are  implemented and sustained. An executive-level II position for a CMO would  provide this individual with the necessary institutional clout to overcome  service parochialism and entrenched organizational silos, which in our  opinion need to be streamlined below the service secretaries and other  levels.", "The CMO would function as a change agent, while other DOD officials  would still be responsible for managing their daily business operations. The  position would divide and institutionalize the current functions of the  Deputy Secretary of Defense into a Deputy Secretary who, as the alter ego  of the Secretary, would focus on policy-related issues such as military  transformation, and a Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, the  CMO, who would be responsible and accountable for the overall business  transformation effort and would serve full-time as the strategic integrator  of DOD\u2019s business transformation efforts by, for example, developing and  implementing a strategic and integrated plan for business transformation  efforts. The CMO would not conduct the day-to-day management functions  of the department; therefore, creating this position would not add an  additional hierarchical layer to the department. Day-to-day management  functions of the department would continue to be the responsibility of the  undersecretaries of defense, the service secretaries, and others. Just as the  CMO would need to focus full-time on business transformation, we believe  that the day-to-day management functions are so demanding that it is  difficult for these officials to maintain the oversight, focus, and momentum  needed to implement and sustain needed reforms of DOD\u2019s overall business  operations. This is particularly evident given the demands that the Iraq and  Afghanistan postwar reconstruction activities and the continuing war on  terrorism have placed on current leaders. Likewise, the breadth and  complexity of the problems and their overall level within the department  preclude the under secretaries, such as the DOD Comptroller, from  asserting the necessary authority over selected players and business areas  while continuing to fulfill their other responsibilities.", "If created, we believe that the new CMO position could be filled by an  individual appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, for a  set term of 7 years.  As prior GAO work examining the experiences of  major change management initiatives in large private and public sector  organizations has shown, it can often take at least 5 to 7 years until such  initiatives are fully implemented and the related cultures are transformed  in a sustainable way. Articulating the roles and responsibilities of the  position in statute would also help to create unambiguous expectations and  underscore Congress\u2019s desire to follow a professional, nonpartisan,  sustainable, and institutional approach to the position. In that regard, an  individual appointed to the CMO position should have a proven track  record as a business process change agent in large, complex, and diverse  organizations\u2014experience necessary to spearhead business process  transformation across DOD.", "Furthermore, to improve coordination and integration activities, we  suggest that all business systems modernization approval authorities  designated in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2005 coordinate their efforts with the CMO, who would chair  the DBSMC that DOD recently established to comply with the act. We also  suggest that cognizant business area approval authorities would also be  required to report to Congress through the CMO and the Secretary of  Defense on applicable business systems that are not compliant with review  requirements and include a summary justification for noncompliance. In  addition, the CMO would enter into an annual performance agreement with  the Secretary that sets forth measurable individual goals linked to overall  organizational goals in connection with the department\u2019s business  transformation efforts. Measurable progress toward achieving agreed-upon  goals should be a basis for determining the level of compensation earned,  including any related bonus. In addition, the CMO\u2019s achievements and  compensation should be reported to Congress each year.  As previously  noted, on April 14, 2005, a bill was introduced in the Senate that requires  the establishment of a CMO who would be appointed by the President and  confirmed by the Senate, for a set term of 7 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["DOD lacks the efficient and effective financial management and related  business operations, including processes and systems, to support the war  fighter, DOD management, and Congress. With a large and growing fiscal  imbalance facing our nation, achieving tens of billions of dollars of annual  savings through successful DOD transformation is increasingly important.  Recent legislation pertaining to defense business systems, enterprise  architecture, accountability, and modernization, if properly implemented,  should improve oversight and control over DOD\u2019s significant system  investment activities. However, DOD\u2019s transformation efforts to date have  not adequately addressed key underlying causes of past reform failures.  Reforming DOD\u2019s business operations is a monumental challenge and many  well-intentioned efforts have failed over the last several decades. Lessons  learned from these previous reform attempts include the need for sustained  and focused leadership at the highest level.  This leadership could be  provided through the establishment of a CMO. Absent this leadership,  authority, and control of funding, the current transformation efforts are  likely to fail.", "I commend the Subcommittee for holding this hearing and I encourage you  to use this vehicle, on an annual basis, as a catalyst for long overdue  business transformation at DOD.
