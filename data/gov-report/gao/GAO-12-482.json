These include internal controls and analysis of return on investment. DOD has included certain internal controls, such as defining key areas of authority for IUID implementation, and it is revising policy to incorporate IUID. However, DOD does not have performance measures, such as reliable schedules for predicting when its enterprise information systems will be able to manage items using IUID data, or a full estimate of IUID\u0092s cost and benefits. Without a management framework that includes such key practices, DOD has faced challenges in implementing IUID technology and may not be well positioned to achieve potential financial and nonfinancial benefits.", "DOD\u0092s data on the number of items already in its inventory\u0097legacy items\u0097marked with IUID labels to date is incomplete and DOD lacks assurance that contractors are sufficiently marking newly-acquired items and government-furnished property.

However, DOD does not have complete information on the total number of legacy items its components have marked and must mark in the future; does not have a full set of quantifiable goals or interim milestones corresponding to its IUID marking criteria\u0097such as certain items that cost $5,000 or more\u0097and does not use consistent criteria among its components to track progress. Without the components reporting complete and comparable data, DOD\u0092s ability to assess progress in marking legacy items will remain limited. Also, DOD does not have assurance that contractors are sufficiently marking newly-acquired items and government-furnished property. DOD reported that as of January 2012, over 2,500 contractors had marked or registered over 11 million items. However, DOD does not require the components to examine and report on all types of contracts that should include IUID marking clauses, nor does it have policies and procedures that provide for systematic assessment of the sufficiency of data contained in these items\u0092 labels. Hence, DOD cannot know the full extent to which contractors are supplying IUID labels with the data needed to track items.", "DOD\u0092s ability to track and share unique item identifier (UII) data across components is hampered by the lack of full integration of data into components\u0092 enterprise information systems. DOD has made some progress but faces challenges as it proceeds with its integration plans. DOD is revising its supply chain management policy and guidance to include IUID use, but has not fully defined requirements for using UII data, nor developed complete, integrated master schedules for integrating IUID, DOD-wide and within components\u0092 systems. Such schedules enable agencies to predict the cost and timelines of their systems\u0092 development.

One aspect of accountability is asset  visibility, a key component of DOD\u2019s management of its supply chain.  DOD describes asset visibility as the ability to provide timely and accurate  information on the location, quantity, condition, movement, and status of  items in its inventory. Limitations in asset visibility\u2014such as a lack of  interoperability among information technology (IT) systems, or challenges  in instituting new technologies for tracking assets\u2014make it difficult to  obtain this information in a timely and accurate fashion. One of the tools  that DOD plans to use to improve asset visibility is a technology called  item unique identification (IUID). This technology allows DOD to assign a  unique number to an individual item and then use that unique number to  manage that item in a variety of logistics processes. For example,  according to DOD, tracking assets with IUID technology could enhance  logistical efficiency and improve DOD\u2019s visibility of these assets. We have  long reported that DOD supply chain management is a high-risk area, due  in part to ineffective and inefficient inventory management practices and  procedures, and challenges in achieving widespread implementation of  key technologies aimed at improving asset visibility. We have also  previously reported on challenges DOD has faced in instituting new  technologies for improving asset visibility,and processes DOD continues to have difficulties in systematically  identifying and managing individual items throughout their life cycles.", "In 2003, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics issued DOD\u2019s first policy on IUID technology,  directing DOD components\u2014the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force,  and Defense Logistics Agency\u2014to include IUID marking requirements in  contracts for certain types of items. In 2004, this office established the  requirement for DOD components to mark items already in their  inventories\u2014known as legacy items\u2014with IUID labels. Contractors and  components mark items with IUID by placing a label on the item. IUID  labels contain information printed on them, and also encoded in a two- dimensional bar code image, referred to as a data matrix. These data  matrices contain various pieces of information that\u2014when combined\u2014 make up a globally unique string of numbers referred to as the item\u2019s  unique item identifier (UII). DOD has established criteria for the types of  items that are required to be marked with IUID labels. According to  DOD, it has tens of millions of items in its inventory that meet these  criteria. It is DOD\u2019s goal for its components to share UII data  departmentwide, and the components are to use these data for tracking  these items.", "The task force was formed at the direction of the Joint Logistics Board on July 7, 2009,  and was tasked to assess IUID implementation across DOD.

One of the best cost-estimation practices  is that historical data are important for creating credible cost estimates.  Because the task force used historical cost data in development of IUID  cost estimates, we collected and reviewed the components\u2019 estimates of  historical IUID spending. In addition, we collected and reviewed the  components\u2019 fiscal year 2012 budget requests for IUID implementation,  and the task force\u2019s analysis of the potential costs and benefits of IUID  implementation. To determine the extent to which the DOD components  have marked legacy items with IUID and taken steps to ensure that  newly-acquired items and government-furnished property are sufficiently  marked by contractors with IUID, we reviewed DOD\u2019s criteria for IUID  marking and its plans for marking items. We also gathered data on the  number of legacy items in components\u2019 inventories, and how many had  been marked as of October 2011. In addition, we reviewed the Defense  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clauses that require  contractors to mark or register newly-acquired items and government- furnished property, and we gathered data from DOD on contractor- marked items. To determine the extent to which DOD has developed the  capability to share UII data across DOD in its enterprise information  systems, we reviewed our previously published work on best practices for  developing schedules for these systems; reviewed existing schedules  for these systems; and reviewed other system planning documents. We  reviewed a variety of DOD\u2019s IUID implementation efforts and visited  selected sites (based on a non-generalizable, judgmental sample) to  observe key IUID activities; these sites represent each DOD component  and were selected in part based on the type of IUID activity performed at  each. For all our objectives, we interviewed officials knowledgeable about  DOD\u2019s IUID implementation efforts. We assessed the reliability of data  provided by DOD by reviewing existing information about the data and the  systems that produced the data and by interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data to determine the steps taken to ensure the  accuracy and completeness of the data.

First,  each item that qualifies for IUID marking\u2014according to DOD\u2019s criteria\u2014is  labeled. IUID labels often contain some human-readable information,  printed as text on the label. The amount and type of human-readable  information varies, but it often contains key details about the item, such  as its National Stock Number, part number, or serial number. These are  categories that DOD components use to identify items in their inventories.  In certain cases, items do not have labels attached to them, and instead  are labeled through a process known as direct part marking, in which the  human- and machine-readable information are applied directly to the  item. In addition, each individual label contains information about the  item, encoded in a machine-readable, two-dimensional image printed on  the label. Known as a data matrix, this image contains various pieces of  information encoded in a two-dimensional bar code. Figure 1 shows a  data plate with an IUID data matrix in the lower right-hand corner.", "When combined, the pieces of information encoded in the data matrix  make up a globally unique string of numbers referred to as the item\u2019s UII  number. To ensure that all items marked with IUID labels are globally  unique, DOD requires that UII numbers be formatted according to  international standards for syntax format. Further, UII numbers must be  entered into DOD\u2019s IUID Registry. The registry is a database intended to  ensure that each UII number is unique. An item\u2019s UII number may be  entered into the registry in one of two ways: the item is marked with an  IUID label and the UII number associated with that label is registered, or  DOD or contractors can establish a \u201cvirtual\u201d UII number. According to  DOD guidance, these virtual UII numbers are assigned to an item that  has not yet been marked with an IUID label. The guidance states that a  virtual UII number may be used due to economic or logistical  considerations. For example, a DOD component may virtually mark one  item that is embedded in another item, so that DOD does not have to  remove the embedded item solely to mark the embedded item. For legacy  items already in a component\u2019s inventory, marking and registration are  the responsibility of the component. For items that are not yet in DOD\u2019s  inventory and are being delivered to a component\u2014or for property  furnished by the government to a contractor\u2014it is the responsibility of the  contractor to mark or register items. If the UII number in a data matrix is  improperly formatted, it cannot be used to properly identify the item, and  the data matrix must be replaced.", "Second, personnel must electronically read the label\u2019s data matrix, the  two-dimensional bar code in which the item\u2019s UII number is encoded.", "There are several types of tools than can be used for this process,  including hand-held scanners and web-based software that can read an  image of a data matrix. Because data matrices cannot be read visually,  electronically reading the matrices is the only way to access the UII data  they contain. Figure 2 shows an electronic scanner being used to read a  data plate with an IUID data matrix.", "Third, UII data from a data matrix is passed to an IT system. According to  DOD officials, there are a variety of IT systems that have a requirement to  use UII data, and some of these systems currently have the capability to  store UII data. Examples include the Army\u2019s Property Book Unit Supply  Enhanced, the Navy\u2019s Configuration Data Managers Database\u2013Open  Architecture, the Marine Corps\u2019 Joint Asset Maintenance Integrated  Support System, and the Air Force\u2019s Automated Inventory Management  Tool. DOD officials have explained that some of these systems operate in  \u201cpockets\u201d within the components, and do not share UII data across the  components or DOD-wide. For instance, the Air Force\u2019s Automated  Inventory Management Tool contains UII data that is specific to an Air  Force installation, and does not have the capability to share these data  with other installations. DOD\u2019s goal is for the components to share UII  data across each of their individual IT systems, and DOD-wide, between  components. Within DOD, this type of data sharing is characterized as  \u201centerprisewide.\u201d In order to accomplish enterprisewide data sharing of  UII data, the components intend to use certain IT systems referred to as  Enterprise Resource Planning systems. These automated systems  consist of multiple, integrated functional modules that perform a variety of  business-related tasks, such as general-ledger accounting, payroll, and  supply chain management. DOD officials have explained that certain  Enterprise Resource Planning systems will provide the capability to share  UII data enterprisewide, and in this report we are focusing on DOD efforts  to integrate IUID with these systems.IT system, such as an Enterprise Resource Planning system, DOD  intends to store UII data and share these data within and across DOD  organizations.

For example, in a property- accountability process that we observed, each time a weapon was  checked in or out of an armory, personnel scanned the label\u2019s data  matrix; the matrix\u2019s UII number was uploaded into an electronic property  book; and software then matched the weapon\u2019s UII number with data that  identified the weapon\u2019s owner.

In our review of these scorecards, we found  that the components do not report information on either the amount of  money they have spent on IUID implementation, or the amount of money  that they plan to request for IUID implementation.", "In its report, the task force estimates that DOD would need to invest $3.2  billion to realize the benefits of IUID implementation. This estimate  includes several types of costs, such as the cost of marking legacy items  and the labor required to perform various implementation tasks. However,  the estimate does not include the following four costs:", "The task force could not completely estimate the costs associated  with how individual logistics processes would need to change to  incorporate the use of IUID technology, because it did not have  sufficient information about these changes. As a relatively new  technology, IUID is not widely used in existing DOD logistics  processes. That means that the components will have to modify  existing processes to use IUID. DOD has made some progress in  defining the type of logistics processes that would need to change to  incorporate IUID. For example, according to ODASD(SCI), DOD  intends to modify 10 different categories of logistics processes, such  as receipt and distribution of items. DOD has made some progress in  planning for such modifications. For example, the Army Materiel  Command has determined that 11 of its logistics processes will  incorporate IUID functionality through one of the Army\u2019s Enterprise  Resource Planning systems. However, according to Army officials, the  Army has not yet defined the distinct steps at which personnel will use  IUID, within its logistics processes. Further, according to DOD  officials, the components have not determined the full number or type  of business processes within these categories that need to be  modified. In addition, in their 2011 scorecard updates, the Army,  Marine Corps, and Air Force reported challenges or concerns with  progress in defining how their business processes will require  modification because of IUID. Without information on the number of  logistics processes that will require modification and the specific steps  that will need to change to accommodate the incorporation of IUID,  the task force could not have completely estimated costs. Several  DOD officials we spoke with agreed with this assessment, explaining  that without this information, the task force was not able to completely  estimate IUID implementation costs.", "The task force report states that the task force did not include the cost  of modifying Enterprise Resource Planning systems to share and use  UII data because the functionality to use UII data is inherent in these  systems. However, if DOD is to achieve benefits from IUID, Enterprise  Resource Planning systems must have the ability to share and  analyze UII data, and according to DOD officials the ability to perform  these two functions is not always inherent in these systems. For  example, the core software package for one of the Army\u2019s Enterprise  Resource Planning systems has the capability to accept UII data, but  in its current version this capability is not activated. For the system to  accept UII data, the capability must be activated in a future update.  According to DOD officials, such modifications to Enterprise Resource  Planning systems can incur costs. Navy officials explained that the  task force report does not include the additional cost that would be  required to modify the Navy\u2019s systems to communicate with other  components\u2019 systems, or to analyze UII data to improve logistics  processes. By not including certain costs to modify the relevant  Enterprise Resource Planning systems, the task force may have left  out a substantial set of costs.", "The report did not include the full cost of marking newly-acquired  items with IUID. Because the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement contract clauses provide that contractors are responsible  for marking or registering items, contractors are likely to build the cost  of marking items into their contract pricing. Therefore, while contractor  personnel are marking the items in question, this cost is borne by  DOD to the extent that the contractor has built the cost of marking  qualifying items into the costs of the goods or services provided.  According to component officials, the components do not know how  much of a newly-acquired item\u2019s cost is attributable to contractors\u2019  marking of that item. However, according to estimates in the task  force report and provided by the Air Force, contractors\u2019 average cost  to mark a newly-acquired item is about $30 to $50. On the basis of  GAO analysis of information from the DOD registry on the number  and rate of contractors\u2019 registration of newly-acquired items in  January 2012, IUID marking by contractors could result in  approximately $27 million to $45 million in marking costs to the  components per year. This cost is not included in the task force\u2019s  estimate.", "As previously discussed, an IUID label on an item may contain  human-readable information, such as the item\u2019s National Stock  Number. In addition, the label has a data matrix that contains  information about the labeled item. For example, the matrix contains  various pieces of information that make up the globally unique string  of numbers referred to as the item\u2019s UII number. Contractors have  delivered items to DOD that have labels with deficient data matrices. If  a label has a deficient data matrix, DOD cannot use the label\u2019s data  matrix to track or manage items. The task force did not include the  cost to the components of fixing these deficient IUID data matrices on  contractor-marked items. Although component officials were not able  to estimate the financial cost of fixing these data matrices, officials  explained that there is productivity loss associated with fixing them.  For example, according to Army and Marine Corps officials, their  verification of a deficient matrix\u2019s missing or incorrect data requires an  average of 10 to 15 minutes, and sometimes requires significantly  more time, when additional research into the item is needed. This  investment of time, multiplied by many thousands of deficient data  matrices, may result in a substantial amount of lost productivity for  DOD components\u2019 personnel.", "The task force report assessed the potential benefits of IUID  implementation by examining three categories of logistics processes:  intensive item management, property accountability, and product life  cycle management. According to the task force\u2019s analysis, DOD\u2019s  implementation of IUID is unlikely to result in substantial financial benefit  in the categories of intensive item management or property accountability.  However, the report did discuss potential nonfinancial benefits of IUID  implementation in these two categories. The report states that the use of  IUID in intensive item management could enable strict accountability and  control of DOD\u2019s most critical assets\u2014such as nuclear weapon\u2013related  material\u2014across parts of DOD\u2019s supply chain, enhancing the security and  safety of such assets. Moreover, according to the report, implementing  IUID into property-accountability processes on the enterprise level could  enable DOD to track equipment assets throughout their life cycle. The  report explains that one benefit of tracking on the enterprise level is that  DOD may be able to more quickly address equipment losses. Further,  according to an official from the Office of Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy, the use of IUID in DOD\u2019s logistics processes could  lead to improved data quality that may result from automatically entering  data into IT systems, as opposed to manually entering data.", "While the report does not estimate substantial savings through the  integration of IUID with intensive item management or property- accountability processes, the report estimates that IUID implementation  could result in annual savings of $3 billion to $5 billion through the  implementation of IUID in a collection of maintenance processes referred  to as product life cycle management. According to our review of the  report and a task force official, the key to achieving savings through  product life cycle management is to track and manage individual items by  a unique identifier. That approach is called serialized item management.  According to DOD officials and the task force report, DOD can achieve  serialized item management by using any type of unique identifier,  including a traditional serial number; a UII number; or a unique identifier  provided by a different type of technology, such as a radio frequency  identification device or a contact memory button.", "The task force estimated achieving substantial financial benefits from  product life cycle management, but it used a methodology for estimating  these benefits that may not be appropriate to the scale and complexity of  DOD\u2019s IUID implementation efforts. The IUID task force report states that  projected savings will gradually increase as implementation of IUID  spreads throughout DOD and, by fiscal years 2016 to 2017, DOD may  reach a break-even point at which its annual financial savings would  equal its annual spending for implementation of IUID. After fiscal year  2017, the report projects that DOD may pass the break-even point, and  could begin to realize the annual savings of $3 billion to $5 billion.", "To develop its estimate of cost savings through the use of serialized item  management in product life cycle management, the task force used the  following methodology:", "Reviewed case studies of five DOD maintenance programs that use  serialized item management. The task force observed that by using   the maintenance programs reduced  serialized item management,costs by an average of 4 to 6 percent in labor and materiel costs for  maintenance, and in the cost to transport items to maintenance  locations.", "Next, the task force estimated maintenance costs by adding DOD\u2019s  fiscal year 2008 budget for depot- and field-level maintenance to  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget for maintenance transportation, which  together total about $83.2 billion.", "Finally, by applying the 4 to 6 percent reduction to $83.2 billion in  annual maintenance costs, the task force estimated that an annual  savings of $3 billion to $5 billion could result from the use of serialized  item management in product life cycle management maintenance  processes.", "However, three aspects of this methodology call into question whether it  is reasonable to assume that DOD-wide use of IUID technology in  maintenance processes would lead to the savings estimated by the task  force.", "The task force estimated DOD-wide savings on the basis of a limited  number of case studies, and conclusions developed from these  studies may not be applicable to the substantial complexity and size  of the DOD-wide maintenance enterprise. According to the Office of  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy  and Programs, DOD\u2019s maintenance operations support a wide range  of weapon systems including about 280 ships, 14,000 aircraft and  helicopters, 900 strategic missiles, and 30,000 combat vehicles. Our  review of the Task Force report indicates the five case studies  address\u2014in total\u2014five individual weapon systems, whereas DOD  performs maintenance on hundreds of different systems. Moreover,  four of the five case studies address either Air Force or Navy  programs; only one addressed Army programs. Because of the limited  scope of the case studies used by the task force, conclusions based  on these case studies may not apply to the DOD-wide maintenance  budgets that the task force used in its estimation of savings.", "The case studies did not address programs that use IUID as the  technology that provides a unique identifier to track items through  serialized item management. Rather, the case studies addressed  programs that use other means of uniquely tracking items, such as  contact memory buttons. Thus, the case studies do not consider costs  that may be specific to IUID technology, such as the cost to purchase  scanners or software to read data matrices, or the cost to replace  deficient IUID data matrices. Because of this, it may be inaccurate to  assume that maintenance programs using IUID technology will  achieve the same type or amount of savings claimed by the case  studies of programs using other technologies.", "Even when a logistics program experiences cost savings after  introducing a new technology or process, it can be difficult to link the  savings directly to a specific cause or technology. For example, we  visited an installation that is using a combination of IUID, passive  radio frequency identification, new database software, and a  reorganization of warehouse space to reduce the cost of managing its  supply chain. However, an installation official explained that it was not  possible to determine the extent to which the cost savings were  attributable to a specific change, such as the introduction of IUID. For  this reason, it may have been incorrect for the task force to assume a  link between estimated cost savings and the use of a specific  technology such as IUID.", "We have previously reported that every estimate is uncertain because of  the assumptions that must be made about future projections, and  because of this, cost estimators should always perform a sensitivity  analysis that demonstrates the effects on the cost and schedule of an  assumption that may no longer be valid.that DOD could begin to realize financial savings from IUID  implementation after fiscal year 2017, and explains that its cost and  benefit estimates are conditional, depending on a number of  assumptions. However, the task force report does not contain a sensitivity  analysis for either its cost or its benefit estimates. As a result, the task  force\u2019s report does not portray the potential effects of changing key  assumptions on the report\u2019s estimates of cost, financial benefits, or the  time frames in which the report estimates DOD may realize financial  benefits.", "The task force report estimates  There is a substantial amount of uncertainty associated with key  assumptions on which the task force report\u2019s estimates are based. For  example, the task force report states that the cost to mark legacy items is  one of the primary drivers of IUID implementation costs. However, as  discussed in more detail later, DOD may face challenges in determining  the total number of legacy items it must mark. The task force\u2019s cost  estimate does not reflect the range of costs associated with marking a  population of legacy items that\u2014according to DOD estimates\u2014may  range between about 60 million and 122 million items. In addition, the  task force\u2019s estimate of financial benefits assumes that the components\u2019  IT systems, including their Enterprise Resource Planning systems, will  have the capability to use UII data for product life cycle management in  2015. However, as discussed later in the report, the components cannot  reliably predict when their Enterprise Resource Planning systems will be  able to use UII data for product life cycle management. The task force\u2019s  estimate of when DOD will begin to realize these benefits does not reflect  the possibility that the components\u2019 Enterprise Resource Planning  systems will not have this capability in fiscal year 2015.", "Also, the task force\u2019s estimates of financial benefits assume IUID  implementation across each of DOD\u2019s components. However, as  discussed in more detail later, the Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics  Agency are currently not carrying out key IUID implementation efforts. For  example, the Navy is not systematically marking legacy items and the  potential integration of IUID with its Enterprise Resource Planning system  for Supply is unfunded. In addition, the Air Force is not actively integrating  IUID into its Enterprise Resource Planning system. Also, the Defense  Logistics Agency is not marking legacy items. The task force\u2019s estimate of  financial benefits does not consider that some benefits may not be  achieved as a result of DOD\u2019s partial implementation of IUID. Without a  sensitivity analysis of its cost and benefit estimates, the task force report  does not provide DOD leaders with information about how well the  estimates may hold up under reasonable changes to the assumptions on  which the estimates are based."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and Contractors Have Made Some Progress Marking Items with IUID, but DOD Faces Challenges in Assessing Progress toward Goals and Ensuring That Items Are Sufficiently Marked", "paragraphs": ["DOD components and contractors have been marking items with IUID,  but due to several challenges, it is difficult for DOD to assess its progress  in marking items or ensuring that contractors are sufficiently marking  items.

For example, the agency does not have  marking equipment. In addition, agency officials explained that the  agency lacks information on how to appropriately mark legacy items  with IUID labels. According to the officials, the other components  must provide this information to the agency, because the components  manage the items that the agency stores in its inventory.", "With regard to the total number of items to be marked in the future, some  component officials stated that their estimates are incomplete. For  example, Army officials explained that their estimate does not include  certain classified items because the system they used to estimate the  Army\u2019s legacy item inventory does not interface with systems that track  those classified items. Navy officials stated that their estimate does not  include items that are embedded in other items\u2014such as a circuit board  inside of an aircraft\u2014because of system limitations and the time it would  have taken to include these items in the Navy\u2019s estimate. Further,  Defense Logistics Agency officials explained that their estimate does not  include items that are classified by the components as serially managed.  Moreover, the components\u2019 estimates of legacy items to be marked in the  future do not match the estimate of the total number of legacy items to be  marked according to the task force\u2019s report.

Further, while some DOD  components have quantifiable goals for marking certain legacy items,  others do not. As previously discussed, DOD has established IUID  marking criteria for different categories of inventory, such as certain items  with a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or greater; certain items that are  serially managed; certain items that are controlled (sensitive or  classified); and certain depot-level reparable items. We found that some  components had set quantifiable goals using these criteria. For instance,  the Marine Corps has quantifiable goals for each of the categories  defined by DOD\u2019s IUID marking criteria. The Army has quantifiable goals  for each of these categories except for items that are controlled (sensitive  or classified). Neither the Navy nor the Air Force have established  quantifiable goals defined by DOD\u2019s IUID marking criteria.", "Once quantifiable goals have been established, we have previously  reported that metrics for a program\u2019s main efforts\u2014such as interim  milestones and schedules\u2014give decision makers the information needed  to assess progress and estimate realistic completion dates. As previously discussed, we have noted that quantifiable target\u2014such as  interim milestones\u2014can assist organizations in tracking progress toward  their goals. For example, quantifiable interim milestones could assist  DOD in evaluating whether the components are marking legacy items at a  rate that will allow DOD to meet its fiscal year 2015 goal of marking a  \u201cmajority\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d number of legacy items in its inventory.", "As of January 2012, ODASD(SCI), the task force, and the components  had not fully developed quantifiable interim milestones to track progress  toward DOD\u2019s goals for marking legacy items. Neither ODASD(SCI) nor  the task force had set interim milestones for the number of items that  should be marked in fiscal year 2015, DOD\u2019s target date for marking a  \u201cmajority\u201d of legacy items and a \u201csignificant\u201d number of legacy items.  Further, while some components have set interim milestones for tracking  their progress in marking certain legacy items, others have not. For  instance, the Air Force has established interim milestones for the marking   but it is still working  of some legacy items, such as class VII equipment,on developing interim milestones for others, such as class II items. The  Marine Corps has established a goal of completing the marking of about  34 percent of its legacy items by December 2012. However, it has  established no interim milestones. Similarly, neither the Navy nor the  Defense Logistics Agency has developed interim milestones.", "In January 2012, ODASD(SCI) provided us with an IUID timeline  containing targets that are not quantified. The IUID timeline indicates that  ODASD(SCI) expects the components to be marking legacy items at least  through fiscal year 2017. In addition, ODASD(SCI)\u2019s IUID timeline lays  out fiscal year 2012 targets for the components to determine the number  of items they need to mark, and fiscal year 2013 targets for the  components to report on their legacy marking progress to ODASD(SCI).

However, ODASD(SCI) officials stated that  the system does not yet have this capability and they do not yet have an  estimate for when the components could begin their reporting. Until  ODASD(SCI) and the components begin to use such milestones to  assess DOD\u2019s progress in marking legacy items, it is difficult to know  whether DOD\u2019s current number of marked legacy items represents what  DOD intended to achieve, almost 7 years after DOD established the  requirement to mark legacy items.", "GAO/GGD-96-118. milestones, and the tracking of progress with categories defined by  DOD\u2019s IUID marking criteria is summarized in table 3.", "While legacy items are marked by DOD, newly-acquired items and  government-furnished property must be marked by DOD\u2019s contractors.  DOD has made some progress in ensuring that these types of items are  marked by contractors. According to the DOD IUID Registry, more than  2,500 contractors had registered over 11.5 million newly-acquired items in  the registry as of January 2012. DOD plans to eventually finish marking  its legacy items, but contractors will continue to mark items that are  acquired by DOD, or provided by DOD to contractors, and meet its IUID  marking criteria. According to January 2012 data from the DOD IUID  Registry, the number of newly-acquired items and government-furnished  property already exceeds the number of legacy items. If current marking  trends continue, the ratio of these items to legacy items will continue to  increase, and newly-acquired items and government-furnished property  will continue to make up the majority of DOD\u2019s inventory of IUID-labeled  items. For this reason, the future success of DOD\u2019s IUID implementation  efforts depends on having contractors sufficiently mark newly-acquired  items and government-furnished property with IUID labels. While DOD  has made some progress, it cannot currently ensure that contractors are  sufficiently marking all of the items that require IUID labels, for two  reasons: reporting requirements do not provide assurance that  appropriate IUID-marking contract clauses are included, and DOD\u2019s  inspection efforts are not systematic. Without adequate reporting  requirements regarding the components\u2019 insertion of IUID clauses into  applicable contracts, DOD cannot know the extent to which it is requiring  contractors to mark all items that should have IUID labels. And, without  sufficient inspection of IUID data matrices, DOD cannot know the extent  to which contractors are supplying deficient data matrices.", "In order for DOD to use IUID technology to track contractor-marked items  that qualify for IUID marking, DOD and its contractors must take certain  steps to help ensure that qualified items are marked, and that the IUID  marks are usable. These steps are as follows:  in contracts for qualified items, the components must ensure that the  contracts contain appropriate contract clauses and that those clauses  are correctly completed. These clauses require the contractor to mark  or register qualified items;  the contractor must then mark items with an IUID label with a data  matrix that can be read electronically or establish a virtual UII in some  cases; and  the data matrix must contain the necessary information, organized  with the proper data elements and syntax, which must be registered in  DOD\u2019s IUID Registry.", "Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement section 252.211-7003. label and whether that label\u2019s data matrix is formatted according to DOD- wide standards. Officials from several components told us that they had  inspected some newly-acquired items to determine whether these items  were sufficiently marked with IUID labels. For the items they reviewed,  those inspections helped to detect problems in contractors\u2019 marking of  items. Also, since 2009, the Defense Contract Management Agency has  had a surveillance program in place to inspect newly-acquired items and  assess contractors\u2019 compliance with the acquired-items clause.", "A DOD memorandum requires that the components report to the Office of  Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy on only a portion of  contracts that should include the clauses related to IUID. According to  the memorandum, components are required to report on, among other  things, whether the acquired-items clause is present in contracts for  newly-acquired items. However, they are not required to report on  whether the government-furnished property clause is present in contracts  involving government-furnished property. Several components are thus  reporting only on whether they are including the acquired-items clause in  contracts. While the Air Force reports on whether it is including both the  acquired-items clause and the government-property clause in contracts,  the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Defense Logistics Agency report only  on whether they are including the acquired-items clause. While certain  components are reviewing contracts for items that cost more than $5,000  or are serially managed, none of the components are reviewing contracts  for items that meet other DOD IUID marking criteria, such as those for  controlled (sensitive or classified) items. Consequently, DOD does not  know the full extent to which the components are complying with the  requirements to include IUID-related clauses in contracts. Without this  information, DOD may be unable to ensure that contractors are marking  all newly-acquired items and pieces of government-furnished property  that require IUID labels.", "According to DOD officials, it is a good practice for either a DOD  component or the Defense Contract Management Agency to inspect  items to ensure that contractors have marked items with IUID labels, and  that the labels\u2019 data matrices are not deficient. Inspection of newly- acquired items is important because contractors have been delivering  IUID labels with deficient data matrices that cannot be used by DOD.  However, neither the components nor the Defense Contract Management  Agency have been systematically inspecting the data matrices in IUID  labels applied to items by contractors. According to both the Marine  Corps and the Air Force, more than 10 percent of the newly-acquired  items\u2019 data matrices they examined after receipt of the items from the  contractor have been deficient. For example, one Marine Corps  installation reported that from January 2010 through October 2011, there  were 8 months in which more than 10 percent of newly-acquired items  provided by contractors were marked with deficient data matrices.  Problems include having matrices in which the syntax of the UII data was  incorrect or missing key elements; matrices that could not be  electronically read; and matrices that contained a UII number that had not  been registered in DOD\u2019s IUID Registry.", "Although the Marine Corps and Air Force have assessed a portion of the  data matrices on newly-acquired items in their inventories, these  components are not systematically assessing whether contractors are  sufficiently marking these items. For example, the Marine Corps  estimates that it has assessed the sufficiency of contractors\u2019 marking for  about 79 percent of all newly-acquired items\u2019 data matrices in its  inventory. Officials from both the Marine Corps and Air Force explained,  however, that neither has developed a systematic approach for inspecting  these items\u2019 data matrices. According to Army officials, the Army also  lacks a systematic approach to inspecting these items\u2019 data matrices. For  example, the two depots identified by the Army as furthest along in IUID  implementation have not established a policy or set procedures for  assessing the sufficiency of the data matrices of newly-acquired items in  their inventories. Defense Logistics Agency officials explained that  although its personnel do perform various types of inspection and  acceptance procedures on items delivered to its sites, personnel are not  inspecting items\u2019 data matrices. In addition, the Navy does not have a  policy or plans in place to systematically assess newly-acquired items\u2019  data matrices.", "According to the Defense Contract Management Agency\u2019s information  memorandum that describes procedures for inspecting contractors\u2019 data  matrices, the agency\u2019s inspectors are to verify the readability of these  matrices if a scanner for reading matrices is available at the inspection  site. However, as previously discussed, the only way to assess the  functionality of a data matrix is to use a tool that can electronically read  the matrix. Because its memorandum does not require inspectors to  electronically read data matrices in all cases, the Defense Contract  Management Agency cannot ensure that the items it inspects have an  IUID label with a data matrix that can be properly read; that the data  matrix contains the necessary UII data, organized with the proper syntax;  and that the item\u2019s UII number is registered in DOD\u2019s IUID Registry.  Furthermore, officials from the Defense Contract Management Agency  said their inspectors rely on contractors to provide the technology to  electronically read data matrices. If contractors do not provide this  technology, inspectors at those manufacturing sites cannot electronically  read and verify the sufficiency of data matrices.", "The Office of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy and the  components have taken steps to address some of these challenges. For  example, in February 2011, the office issued a DOD standard operating  procedure for assessing the sufficiency of data matrices. Also, through  the Product Quality Deficiency Report process, Marine Corps item  managers are beginning to work with contractors to address the  contractors\u2019 delivery of deficient data matrices. In addition, in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Air Force began to track the number of  deficient data matrices it is discovering as it assesses the sufficiency of  newly-acquired items\u2019 data matrices.

DOD  stated that the benefits to DOD of implementing IUID marking are to  improve asset accountability, tracking, and the life cycle management of  targeted items. Further, DOD stated that it will continue to identify costs of  implementing IUID as IUID is implemented across DOD. As previously  discussed, a best practice for analyzing a program\u2019s return on investment  is the estimation of all potential costs, and DOD efforts to continue to  identify costs of IUID implementation may be a positive step in this  direction. According to DOD, another best practice for analyzing a  program\u2019s return on investment is analyzing benefits, and making  recommendations, based on relevant evaluation criteria. DOD has  estimated that IUID implementation could cost $3.2 billion, and the  components report that they have already spent at least $219 million on  implementation efforts.

As previously  discussed, DOD may have used a methodology for estimating these  benefits that may not be appropriate to the scale and complexity of DOD\u2019s  IUID implementation efforts. For example, the task force estimated DOD- wide savings on the basis of a limited number of case studies, these case  studies did not address programs that use IUID as the technology that  provides a unique identifier to track items through serialized item  management, and even when a logistics program experiences cost  savings after introducing a new technology or process, it can be difficult to  link the savings directly to a specific cause or technology such as IUID.  Given IUID\u2019s potential costs and that DOD\u2019s methodology for estimating  IUID\u2019s potential financial benefits may not be appropriate, we continue to  believe that an estimate of both IUID\u2019s costs and benefits, based on an  appropriate methodology, and a sensitivity analysis of these estimates,  would provide DOD leaders with key information to better enable sound  program management and determine whether continued spending on  IUID is likely to result in a significant return on investment.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the  Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps;  and the Directors of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense  Contract Management Agency.

In the course  of our assessment, we reviewed estimates provided by the components  on the number of legacy items marked and to be marked; deficient data  matrices; and historical and requested IUID spending.", "Each of the components provided estimates on either the number of  legacy items marked, or to be marked; several of the components  provided estimates of both. On the basis of our review of the sources  and methodology used by the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force to  produce estimates of the number of legacy items they have marked,  we determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of reporting the components\u2019 best estimates of the size of  this population of items. The Navy was not able to estimate the  number of legacy items it has marked; the Defense Logistics Agency  reported that it has not marked legacy items. Based on our review of  the sources and methodology used by the Marine Corps and Air  Force to produce estimates of the number of legacy items they must  mark in the future, we determined that these data are sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting on the components\u2019 best  estimates of the size of this population of items. As previously  discussed, the Army, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency explained  that their estimates on the number of legacy items that must be  marked in the future are not complete. Although not complete, we  determined that the data on legacy items represent the components\u2019  best estimates, and are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  reporting on the general size of the population of legacy items they  must mark in the future.", "The Army, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency did not provide data  on deficient data matrices; the Marine Corps and Air Force did provide  these data. We reviewed the data sources and methodology used by  the Marine Corps and Air Force to produce data on the number of  deficient data matrices they have discovered through their review of a  portion of data matrices on newly-acquired items in their inventories.  We determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of reporting on the percentage of data matrices that these  components classified as deficient, out of the portion of data matrices  in their inventories that they have assessed for sufficiency.", "The Defense Logistics Agency did not provide estimates on either  historical or requested IUID spending; the Army and Navy provided  estimates on historical IUID spending; and the Marine Corps and Air  Force provided estimates of both historical and requested IUID  spending. We discussed with component officials the sources and  methodology they used to produce the data on their historical IUID  spending and fiscal year 2012 budget requests for IUID spending. The  Marine Corps and Air Force provided data on both their historical and  future spending. On the basis of our review of their sources and  methodology for producing these data, we determined that the  spending data provided by the Marine Corps and Air Force are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting on these components\u2019  historical spending and fiscal year 2012 IUID budget requests. As  previously discussed, Army and Navy officials explained that their  estimates on historical IUID spending are not complete. Although not  complete, we determined that these data represent the best estimates  of the Army and Navy on their historical IUID spending, and are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting on the historical  spending data that are available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Key IUID Policy Issuances and Implementation Events, Fiscal Year 2003 to Fiscal Year 2011", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kimberly Seay, Assistant  Director; Emily Biskup; Cindy Brown Barnes; Cynthia Grant; Neelaxi  Lakhmani; Jason Lee; Alberto Leff; John Martin; Charles Perdue; Carol  Petersen; Karen Richey; Darby Smith; Chris Turner; Cheryl Weissman;  and Michael Willems made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Defense Logistics: DOD Needs to Take Additional Actions to Address  Challenges in Supply Chain Management.
