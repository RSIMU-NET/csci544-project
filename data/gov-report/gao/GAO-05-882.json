On an ongoing basis, DOD compiles and reports information on the incremental costs of the war, and uses these data in preparing future funding requests. To assist Congress in its oversight of war spending, GAO assessed (1) whether DOD's reported war costs are based on reliable data, (2) the extent to which DOD's existing financial management policy is applicable to war spending, and (3) whether DOD has implemented cost controls as operations mature. GAO focused primarily, but not exclusively, on fiscal year 2004 reported costs--the latest full year of data available at the time of GAO's review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found numerous problems in DOD's processes for recording and reporting costs for GWOT, raising significant concerns about the overall reliability of DOD's reported cost data. As a result, neither DOD nor Congress can reliably know how much the war is costing and details on how appropriated funds are being spent, or have historical data useful in considering future funding needs. On the basis of GAO's work, DOD is taking steps to improve its cost reporting. Factors affecting the reliability of DOD's reported costs include long-standing deficiencies in DOD's financial systems, the lack of a systematic process to ensure that data are correctly entered into those systems, inaccurately reported costs, and difficulties in properly categorizing costs. In at least one case, reported costs may be materially overstated. Specifically, DOD's reported obligations for mobilized Army reservists in fiscal year 2004 were based primarily on estimates rather than actual information and differed from related payroll information by as much as $2.1 billion, or 30 percent of the amount DOD reported in its cost report. In addition, GAO found inadvertent double counting in the Navy's and Marine Corps' portion of DOD's reported costs amounting to almost $1.8 billion from November 2004 through April 2005. Because it was not feasible to examine all reported costs and significant data reliability problems existed, GAO was not able to determine the extent that total costs were misstated. Further complicating the data reliability issue is the fact that DOD has not updated its policy to address GWOT spending. Instead, DOD is using its existing financial management regulation for funding contingency operations, although it was developed and structured to manage the costs of small-scale contingency operations. GAO has noted that specific provisions of the existing policy conflict with the needs of GWOT. One conflict concerns the use of supplemental funds for base support activities at home stations. DOD's financial management regulation administratively precludes such use, but military service officials have spent billions of dollars in supplemental funds on these activities. Some of this spending appears to directly support the war, but some does not. DOD is currently updating its regulation on the basis of GAO's work. While individual commands have taken steps to control costs and DOD policy generally advises its officials of their financial management responsibilities to ensure the prudent use of contingency funding, DOD has not established guidelines that would require all commands involved in GWOT to take steps to control costs and to keep DOD informed of those steps and their success. For example, the commander of coalition forces in Iraq has unilaterally set a 10 percent cost reduction target for fiscal year 2005 but the details are not widely known outside the command. With the growth in GWOT costs, there is a need to ensure that all commands seek to control costs, including the need to review and rationalize related requirements. Until the department establishes guidelines on cost controls and is routinely informed about the types of controls and their impact on costs, it cannot be sure that all that can be done to control costs is being done."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the terrorists attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States  began military operations to combat terrorism both in the United States  and overseas.  Military operations to defend the United States against  further attacks are known as Operation Noble Eagle.  Ongoing military  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq are known as Operation Enduring  Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, respectively.  Together, these three  military operations are identified as the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).   Since the attacks, the Department of Defense (DOD) reports that it has  obligated $191 billion through May 2005 for conducting the war.  Congress  has enacted a series of supplemental appropriation acts to fund the war  beginning in September 2001.", "To assist Congress in its oversight role, we are continuing to undertake a  series of reviews relating to the cost and funding of contingency operations  in support of GWOT.  In September 2003, we issued a report that discussed  the funding outlook for fiscal year 2003.  We continued our analysis of  fiscal year 2003 obligations and funding, and in May 2004 we issued a  summary report comparing full-fiscal-year 2003 GWOT cost and funding.   In July 2004, we reported on the funding outlook for fiscal year 2004.  We  are currently continuing our review series by examining full-fiscal-year  2004 GWOT obligations and the availability of funding to cover those  expenses and the funding outlook for the fiscal year 2005 GWOT  supplemental appropriations for the war.  We will report our results on  these subjects separately.", "This report contains our analyses of DOD\u2019s reporting on the costs of GWOT.   On the basis of the authority of the Comptroller General, we assessed (1)  whether DOD\u2019s reported war costs are based on reliable data, (2) the extent  to which DOD\u2019s existing financial management policy is applicable to war  spending, and (3) whether DOD has implemented cost controls as  operations mature.  We focused our analysis primarily on fiscal year 2004  obligations specifically for military personnel and operation and  maintenance expenses, as they represent the largest amount of reported  spending.  Obligations are incurred by the Defense Department and the  military services through actions such as orders placed, contracts awarded,  services received, or similar transactions made during a given period that  will require payments during the same or a future period.", "To accomplish this review, we analyzed DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004 monthly  Consolidated DOD Terrorist Response Cost Report, which was renamed  the Supplemental and Cost of War Execution Report in January 2005, to  determine reported obligations by operation and by appropriation account  for the military services.  That report is the source document used by the  department in discussing the cost of the war.  It is not used in the  department\u2019s funds or appropriations accounting.  DOD\u2019s cost report does  not include obligations incurred by the intelligence community; therefore,  we did not review those obligations.  To assess the reliability of DOD\u2019s data,  we undertook a number of steps, including conducting limited testing on  military personnel costs and operation and maintenance costs.  At the unit  level, we cross-checked data entries back to the reporting vehicle used to  input the data into the GWOT cost report.  We also conducted limited cross- checking of the U.S. Army Central Command\u2019s (ARCENT) document  register numbers against documentation controlled by the Defense Finance  and Accounting Service (DFAS), Rome, New York.  We discussed with  Army financial managers the processes used to ensure that GWOT  obligation data provided from Army units were accurate and reliable.  We  also reviewed Army Audit Agency, Air Force Audit Agency, and Naval Audit  Service reviews of their respective service\u2019s GWOT spending.  To determine  what guides GWOT spending, we focused our efforts on analyzing the fiscal  year 2004 Defense Appropriations Act, the fiscal year 2004 Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations Act, and DOD\u2019s and the military services\u2019  specific policies and guidance.  We also met with officials from the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Army, Navy, and  Marine Corps to discuss the sufficiency of DOD\u2019s financial management  policies and procedures for contingency operations, including their  applicability to GWOT conditions.  To determine controls over spending  and when they could be strengthened, we identified current controls and  held discussions with resource management officials from major  commands and units that had deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan on what  benchmarks might be used to ascertain when controls could be  strengthened as operations mature and what steps DOD has directed or  implemented to control costs.  We did limited work at the Air Force  because the Air Force Audit Agency was undertaking a concurrent review  of Air Force GWOT spending; instead, we drew upon that work as  appropriate.  As discussed below, we found that the reported cost data are  not reliable because of long-standing deficiencies in DOD\u2019s financial and  accounting systems, the lack of a systematic process to ensure that data  are properly entered into those accounting systems, the use of estimates  rather than actual data for some of DOD\u2019s reported costs, and the incorrect  categorization of some reported costs due to the large number of cost  categories and limited training on how to apply them.", "We performed our work from August 2004 through August 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States  began military operations to combat terrorism both in the United States  and overseas.

Factors that affect the cost of the war  include the number of deployed personnel, the special pays and allowances  that deployed personnel receive, the additional pay that mobilized  reservists receive when on active duty, the pace of operations, the extent to  which facilities have to be built to house and protect the deployed forces,  and the distance to the theater.  Congress has enacted a series of  supplemental appropriation acts, beginning in September 2001, to fund the  war.  These supplemental appropriation acts have included funding  authority for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, homeland security, and  other global counterterrorism military and intelligence operations.", "The costs of contingency operations are referred to as \u201cincremental costs\u201d  and are directly attributable costs that would not have been incurred, were  it not for the operation.  Specifically, the costs are above and beyond  baseline training, operations, and personnel costs. Incremental costs  include the pay of mobilized reservists as well as the special pays and  allowances of deployed personnel, such as imminent danger pay and  foreign duty pay for those personnel serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom  and Operation Enduring Freedom, the cost of transporting personnel and  materiel to the theater of operation and supporting them upon arrival, and  the operating cost of equipment, such as vehicles and aircraft, among many  other costs.  Costs that are incurred regardless of whether there is a  contingency operation, such as the base pay of active duty military  personnel, are not considered incremental.", "DOD tracks the obligations incurred to support GWOT and produces a  monthly cost report, which is distributed throughout the department and  used by senior DOD leadership in discussing the cost of the war.  It is also  used in formulating future budget requests to fund GWOT.  The monthly  report, which, as noted earlier, was titled the Terrorist Response Cost  Report until January 2005, when it was renamed the Supplemental and  Cost of War Execution Report, identifies the monthly and cumulative  incremental GWOT obligations.  DOD reports the costs by service, defense  agency, contingency operation, and appropriation.  On October 1, 1998,  DOD implemented a standard contingency cost breakdown structure to  improve contingency cost reporting consistency between multiple services  and DOD agencies.  Furthermore, this cost breakdown structure was also  to facilitate future efforts to understand and interpret differences between  estimated and actual costs.  DOD Financial Management Regulation  7000.14-R, volume 12, chapter 23, generally establishes financial policy and  procedures related to DOD contingency operations.  The regulation  incorporates the common cost categories and multiple subcategories,  which were established in 1998 and updated in January 2005, that are used  to report DOD\u2019s monthly GWOT costs.", "We previously reported our concerns about the reliability of reported  contingency operations cost data.  Specifically, our 1996 report on the  reliability of reported contingency operations costs found inaccuracies  representing about 7 percent of the $4.1 billion in costs reported in fiscal  years 1994 and 1995, which we believe was indicative of a material  weakness in the accounting systems.   These included the following:  $104 million in overstated costs, primarily due to the failure of the Air  Force ($67 million) and the Navy ($3 million) to adjust reported flying  hour costs to reflect the value of free fuel being received at that time.", "The services\u2019 failure to adjust reported costs to reflect normal operating  and training costs. For example, one Army command reported operating  costs of $11 million that were not incurred because of deployments.", "The services\u2019 failure to report or fully report $171 million in understated  costs, including some military personnel costs such as imminent danger  pay and family separation pay, munitions the Navy used, and Air Force  mobility equipment and munitions.", "We further reported that it was not feasible to examine all reported costs  and supporting data and that our results were not statistically projectable.   Consequently, we were unable to conclude, on the whole, if reported costs  were overstated or understated.  At that time, we recommended that DOD  clarify existing guidance for reporting costs, which DOD agreed to do.

Instead of using related DOD payroll information, the Army  based the GWOT military personnel obligations used in the GWOT cost  report primarily on its fiscal year 2004 obligation plan and, in the end,  forced, or \u201cplugged,\u201d obligations to match available supplemental budget  authority.  Effectively, the Army was reporting back to Congress exactly  what it had appropriated.  Army officials were unable to readily explain the  process for identifying and reporting GWOT military personnel obligations.   Specifically, the Army Budget Office lacked formal procedures to guide the  monthly reporting of GWOT military personnel obligations to DOD and a  process to ensure management\u2019s review of the reported amounts.  Army  Budget Office officials stated that these problems were exacerbated by  staff losses in the September 11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, personnel  turnover, and hiring difficulties.", "Our analysis showed that obligations associated with Army military  personnel in the monthly GWOT cost report were not consistent with  related DOD payroll information, and the use of planned obligations  instead of actual payroll information might have resulted in reported Army  military personnel GWOT obligations being materially overstated.  For  fiscal year 2004, our analysis of the more than $7.1 billion in incremental  military personnel obligations listed in the GWOT cost report category for  mobilized Army reserve-component soldiers identified as much as $2.1  billion of reported obligations in excess of related DOD payroll  information.  Initially, the Army could not support this difference or its  reported GWOT military personnel obligations.  Over the next several  months, the Army and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) provided us with several possible, though sometimes  inaccurate, explanations for this difference.  Some explanations appeared  valid while others did not and, taken together, they failed to fully account  for the difference.  For example, the Army Budget Office stated that a  portion of the difference was attributable to retirement pay and retirement  health care accruals.  We found that the retirement health care accrual did  not result in incremental costs and, therefore, was not a valid explanation  for the difference.  However, mobilized reserve-component personnel  receive an increase in retirement pay benefits over nonmobilized reservists  and, therefore, DOD incurs incremental costs related to this benefit.   According to the Army, the retirement pay accrual represents part of the  difference, and it reported this amount at $824 million.  This information  was provided too late in our audit to assess its accuracy and completeness.   Further details on our review of GWOT obligations for Army military  personnel are included in appendix II.", "In addition to examining the obligations for mobilized Army reservists, we  also examined reported imminent danger pay and found wide monthly  swings and little correlation with the numbers of deployed personnel.   Imminent danger pay relates directly to the number of military personnel  deployed to eligible areas.  Beginning on October 1, 2002, all military  personnel\u2014both Active and Reserve Component\u2014in areas designated as  eligible for imminent danger pay receive $225 per month for each month for  which they qualify for such pay.  Eligible areas include, but are not limited  to, the countries of Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Saudi  Arabia.  The monthly amount is payable in full without being prorated or  reduced, for each month, during any part of which a service member  qualifies and regardless of the actual period of time served on active or  inactive duty during that month.", "Month-to-month changes in reported imminent danger pay obligations for  GWOT should be consistent with the number of deployed forces in eligible  areas.  However, as shown in table 1, which depicts the amounts reported  for DOD as a whole and the implied number of people who should be  receiving the pay on the basis of dividing the amount per month\u2014$225\u2014 into the reported obligations, there are wide monthly swings in the number  of deployed personnel, based on the amount of reported imminent danger  pay, that do not seem to correlate to the actual numbers of deployed  personnel.  For example, the reported imminent danger pay suggests that  173,000 personnel were deployed to support GWOT in July 2004 and that  the number of personnel rose to more than 1 million in August 2004 and  then declined to 264,000 in September 2004 and 61,000 in October 2004.", "According to DOD, about 221,300 personnel from all the military services  were deployed throughout the region in December 2004 to support  Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, including  deployed personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait.", "In continuing discussions of our analysis, Army Budget Office officials  provided additional detail on the Army\u2019s reported imminent danger pay  obligations, which comprise the bulk of DOD-wide reported imminent  danger pay obligations.  With respect to the August 2004 reported imminent  danger pay, which was by far the largest reported amount from April 2004  through April 2005, Army Budget Office officials said that their reported  portion\u2014$217 million\u2014of the DOD-wide $231 million was in error owing to  a misplaced decimal and that the Army\u2019s August 2004 imminent danger pay  should have been reported as $21 million.  These officials attributed the  month-to-month fluctuations in reported imminent danger pay to the lack  of timeliness and consistency in adjusting costs between those baseline  and GWOT amounts.

Operation and  maintenance obligations in support of GWOT represent tens of thousands,  if not hundreds of thousands, of individual transactions ranging in value  from 1 penny to millions of dollars.  When obligations are incurred, the  services enter them into their accounting systems using accounting codes.   For example, an Army budget activity, such as an installation or unit,  initially obligates funds for acquired goods and services by using the  Standard Army Accounting Classification Code.  An obligation entry  includes information on the funding source; the operational mission, such  as Operation Iraqi Freedom; and the category of cost.  The cost categories  are established by the services.  In the Army, the cost category is called the  element of resource (EOR).", "Because DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation volume 12, chapter 23  requires that the services capture costs within their existing accounting  systems and report them in a common cost format known as the cost- breakdown structure, the services must translate\u2014or \u201ccross-walk\u201d\u2014 their  obligations into 1 of 55 cost categories in the cost breakdown structure  established by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  and used in the monthly GWOT cost reports.  For the Army, this involves  translating obligations recorded by EOR into the chapter 23 GWOT cost  categories.  To meet DOD\u2019s reporting requirements, each month Army  resource management officials must cross-walk costs in the EOR  categories into the GWOT cost categories, sometimes manually.  For  example, in fiscal year 2004, ARCENT resource management officials  manually cross-walked 266 EORs into 14 GWOT cost categories.", "If obligations are not identified in the correct cost category in the services\u2019  accounting system, they can affect the overall reliability of DOD\u2019s GWOT  cost reporting.  In the Army, ARCENT resource management officials told  us that on the basis of their reviews of GWOT obligations, they had  confidence in the accuracy of the total dollar obligations as identified in the  GWOT cost report but felt that obligations were being incorrectly  categorized.  At two Army divisions, we observed obligations being  assigned to the wrong EOR.  In our limited testing of transactions at one of  the divisions, which deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom,  we found errors in assigning costs to the correct EOR, which resulted in  overstated costs in some categories and understated costs in others.  We  reviewed 31 transactions valued at $15 million and found coding errors in  11, or 35 percent of the transactions, valued at $770,134, or 5 percent of the  amount we reviewed.  One example of an error we found involved $383,147  in obligations for communications services, which was entered into the  division\u2019s financial management systems under an EOR that corresponded  with DOD\u2019s GWOT cost report\u2019s category of Other Services and  Miscellaneous Contracts.  A senior division resource management official  stated that it would have been better to use an EOR that corresponded with  the Facilities/Base Support category.  As a result, the Other Services and  Miscellaneous Contracts category was overstated by $383,147 while the  Facilities/Base Support cost category was understated by the same  amount.  At the other Army division, which deployed to Afghanistan as part  of Operation Enduring Freedom, we also found errors in assigning costs to  the correct EOR that resulted in overstated costs in some categories and  understated costs in others.  We reviewed 146 of 237 transactions valued at  more than $14 million and found coding errors in 32 transactions, or 22  percent of the transactions, valued at more than $4 million, or 30 percent of  the amount we reviewed.  For example, the division obligated $6,995 for a  printer, which it originally coded with the EOR for automated data- processing equipment.  However, once the purchase request reached the  contracting office, it was recoded as general supplies and not as automated  data-processing equipment.  After reviewing this example and others, a  senior resource management official at the division concurred with our  assessment of these coding errors.", "In related reporting, we have raised concerns about reported equipment  reconstitution costs.  Reconstitution is one of the cost categories in  DOD\u2019s GWOT cost report.  We reported that DOD has not accurately  tracked and reported its reconstitution costs because the services are  unable to segregate equipment reconstitution from other maintenance  requirements, as required.  In the case of the Air Force, we reported that it  does not break out its equipment reconstitution obligations from other  GWOT obligations in the cost report and was reporting no reconstitution  costs.  In further discussions Air Force officials told us that their  reconstitution costs were being captured in their flying hour (operating  tempo) costs.  Regarding the Army and the Navy, we reported that  equipment reconstitution obligations reported by those two services are  likely overstated because (1) the Army includes costs other than those  required for reconstitution and (2) the Navy is unable to segregate regular  maintenance from reconstitution maintenance for ship overhauls.  We  recommended and DOD agreed to direct the services to develop  comprehensive and consistent methods for tracking and reporting  equipment reconstitution obligations.  In agreeing with our  recommendation, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) said that the office had already revised its financial  management regulation to improve the reporting of equipment  reconstitution, but we observed that until additional actions are taken,  such as improving the services\u2019 financial management systems\u2019 ability to  track obligations, our recommendation will not be fully implemented.

These officials  said that the Army is taking two immediate actions.  First, it has refined its  EOR to cost breakdown structure code cross-walk.  The Army has  specifically identified approximately 135 EORs that directly associate with  the cost breakdown structure.  Additionally, Army officials said that they  have added an additional data element (the Functional Cost Account code,  which describes the programmatic function), which will provide one more  reference point to validate entries.  This revision was effective with the  June 2005 reporting cycle.  Second, Army officials said that the Army is  developing a standard operating procedure with a follow-on \u201ctrain the  trainers\u201d program for Army-wide distribution.  It will prescribe the  methodology for capturing GWOT execution data from the accounting  systems and source documents.  This is a longer-term solution that the  Army believes should contribute materially to improved data entry at the  originating organizational levels.", "The Air Force Audit Agency, in a June 2005 report on Air Force GWOT  spending, also identified errors in properly categorizing GWOT costs.", "Specifically, the audit agency found that in fiscal year 2003, 159 of 923  transactions it reviewed, or about 17 percent of GWOT transactions valued  at more than $163 million, were inaccurately recorded in the Air Force\u2019s  accounting system.  The report stated that this condition occurred because  resource management officials were uncertain of which costs were GWOT  related and because reported costs were not compared with  documentation as required by DOD\u2019s financial management regulation.   The audit agency concluded that inaccurate cost reporting may lead to  questionable cost-of-war information, distorted command resource  allocation and spending plans, and unreliable summary DOD financial  reports.  The audit agency made several recommendations, including one  that cognizant Air Force officials review transaction data and notify  accounting liaison office personnel of inaccurate entries monthly, and one  that the liaison office personnel request data correction from appropriate  accounting offices.  The Air Force agreed with the recommendations and  stated that it would make the recommended changes.  In advance of the  report\u2019s issuance, in a March 2, 2005, memo, the Assistant Secretary of the  Air Force, Financial Management and Comptroller, addressed and agreed  to revise guidance to emphasize increased management oversight over  transaction approval, accuracy, and documentation completeness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some GWOT Cost Data Are Based on Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Because ships at sea incur the same types of costs whether in normal  forward-deployed operations or in support of GWOT, the Navy allocates the  costs between normal and GWOT operating costs.

For  example, we found that the Atlantic and Pacific surface commands, which  are responsible for managing the Navy\u2019s surface ships, use two different  approaches in order to allocate a portion of each ship\u2019s normal operating  costs to GWOT for those ships that have been used to support GWOT  missions.  The Atlantic Fleet uses an approach whereby the portion of a  ship\u2019s normal operating costs becomes GWOT costs when (1) the ship has  been engaged in a GWOT mission during that month and (2) the ship  exceeds its monthly baseline budget.  Once the baseline budget has been  exceeded, the additional cost above that baseline is considered  incremental and is recorded as a GWOT cost.  The Pacific Fleet uses a  different approach, which utilizes a model that has evolved over many  years.  This model takes a number of factors into consideration in order to  calculate how much of a ship\u2019s costs should be allocated to GWOT.

However, when we compared a limited number of documents from the  ARCENT document register with documentation controlled by DFAS- Rome, New York, we found instances where (1) document register  descriptions did not match invoices maintained by DFAS and (2) invoices  did not match dollar amounts associated with the ARCENT documentation  number.  For example, one item we identified was listed in the document  register as a purchase of unit coins for $200,000.  However, we found no  evidence indicating that the $200,000 was actually obligated for the  purchase of unit coins.  The EOR listed in the document register indicated  that the item was for furniture.  When we reviewed the invoices, we found  that the documentation supported the purchase of furniture for $18,959 but  nothing for unit coins or for $200,000.

In many cases, documentation was not  available or the available documentation was not sufficient enough to  determine the applicability of costs, as shown in the following examples:   The Air Force Audit Agency, in its previously cited June 2005 report on  Air Force GWOT funds management, reported that financial managers  could not provide documentation to support approximately 14 percent  of 1,037 fiscal year 2003 transactions reviewed.  The transactions had an  absolute value of more than $16 million.  The audit agency reported that  the inability to provide documentation occurred for three primary  reasons: (1) Air Force financial managers did not require funds holders  and resource advisors to maintain supporting documents for a minimum  of 24 months, (2) comptrollers did not provide funds holders and  resource managers with documentation requirements training, and (3)  Air Force organizations did not always comply with records  management guidance.  The agency concluded that maintaining  documentation provides an audit trail and assurance that Air Force  personnel properly expended these funds.  The agency made several  recommendations to strengthen controls over documentation, which  the Air Force agreed to implement.  In the previously cited March 2,  2005, memo issued in advance of the issuance of the Air Force Audit  Agency\u2019s report, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial  Management and Comptroller also addressed this finding and agreed to  revise Air Force guidance to require funds holders and resource  advisors to maintain supporting documentation for a minimum of 24  months for all financial transactions, modify the Web-based Resource  Advisor Tutorial to highlight the need for funds holders and resource  advisors to maintain documentation for financial transactions, and to  require comptroller personnel to include documentation requirements  in all funds holders\u2019 training and resource advisor training.", "The Naval Audit Service reported that it could not find supporting  documentation for 11 percent of the reported fiscal year 2002 Operation  Enduring Freedom costs for the 14 units it reviewed.

These problems included a lack of documentation  authorizing purchases and inadequate justification of purchases to  ensure that they were related to contingency operations.  The agency  concluded that without adequate justifications and support to ensure  that the transactions are related to contingency operations, these types  of obligations appear questionable.  The agency recommended that  Army financial management leadership emphasize the consistent  application of guidance for justifying and documenting contingency  operations requirements, and the Army financial management  leadership said that it would emphasize the need to fully justify and  document expenditures as related contingency operations and that it  had already completed or will complete action through the distribution  of additional guidance by December 2005."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Contribute to Data Reliability Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Data reliability is affected by the previously discussed long-standing  deficiencies in DOD\u2019s financial management systems, which affect the  ability to capture costs in a completely systematic manner.

To ensure the  accuracy of DOD\u2019s GWOT cost reports, the military services and the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) compare each new  month\u2019s cost report with previous months\u2019 reports to ascertain if there are  large variances from previous reports and, if so, determine what caused  them and make revisions as appropriate.  For GWOT cost reporting,  individual obligation data that are coded as being in support of GWOT are  aggregated at successively higher command levels and sent through the  services\u2019 chain of command.  At each command level, financial  management officials review costs for large anomalies.  The services take  different approaches to ensure that GWOT obligation data are correctly  recorded.  For example, the Army gains assurance that reported obligations  are accurate by reviewing the monthly obligation data provided by units.   However, the Army does not follow specific guidelines to determine the  extent to which obligations are accurately reported.  For example, U.S.  Army Forces Command and ARCENT financial management officials  ensure that reported obligations are correct by using historical knowledge  of cost trends to review obligation reports for large anomalies.  If a large  anomaly is identified, it is further investigated to determine the cause and  resolve any differences.  However, the two commands do not have specific  criteria to determine how large an anomaly has to be before it is  investigated.  As a result, financial management officials at the commands  use their judgment to determine which anomalies to investigate.  The Navy  also reviews GWOT cost data for anomalies but lacks a systematic method  for gaining assurance that the data are reliable.  According to the Financial  Management and Budget official who manages the process, there is no  systematic approach for reviewing the submissions received from each of  the claimants.", "The Marine Corps has adopted additional measures to gain further  assurance that its GWOT obligations are accurately reported.  For example,  resource management officials at one Marine Expeditionary Force told us  that they periodically visit subordinate units to reaffirm that these units are  following Marine Corps standard operating procedures for entering and  recording obligation data.  During these visits, officials use a checklist that  highlights areas that the visiting officials should emphasize.  These areas  include assessing the unit\u2019s knowledge of Marine Corps policies and  procedures, reviewing purchases made by the unit, and checking to ensure  that the unit correctly entered obligations into the Marine Corps\u2019  accounting system.

We  found instances where the services did not identify wide swings in monthly  costs, such as the swings discussed earlier in imminent danger pay in the  GWOT cost reports for DOD as a whole, as well as errors in the overall  GWOT cost reports that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars  monthly.  Specifically, in reviewing the Navy\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year  2005 operation and maintenance and investment GWOT obligations as part  of a separate effort, we found that the obligations reported in DOD\u2019s  summary GWOT cost report were inadvertently being overstated by  hundreds of millions of dollars monthly between the November 2004 and  the April 2005 cost reports.  In total, we found that the two services  overstated their obligations during that period by almost $1.8 billion\u2014$1.5  billion in the case of the Marine Corps and $300 million in the case of the  Navy.  Each month DOD prepares a separate report for each of the  appropriations acts that are used to provide funding authority to support  GWOT and an overall summary cost report.  In discussions with Marine  Corps and Navy budget officials, it was determined that operation and  maintenance and investment obligations associated with funding authority  provided through title IX of the fiscal year 2005 Defense Appropriations Act  were inadvertently being double counted in the GWOT cost report: once in  the title IX report and once again in the report on funding authority  provided in other fiscal year 2005 appropriations acts, resulting in inflated  figures in the summary report.  These reporting problems were present in  all of the GWOT cost reports from November 2004 through April 2005.

We found that the  large number of EORs encourages Army units to adopt shortcuts to  simplify categorization, which can result in incorrectly categorizing  obligations.  For example, a resource management official in one Army  division indicated that the division used one particular EOR as a catch-all  category.  This EOR corresponded with DOD\u2019s GWOT cost-reporting  category of \u201cOther Services and Miscellaneous Contracts.\u201d  Placing costs in  this category inflates this cost category.

These contracts inflated the costs for that EOR category.", "When coding errors are made, they are not always corrected.

At another Army  installation, we found GWOT costs to improve the readiness condition of  equipment not deployed for contingency operations.  In addition, we found  that one Navy Command reported GWOT costs for improving the condition  of floating docks that were not properly stored while the unit responsible  for their upkeep was deployed on a GWOT mission.  The docks were  seriously corroded as a result of not being stored properly and left in salt  water for more than a year.  Navy officials said that nearly $6 million in  GWOT funding had been used in fiscal year 2003 to pay for these repairs.   Navy officials disagreed with our view that these costs were at best  tangential to the support of the war and noted that the justification for the  repairs was that these docks were a requirement and would likely be  needed in the future to support GWOT.

We reported that U.S.  Army Europe saved $200 million dollars, or 10 percent of the contract  ceiling price, on its Balkans Support Contract; Third Army would save $31  million annually in Kuwait, or 43 percent by changing food service  contractors; and the Marine Corps saved $8.6 million, or 18 percent, from  an estimated $48 million in work in Djibouti, which is one of the Operation  Enduring Freedom locations.", "Military commands and individual commanders involved in GWOT as well  as in earlier operations have put in place a variety of controls on their own  initiative designed to control costs.  Some examples are as follows:  Acquisition review boards are being used in Iraq, Afghanistan, and  Kuwait to assess if requirements are valid and, if so, decide how best to  satisfy them.  In addition, in an August 2004 order, the commander of  Multinational Forces-Iraq established a stewardship council intended to  reinforce fiscal discipline in order to ensure that limited financial  resources are effectively and efficiently employed to accomplish the  command\u2019s strategic objectives.", "Individual Army divisions have taken steps to control costs.  One Army  division we visited has restricted the use of its Government Purchase  Cards for GWOT reconstitution obligations until the card holders  complete a training class detailing the appropriate use of the cards.  The  division Comptroller stated that this action was taken to limit spending  and ensure that purchases made in support of GWOT were appropriate.   Another Army division implemented a Program Budget Advisory  Committee to review its GWOT predeployment requirements.  One  example of economies directed by the committee was to consolidate  requirements for medical supplies, batteries, and ballistic blankets into  a single division purchase.  The committee was reestablished upon the  division\u2019s return from Afghanistan for the review and approval of GWOT  reconstitution requirements.", "Third Army, which obligated almost $17 billion in fiscal year 2004 to  support GWOT, has taken a number of steps to control costs.  Among  other things, it reviews requisitions of items obtained through the stock  fund that are not reviewed by the review boards in Iraq, Afghanistan,  and Kuwait\u2014specifically, items that have a high dollar value, involve  large quantities, are pilferable, or are personal items.  In a March 2005  message to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, the Third Army  commander also described cost control measures implemented by  organizations funded by Third Army.  These included management  controls placed on requests to expand the use of LOGCAP, reducing the  cost of transporting cargo into the theater, and reducing demurrage  charges associated with commercial containers by identifying and  returning excess containers.", "The Army has also set limits on certain kinds of spending.  For example, the  Army set a $6.5 billion limit on LOGCAP spending in fiscal year 2004 on the  basis of the estimated cost of required work and a $6.6 billion limit for  fiscal year 2005.  On a much smaller scale, in July 2004, Third Army issued a  policy memorandum setting forth procedures for purchasing and awarding  unit coins to limit coins purchased with contingency operations funds.   The policy recommends a funding ceiling for coin purchases from  operating funds of $1,000 per battalion and $3,000 per brigade.", "One command has also set spending reduction targets to constrain  spending.  The commander of coalition forces in Iraq has set a 10 percent  cost reduction target in Iraq.  According to the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Resource Management for Multinational Forces-Iraq, the cost-reduction  goal was intended as a direction to take the command rather than as a hard  target.  While realizing that many factors driving costs were outside his  control, the commanding general wanted the command to manage those  areas that the command could affect.  The cost-reduction plan was broken  down into three lines of operation\u2014stock fund, LOGCAP, and nonstock  fund.  As a result the command reports the following:    Efforts to control stock fund costs have met with mixed results.  The  command has encountered difficulties in controlling stock fund costs in  part because units can order items directly from the supplying  command, bypassing the command in Iraq.  However, some control  procedures have been established, which reduced direct orders from  approximately $50 million per month to $5 million in April 2005.", "The command reports that it has been working to control LOGCAP  costs, but additional requirements were subsequently identified that  were expected to drive up LOGCAP costs beyond the initial $4.3 billion  goal.  The commanding general has asked the Army Audit Agency to  help evaluate the use of the LOGCAP program in Iraq and provide  recommendations for cost savings and improved processes.", "The command reports that it is well on its way to achieving its goal of  $2.25 billion for nonstock fund spending.  As of April 30, 2005, the  command reported that it had obligated only about $1 billion in  nonstock funds and was well on its way to come in under the initial  savings goal.", "ARCENT, the Army command responsible for funding the command in Iraq,  was aware of the initiative but not its details and was not aware of whether  there were similar efforts in other countries, specifically in Afghanistan and  Kuwait.", "While DOD policy emphasizes commanders\u2019 fiduciary responsibility to  spend funds prudently, it has not directed any systematic effort for the  services and combatant commands to seek opportunities to reduce costs or  provided guidelines for doing so.  In discussions with resource  management personnel in Army units that were deployed to Iraq and/or  Afghanistan, there was a consensus that cost controls can be strengthened  as an operation matures.  For example, resource managers at one Army  division that deployed to Iraq told us that the division\u2019s experience is that  spending can be managed at all stages of a contingency operation, even  under high-operating-tempo combat operations.  Another Army division  resource manager who deployed to Iraq told us that he could have operated  under a budget after his third month of deployment to Iraq.  He preferred to  operate under a budget where he knew the amount of funding that was  available and could tell commanders that they had to prioritize their  requirements.  A third Army division resource manager, who deployed to  Afghanistan, told us that as an operation matures, cost controls can be  strengthened.", "In discussing efforts to control costs with the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller), the view was expressed that on the basis of the  varying combat situations, steps to control costs were best left to the  individual commands.  As described above, individual commands have  done much to control costs, but efforts vary by command, and there is  limited knowledge of such efforts outside each command.  The  Comptroller\u2019s office has no direct knowledge of the commands\u2019 cost  control efforts and has not asked to be kept informed of cost control steps.

Specific  provisions of the regulation conflict with the needs of GWOT.  One such  conflict concerns administrative limitations on the use of supplemental  funds for base support activities at home stations.  In addition, the  regulation includes conflicting policies and procedures to guide the  budgeting or reporting of investment costs of the war.  Without an updated  policy, the military services and other DOD agencies cannot make informed  judgments on the appropriate use of GWOT funding authorities.

With the growth in GWOT costs, there is a need to ensure that all  commands seek to control costs.

Direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to  oversee the above service efforts as well as to develop a systematic  process to review and test the reliability of the overall GWOT cost  reports.  3. Direct the Secretary of the Army to take the following steps:  develop and implement formal procedures to guide the monthly  reporting of GWOT military personnel costs;  formalize the Army\u2019s management review of military personnel cost  information submitted for the GWOT cost report;   use information from the DOD payroll system, where applicable, to  identify and report GWOT military personnel cost information; and   review and simplify the numbers of elements of resource currently used  to identify, categorize, and record contingency costs.", "To ensure that the military services and other DOD agencies make  informed judgments on the appropriate use of GWOT funding authorities  that are consistent with DOD guidance and meet the needs of GWOT, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense expand DOD\u2019s financial  management regulation for contingency operations to include  contingencies as large as the current GWOT.  At a minimum, the updated  policy should address the budgeting, cost reporting, and spending  associated with investment and base operation and support costs at the  home stations of units that support GWOT.", "To ensure that GWOT mission needs are being met while applying  appropriate cost controls we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to take  the following two steps: 1. establish guidelines on cost controls, including identifying what types  of cost controls are available to the services, and  2. require that the services routinely keep the Comptroller\u2019s office  informed about the types of controls and their impact on costs, and  share information on cost control efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report.

DOD further  commented that on the basis of its review and consistent with our  recommendations it has taken several immediate actions to improve  procedures and strengthen the cost reports.  These include issuing  additional direction and guidance to strengthen, clarify, standardize, and  simplify procedures for collecting, reporting, and auditing cost of war  information and issuing supplemental guidance to its Financial  Management Regulation to address large-scale contingency operations.", "Regarding our recommendations on improving the accuracy and reliability  of reported costs of the Global War on Terrorism and to have the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) play a role in overseeing the  efforts as well as to develop a systematic process to review and test the  reliability of the overall GWOT cost reports, DOD stated that it has  completed implementation of this recommendation through the execution  of new guidance and procedures for collecting and reporting cost of war  information and is actively overseeing the preparation of GWOT cost  reports.  DOD further stated that the Army has changed its data collection  and reporting process and among other things is now using a Standard  Operating Procedure which prescribes a clear methodology for capturing  contingency operations cost data from the accounting systems and a  formal management review process to prepare military cost information  associated with GWOT. \u201cAdditionally, because of the scale of operations, including intense combat or long term  stability or anti-insurgency operations, expenses beyond only direct incremental costs may  be appropriate on a case by case basis in written coordination with the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).\u201d", "Although the revised guidance states that such costs require coordination  with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), we  believe that this expanded definition of incremental costs suggests that the  costs of large-scale contingency operations can be beyond those defined  elsewhere in DOD\u2019s guidance as incremental costs--i.e., those additional  costs to the DOD Component appropriations that would not have been  incurred had the contingency operations not been supported.  We further  believe that costs incurred beyond what was reasonably necessary to  support a contingency operation cannot be deemed incremental expenses,  since such costs are not directly attributable to support of the operation.  In  addition, we believe that expanding allowable costs of contingency  operations beyond those directly attributable to support of the operation is  problematic because it provides no guidance on what costs beyond those  that are attributable to the operation are now allowed to be reported.  We  therefore do not believe that this provision meets the intent of our  recommendation.  The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) should  reconsider this provision in light of our evaluation of its potential  consequences.", "DOD did not agree with our recommendation to have the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) establish guidelines on cost  controls.  In commenting on our recommendation, DOD stated that field  commanders are the correct echelon to adopt and emphasize cost controls  during a contingency; that it relies on the judgment of the combatant  commander in the theater of operations to manage resources at their  disposal to effectively safeguard personnel and perform the mission; and  that implementing administrative funding controls could have a  detrimental effect on the commanders\u2019 ability to make critical decisions in  the theater.  DOD further stated that the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) has included a section in the Financial Management  Regulation that emphasizes that the DOD components are responsible to  employ a fiduciary approach to ensure that the funds are used in a prudent  manner and that as operations mature, steps should be taken to evaluate  and establish spending constraints.  We recognize that certain individual  commands have done much to control costs and describe some of those  efforts, but we further note in our discussion of cost controls that efforts  vary by command and that there is limited knowledge of such efforts  outside each command.  We do not believe, as DOD suggests, that our  recommendation would have a detrimental effect on the commanders\u2019  ability to make critical decisions in the theater.  We are simply  recommending that DOD provide guidance that increases awareness of the  need for reasonable cost controls and requires that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) be kept informed of the types of  controls and their impact on costs and share information within DOD on  cost control efforts.  We continue to believe that more can be done and that  absent DOD-wide guidelines on cost control efforts, there is no assurance  that successive commanders will emphasize cost control and that each  command\u2019s efforts will be equally comprehensive.  Therefore, we have  retained the recommendation.", "In commenting on the report\u2019s content, DOD disagreed with GAO\u2019s position  on the overstatement of the reported costs for mobilized Army reservists in  fiscal year 2004.  DOD commented that our report was incomplete because  we did not consider military retirement pay and other costs, which DOD  stated accounted for almost $1.3 billion of the $2.1 billion difference cited  in our report.  We disagree.  As discussed in our draft report, initially, the  Army could not support its reported costs for mobilized Army reservists or  explain the $2.1 billion difference that we noted between its payroll system  and its reported cost for mobilized Army reservists.  During our audit, the  Army and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  provided us with several possible, although sometimes inaccurate,  explanations for the $2.1 billion difference.  After several months, DOD  provided information showing that it could account for about $1.6 billion of  the $2.1 billion difference.  While making it clear that the information was  received too late for us to assess its accuracy and completeness as part of  our audit, we did include the information in our draft report.  We stated that  some of the explanations appeared valid, while others did not and, taken  together, they failed to fully account for the difference.  The fact that DOD\u2019s  comment letter reduces the $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion further confirms the  concerns we have expressed throughout this report over the accuracy of  DOD\u2019s past reported costs.  Finally, we believe that DOD\u2019s reference in its  comment letter to the $2.1 billion difference as an anomaly is a  mischaracterization--particularly when viewed in the context of its  explanation that \u201cthe Department\u2019s use of estimates led to a difference.\u201d    As clearly stated in this report, we found that the reported cost data are not  reliable, in part because of long-standing deficiencies in DOD\u2019s financial  and accounting systems, a lack of systematic processes to ensure that data  are properly entered into those accounting systems, and the use of  estimates rather than actual information.

Finally, we discussed the processes used to ensure that GWOT  obligation data provided were accurate and reliable with service financial  managers.  We found that the reported cost data were not reliable because  of long-standing deficiencies in DOD\u2019s financial and accounting systems,  the lack of a systematic process to ensure that data were properly entered  into those accounting systems, the use of estimates rather than actual data  for some of DOD\u2019s reported costs, and the incorrect categorization of some  reported costs due to the large number of cost categories and limited  training on how to apply them.

To determine if reported obligations were based  primarily on estimates, we compared reported GWOT amounts for Army  military personnel with Army obligation plans.  We obtained monthly  extracts of fiscal year 2004 military pay records for Army Reserve and  National Guard soldiers supporting GWOT operations from the DOD  payroll system at DFAS, Indianapolis.

Army Budget  Office officials were unable to explain the entire difference."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army GWOT Reporting Process Used Estimated Obligations", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, the Army developed a monthly obligation plan for estimated  GWOT military personnel obligations in fiscal year 2004 on the basis of  anticipated funding of $12.5 billion from the fiscal year 2004 DOD  supplemental appropriation request.  In October 2003, the Army began  incurring military personnel obligations for fiscal year 2004 GWOT  operations before passage of a supplemental appropriation.  However,  instead of using actual information, the Army based the military personnel  obligations used in the monthly GWOT cost report primarily on estimates  in its fiscal year 2004 obligation plan, and \u201cplugged\u201d to available  supplemental budget authority.  Effectively, the Army was reporting back  to Congress exactly what it had appropriated.", "Through much of fiscal year 2004, the Army Budget Office based military  personnel obligations for GWOT operations primarily on its monthly  obligation plan.  As illustrated in table 4, this resulted in the cumulative  GWOT military personnel obligations tracking closely to and, in two cases  equaling, the estimated amounts from the fiscal year 2004 obligation plan.", "One example of military personnel obligations reported directly from the  Army obligation plan is evident with the cost category for \u201cSubsistence\u201d  described earlier.  The Army obligation plan for \u201cSubsistence\u201d showed an  estimated obligation amount of about $130 million monthly in most of fiscal  year 2004 and, except for a large increase in September 2004, was largely  identical to the monthly GWOT cost report amounts as shown in table 5.   Subsistence costs at the end of fiscal year 2004 were a major factor in the  need to \u201cplug\u201d reported military personnel obligations in the GWOT report\u2019s  cost category \u201cReserve Components Called to Active Duty\u201d as discussed  later.", "Budget authority for Army military personnel supporting GWOT operations  provided in the fiscal year 2004 emergency supplemental appropriation was  reduced late in the fiscal year.  As detailed in table 6, reprogrammings and  additional reductions lowered the supplemental budget authority available  from the supplemental appropriation to about $12 billion for Army GWOT  military personnel in fiscal year 2004.", "The Army Budget Office reported negative obligations of more than $439  million in the cost category \u201cReserve Components Called to Active Duty\u201d  for September 2004 so that GWOT military personnel obligations would  equal available supplemental budget authority of about $12 billion.  This  was necessary (1) because the fiscal year 2004 Army obligation plan was  originally developed for about $12.5 billion in GWOT military personnel  spending and the available supplemental budget authority was reduced late  in the fiscal year and (2) because of the unexpected need to obligate a large  amount for the \u201cSubsistence\u201d cost category in September 2004.  As shown  in figure 4, the reporting of a negative amount effectively resulted in the  Army\u2019s use of \u201cplugging,\u201d or reporting back to Congress exactly the amount  of available budget authority, as adjusted, remaining from the fiscal year  2004 emergency supplemental appropriation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Reporting Process Hampered by Lack of Formal Procedures and Management Review", "paragraphs": ["The process used in fiscal year 2004 to determine the Army\u2019s military  personnel obligations for the monthly GWOT cost report was not clearly  understood by Army Budget Office management, and we found that Army  management was not familiar with the process used to force, or \u201cplug,\u201d the  reported fiscal year 2004 GWOT military personnel obligations to match  available supplemental budget authority.", "According to Army Budget Office officials, they did not have formal  procedures for developing and reporting GWOT military personnel  obligations.  These officials explained that, in the absence of written  procedures, the process used to develop the monthly obligation  information reported to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  (DFAS) was entirely dependent on the staff person assigned to this task.  A  DOD Financial Management Regulation includes general guidance on  developing and reporting incremental costs related to contingency  operations.  For example, the guidance requires that controls, accounting  systems, and procedures provide, in financial records, a proper  identification and recording of the costs incurred for DOD contingency  operations.  However, this general guidance is not a substitute for detailed,  written implementing procedures at the service level.", "Furthermore, the Army Budget Office did not establish a formal  management review process for the GWOT military personnel obligations  reported monthly to DFAS.  The Army could not provide documentation to  show that management-level officials reviewed its GWOT military  personnel obligations in fiscal year 2004 that were sent to DFAS for  inclusion in the monthly GWOT report.  Army Budget Office officials also  told us that these problems were exacerbated by staff lost in the September  11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, personnel turnover, and hiring  difficulties.  Specifically, the Army Budget Office-Military Personnel  Division is authorized 10 civilian positions and had not been fully staffed in  over 2 years.  The position of Chief for the Military Personnel Division was  held by three different individuals in the last 2 years.  We were told that  only one staff member had been with the division longer than 2 years.  As of  May 2005, Army Budget Office officials told us that 2 of the 10 positions  were staffed by interns and 3 positions were not filled.", "High staff turnover and new staff training make it increasingly important  that detailed, documented procedures be developed for identifying and  reporting incremental GWOT military personnel obligations.  Formal  procedures would help ensure that the monthly amounts are reported  consistently and accurately, using the best available information.  Lacking  such procedures, Army Budget Office management provided two different  explanations for the process for identifying and reporting GWOT military  personnel obligations.  When asked, Army management initially explained  that reported GWOT military personnel obligations for fiscal year 2004  were based largely on payroll expenditures.  However, our analysis of  reported obligations revealed a significant, unexpected monthly fluctuation  in two GWOT military personnel cost categories, raising doubts about the  reasonableness of management\u2019s explanation and the reliability of the  Army\u2019s estimation process.  For example, as previously noted, a large  negative obligation amount was reported in the \u201cReserve Components  Called to Active Duty\u201d cost category in September 2004 even though the  associated Army National Guard and Reserve soldier strength remained  relatively constant during the period.", "In December 2004, Army Budget Office management provided a different  explanation and stated that GWOT military personnel obligations were  estimates based principally on a calculation that considered the number of  soldiers (e.g., mobilized, deployed) and a monthly composite pay rate or  special pay/allowance amount.  The Army Budget Office provided a  schedule in January 2005 supporting this description of the estimating  process for its GWOT military personnel obligations in fiscal year 2004.   Using this description, our analysis of these obligations, however, indicated  that the Army\u2019s estimation process was not reliable.  For example, our  analysis showed that the estimated obligations reported were not  reasonable owing to both inconsistencies with the number of soldiers and  the high composite pay rate (i.e., officer-grade equivalent).", "After further discussion with us about the reasonableness of their earlier  explanations, an Army Budget Office official agreed with our determination  in February 2005 that the reported amounts were based on planned  obligations and later agreed that the year-end amount was matched, or  \u201cplugged,\u201d to available supplemental budget authority.  Army and DOD  officials stated that efforts were being undertaken to improve GWOT cost  reporting by using, where applicable, DOD payroll information instead of  estimated amounts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported GWOT Obligations for Mobilized Army Soldiers Were Significantly Higher Than Related DOD Payroll Information", "paragraphs": ["GWOT military personnel obligations reported in fiscal year 2004 were not  consistent with the DOD payroll information we reviewed.  Army  management expressed a belief that pay and allowance information could  not be obtained from the DOD payroll system and used for the monthly  GWOT cost report.  However, we obtained fiscal year 2004 payroll  information from DFAS for reserve-component soldiers mobilized for  GWOT operations and demonstrated that actual DOD payroll information,  where applicable, could be used to identify incremental military personnel  obligations for mobilized Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers.   Although we previously reported that several system issues were  significant factors impeding accurate and timely payroll payments to  mobilized reserve-component soldiers, we believe that payroll information  represents the best information available and should be used, where  applicable, to prepare the GWOT cost report.", "For fiscal year 2004, we evaluated the Army obligation plan estimates and  military personnel cost category titled \u201cReserve Components Called to  Active Duty.\u201d  Army officials explained that this estimate included a  soldier\u2019s basic pay, Federal Insurance Contribution Act contributions (i.e.,  Social Security and Medicare), allowances for housing and subsistence,  and accrual amounts for retirement pay and retirement health care.  From  the DOD payroll system, we identified the payroll information for Army  soldiers mobilized to support GWOT operations in fiscal year 2004 and  analyzed payroll information for the related pay components used to  estimate Army military personnel GWOT obligations.  As shown in table 7,  military personnel costs identified from the DOD payroll system were as  much as $2.1 billion less than the estimated Army obligations reported in  the monthly GWOT cost report.", "Initially, the Army could not support this difference or its reported GWOT  military personnel obligations.  Over the next several months, the Army and  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) provided us  with several possible, though sometimes inaccurate, explanations for this  difference.  Some explanations appeared valid while others did not and,  taken together, they failed to fully account for the difference.  For example,  when asked to explain the difference in military personnel obligations  between the GWOT cost report and related DOD payroll information, Army  Budget Office officials stated in March 2005 that a portion of the difference  was attributable to retirement pay and retirement health care accruals.  We  found that the retirement health care accrual did not result in incremental  costs and, therefore, was not a valid explanation for the difference.  In July  2005, DOD agreed that mobilized reservists do not receive an increase in  retirement health care benefits over benefits for nonmobilized reservists  and, therefore, DOD does not incur incremental costs related to this  benefit.  However, mobilized reservists receive an increase in retirement  pay benefits over benefits for nonmobilized reservists and, therefore, DOD  incurs incremental costs related to this benefit.  In July 2005, Army and  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials reported  to us that $824 million of the difference was attributable to the inclusion of  the retirement pay accruals and provided other potential reconciling cost  information totaling $732 million as additional explanations for the  difference.
