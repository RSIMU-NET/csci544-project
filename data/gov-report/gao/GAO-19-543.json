For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created a mapping tool that can help identify low-income and minority communities exposed to health or environmental risks. Several agencies, such as EPA and the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and the Interior, also developed policies or guidance to analyze environmental justice issues during environmental reviews or enforcement activities. Most of the agencies supported their efforts with funds and staff from related programs, but EPA and the Department of Energy provided funds ($8.3 million in fiscal year 2018) and staff specifically for environmental justice.", "Agencies' progress toward environmental justice is difficult to gauge, however, because most do not have updated strategic plans and have not reported annually on their progress or developed methods to assess progress. As they agreed to do in a 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), most of the agencies developed environmental justice strategic plans, but only six have updated them more recently. Few agencies have measures or methods for assessing progress, and the working group has not provided guidance to help agencies with such assessments. The number of agencies issuing annual progress reports has declined (see fig.). Updated strategic plans and annual progress reports, along with guidance on performance measures and methods, would help agencies provide essential information to assess their progress.", "The working group, chaired by EPA, has developed committees and written agreements to carry out its responsibilities to coordinate agencies' environmental justice efforts, but it is not carrying out several functions in the 1994 Executive Order. GAO has found that collaborative mechanisms, such as the working group, benefit from clear goals, but the working group's organizational documents do not contain clear strategic goals aligned to address the order. Clear strategic goals to carry out the executive order could enhance the group's strategic direction for intergovernmental environmental justice efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 24 recommendations, including that agencies update environmental justice strategic plans and report on progress annually, and that EPA consult with other working group members to provide guidance on assessing progress and to set strategic goals.

GAO continues to support its recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The predominantly minority and low-income community of West Oakland,  California, is surrounded by three interstate freeways and abuts a major  port. Since 2000, the city has been redeveloping the port and the  adjacent Oakland Army Base. This redevelopment includes additional  infrastructure for the movement of commercial goods, such as  warehouses and distribution centers, which brings truck traffic and diesel  emissions to local streets. Up to 3,000 trucks visit the port each day. A  study conducted by the California Air Resources Board in 2008 found that  West Oakland residents are exposed to air concentrations of diesel  pollution that were almost three times higher than average  background levels in the surrounding area. Research indicates that West  Oakland\u2019s experience reflects a nationwide problem with the distribution  of environmental and health risks for minority and low-income  communities. For example, a 2018 study found that minority and low- income communities in most states and counties across the country are  disproportionately exposed to facilities that emit harmful air pollution (e.g.,  industrial or waste disposal facilities).", "Concerns about disparities in the health and environmental risks faced by  low-income and minority communities gave rise to the concept of environmental justice. Specifically, the environmental justice movement  grew out of efforts in the 1980s to draw attention to the location of  hazardous waste sites near poor communities with largely minority and  rural populations. The movement gained national attention in 1982 with  large-scale protests against the siting of a toxic landfill in a predominantly  African-American community in Warren County, North Carolina.", "Environmental justice issues include a broad array of environmental  hazards, such as unsafe drinking water, proximity to chemical facilities,  and risks from climate change and natural disasters. The Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) describes environmental justice as seeking the  fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of  race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development,  implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and  policies. In practice, this would mean that all communities enjoy the same  degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal  access to decision-making processes.", "Federal agencies have been making efforts to identify and address  environmental justice issues for more than 25 years. In 1994, the  President signed Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address  Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income  Populations. The executive order directed each of 11 federal agencies to  \u201cmake achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying  and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse  human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and  activities on minority populations and low-income populations.\u201d It also  directed agencies to develop environmental justice strategies that include  a list of programs, policies, and activities that should be revised to better  address environmental justice issues. In addition, the executive order  established the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice  (working group), chaired by EPA.", "After taking initial actions to implement the 1994 executive order, agency  participation fluctuated over the succeeding decades. EPA continued  some efforts to integrate environmental justice into its programs and more  widely across the federal government, but in 2004 and 2006, EPA\u2019s  Inspector General made a number of recommendations to improve EPA\u2019s  environmental justice efforts. In response to the 2006 report, EPA took  additional steps to implement the executive order, such as identifying  national environmental justice priority areas (e.g., reduce air toxics) and  improving environmental justice action plans.", "We have also recommended improvements in EPA\u2019s environmental  justice efforts, and the agency has largely implemented them. In July  2005, we made four recommendations to EPA to help ensure that  environmental justice issues are adequately identified and considered  when clean air rules are being drafted and finalized, and, in July 2007,  provided testimony on the status of these efforts. EPA disagreed with  these recommendations but subsequently implemented all four of them  by taking several actions. These actions included developing additional  demographic variables for use in a mapping program that it uses to help  identify communities of concern; requiring environmental justice training  for all regulatory policy staff in 2007; and drafting a policy for how EPA\u2019s  Office of Air and Radiation will integrate environmental justice into its  programs, policies, and activities. EPA also created an agency-wide  process and a set of protocols for conducting environmental justice  program reviews when setting standards and developing rulemakings or  regulations.", "In October 2011, we made four additional recommendations to support  EPA\u2019s continued progress toward the effective integration of  environmental justice considerations into the agency\u2019s programs, policies,  and activities. EPA partially agreed with the four recommendations and  implemented three of them by taking several actions. For example, EPA  defined key environmental justice terms in documents, developed an  environmental justice screening and mapping tool based on nationally  consistent environmental and demographic data, engaged states  regarding their roles and responsibilities (such as through briefings on  EPA\u2019s 2014 environmental justice plan), and included milestones and  measures for implementation in its 2020 environmental justice action  agenda. EPA did not implement the fourth recommendation, which was  related to assessing resources, saying it was difficult to implement  because environmental justice efforts were integrated throughout the  agency.", "In addition to taking these actions, EPA reaffirmed its commitment to  environmental justice through a 2010 memo, in which the EPA  Administrator cited environmental justice as one of the agency\u2019s top  priorities. The agency also identified environmental justice as a cross- cutting strategy in its agency-wide strategic plan for fiscal years 2011  through 2015. (4)  called for all working group agencies to issue annual progress  reports on the implementation of their strategies.", "The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) also agreed to participate  in the working group given its responsibility to oversee implementation of  the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In 2016, the working  group released its Framework for Collaboration, which described how it  planned to provide guidance, leadership, and support to federal agencies  in carrying out environmental justice efforts.", "Executive Order 12898 directs each federal agency to make achieving  environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as  appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority  or low-income populations. For example, when the contractor operating a  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Customs and Border  Protection inspection facility relocated the facility in West Oakland,  California, in 2014 as part of the redevelopment of the port and waterfront  area, the contractor did not initially consider the community\u2019s previously  identified concerns over truck traffic and diesel emissions. However, the  community identified concerns about increased truck traffic and emissions  after the relocation and requested that federal agencies such as the  Department of Transportation (DOT) and DHS\u2019s Customs and Border  Protection take action to help resolve the problems. Starting in 2015, the  community mapped and monitored air pollution related to these diesel  emissions with assistance from partners including EPA, an environmental  non-profit organization, and Google. DHS officials stated that when the  contract ended, the facility moved to a non-residential area. DHS officials  told us that the agency is considering incorporation of environmental  justice into its contracting procedures, as it already does for NEPA  processes.", "You requested that we examine federal agencies\u2019 environmental justice  strategies. This report examines (1) the extent to which the 16 working  group agencies have developed environmental justice strategic plans and  shown progress toward environmental justice goals since 2011; (2) the  actions the agencies have taken to identify and address environmental  justice issues related to their programs, policies, and activities since the  executive order was issued in 1994 and the resources they have used to  do so in recent years; and (3) the extent to which the working group has  collaborated on environmental justice efforts. To address all three  objectives, we reviewed the executive order, working group documents,  and agency plans, reports, and related documents; and interviewed  agency officials. We also attended the 2018 National Environmental  Justice Conference and Training Program in Washington, D.C., and  visited sites in Oakland, California, and Richmond, California, to add  context to our review with observations of communities with  environmental justice issues. We selected these sites because they had  minority and low-income populations with environmental and health  concerns.", "To examine the extent to which the 16 agencies developed environmental  justice strategic plans and showed progress toward environmental justice  goals since 2011, we reviewed agency plans and reports issued from  2012 through 2018 and interviewed agency officials about the origin and  status of their plans and reports. We compared the agencies\u2019  environmental justice strategic plans against leading practices for federal  strategic planning that our past work has identified, such as updating  plans at least every 4 years, articulating specific goals, establishing a  method to assess progress toward these goals, and aligning the plans  and goals with the agency\u2019s mission. We also interviewed agency  officials about their progress toward the goals of the executive order and  their strategic plans.", "To examine the actions agencies took to identify and address  environmental justice issues related to their programs, policies, and  activities, we reviewed agency environmental justice strategic plans,  progress reports, and related documents; and interviewed agency officials  about their environmental justice efforts since the issuance of the 1994  executive order. To examine what resources the agencies used for  environmental justice efforts in recent years, we obtained and reviewed  agency budget justification documents and agency-reported resources  data for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. We assessed the reliability of the  agency-reported resources data by corroborating with agency budget  justification documents or other internal agency budget documentation  and comparing it with information on any reported examples of  environmental justice efforts. In addition, we conducted 33 interviews with  environmental justice stakeholders about the agencies\u2019 efforts. These  stakeholders included representatives from local and national nonprofit  organizations, universities, and private companies. We selected  stakeholders based on their expertise on a range of issues directly related  to environmental justice and on geographic dispersion. The views of  stakeholders we interviewed cannot be generalized to all similar  stakeholders, but they represent a range of stakeholder perspectives and  provide illustrative examples of views on agency efforts.", "To determine the extent to which the working group has collaborated on  environmental justice efforts, we reviewed working group documents from  2012 through 2018, including recent plans and progress reports. We also  interviewed officials from working group committees. We compared the  working group\u2019s organization, documents, and actions with key features  of collaborative mechanisms that we previously identified, including  clarifying roles and responsibilities, participating, establishing written  guidance and agreements, and establishing outcomes and  accountability.

To that end, during strategic  planning, which should occur at least every 4 years, an agency should  review its mission statement, review its strategic goals, align strategic  goals and strategies, and align strategic and annual performance goals.  In addition, a strategic plan should contain a description of how the goals  will be achieved, including human capital, information, and other  resources needed. Finally, agencies should develop annual performance  plans with annual performance goals\u2014linked to the overall strategic  goals\u2014and describe how the goals will be measured to assess progress  in achieving them.

Examples of how the four agencies measured the progress of their  environmental justice efforts include the following:", "DOI established performance measures in its 2012 environmental  justice strategic plan and reported on progress using these measures  in its 2013, 2014, and 2015 annual progress reports. DOI changed  from performance measures to milestones in its 2016 strategic plan.  For example, in the 2016 plan, DOI has target years for establishing  public outreach strategies and creating a best practices report on  public outreach activities for environmental justice communities.  According to agency officials, DOI made this change because the  performance measures from the 2012 plan were difficult and time- consuming to use, were not helpful in tracking progress, and did not  result in actionable outcomes. DOI believed that an action plan would  be easier to use for identifying actions to meet goals and for  measuring progress. DOI has not yet reported on the milestones from  its 2016 strategic plan. Its most recent progress report is from fiscal  year 2016, the first year that the strategic plan covers. Agency officials  stated that DOI plans to report on the milestones in its fiscal year  2017 progress report but did not provide a timeline for when this  report would be issued.", "In its environmental justice strategic plan for 2016 through 2020, EPA  established four goals for reducing environmental and health hazards:  reducing children\u2019s exposure to lead, reducing contamination of small  and tribal drinking water systems, reducing fine particle air pollution,  and reducing contamination at hazardous waste sites. EPA  established performance measures for tracking progress toward each  of these goals at the national level. For example, EPA\u2019s goal is to  achieve air quality that meets national standards for fine particle  pollution in all areas of the country, with special emphasis on  communities with poor air quality and low-income populations. EPA  collected data from air monitors to determine its progress toward  achieving this goal. In its progress report for fiscal year 2017, EPA  reported an increase from 43 percent of low-income populations living  in counties that attained the standards in 2006 through 2008 to 92  percent in 2014 through 2016. According to agency officials, EPA  plans to continue reporting on the goals in the future. EPA has also  established several other performance measures and milestones for  its environmental justice activities. For example, in its environmental  justice strategic plan for 2016 to 2020, EPA provides the status for 28  environmental justice activities that it had included in its environmental  justice 2014 strategic plan.", "HHS established many performance measures and milestones in its  2012 environmental justice strategic plan and reported on its progress  toward these measures and milestones in its annual progress reports.

For its first environmental justice strategic goal,  USDA established performance measures involving increased funding  for environmental justice-related programs. USDA established  milestones for the rest of its goals. Its five strategic goals are: ensure  USDA programs provide opportunities for environmental justice  communities; increase capacity-building within environmental justice  communities; expand public participation in program operations,  planning activities, and decision-making processes to benefit  environmental justice communities; ensure USDA\u2019s activities do not  have disproportionately high and adverse human health impacts on  environmental justice communities and resolve environmental justice  issues and complaints; and increase awareness, skills, and abilities of  USDA employees regarding environmental justice issues. However,  the agency has not issued a progress report since its 2016 strategic  plan and has not yet reported on these measures and milestones.  Agency officials said that USDA has collected information on these  measures and milestones, but has not issued progress reports with  this information.", "In our interviews with agency officials, a few described plans for  developing new performance measures. In particular, EPA has proposed  to implement a measure that would involve identifying key decisions  across the entire agency in which environmental justice was taken into  account. According to EPA officials, a significant way to incorporate  environmental justice into an agency\u2019s mission, including its programs,  policies, and activities, is to include environmental justice considerations  in its various decision-making processes. For example, EPA has set a  goal of including environmental justice issues in the analyses for  regulatory or permitting decisions, such as Clean Air rules or permits;  officials stated that they could count the number of such decisions that  that have included environmental justice issues in the underlying  analyses for the decisions. Under the new performance measure, every  EPA office would be responsible for identifying a certain number of  decisions it has made and explaining how these decisions were affected  by environmental justice considerations. The measure would also allow  EPA to share examples of how various offices are taking environmental  justice into account, so that other offices could learn from these examples  (e.g., integrating environmental justice into permitting decisions). EPA  plans to pilot this new measure through September 2019.", "The remaining 12 agencies have not established any performance  measures or milestones.

Officials from most of these agencies said that they are  unable to determine how much progress they have made toward  achieving this directive. Specifically, officials from six of the agencies  (Commerce, DOD, Education, DOJ, DOL, and VA) stated that they do not  have a method for gauging their progress, although several of these  agencies stated that they are able to identify specific accomplishments  they have made toward addressing environmental justice issues. A  seventh agency, DOT, said that it has made significant progress, but  faced challenges in developing quantitative performance measures.  Officials from DHS and GSA said that they gauge their progress by  tracking the completion of action items or goals from their environmental  justice strategic plans, and DOE said that it periodically gauges its  progress through conducting qualitative reviews of its environmental  justice work. Finally, DOD and SBA reported no efforts to gauge progress  toward implementing the executive order. Officials for most of the 12  agencies that have not developed performance measures for their  environmental justice efforts said they have not done so because it would  be difficult and they are unsure how to do so. For example, DOJ officials  commented that it would be difficult to develop meaningful measures that  are indicative of true progress toward achieving environmental justice.  EPA officials commented that encouraging agencies to adopt  performance measures for environmental justice would align with their  agency\u2019s efforts and would involve, among several things, providing  guidance and training to the agencies.", "The 2011 MOU states that annual progress reports issued by the  agencies should include performance measures as deemed appropriate  by each agency. In our previous work, we have found that it is important  for agencies to establish a method to assess their progress toward their  goals; such methods should ideally include performance measures or  milestones. We have also reported that performance measures are  important for tracking progress in achieving goals and are a key element  of effective strategic planning. Performance measures provide  managers with information on which to base their decisions, including  how effectively offices are integrating environmental justice in their  decisions. Performance measures also create powerful incentives to  influence organizational and individual behavior. Leading practices we  have identified include clearly relating performance measures to the  performance they will be used to evaluate and creating a set of  performance goals and measures that addresses important and varied  aspects of program performance.", "The executive order directs the working group to provide guidance to  agencies in developing their environmental justice strategies. However,  the working group has not provided guidance to its members on methods  to assess and report on their environmental justice progress, such as  through performance measures, according to officials from EPA, which  chairs the working group.

In their most recent  environmental justice strategic plans, 11 agencies discussed planning to  improve research and data collection on environmental justice issues. At  least eleven agencies provided examples of research or data actions they  implemented, including creating data tools. For example, in 2015, EPA  publicly released its Environmental Justice Mapping and Screening Tool  (EJSCREEN), a web-based mapping tool that includes environmental and  demographic data at a local level, allowing users to identify potential  exposure to environmental pollutants and related health risks across  different communities. Officials from DOJ\u2019s Environmental and Natural  Resources Division told us that they regularly use EJSCREEN to help  determine if cases involve environmental justice issues.

The rule changes were identified by a  Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working  Group composed of the Administrator of EPA,  and the department heads of Labor,  Homeland Security, Justice, Agriculture, and  Transportation, which was created in 2013 by  Executive Order 13650 after chemical facility  incidents that resulted in fatalities. The  executive order requires that the working  group develop ways to improve operational  coordination with state, local, tribal, and other  partners, including enhancing federal agency  information sharing.  In a May 2014 report, the working group cited  the need to familiarize all agencies with  Executive Order 12898 on environmental  justice. It identified concerns of communities  living adjacent to chemical facilities, many of  them low-income and minority, and the need  to share information with these communities,  including first responders.    Under EPA\u2019s 2017 rule, risk management  plans must be provided to members of the  public upon request. The notice publishing the  final rule contained a section on  environmental justice comments and its  response to address environmental justice  concerns.   In May 2018, EPA proposed to rescind  several amendments to its rule. Industry and  some states raised concerns about the cost  and burden to carry out the rule.", "Promote enforcement of health and environmental statutes. In their  most recent environmental justice strategic plans, 13 agencies discussed  planning to promote enforcement of health or environmental statutes in  some form. At least 12 agencies provided examples of actions they  implemented to promote enforcement, including ensuring enforcement of  environmental laws in communities with environmental justice issues and  addressing such issues in the resolution of cases against violators. For  example, in its 2017 progress report, EPA reported combining  EJSCREEN with enforcement and compliance data to help regional  offices and state, local, and tribal authorities focus reviews of compliance  with environmental laws in overburdened communities. EPA reported  reviewing all enforcement cases to see if communities with environmental  justice issues were affected and tracking how agency enforcement  actions to resolve these cases benefitted the affected communities. As  a result, EPA reported tracking that 45 percent of Supplemental  Environmental Projects\u2014a type of beneficial environmental project  implemented as part of a civil enforcement action settlement\u2014in fiscal  year 2017 were in locations with potential environmental justice issues.", "Ensure greater public participation. In their most recent environmental  justice strategic plans, 14 agencies discussed planning to ensure greater  public participation in decision-making processes. All 14 agencies  provided examples of public participation actions they implemented,  including seeking public input on their environmental justice strategic  plans or consulting communities directly during environmental analyses  under NEPA, siting decisions, or enforcement cases. For example, in its  2016 progress report, DOI reported formally inviting tribes to participate in  environmental analyses and revising policies on tribal-government  relations. DOI also continued to have publicly designated environmental justice coordinators for each of its bureaus (e.g., Bureau of Land  Management), many of which deal directly with tribes or manage natural  resources they rely on, such as land or water.", "Example of an EPA Environmental Justice  Grant to Study Microplastics in Tribal  Foods  In 2017, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska received an  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Environmental Justice Small Grant to study  microplastics in its traditional food sources,  such as mussels and clams. Microplastics are  tiny pieces of plastic that are less than 5  millimeters in length and, according to EPA,  may contain toxic chemicals that can pose  human health and ecosystem risks when  ingested by aquatic animals.   According to EPA, the tribe planned to collect  samples of water and traditional foods from  four locations within its traditional territory and  test them for the presence of microplastics  and associated toxins. The results were to be  shared with the tribe and the public to inform  decisions about harvesting traditional foods.  Local students collected and tested Butter  Clam and Blue Mussel samples in 2018,  which showed that more than 80 percent of  the mussels and 100 percent of the clams  contained microfibers and other microplastic  particles.", "Identify differential patterns of consumption of natural resources.  Because many Native Americans and other minority communities rely on  hunting, foraging, or fishing for food, five agencies planned actions to  identify or address risks to these food sources in their most recent  environmental justice strategic plans. At least eight agencies provided  examples of actions they implemented in this area, including collecting or  providing information on human health risks associated with the  consumption of polluted fish or wildlife. For example, in its 2015 progress  report, USDA reported that the Forest Service\u2019s Alaska Regional Office  coordinated with DOT\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration to accelerate  cleanup of petroleum-contaminated soil at a mixed-ownership site  containing national forest lands. According to USDA, the need for  accelerated cleanup arose because increasing sea-levels and tidal  surges that were encroaching on the area would have washed the  pollutants into nearby waters supporting a local subsistence fishery.", "Implement NEPA. In their most recent environmental justice strategic  plans, 12 agencies discussed planning to consider environmental justice  issues in their NEPA analyses. At least 13 agencies provided examples of  NEPA actions they had implemented, including providing internal  guidance on how to include environmental justice issues in NEPA  analyses. For example, at DOI, it is departmental policy for all bureaus  to include consideration of environmental justice in the NEPA process  and some bureaus have developed their own guidance for doing so. For  example, DOI\u2019s 2015 National Park Service NEPA Handbook requires the  agency\u2019s environmental analyses to discuss and evaluate the impact of  proposals on minority and low-income populations and communities,  including the distribution of the benefits and risks among different  communities and populations.", "Implement Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In their most recent  environmental justice strategic plans, 11 agencies planned to consider  environmental justice issues when implementing their Title VI programs.", "At least 10 agencies provided examples of Title VI environmental justice  actions they implemented, some of which focused on providing training  and guidance. For instance, in 2016, DOJ, DHS, HUD, HHS, and DOT  jointly issued interagency guidance on Title VI to state and local agencies  involved in emergency activities. DHS and DOJ reported that DHS\u2019s  Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division  coordinated to distribute this guidance in the aftermath of the 2017  hurricane season to ensure that federal funding recipients (e.g., state and  local agencies) were aware of their obligations to provide emergency  management services across communities without discrimination.", "Consider impacts from climate change. In their most recent  environmental justice strategic plans, nine agencies discussed planning  to address impacts from climate change on communities with  environmental justice issues. At least 11 agencies provided examples of  actions they implemented in this area, including providing communities  with information on how climate change may affect them. For example, in  its 2016 progress report, DOI reported that the U.S. Geological Service  working with the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and Skagit River  System Cooperative to build a coastal model to evaluate the impacts of  sea-level rise, storm surge, and waves, including effects on foods such as  salmon and shellfish. DOI reported that the model was used to inform  tribal climate adaptation and resilience plans.", "Consider impacts from goods movement. In their most recent  environmental justice strategic plans, three agencies discussed planning  to address environmental justice issues arising from goods movement,  and at least five agencies provided examples of actions they implemented  in this area. For example, DOT\u2019s Federal Highway Administration  developed a detailed freight and land use handbook in 2012, which  highlights potential negative impacts in communities with minority or low- income residents (e.g., air quality or light pollution) and provides guidance  on integrating freight and land-use planning to balance freight\u2019s beneficial  economic impacts and harmful environmental impacts for affected  communities. For example, the handbook advises using off-peak  deliveries or anti-idling technologies to reduce impacts from emissions.", "Provide internal training. Eleven agencies also provided us with  examples of training programs to help their staff identify and address  environmental justice issues within their work. For example, EPA  developed an introductory training on environmental justice, which was  required training for all EPA staff agency-wide when it was first launched  in 2015. More recently, EPA reported providing environmental justice  training in 2017 to more than 1,000 employees and contractors across the  government who were responsible for implementing NEPA. DOI  developed a web-based introductory training on environmental justice in  2015 that is available to all DOI employees and became required training  for project managers for the Central Hazardous Materials Fund in 2016.", "Example of an EPA Environmental Justice  Grant to Build Community Capacity to  Reduce Exposure to Contaminated Soil  through Community Education  In 2017, the Trumbull Neighborhood  Partnership in Warren, Ohio, received an EPA  Environmental Justice Small Grant for an  educational initiative to reduce residents\u2019  exposure to soil contamination from former  industrial activities, such as steel production.  According to EPA, with support from the  grant, the neighborhood partnership planned  to create a curriculum of best practices,  repurpose vacant land, and share a range of  educational materials with residents to help  them learn how to avoid exposure to  contaminated soil. As part of the educational  campaign on safe soil handling practices for  residential and community land use, the  partnership created a website to host  educational materials and also shared the  materials in person with residents and  contacted local contractors to help ensure  safe demolition practices.", "Conduct external capacity building. Thirteen agencies also provided  examples of actions they implemented to fund and assist communities  with environmental justice issues to build their capacity to access  available resources and participate in federal decisions that affect them.  For example, since its inception in 1994, EPA\u2019s Environmental Justice  Small Grants Program has awarded more than $24 million to over 1,400  organizations working with communities with environmental justice  issues.

These staff support data tools such as EJSCREEN, provide  training sessions, and coordinate federal efforts through the Interagency  Working Group on Environmental Justice. The two grant programs  provide communities with funding to research and understand potential  environmental and health issues in their communities. For fiscal years  2015 through 2018, EPA awarded an average of about $1.2 million  annually in environmental justice grants to communities through the  Environmental Justice Small Grants Program and Environmental Justice  Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program. EPA  officials also reported using other related resources to support  environmental justice efforts, but said the agency does not track these  resources separately.", "In fiscal year 2018, DOE provided about $1.6 million and, according to  DOE officials, one FTE for its environmental justice program in its Office  of Legacy Management. These resources support activities to manage  problems and concerns arising from the materials and chemicals on DOE  sites by giving communities and tribes near these sites opportunities and  tools to participate in DOE decisions.

Four of these  agencies\u2014USDA, DOI, GSA, and HUD\u2014provided us with estimates of staffing or funding resources used to support environmental justice  efforts. USDA estimated that a total of about eight FTEs annually were  charged by many different staff for fiscal years 2015 through 2018 and  that between $10,000 and $22,500 in funding annually supported the  National Environmental Justice Conference and Training Program. DOI  reported that it has one full-time Environmental Justice Outreach  Specialist and that most DOI bureaus have an Environmental Justice  Coordinator who handles environmental justice responsibilities as a  collateral duty. DOI also reported funding one small research project  related to environmental justice. GSA reported that staffing related to  environmental justice efforts constituted a portion of the total FTE  allocation within its Office of Civil Rights and estimated that this amounted  to less than one FTE annually for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. HUD  also estimated that less than one FTE was used specifically to support  environmental justice efforts annually for the period, with one designated  environmental justice lead and other staff serving on the working group as  needed.", "Officials from the other seven agencies did not quantify estimates of  resources but told us that staff conduct these activities as collateral  duties. For example, DHS told us that its Office of the Chief Readiness  Support Officer, Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of  General Counsel support its environmental justice efforts as needed. In  another instance, DOJ designated an Environmental Justice Director,  created a Senior Litigator for Environmental Justice position, and reported  that the department has other staff that spend a portion of their time  working on environmental justice efforts.

Stakeholders expressed concerns about the limited availability of resources for environmental justice efforts, including staff to carry  out environmental justice work and funding for related programs. One stakeholder told us that agencies need to prioritize their  environmental justice efforts because they have not identified all communities with potential environmental justice issues and lack the  resources to address all environmental justice issues. Several stakeholders discussed concerns about variation in agency staff  familiarity with environmental justice issues or responsiveness to issues raised. Stakeholders also expressed concerns about the  ability of existing legal tools to address environmental justice issues in the absence of a legal framework that specifically addresses  them. For example, stakeholders said that risks from cumulative pollutant exposure are not addressed by existing environmental  statutes. Several stakeholders also expressed concern about federal prioritization of environmental justice issues overall, including  enforcement, changes to existing environmental regulations, and limited consideration of environmental justice in rulemaking  processes.  Some stakeholders we interviewed, including representatives from local and national nonprofit organizations, university professors,  federal officials, and employees of private companies, also said that agencies\u2019 efforts to build community capacity and develop tools  that address environmental justice issues have been helpful.

They have  conducted a number of efforts over the last 25 years to implement the  Executive Order on Environmental Justice. Through these efforts, they  have developed tools such as EJSCREEN and guidance for incorporating  environmental justice under NEPA. Most of the agencies have also  developed strategic plans since 2011, although two agencies we  reviewed have not, and many others have not kept their plans updated.  SBA is in the process of reviewing whether it should continue its  membership in the working group, which should clarify its role after SBA  completes its review. DOD developed an environmental justice strategic  plan in 1995 after the executive order was issued but not since 2011  when the interagency working group members signed the MOU. By  updating its environmental justice strategic plan, DOD would have a  foundation for its environmental justice efforts. Another seven agencies  developed environmental justice strategic plans in 2012 but have not  updated them since. By updating their strategic plans, these agencies\u2014 Commerce, DHS, DOJ, DOL, Education, HUD, and VA\u2014would have a  current plan to guide their environmental justice activities as they  committed to do in the 2011 MOU.", "Moreover, most agencies\u2014Commerce, DOD, DOE, DOI, DOL, DOT,  Education, HHS, HUD, USDA, and VA\u2014have not shown clear progress  toward achieving their environmental justice goals in the 8 years since  they signed the working group\u2019s 2011 MOU because they have not  consistently issued progress reports. By issuing progress reports each  year, the agencies can provide essential information needed to assess  their performance and demonstrate results.", "The 16 agencies and CEQ signed the 2011 MOU to establish a  collaborative initiative across agencies to carry out environmental justice  efforts. Under the leadership of EPA, they have also put in place a  structure to coordinate with each other on their environmental justice  efforts. One area that the group has not coordinated, however, is in  developing guidance on what to include in strategic plans, such as  demonstrating how environmental justice is part of an agency\u2019s mission,  or developing methods to assess and report on progress, which many of  the agencies said they needed. Under GAO\u2019s leading practices for  strategic planning, agencies\u2019 plans should address their missions,  articulate goals, and lay the groundwork for assessing progress. Only half  of the agencies that developed environmental justice strategic plans after  2011 clearly assessed how their plans fit into their overall missions. By  developing guidance on what agencies should include in their  environmental justice strategic plans, the working group could assist  agencies in planning more strategically about what parts of their mission  are important for achieving the environmental justice directives outlined in  Executive Order 12898. Few of the agencies had performance measures  or other methods to assess progress. By developing guidance on  methods that the agencies could use to assess and report on progress, or  creating a committee to do so, the working group could assist agencies in  tracking and measuring their progress in achieving their environmental  justice goals.", "In addition, the working group faces challenges of unclear strategic goals  and mixed levels of participation. As noted in our earlier work,  collaborative mechanisms, such as the working group, benefit from clear  goals to establish organizational outcomes and accountability. Although  the 1994 executive order created the working group to carry out the  functions of the executive order, the working group\u2019s framework focuses  on how the agencies will collaborate rather than setting clear strategic  goals to carry out the executive order. As a result, several of the  executive order\u2019s functions are not being carried out by the working  group. By clearly establishing, in its organizational documents, strategic  goals for the federal government\u2019s efforts to carry out the 1994 executive  order, EPA and the working group members could enhance the strategic  direction for intergovernmental environmental justice efforts. Furthermore,  by updating the 2011 MOU and having the 16 agencies and CEQ renew  their commitment to participating in the interagency collaborative effort  and the working group, EPA, as chair of the working group and consulting  with other working group members, would have more reasonable  assurance that those who sign the agreement are committed to  participate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of 24 recommendations to 15 agencies of the  Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice\u2014nine to the federal  agencies that need to develop or update strategic plans  (recommendations 1-9); 11 to the federal agencies that need to develop  annual progress reports (recommendations 10-20); and four to the  Environmental Protection Agency as chair of the working group  (recommendations 21-24).", "The Secretary of Commerce should update the department\u2019s  environmental justice strategic plan.

First, DOD stated  that it had achieved the intent of Executive Order 12898 by including  environmental justice considerations in its decision-making processes,  primarily by using the NEPA review process. Second, the department  stated that it has limited ability to further the implementation of  environmental justice and create new goals and metrics in operating  locations and mission. DOD stated that it is bound by its mission with  limited opportunities to change where the department operates.  According to DOD, for it to create new bases or close existing ones, it  must first obtain congressional approval and then perform a NEPA  analysis prior to implementation; also, its mission does not include a  federal role in regulating or directing off-base activity or land uses; and  aside from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil regulatory functions, it  does not routinely issue environmental permit decisions like federal  regulatory agencies.

Sixteen federal agencies  and one agency of the Executive Office of the President are involved in  environmental justice efforts: the Council on Environmental Quality  (CEQ), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), General Services  Administration (GSA), Small Business Administration (SBA), Department  of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Commerce (Commerce),  Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Education (Education),  Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD), Department of the Interior (DOI),  Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of  Transportation (DOT), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).", "To address these objectives, we reviewed Executive Order 12898  (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority  Populations and Low-Income Populations), the 2011 Memorandum of  Understanding on Environmental Justice (MOU), working group  documents, and agency environmental justice strategic plans and  progress reports, and interviewed federal agency officials about the  documents. We also attended the 2018 National Environmental Justice  Conference and Training Program, in which leaders from various sectors  share ideas and approaches to achieving environmental justice. At this  conference, we observed sessions to gain background and context and  interviewed some attendees whom we identified and arranged to  interview prior to the conference. We also visited sites in Oakland,  California, and Richmond, California, to add context to our review with  observations of communities with environmental justice issues. We  selected these sites because they had minority and low-income  populations with environmental and health concerns. Including interviews  we conducted at the conference, we conducted 33 interviews with  environmental justice stakeholders about federal environmental justice  efforts and related issues. Of these interviews, 10 were with  representatives from national nonprofit organizations, seven were with  representatives from nonprofit groups who work on local issues, six were  with university professors, four were with employees of private  companies, two were with current or former government officials, and four  were with mixed groups of stakeholders. We identified these stakeholders  for interviews from our background interviews and document reviews. The  views of the stakeholders we interviewed cannot be generalized to all  similar stakeholders, but they represent a range of stakeholder  perspectives and provide illustrative examples of views of agency efforts.", "To examine the extent to which the 16 agencies developed environmental  justice strategic plans since 2011, we determined which agencies had  completed an environmental justice strategic plan after signing the 2011  MOU and which agencies had also updated their plans at EPA\u2019s request  in 2016. We made these determinations by reviewing the website of each  agency for its environmental justice documents, reviewing the  environmental justice strategic plans, and interviewing agency officials  about the origin and status of these environmental justice strategic plans.", "To examine the extent to which the 16 agencies showed progress toward  environmental justice goals since 2011, we determined whether each  agency had completed annual environmental justice progress reports for  each year for fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017 by reviewing the  website of each agency to identify these progress reports, reviewing the  progress reports we located, and interviewing agency officials about the  status and content of these progress reports. We also reviewed the  environmental justice strategic plans and progress reports to assess  whether agencies included a method to assess progress in accordance  with GAO\u2019s leading practices for strategic planning and reporting,  including establishing goals and establishing a method to assess  progress toward goals. Specifically, we analyzed whether each agency\u2019s  environmental justice strategic plan included goals and performance  measures or milestones, and whether each agency assessed progress  toward these goals using performance measures or milestones in  subsequent progress reports. We also interviewed agency officials about  their progress toward the goals of Executive Order 12898.", "To examine the actions the 16 agencies took to identify and address  environmental justice issues related to their programs, policies, and  activities since the executive order was issued in 1994, we reviewed  agency environmental justice strategic plans, progress reports, and  related documents to identify illustrative examples of agency efforts in  each of the areas outlined in Executive Order 12898 and the 2011 MOU  as well as two additional areas identified by agencies. We also  interviewed officials from each agency to confirm or gather additional  information on these examples. The analysis included a detailed review of  the most recent environmental justice strategic plan and progress report  for each agency to identify examples of agency actions and a content  analysis of the most recent environmental justice strategic plan for each  agency. From this review, we (1) counted how many agencies discussed  plans to identify and address environmental justice issues related to the  areas outlined in the 1994 executive order and 2011 MOU in their most  recent environmental justice strategic plan, (2) developed a list of  illustrative examples of agency efforts to identify and address  environmental justice issues related to these areas, and (3) counted how  many agencies provided examples of actions they implemented related to  these areas. The examples are not a generalizable sample of the types or  instances of agency actions, but illustrate the various ways that different  agencies are implementing plans to identify and address environmental  justice issues and different approaches to doing so that may be useful for  other agencies, the Interagency Working Group on Environmental  Justice, and environmental justice stakeholders. We report a minimum  count of agencies that provided examples for each area because most  agencies did not formally report on progress annually and the information  we reviewed does not provide a complete record of agency environmental  justice efforts.", "To examine what resources working group members used to support their  environmental justice efforts for fiscal year 2015 through 2018, we  obtained and reviewed agency budget justification documents and  agency estimates of resources data to determine which agencies (1) had  any funding or staffing resources dedicated specifically for environmental  justice in their budgets, (2) supported environmental justice efforts with a  mix of existing funding and staff from related programs, or (3) did not  report any examples of environmental justice efforts or use any resources  specifically for any environmental justice efforts. We assessed the  reliability of the agencies\u2019 estimated resources data, including for  agencies that estimated no resources were used to support any  environmental justice efforts, by corroborating it with agency budget  justification documents or internal agency budget documentation,  interviewing agency officials about the data, and comparing it with  information on any reported examples environmental justice efforts. We  found it reliable for our purposes of describing which agencies had any  resources dedicated specifically for environmental justice in their budgets  and of presenting estimates of other funding and staffing resources used  to support environmental justice efforts.", "To determine the extent to which the working group has collaborated on  environmental justice efforts, we reviewed working group documents  including the group\u2019s fiscal year 2016-2018 Framework for Collaboration  and associated progress reports, its published guidance entitled  Promising Practices for Environmental Justice Methodologies in NEPA  Reviews, and its resource guide entitled Goods Movement Federal  Resources Compendium. We also conducted semi-structured interviews  with officials from working group committees. We compared the working  group\u2019s organization, documents, and actions with key features of  collaborative mechanisms that GAO has identified, including clarifying  roles and responsibilities, participation, establishing written guidance and  agreements, and establishing outcomes and accountability. We selected  these features because they were most relevant to the activities of the  working group organization.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Examples of Agency Actions to Identify and Address Environmental Justice Issues", "paragraphs": ["Agencies provided examples of actions to identify and address  environmental justice issues:  Improve research and data collection  In 2017, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) to improve communication and  data sharing about public and HUD-assisted housing located near  contaminated Superfund sites to help both agencies prioritize actions  protecting against human health and environmental risks.", "The Department of the Interior (DOI) provided an example in which  the National Park Service used EPA\u2019s Environmental Justice Mapping  and Screening Tool (EJSCREEN) in 2015 to check for populations  with respiratory health risks near a prescribed burn area (i.e., a  planned, controlled fire to manage wildfire risks) in Jean Lafitte,  Louisiana, as part of an environmental assessment (see fig. 1 for  example of EJSCREEN display).", "Promote enforcement of health and environmental statutes", "The Department of Justice (DOJ) officials told us that its attorneys  consider environmental justice issues when pursuing cases to enforce  federal environmental laws, and in 2014 it updated and reissued  guidance on how its attorneys should identify and address  environmental justice issues in their work.
