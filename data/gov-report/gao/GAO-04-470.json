Currently, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is assessing the practicality of counting all Americans abroad by holding a test census in France, Kuwait, and Mexico. GAO was asked to (1) assess the soundness of the test design, and (2) examine what past court decisions have held about Americans' rights and obligations abroad."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the overseas enumeration test was designed to help determine the practicality of counting all Americans abroad, because of various methodological limitations, the test results will only partially answer the Bureau's key questions concerning feasibility, data quality, and cost. For example, one research questions asks, \"How good is the quality of the data?\" However, the Bureau will only measure item nonresponse, which indicates whether a person completed a particular question. As a measure of quality, it is far from complete. Similarly, although a key research objective was to determine the cost of counting Americans overseas, the Bureau's data will not inform the cost of conducting future tests or an overseas enumeration in 2010. Overall, the Bureau overstated the test's ability to answer its key research objectives. Overseas Americans have various rights and obligations to federal programs and activities. For example, Americans abroad are generally taxed on their worldwide income and can vote in federal elections, but are generally not entitled to Medicare benefits. There is nothing in the Constitution, federal law, or court decisions that would either require the Bureau to count overseas Americans, or not count this population group. As a result, Congress would need to enact legislation if it wanted to require the Bureau to include overseas Americans in the 2010 Census. Counting Americans abroad as part of the census would add new risks to an enterprise that already faces an array of challenges. Therefore, it will be important for Congress to decide whether overseas Americans should be counted as part of the census or counted as part of a separate survey or whether there are so many obstacles to a successful count regardless of the approach that the Bureau should shelve any plans for further research and testing. To the extent a second test is required, the Bureau will need to take steps to develop a more rigorous design."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["One of the thornier issues facing the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) as it  prepares for the 2010 Census is whether to count American citizens  residing abroad, and if so, how to use the results.  Under federal law, the  Bureau has discretion over whether to count this population group.  Thus,  in prior censuses, the Bureau has generally included \u201cfederally affiliated\u201d  groups\u2014members of the military and federal employees and their  dependents\u2014but has excluded private citizens residing abroad from all but  the 1960 and 1970 Censuses.  Moreover, when these overseas groups were  included in the census, their population totals were generally not included  with the counts used for apportioning Congress.", "According to the Bureau, no accurate estimate exists of the total number of  Americans living abroad.  Further, while it is unclear how counting these  individuals would affect congressional apportionment and other purposes  for which census data are used, in some instances it could be significant.   For example, in January 2001, Utah sued the U.S. Department of Commerce  claiming that it lost a congressional seat because the 2000 Census excluded  the state\u2019s 11,000 Mormon missionaries and other private citizens living  abroad.  Although the suit was unsuccessful, according to a report by the  Congressional Research Service, Utah would have gained a congressional  seat had an additional 855 people been counted in the census.", "In response to congressional direction and the concerns of various  stakeholder groups representing overseas Americans, the Census Bureau  launched a research and evaluation program to assess the practicality of  counting both private and federally affiliated U.S. citizens residing abroad,  as well as their dependents.  The first step of this effort, a test enumeration  of Americans residing in France, Kuwait, and Mexico, is currently  underway. A sound feasibility test is essential because the Bureau has  already identified a number of operational, conceptual, and policy issues  that would make an accurate count of overseas Americans even more  difficult than the stateside enumeration, an endeavor that is a daunting  challenge in its own right.  As a second step, the results of the 2004 test will  be used to provide information and recommendations for another overseas  enumeration test planned for 2006.", "To facilitate Congress\u2019s oversight of the test and provide information for  future decision making on this issue, you asked us to review the overseas  test design.  As agreed with your offices, we (1) assessed the soundness of  the Bureau\u2019s test design and its suitability for addressing the Bureau\u2019s  specific research questions, and (2) examined what past court decisions  have held about Americans\u2019 rights and obligations abroad that could help  inform whether and how they should be included in the census.", "To meet these objectives, we interviewed knowledgeable Bureau officials;  reviewed pertinent documents such as test plans; and examined relevant  statutes, court decisions, and legal analyses.  We also systematically rated  the soundness of the Bureau\u2019s test design using a checklist of over 30  design elements that, based on our review of program evaluation literature,  are important for a sound study plan.  We conducted our work from June  2003 through February 2004, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "This report is the second in our ongoing series on the planning and  development of the 2010 Census.  In a study issued earlier this year, we described the various challenges facing the 2010 Census, and the need for  the Bureau to address cost and design issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Census Bureau has discretion under the Constitution and federal  statutes to decide whether to count Americans residing overseas.  The  federal decennial census is conducted pursuant to the requirement  imposed by Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, and Section 2  of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Congress enumerate \u201cthe whole  number of persons in each State\u201d as the basis for apportionment of seats in  the United States House of Representatives.  Under the Constitution, the  census is to be conducted every 10 years \u201cin such Manner as   shall by Law direct.\u201d  Congress has exercised its authority under the  Constitution by passing the Census Act, which assigns to the Secretary of  Commerce the responsibility of \u201ctak a decennial census of population  as of the first day of April\u201d of each census year.  The Secretary does so with  the assistance of the Census Bureau and its Director.", "The statutes governing the earliest censuses provided that enumerators  should record all persons reported to them within their respective districts  as having a usual place of abode there or as usually residing within that  district, even though such persons might be \u201coccasionally absent at the time of enumeration.\u201d  Statutes governing later censuses, including the  current provisions in Title 13 of the United States Code, contain no similar  provision, or any provision specifically governing the enumeration of  inhabitants of the United States who are outside of its borders on the  enumeration date.", "To determine who should be included in the census, the Bureau applies its  \u201cusual residence rule,\u201d which has been defined as the place where a person  lives and sleeps most of the time.  People who are temporarily absent from  that place are still counted as residing there.  One\u2019s usual residence is not  necessarily the same as one\u2019s voting residence or legal residence.   Noncitizens living in the United States are counted in the census,  regardless of their immigration status.", "Historically, the census has focused primarily on the domestic population  and typically has not included any procedures designed to enumerate  Americans residing outside of the United States. The first attempts to count  Americans residing overseas were in the 1830 and 1840 censuses, which  included procedures for counting the \u201ccrews of naval vessels at sea.\u201d  The  naval personnel included in those censuses, however, were not allocated to  any individual state, and thus were not included in the apportionment  population.", "As shown in table 1, various overseas population groups were included in  the census at different times.  For example, while federally affiliated  personnel were typically included in the enumerations that took place from  1900 through 2000, only the 1970, 1990, and 2000 censuses used the  numbers for purposes of apportioning Congress.  At the same time, private  citizens living abroad were included only in the 1960 and 1970 censuses,  but not for purposes of apportionment.", "In response to congressional direction and the concerns of various  business, political, and other groups that represent overseas Americans,  the Census Bureau embarked on a research and evaluation program aimed  at determining the feasibility, quality, and cost of counting both federally  affiliated and private citizens living abroad.  The test enumeration began  February 2004 and is to run through July 2004 at three sites:  France,  Kuwait, and Mexico.", "The Bureau selected these countries based on several criteria including  their geographic diversity, the fact that large numbers of U.S. citizens reside  there, and because of the existence of administrative records that can be  used to compare to the test census counts for evaluation purposes.  The  Bureau estimated the implementation costs for the 2004 test at  approximately $2.5 million in fiscal year 2004.  Further, the Bureau  estimates that by the end of fiscal year 2004, it will have spent an additional  $3.5 million for planning and preparation during fiscal years 2003 and 2004.", "Americans can participate in the test census by completing a short-form  paper questionnaire that is available at embassies, consulates, and other  organizations that serve overseas Americans, or by completing the form on  the Internet.  The Bureau hired a public relations firm to develop a  communications strategy to inform and motivate respondents living in the  selected countries to answer the census.  Responses from the paper and  the Internet returns will be captured in order to analyze, among other  things, the demographic characteristics of respondents and patterns of  item nonresponse.  The Bureau plans to conduct a 2006 overseas test if  Congress appropriates requested funds in fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007.   If Congress then indicates its desire that the Census Bureau conduct a  general overseas enumeration in 2010, the Bureau will seek a  supplementary appropriation in calendar year 2007 for that purpose and to  conduct a 2008 overseas dress rehearsal beginning in 2007.", "A sound test is essential in order for the Bureau, Congress, and other  stakeholders to resolve the numerous logistical, conceptual, policy, and  other questions that surround the counting of overseas Americans.  They  include:  Who should be counted?  U.S. citizens only?  Foreign-born spouses?", "Children born overseas?  Dual citizens?  American citizens who have no  intention of ever returning to the United States?  Naturalized citizens?", "How should overseas Americans be assigned to individual states?  For  certain purposes, such as apportioning Congress, the Bureau would  need to assign overseas Americans to a particular state.  Should one\u2019s  state be determined by the state claimed for income tax purposes?   Where one is registered to vote?  Last state of residence before going  overseas?  These and other options all have limitations that would need  to be addressed.", "How should the population data be used?  To apportion Congress?  To  redistrict Congress?  To allocate federal funds?  To provide a count of  overseas Americans only for general informational purposes?  The  answers to these questions have significant implications for the level of  precision needed for the data and ultimately, the enumeration  methodology.", "How can the Bureau verify U.S. citizenship?  Administrative records  such as passports and Social Security data have limitations.  For  example, Americans can reside in Mexico and Canada without a  passport and many Americans overseas do not have Social Security  numbers, especially dependents.", "How can the Bureau ensure a complete count without a master address  list? The foundation of the stateside decennial census is a master  address list.  Because the list is essentially the universe of all known  living quarters in the United States, the Bureau uses it to deliver  questionnaires, follow up with nonrespondents, determine vacancies,  and determine individuals the Bureau may have missed or counted more  than once.  The Bureau lacks a complete and accurate address list of  overseas Americans.  Consequently, these operations would be  impossible and the quality of the data would suffer as a result.", "Can administrative records be used to help locate and count overseas  Americans?  Administrative records such as passport and visa files,  voter registration forms, as well as records held by private companies  and organizations have the potential to help the Bureau enumerate  Americans abroad.  However, the accuracy of these records, the  Bureau\u2019s ability to access them, confidentiality issues, and the  possibility of duplication all remain open questions.", "Do certain countries have requirements that could restrict the Bureau\u2019s  ability to conduct a count?  According to the Bureau, in planning the  overseas test, the Bureau was informed that French privacy laws  prohibit asking about race and ethnicity, two questions that are included  on the U.S. census questionnaire.  Although the Bureau worked with  French officials to address this problem, the extent to which the Bureau  will encounter restrictions in other countries, or whether other  countries will cooperate with the Bureau at all, is unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As agreed with your offices, our objectives for this report were to   (1) assess the soundness of the Bureau\u2019s test design and its suitability for  addressing the Bureau\u2019s specific research questions, and (2) examine what  past court decisions have held about Americans\u2019 rights and obligations  abroad that could help inform whether and how they should be included in  the census.", "To assess the soundness of the Bureau\u2019s 2004 overseas enumeration test  design, we interviewed knowledgeable Bureau officials and reviewed  existing documents that described the Bureau\u2019s test objectives, research  questions, and test plans.  We then systematically rated the Bureau\u2019s  approach using a checklist of over 30 design elements that, based on our  review of program evaluation literature, are relevant to a sound study plan.   For example, we reviewed the Bureau\u2019s approach to determine, among  other things,  (1) how clearly the Bureau presented the research objectives,  (2) whether the research questions matched the research objectives,   (3) whether potential biases were recognized and addressed, and (4) the  appropriateness of the data collection strategy for reaching the intended  sample population.  See appendix II for a complete list of the 30 design  elements.", "We supplemented our ratings on the suitability of the test by gathering  additional information through telephone and in-person interviews with  representatives of several stakeholder organizations that represent various  groups of Americans residing abroad.  The organizations included  Democrats Abroad, Republicans Abroad, Association of Americans  Resident Overseas, and the American Business Council of the Gulf  Countries.  In addition, we interviewed representatives of the Mexican  American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Coalition for an  Accurate Count of Asians and Pacific Islanders, and California Rural Legal  Assistance, Inc., to get their perspectives on the Bureau\u2019s plans for  counting American citizens living in Mexico, particularly migrant and  seasonal farm workers, a group that the Bureau had trouble counting  during the 2000 Census. These three organizations, while not actively  involved in the planning of the overseas enumeration test, are members of  the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s Decennial Census Advisory Committee, a  panel that advises the Bureau on various census-related issues.", "To examine what past court decisions have held about Americans\u2019 rights  and obligations living abroad, including their right to be counted in the  census, we reviewed a judgmental selection of five federal laws and/or  programs that cover large numbers of Americans stateside, in order to  determine how those laws and programs treat U.S. citizens should they live  overseas.  We examined federal election law, federal income tax law, and  federal laws relating to Social Security benefits, Supplemental Social  Security Income, and Medicare.  For each of these laws and programs, we  reviewed relevant statutes, court decisions, and legal analyses.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Commerce, which were sent to us April 13, 2004 (see app. I).

To assess the overseas test the  Bureau is planning to complete a series of evaluations due in early 2005.   The test objectives and related research questions are appropriate as  written, but, as shown in table 2, because of various methodological  limitations, the data that will result from the test will not fully answer key  questions concerning feasibility, data quality, and cost.  In short, the Bureau  overstated the research test\u2019s ability to answer its key research objectives  and, as a result, congressional decision making on this issue will be that  much more difficult."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research Question #1: Participation Data Could be Unreliable", "paragraphs": ["For the decennial census, the Bureau uses participation data as a key  indicator of public cooperation with the census.  The Bureau measures  participation levels by what it calls the \u201creturn rate,\u201d which it calculates as  a percentage of all forms in the mailback universe (excluding vacant and  nonexistent housing units) from which it receives a questionnaire.", "Stateside, the Bureau is able to perform this calculation because, as noted  above, it has a master address list of all known housing units in the United  States, an inventory that takes the Bureau several years and considerable  resources to compile.", "However, no such address list exists for overseas Americans.   Consequently, participation rates for overseas Americans cannot be  calculated and the Bureau will only be able to tally the number of  responses it receives (both overall for each site and within several  demographic categories) and compare the results to counts obtained from  administrative records.  The sources for the records include a combination  of tax, Medicare, and State Department data, as well as foreign census data  if available.  For a variety of reasons\u2014some of which the Bureau has  already acknowledged\u2014the information generated from this exercise may  not be relevant.", "First, the administrative records were developed for different purposes,  and as a result, are not well suited as a base for comparing against overseas  counts; thus, their relevance is uncertain.  As the Bureau has already  reported, each of the records it plans to use to compare to the census  counts has coverage limitations.  Further, as each of these records is  associated with particular demographic groups, they could introduce  systemic biases (we discuss potential problems with administrative  records in greater detail below, under Research Question #5).", "Second, the census counts could be problematic because it is unclear who  should participate in the overseas census, which in turn could confuse  potential respondents.  For the stateside enumeration, to determine where  an individual should be counted, the Bureau uses the concept of \u201cusual  residence,\u201d which it defines as \u201cthe place where a person lives and sleeps  most of the time.\u201d  The Bureau has developed guidelines, which it prints on  the stateside census questionnaire, to help people figure out who should  and should not be included.  However, the Bureau has not developed  similar guidance for the overseas test.  According to the Bureau, this was  intentional; because this was an initial feasibility test, the Bureau did not  want to restrict response, but rather to encourage the widest possible  participation.", "Further, the guidance the Bureau has developed, which is available on its  Web site and promotional literature, is vague and could confuse potential  respondents.  For example, the guidelines inform potential respondents  that, \u201cAll U.S. citizens living in France, Mexico and Kuwait, regardless of  shared citizenship, can and should participate in the test.  U.S. citizens on  vacation or on short business trips should not.\u201d  Unclear is what constitutes  a short or long business trip.  Is it 3 weeks or 3 months?  Does it matter  whether one stays in a hotel or an apartment?  Also, should naturalized U.S.  citizens, some of whom may not return to the United States, participate?   What about children born in the United States to noncitizens, but who only  lived in the United States a short time?  Should students spending a  semester abroad but who maintain a permanent residence stateside be  included?  Without clear residence rules and appropriate guidance  indicating who should be counted, it is quite possible that some people  might inappropriately opt in or out of the census, which would reduce the  quality of the data.  Bureau officials have told us that they are working to  develop residence rules that it will apply if there is a second overseas  enumeration test in 2006.", "Participation data might also be problematic because the Bureau\u2019s  enumeration methods strategy might not be as effective with certain  groups compared to others.  To the extent this occurs, it could introduce a  systemic undercount.  This is particularly true for dual nationals who, for  cultural reasons, may not think of themselves as American citizens.", "For example, according to representatives of two advocacy groups we  contacted, Mexican dual nationals include migrant farm workers, a group  that often consists of poor, less-educated people living in rural areas.  They  noted that this population group has low literacy levels and thus might not  understand the questionnaire, and is not likely to have Internet access.  At  the same time, they are not likely to pick up a copy of the questionnaire at  an embassy.  Further, the barriers that make it difficult to count migrant  farm workers in the United States, such as a distrust of government and the  fact that they may speak indigenous languages, also make it difficult to  count this group in Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Question #2: Information on Data Quality Will be Limited", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau plans on measuring the quality of the data collected in the  overseas test by tabulating item nonresponse, which refers to whether a  respondent completed a particular question.

However, as the  Bureau acknowledges in its study plan for evaluating the quality of the  overseas enumeration data, item nonresponse by itself does not address  the quality of the data.  Thus, at the end of the test, the Bureau will have, at  best, only limited information on the quality of the overseas data.", "By comparison, the Bureau\u2019s guidelines for measuring data quality in other  surveys they conduct use measures such as coverage, unit response rates,  imputation rates, and data collection errors.  Because the Bureau lacks  information on the universe of overseas Americans it will be unable to  calculate these indicators.  Therefore, it is misleading for the Bureau to  state in its research objectives that it will determine the quality of the  overseas data, when in fact it will deliver something far more limited.   Comprehensive measures of data quality are critical because they could  help Congress decide whether the data are sufficiently reliable to use for  specific purposes.  If the numbers were to be used to obtain a simple count  of Americans abroad, absolute precision is not as critical.  However, for  other uses of the data, particularly congressional apportionment and  redistricting, the quality of the data would need to be far higher."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Question #3: The Bureau Will be Unable to Geocode Certain U.S. Addresses", "paragraphs": ["Counting people in their correct locations is essential for congressional  apportionment, redistricting, and certain other uses of census data.  With  respect to Americans abroad, if the data are to be used for apportionment,  the Bureau would need to assign respondents to a specific state.  For  purposes of redistricting and allocating federal funds, the Bureau would  need to assign overseas respondents to specific neighborhoods and street  addresses in the United States\u2014a far more challenging task.  Geocoding is  the  process of linking an address in the Bureau\u2019s Master Address File  (MAF) to a geographic location in the Bureau\u2019s geographic database,  known as the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and  Referencing (TIGER) mapping system.  To obtain this information, the  overseas enumeration form asks respondents to indicate their U.S. state of  last residence, and their last street address within that state.", "Although the Bureau is assessing the level of geography to which it can  geocode the overseas population, an important limitation is that the Bureau  will not be able to make this assessment for people who live in certain  noncity-style U.S. addresses; that is, U.S. addresses without a housing  number and/or street name.  Specifically, people whose U.S. addresses  consist of a post office box will be excluded from the study.  For the  stateside enumeration, Bureau employees canvass the country, identify  noncity-style addresses, and mark the locations of those residences on a  map.  During the 2000 Census, around 20 percent of U.S. households had  noncity-style addresses.", "Indeed, the overseas enumeration questionnaire instructs respondents not  to provide a post office box number for their last stateside address.   However, if a respondent\u2019s address includes a post office box or rural route  number, it is unclear how they are supposed to complete this question.   Also unclear is how migrant farm workers, who may not have had an  address in the United States, would complete this question.", "To the extent they leave the question blank, the Bureau would be unable to  distinguish between those people who did so because they have a noncity- style address, or left it blank for privacy or other reasons.  This could affect  the accuracy of the Bureau\u2019s assessment.  Moreover, the construction of the  question could introduce a systemic bias because those states with large  rural areas are more likely to have noncity-style addresses.", "The Bureau\u2019s evaluation plan recognizes that respondents in the 2004  overseas enumeration test may provide noncity-style addresses which  cannot be geocoded by the TIGER system.

The organizations included advocacy  groups, universities, church groups, and corporations.", "The Bureau anticipates that these stakeholders will help get the word out  via e-mail, newsletters, and other media that a test census of Americans  overseas is underway.  In addition, the Bureau is to provide copies of the  overseas questionnaire to stakeholders so that they can distribute them to  their members and constituents.  As noted earlier, questionnaires will also  be available on the Internet, as well as at public places that Americans may  visit, such as embassies and consulates.  The Bureau has produced posters  and pamphlets to promote the test (see fig. 1).

Rather, the Bureau defines a valid  return as one where at least one person in the household checked the U.S.  citizen box on the questionnaire, provided a valid Social Security or U.S.  passport number, and has been subject to and passes an algorithm that  analyzes data from the questionnaire.  All other returns are invalid.  Thus,  what the Bureau is really measuring is whether a questionnaire is eligible  for further processing, and not whether the respondent lives abroad.  Put  another way, anyone who completes a questionnaire with valid data,  including Social Security numbers, would be considered a valid return,  regardless of whether the individual lived in the test areas.", "This is not an unlikely scenario given the way the Bureau set up its Internet  site.
