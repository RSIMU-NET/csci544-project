Not only do these laboratories conduct activities related to the design, construction, and maintenance of nuclear weapons\u2014a long-standing target of foreign espionage\u2014but they also conduct research into many areas of high technology, such as laser fusion, high-performance computers, and microelectronics. Their research is often done in collaboration with industry, and sometimes foreign countries, to develop new technologies for commercial applications. Accordingly, their work is of interest to other countries, and thousands of foreign nationals visit these laboratories each year to participate in such research. The high number of foreign visitors, as well as some recent investigative cases involving foreign nationals at DOE\u2019s laboratories, have increased concerns that these laboratories are targets of foreign espionage efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Weapons Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories\u2014the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico\u2014have been the cornerstones of the U.S. weapons program for over 40 years. In this regard, they are unique among DOE\u2019s laboratories. Government-owned and contractor-operated, these three laboratories have been assigned specific missions for nuclear weapons development as well as other programmatic responsibilities. Over time, the laboratories have increasingly expanded their responsibilities in nondefense research areas.", "The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is operated by the University of California for DOE. Established in 1952, the laboratory occupies 1-square mile in Livermore, California. The laboratory\u2019s major missions include nuclear weapons research and development to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile; other weapons and defense-related activities for DOE and the Department of Defense; inertial confinement fusion (a technology that has both energy and nuclear weapons testing applications); and nuclear nonproliferation.", "The Los Alamos National Laboratory, also operated by the University of California for DOE, was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project that developed the first nuclear weapons. Located approximately 35 miles from Santa Fe, New Mexico, the laboratory covers an area of approximately 43 square miles. The laboratory conducts an array of classified and unclassified activities, including all phases of nuclear weapons research, design, and testing; other weapons-related research for DOE; and management of special nuclear materials, such as plutonium. Recently, Los Alamos was given responsibility for the production of certain weapons components.", "The Sandia National Laboratories are operated for DOE by the Lockheed Martin Corporation. Sandia, established in 1949, is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and works in conjunction with Livermore and Los Alamos to design and develop nuclear weapons. Sandia conducts research, development, and engineering on all facets of weapons design and development except the nuclear explosive components. Sandia also produces some of the nonnuclear components, such as neutron generators, that are needed for nuclear weapons.", "Although the Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia laboratories are involved in research and development activities related to nuclear weapons, in recent years many of their efforts have expanded beyond issues strictly related to defense or national security. The laboratories are now involved in such areas as high-performance computers, lasers, and microelectronics. Furthermore, they perform research in such diverse areas as biomedicine, environmental restoration, and global climate change. In addition, the laboratories are working with industry to develop new technologies and products for the commercial market. Such activities include work on advanced automobile propulsion systems, medical applications, and waste management. Furthermore, each laboratory conducts basic scientific research in areas of its own choosing\u2014termed Laboratory Directed Research and Development. This research involves such subjects as astrophysics and space science, particle physics, materials science, and chemistry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controls Over Foreign Visits to the Weapons Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["Because the Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia laboratories are world-leading centers of research in many technologies and scientific disciplines, many foreign scientists are attracted to them and invited to come there to exchange information or participate in research activities. DOE\u2019s policy supports an active program of unclassified visits to these laboratories for the benefit of its programs. In fact, DOE and the laboratories have cooperative activities with certain countries to exchange scientists and information and to collaborate on research in selected scientific areas.", "With the easing of global tensions since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the changing missions of the weapons laboratories, the number of unclassified foreign visits to the laboratories has increased significantly. The average annual number of visits by foreign nationals to the laboratories has increased over 50 percent from the late-1980s to the mid-1990s. Furthermore, this increase in foreign visitors is continuing. As shown in figure 1.4, the number of unclassified foreign visits to the laboratories has increased each of the last 3 years, to a level of about 7,000 visits in 1996. This represents a significant portion of the 20,000 or more unclassified foreign visits estimated by DOE to have occurred at all of its laboratories during 1996.", "Allowing foreign nationals to visit the weapons laboratories and participate in their unclassified activities provides valuable benefits to the laboratories and the country, such as using the visitors\u2019 skills to increase the chances of making significant scientific advancements. However, because such visits are not without risk, DOE Order 1240.2b\u2014Unclassified Visits and Assignments by Foreign Nationals, September 3, 1992\u2014establishes responsibilities and policies and prescribes administrative procedures for controlling unclassified visits and assignments to DOE\u2019s facilities. Until recently, the foreign visitor program was principally administered by the Office of Policy and International Affairs, but in March 1997 this responsibility was transferred to the Office of Resource Management in the Office of Nonproliferation and National Security. Other principal organizations involved in administering and controlling unclassified foreign visits include the Nuclear Transfer and Supplier Policy Division, Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation; the Office of Safeguards and Security, Office of Security Affairs; the Counterintelligence Division, Office of Energy Intelligence; the appropriate headquarters program office that is sponsoring the visit; DOE field offices; and laboratory management.", "As defined by the order, visits are short-term stays of 30 days or less for the purposes of orientation, technical discussions, observation of projects or experiments, training, or discussion of collaboration on topics of mutual interest. Assignments are long-term stays of more than 30 days (within a 12-month period) to actively participate in the work of a facility or contribute to its projects. Assignments are limited to 2 years but may be extended. Assignees may include foreign nationals who are employees, as well as those who are guests or consultants. According to DOE\u2019s estimates, over 25 percent of the foreign visitors to its weapons laboratories are assignees.", "DOE\u2019s foreign visit and assignment order identifies several requirements for reviewing, approving, and documenting foreign nationals\u2019 access to its nuclear weapons laboratories. Although the order, in general, allows most foreign nationals access with little oversight by DOE, the Department views some visits and assignments to be of potential concern. These include visits from countries DOE considers sensitive for reasons of national security, nuclear nonproliferation, regional instability, or terrorism support (see app. I for a list of these countries). Data from DOE and the laboratories show that almost 30 percent of the visitors to its weapons laboratories are from sensitive countries. DOE is also concerned about visits involving subjects which, although unclassified, are considered sensitive because they have the potential to enhance nuclear weapons capability, lead to nuclear proliferation, divulge militarily critical technologies, or reveal other advanced technologies (see app. II for a list of these subjects) as well as visits to areas located within the laboratories where special nuclear material and/or classified information and equipment are located.", "Certain requirements must be met if a foreign visit or assignment involves a sensitive country, a sensitive subject, or a security facility where classified work is conducted. According to the foreign visits and assignments order, all assignments and visits involving sensitive subjects or security facilities where classified work is conducted must be reviewed and approved by DOE. Furthermore, before an assignment involving a visitor from a sensitive country begins, a national security background check must be completed to determine if appropriate U.S. government agencies have derogatory information, such as an intelligence affiliation, about that individual.", "DOE also has security procedures that control the access of foreign visitors to the weapons laboratories. All foreign visitors\u2014whether on a visit or an assignment\u2014must wear an appropriate badge to obtain entry to various parts of a weapons laboratory. Furthermore, depending upon the facility involved, the days of the week and the hours during which the foreign national can actually be on site are restricted. Finally, guards and other security countermeasures are used to control access to those parts of the laboratories where classified work is conducted. Security forces and other countermeasures are also used to monitor and control access to the less protected, controlled areas known as property protection areas\u2014which are not open to the general public and which may contain unclassified sensitive information\u2014to ensure that this information is not compromised.", "As an added line of defense, DOE and its laboratories operate counterintelligence programs to identify and mitigate the risk that sensitive information could be divulged to foreign countries. Among other things, the counterintelligence personnel conduct awareness programs to keep employees aware of the risk of foreign intelligence-gathering activities, brief and debrief employees who host foreign visitors, conduct assessments of foreign visitor activity, and disseminate relevant information throughout the DOE community. However, they have no approval authority for foreign visitors. The laboratories\u2019 counterintelligence programs do not conduct counterintelligence \u201coperations,\u201d such as surveillance activities. Situations of concern are referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which performs counterintelligence operations or investigations as necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Exist About the Potential Compromise of Sensitive Information", "paragraphs": ["The risk that classified or sensitive information may be compromised through foreign espionage is real and has been long-standing. Espionage against the weapons laboratories occurred as long ago as the 1940s when the Manhattan Project was developing the nation\u2019s first nuclear weapons. As documented in a 1996 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report that detailed recently declassified documents, key information on nuclear weapons was obtained from Los Alamos by the Soviet Union. In the 1980s and 1990s, there have been other espionage activities against DOE\u2019s laboratories, but information on these incidents remains classified. DOE, laboratory, and other agency counterintelligence professionals briefed us on them, which included recent cases involving the possible theft or compromise of sensitive information in which foreign nationals at DOE\u2019s laboratories played a prominent role.", "The large and increasing number of foreign nationals visiting DOE\u2019s laboratories has raised concerns about the potential compromise of classified information or other sensitive or proprietary information at these facilities. Counterintelligence professionals point out that (1) the laboratories have desirable assets in the form of classified information and unclassified but sensitive information; (2) access by foreign nationals, even for a short time, can provide the opportunity to identify and target laboratory information; and (3) repeated and long-term contact between laboratory personnel and foreign nationals can create relationships that foreign countries can use to obtain information. They add that the threat has become more complex because not only is information on nuclear weapons desirable to some foreign countries, but information and technology of economic benefit is of great importance to all countries. Consequently, the laboratories face the risk of economic espionage by enemies and allies alike.", "Past unclassified work done by GAO and classified work by others have shown the risks of foreign visits and DOE\u2019s problems in controlling foreign visitors\u2019 presence at its laboratories. In 1988, we reported that major weaknesses existed in DOE\u2019s foreign visitor program and, as a result, suspected foreign intelligence agents and individuals from facilities suspected of conducting nuclear weapons activities had obtained access to the laboratories without DOE\u2019s prior knowledge. More recently, classified reports\u2014in 1992 by an intelligence community interagency working group and in 1997 by the FBI\u2014have pointed out basic problems with DOE\u2019s counterintelligence efforts regarding the presence of foreign nationals at DOE\u2019s laboratories.", "DOE itself is concerned about the number of foreign visitors to its facilities and the potential threat of espionage they pose and has obtained additional funding to help its counterintelligence programs respond to this potential threat. Counterintelligence funding for headquarters program direction and field activities in fiscal year 1996 totaled about $3.2 million.

This report completes our work on DOE\u2019s controls over foreign visitors and, as agreed with Committee staff, addresses DOE\u2019s (1) procedures for reviewing the backgrounds of foreign visitors and for controlling the dissemination of sensitive information to them, (2) security controls for limiting foreign visitors\u2019 access to areas and information within its laboratories, and (3) counterintelligence programs for mitigating the potential threat posed by foreign visitors.", "To obtain an overall perspective on DOE\u2019s foreign visitor procedures, security controls, and counterintelligence efforts, we obtained and reviewed pertinent DOE and laboratory orders, documents, and other materials. We also met with and interviewed DOE headquarters, field office, and contractor officials, including officials from DOE\u2019s Offices of Defense Programs, Nonproliferation and National Security, and Policy and International Affairs in Washington, D.C., and in Germantown, Maryland, as well as officials at DOE\u2019s field locations in Albuquerque and Los Alamos, New Mexico, and in Livermore, California. We also met with contractor officials at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California; the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico; and the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Furthermore, we met with officials from the FBI to obtain their views on the risk of, and control over, foreign visitors to DOE\u2019s laboratories.", "In reviewing procedures on background checks for foreign visitors, we reviewed data on visits that occurred between January 1994 and December 1996. We examined records on visits and background checks contained in (1) DOE\u2019s centralized computer database on foreign visitors, (2) the laboratories\u2019 badging office and local foreign visitor databases, and (3) DOE\u2019s centralized counterintelligence database. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the information in these databases; however, we did obtain additional verification of visit information as necessary to complete our review. In particular, our analysis focused on the adequacy of DOE\u2019s controls related to high-risk visitors (i.e., visitors from sensitive countries who potentially could have derogatory national security information on file). In this regard, we tracked information on such visitors by examining DOE\u2019s records on background checks and by independently obtaining some background checks from the FBI.", "To examine the process used for identifying sensitive subjects and controlling the dissemination of such information to foreign visitors, we obtained and analyzed pertinent guidance on sensitive subjects and discussed with DOE and contractor officials (including some who had hosted foreign visitors) the methods by which visits involving sensitive subjects are identified. We examined records on several hundred visits that occurred from January 1994 through December 1996. We judgmentally selected for further analysis over 150 visits that were not identified as involving sensitive subjects and compared the visits\u2019 purpose and/or subject with those identified on DOE\u2019s sensitive subject list. We discussed these visits with DOE officials in its Nuclear Transfer and Supplier Policy Division, which is responsible for reviewing visits that involve sensitive subjects, to obtain their perspectives on the accuracy of the identification of sensitive subjects. Additionally, we followed up with researchers and managers at these laboratories who frequently host foreign visitors concerning whether individual research projects that involved foreign nationals involved sensitive subjects.", "To assess the security controls associated with foreign visitors\u2019 access to certain areas and information within DOE\u2019s laboratories, we obtained and examined security procedures, plans, surveys, and statements of threat. Our work included a review of laboratory security infractions, violations, and occurrences, as well as laboratory counterintelligence contact/incident reports. Additionally, we obtained unclassified program and building security assessments that identified problems and vulnerabilities. While touring laboratory facilities with security personnel, we observed the security controls in place for both classified and unclassified sensitive research.", "To review the counterintelligence programs, we interviewed DOE, laboratory, and FBI counterintelligence officials and obtained pertinent documentation regarding the potential threat posed by foreign visitors to the weapons laboratories and DOE\u2019s activities to counter this threat. In particular, we attended a classified counterintelligence briefing that was held for staff of DOE\u2019s Albuquerque Operations Office, which discussed the foreign visitor threat. We also examined the laboratories\u2019 counterintelligence contact/incident reports and observed the capabilities of DOE\u2019s centralized counterintelligence database. In addition, we obtained and reviewed assessments of DOE\u2019s counterintelligence programs that had been conducted by other organizations in the U.S. intelligence community.", "We encountered two limitations in our attempts to examine DOE\u2019s controls over foreign visitors to its laboratories. First, our request to the CIA for access to data on the backgrounds of foreign visitors was denied on grounds of the sensitivity of the data. As a result, we were unable to review background information from the CIA that was on file at DOE or to independently obtain background data from the CIA. Second, we requested from the FBI specific information on possible espionage or other illegal activities at the laboratories. However, FBI officials told us that disclosure of such information is contrary to FBI policy; consequently, the requested information was not provided to us.", "We provided a draft of this report to DOE for its review and comment.

Additionally, background checks must be proposed by the laboratories to DOE\u2019s Counterintelligence Division for short-term visitors from sensitive countries, but the division has the discretion to determine whether the background check should be done. For example, the Counterintelligence Division may choose to request background checks on sensitive-country visitors who will be entering security areas or discussing sensitive subjects. The checks are obtained from government intelligence and investigative agencies, such as the CIA and the FBI. At DOE\u2019s request, these agencies review their files and report to DOE whether intelligence information of a derogatory nature exists about a particular visitor (e.g., that the visitor is suspected of having ties to a foreign intelligence service or terrorist group). DOE\u2019s order also requires that some background checks\u2014those considered necessary to approve a visit or assignment\u2014be completed before the visit or assignment begins. Many other checks done on visitors need not be completed before the visit begins\u2014these are checks considered needed for counterintelligence research purposes only.", "Although DOE uses the results of these background checks to approve proposed visits and to help mitigate any risks related to them, the existence of derogatory information about a foreign visitor does not preclude a visit from occurring. According to DOE officials, if a background check reveals derogatory information about a foreign visitor, the visit is rarely denied. Instead, DOE allows the visit to occur but, depending on the results of the check and other factors, may increase the stringency of escort requirements or may restrict the length of the visit, the buildings to be accessed, or the subjects to be discussed. Thus, the background check serves as means to forewarn DOE and laboratory officials of possible national security concerns so they may devise appropriate countermeasures where needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Background Checks Are Performed on Sensitive-Country Visitors to the Los Alamos and Sandia Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["Few background checks are performed for visitors to DOE\u2019s Los Alamos and Sandia laboratories. In August 1994, these laboratories implemented a partial exception from the foreign visitor order that was granted by DOE. Under the terms of this exception, the two laboratories are required to request background checks only on those foreign visitors planning to enter a security area at the laboratory or to discuss sensitive subjects. According to DOE and laboratory officials, the partial exception for Los Alamos and Sandia was granted because of the high volume of foreign nationals desiring to visit these weapons laboratories, which contributed to processing backlogs, and the costs associated with processing paperwork for foreign visitors. Laboratory officials said the processing backlogs caused delays that resulted in some visits having to be canceled because of uncompleted background checks.", "The partial exception has limited the number of requests for background checks on visitors to Los Alamos and Sandia. As a result, DOE obtains relatively few background checks on visitors to those laboratories, particularly in comparison to Livermore, which did not request an exception from the order\u2019s requirements. Our review of DOE\u2019s records of foreign visitors showed that, during the 3-year period from 1994 through 1996, background checks were obtained on only 5 percent of the visitors from sensitive countries to Los Alamos and Sandia. In contrast, Livermore requested checks on many more names during that timeframe, and background checks were obtained on 44 percent of the visitors from sensitive countries to this laboratory. Table 2.1 compares the number of background checks obtained on sensitive-country visitors for the three laboratories.", "Data on foreign visitors from individual sensitive countries also showed significant differences among the laboratories. For example, 46 percent of the Russian visitors to Livermore were checked during that 3-year period, compared to 10 and 7 percent, respectively, for Los Alamos and Sandia. Furthermore, 39 percent of the Chinese visitors to Livermore were checked, compared to 2 and 1 percent, respectively, for Los Alamos and Sandia.

According to FBI counterintelligence officials, the low percentage of background checks conducted on Russian and Chinese visitors to Los Alamos and Sandia does not constitute effective use of the background check process. Statistics on the results of background checks DOE did request support this. Of all the background checks DOE obtained on visitors from sensitive countries to the weapons laboratories during the 1994 through 1996 timeframe, about 4 percent of the checks that DOE received indicated the existence of derogatory information.", "Moreover, we noted during our review that people with suspected foreign intelligence connections were let into the laboratories without background checks. We were able to document 13 instances where persons with suspected foreign intelligence connections were allowed access without background checks\u20148 visitors went to Los Alamos and 5 went to Sandia\u2014during the 1994 through 1996 period. Available records also indicated that 8 other persons with suspected connections to foreign intelligence services were approved for access to Sandia during the period; however, DOE and Sandia lacked adequate records to confirm whether the persons actually accessed the facility. Although we could not confirm that any of these visits compromised U.S. security, at a minimum, the lack of a background check did not provide DOE the opportunity to implement countermeasures to mitigate the potential risk posed by these visits. Also, all of these instances occurred at the two weapons laboratories that had been granted a partial exception to DOE\u2019s foreign visitor order.", "DOE\u2019s requirements for national security background checks represent a continuing problem that we previously identified in a 1988 GAO report and about which elements of the U.S. intelligence community have also expressed concern.

They added that although data from a background check\u2014even derogatory data\u2014is rarely used to deny a visitor access to a laboratory, obtaining such information is beneficial in identifying individuals known to be a risk.

In November 1996, DOE\u2019s Deputy Secretary expressed concerns about the presence of foreign visitors at the laboratories, and as a result, several departmentwide corrective actions are now underway.", "In the spring of 1996, the director of DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Intelligence briefed the staff of several congressional committees about the concerns raised by the increasing number of foreign visitors to its laboratories and the threat they posed. In the fall of that year, the Congress provided DOE with an additional $5 million for fiscal year 1997 to expand counterintelligence activities at its weapons laboratories and other high-risk facilities. Of the $5 million, about half\u2014$2.47 million\u2014went to the three nuclear weapons laboratories. The additional funds were used to increase the number of counterintelligence staff at those laboratories and for counterintelligence-related analyses. As a result, DOE has increased the counterintelligence staff at the weapons laboratories.", "On November 21, 1996, the then Deputy Secretary of Energy initiated several corrective measures to improve DOE\u2019s foreign visitors program. The Deputy Secretary met with officials of five DOE facilities: the three weapons laboratories, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory. Among the corrective measures the Deputy Secretary and these officials agreed to complete during fiscal year 1997 were the following:", "Develop training in export control and provide that training to laboratory staff at those five facilities.", "Develop new guidance on unclassified, but sensitive, subjects (i.e., matters unsuitable for discussion with a foreign visitor).", "Develop laboratory threat assessments of foreign visits and assignments.", "Develop a DOE-wide comprehensive threat assessment of foreign visits and assignments.", "However, counterintelligence officials at headquarters expressed concerns about DOE\u2019s ability to complete these initiatives because DOE has historically given its counterintelligence program a low priority and the tendency for the laboratories to resist headquarters management. They said that they are hopeful that DOE\u2019s current Secretary will support these initiatives in the counterintelligence program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["With the end of the Cold War, DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories have been moving away from secret research toward more open and cooperative research with a variety of nations and an increasing number of foreign nationals. Open collaboration can greatly benefit DOE and the United States by stimulating the exchange of ideas and promoting cooperation. This in turn can lead to more efficient research and increase the likelihood of important scientific discoveries. While recognizing that such cooperation is beneficial, it is important to note that foreign espionage efforts against DOE\u2019s weapons laboratories may be more active than ever. Furthermore, these efforts may have expanded to include industrial espionage. All of this puts new burdens on DOE\u2019s security.", "To respond to these challenges, DOE cannot entirely rely on systems left over from the Cold War. For a long time, DOE\u2019s security controls have emphasized \u201cguns, guards, and gates,\u201d as well as strict control over anyone, including foreign visitors, allowed to enter the weapons laboratories. Where visitors went, whom they talked to, and what they saw were more carefully controlled than they are today. These controls, while still necessary in some places, cannot be expected to work in locations where openness, collaboration, and free access to information and ideas are encouraged. In these places, DOE needs a more sophisticated security strategy that is consistent with the laboratories\u2019 more open missions and includes a greater role played by DOE and laboratory counterintelligence programs.", "Now more than ever, effective counterintelligence efforts must be central to DOE\u2019s security strategy. Greater counterintelligence program effectiveness can be achieved through the development of a comprehensive threat assessment to determine the nature, extent, and targets of foreign espionage efforts against DOE\u2019s weapons laboratories. Such an assessment could also form the basis for developing counterintelligence program performance measures as well as periodic headquarters evaluations of each laboratory\u2019s performance. These evaluations would determine how effectively each laboratory is addressing the established performance measures and how their counterintelligence programs can be improved.", "In addition to establishing performance measures for DOE\u2019s counterintelligence program, other parts of the overall strategy could be improved by clarifying what constitute sensitive subjects, tightening procedures for background checks, and reassessing procedures for foreign visits to controlled areas. For example, clarifying what subjects are sensitive and requiring an independent review by technically qualified personnel of all subjects proposed for discussion during a visit would help ensure that researchers, program managers, and DOE headquarters officials would have the same understanding of what needs to be protected so discussions of sensitive subjects would not occur without the knowledge of DOE. DOE and laboratory officials recognize the problems with identifying sensitive subjects and have established internal review processes to better focus on those foreign visits that involve sensitive subjects. However, without a clear understanding of what information DOE considers sensitive, these improved review processes cannot provide adequate assurance that foreign visits involving sensitive subjects are appropriately identified and reviewed.", "Increasing the number of background checks on foreign visitors from sensitive countries will enable DOE to better assess individual situations from a security point of view. When necessary, actions can then be taken to mitigate the risks of a particular visit. While background checks cannot identify all foreign visitors who pose a risk, they are a valuable tool for alerting DOE and the laboratories of situations that may warrant more attention and control. DOE\u2019s current foreign visitor order contains requirements that would increase the number of background checks obtained; enforcing those requirements at the laboratories, especially at Los Alamos and Sandia, should enable DOE to expand its advance knowledge of risks associated with the visits and, if necessary, mitigate those risks.", "Finally, a specific assessment of vulnerabilities related access to unclassified, but sensitive information in controlled areas is needed. This assessment will help ensure that procedures for these areas are consistent from laboratory to laboratory and security vulnerabilities and/or problems are identified and corrected. In addition, this assessment could identify best practices that DOE could disseminate for use to all laboratories for improving the protection of sensitive information that may be exposed to foreign visitors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Energy:", "Direct DOE\u2019s Counterintelligence Division to perform a comprehensive assessment of the espionage threat against DOE and the weapons laboratories to serve as the basis for determining appropriate countermeasures and resource levels for laboratory counterintelligence programs. To the extent possible, this assessment should include the laboratories as well as other agencies with appropriate expertise, such as the FBI and CIA.", "Establish appropriate program performance measures and expectations for the laboratories\u2019 counterintelligence activities and require periodic performance reviews to help determine if their activities are effectively preventing foreign espionage.", "Revise DOE\u2019s foreign visitor order to (1) clarify to all DOE and laboratory contractor personnel the specific types of unclassified, but sensitive, subjects that require protection from compromise by foreign nationals and (2) require that the subjects of visits be independently reviewed by experts with appropriate technical backgrounds\u2014such as laboratory individuals involved in export control issues\u2014to verify that visits involving sensitive subjects are adequately identified for DOE\u2019s review.", "Require that DOE and the weapons laboratories comply with the current foreign visitor order by obtaining background checks on all assignees from sensitive countries. Further, require the laboratories to inform headquarters of the names of all other proposed foreign visitors from sensitive countries so DOE\u2019s Counterintelligence Division can obtain additional background checks at its discretion.", "Require that security measures at each laboratory\u2019s controlled areas\u2014those most accessible to foreign visitors\u2014be assessed to ensure that the controls over persons and information in these areas are effective. This assessment should also identify the best practices at each laboratory to improve protection of sensitive information that may be exposed to foreign visitors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["DOE had no comments on the general nature of the facts in the report and concurred with our recommendations. The Department, however, believes that the report overstates the value of background checks on foreign visitors. DOE believes that foreign intelligence services increasingly rely on \u201cnon-official collectors\u201d\u2014who would have clear background checks\u2014instead of intelligence officers. We do not believe we are overvaluing background checks. We recognize that these checks are but one factor DOE considers in approving foreign visits. Nevertheless, the information obtained through background checks can be of importance in determining if additional risk is associated with a foreign visitor. Consequently, we are recommending that DOE complete background checks in accordance with its foreign visits and assignments order.", "DOE also suggested that we revise our recommendation on the assessments of information security in controlled areas. A key point in DOE\u2019s suggested revision was to have the recommendation specify that an operations security assessment be done of each laboratory\u2019s controlled areas, whereas we recommended only that an assessment be done. We did not revise our recommendation to specify this type of assessment because, while we believe that operations security principles and personnel must be part of any assessment of the laboratories\u2019 controlled areas, other elements of DOE\u2019s security programs can also provide value in an assessment. We do not want to be overly prescriptive on how and/or by whom these assessments be done. DOE also suggested that the wording of the recommendation more clearly focus on protecting sensitive information. We revised the recommendation to clarify that the assessments should identify the best practices to improve the protection of sensitive information. Finally, DOE\u2019s response detailed a number of actions it has taken or plans to take to address the recommendations. We did not address these actions as part of our work.
