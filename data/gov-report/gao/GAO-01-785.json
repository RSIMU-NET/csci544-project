Personnel in retention-critical occupations were generally as satisfied with military life as were other enlisted personnel and each group's career intentions were similar. Nearly half of both retention-critical and other enlisted personnel were satisfied with the military way of life. Perceptions of civilian life for those serving in retention-critical occupations were mixed. Overall, most enlisted personnel had a positive perception about work-related opportunities and the quality of life available in the civilian world. Those in retention-critical occupations that had highly marketable skills, such as electronics equipment repairers, were especially optimistic about their prospects for civilian employment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Widespread reports of flagging military morale raise an important question: is dissatisfaction with the military way of life driving highly trained individuals out, or are they being lured away by more favorable civilian opportunities? In recent years, the Department of Defense (DOD) has become increasingly concerned about its ability to retain enough personnel to fulfill its missions and is particularly concerned about retaining personnel who possess specialized skills. Human capital management is not only a problem for DOD, but as we have reported, it is also an area of concern throughout the federal government today. Overall, the military reports that it is meeting its aggregate retention goals, but DOD leaders remain concerned that they are significantly challenged in their efforts to compete with the private sector for individuals with specialized skills.", "In response to your request, we analyzed the results of DOD's 1999 broad- based survey of active duty personnel to help shed light on why servicemembers in critical occupational areas might be leaving the military. We helped the Department design this survey and previously testified before the Subcommittee on the results of our preliminary analysis. This analysis revealed that more military personnel are satisfied than dissatisfied with the military way of life. Following our testimony, the Subcommittee asked us to use the final survey data to more closely examine the responses of personnel serving in retention-critical occupations and compare them to those of other enlisted personnel. We focused our analysis on three areas: (1) what were the expectations and experiences of enlisted personnel, (2) how satisfied were they with military life and what were their career intentions, and (3) what were their perceptions of civilian work opportunities and quality of life.  We defined a difference to be both significant and meaningful if the responses of retention-critical personnel and other enlisted personnel differed by \u00b17 percentage points.", "To address these objectives, we worked closely with each of the four services to determine what occupations they consider \"retention-critical\" because of their impact on readiness. Identifying occupations that are retention-critical proved difficult because each service defines the term differently. Ultimately, they identified 64 occupations that were of concern. We grouped the occupations into three broad occupational areas\u2014electronic equipment repairers, communications and intelligence specialists, and electrical and mechanical equipment repairers. These broad areas include specific jobs like sonar equipment repairers, radio and radar repairers, air traffic controllers, and aircraft and automotive mechanics. Combined, the services employ about 300,000 retention-critical enlisted personnel in these three broad areas. This represents about 29 percent of the entire enlisted force. We compared the perceptions of the personnel in these retention-critical occupations to those of other enlisted personnel. Details on our objectives, scope, and methodology are in Appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["During the early and mid-1990s, when the military reduced personnel levels, retention was not a primary concern. However, DOD and Congress have long recognized that some servicemembers, particularly those in certain technical areas, can be difficult to retain. In 1998, DOD raised concerns about retention overall and about the quality and readiness of its forces. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in September 1998, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that retention rates had declined force-wide and within specific critical occupations. In response to these concerns, Congress increased military pay across-the-board and repealed legislation that lowered retirement benefits for some military personnel. In the last quarter of fiscal year 2000, the services reported they were generally successful in retaining more personnel at the aggregate level but were still concerned about readiness in selected critical skill areas.", "To determine which occupations were of greatest concern, we asked DOD and each of the services to identify and prioritize occupations they deemed retention-critical due to their impact on force readiness. In response, the services identified 64 service-specific occupations as retention-critical. To make comparisons between the different service occupations possible, we used DOD's occupational coding scheme to organize each of the service occupations into broader occupational groupings. For example, each of the services identified radio and radar repair personnel as a retention-critical occupation. Using DOD's occupational coding scheme, radio and radar repairers fall within the electronic equipment repair occupational area.  All of our analyses were conducted at this occupational area level. By organizing the service occupations into their respective groups and ultimately into occupational areas, we were able to consolidate the services' list of 64 retention-critical occupations into 16 occupational groups and then further into three occupational areas (see table 1).", "In a November 2000 report to Congress, DOD acknowledged that the services had shortages in some critical skill areas. Although concerned, DOD indicated it was working with each service to prioritize the use of available personnel and planned to continue focusing on pockets of retention problems within critical skill areas. DOD officials attribute retention problems in certain occupations to factors such as the growth of civilian job opportunities, the negative impact of increasing military operations, and servicemembers' concerns over benefits and quality-of-life conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expectations and Experiences of Retention-Critical Personnel Were Similar to Other Enlisted Personnel", "paragraphs": ["The expectations and experiences of personnel serving in retention- critical occupations were similar to those of other enlisted personnel (see fig. 1).

Those serving in retention-critical occupations reported similar career expectations when they first joined the military.

Again, the responses of those in retention- critical occupations were similar to those of other enlisted personnel.", "To compare personnel in retention-critical occupations to other enlisted personnel, we developed profiles using survey questions from DOD's 1999 Survey of Active Duty Personnel. These profiles made it possible to compare the responses of retention-critical personnel in each occupational area against those of other enlisted personnel. By doing these comparisons, we could identify differences in the expectations and experiences between enlisted personnel serving in retention-critical occupations and other enlisted personnel. To measure expectations, we analyzed survey questions regarding what enlisted servicemembers' recalled their career intentions were when they first entered the military. We also analyzed their responses to survey questions about whether military life had met the expectations they had when they first entered military service. Figure 1 shows no significant differences between personnel serving in retention-critical occupations and other enlisted personnel regarding their career intent and their expectations for what military life would be like when they first entered the military.

To measure enlisted servicemembers' experiences, we analyzed their responses to DOD survey questions about issues that reflect some of the top concerns that have been raised by servicemembers and service leadership in recent years. The survey asked (1) how many hours servicemembers reported working during their last full workweek, (2) how much they had been deployed during the previous 12-month period, (3) how well their units were staffed, and (4) how well their units were equipped. These issues were cited in a recent report to Congress as exacerbating retention problems within certain critical occupations. Our analysis of the survey data revealed that although some areas of concern exist within one retention-critical occupational area, these concerns are not as serious in the other two retention-critical occupational areas. For instance, more personnel serving in electrical and mechanical equipment repair occupations reported staffing and parts and equipment concerns compared to other enlisted personnel (see fig. 2), but the concerns of those in the other two retention- critical occupational areas were similar to those of other enlisted personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Time at Work and Away from Home", "paragraphs": ["Enlisted personnel in retention-critical occupations reported working roughly the same number of hours as did other enlisted personnel.

In recent years, DOD and others have raised concerns about the increasing number of deployments and the toll these deployments are taking on military personnel. About 19 percent of the entire enlisted force reported being away from home for 5 or more months during the 12 months prior to completing the survey. Excessive time away from home is believed to have a negative impact on servicemembers' overall satisfaction and thus retention intent.

In one readiness report to Congress, the Air Force reported that retention shortfalls created an experience imbalance in some key skill areas. The same report indicated that although mission-capable rates for aircraft stabilized, the Air Force was concerned that \"low retention of experienced maintenance personnel could cause these rates to once again decline or remain at low levels.\" Parts and equipment shortfalls were of greater concern to personnel serving in retention-critical electrical and mechanical equipment repair occupations. Forty-five percent voiced concerns about parts and equipment problems compared to 34 percent of other enlisted personnel. To gauge the readiness impact of parts and equipment shortages, the survey asked respondents to rate their unit's preparedness regarding parts and equipment from well prepared to poorly prepared.

We analyzed the top 10 factors including: compensation, military life, workload, personal health care, assignment stability, career progression, deployments, family friendliness, family health care, and co-location of military spouse. For all enlisted personnel, compensation was identified as both the top reason to stay and the top reason to leave the military. The compensation factor comprised several types of military pay, including: basic pay, special and incentive pay, bonus/continuation pay, retirement pay, housing allowance, subsistence allowance, and cost of living adjustments. Of the various types of compensation, basic pay was the top reason cited by enlisted personnel to either stay in or leave the military.

Personnel in all three retention-critical occupational areas had similar career intentions. Unlike personnel in civilian occupations, military personnel are not vested in their retirement plan until they have served 20 years or more. This creates a disincentive for servicemembers to leave the military.

Seventy percent of the enlisted force believed their quality of life would be better as a civilian than as a military member. Over 70 percent believed they could make an easy transition into a civilian occupation and nearly 60 percent thought that the civilian labor market offered many options. According to officials from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this belief is difficult to quantify but probably accurate, since the training and documented work history of these personnel make them very attractive to civilian employers. These employers tend to be very positive toward former military personnel, and it is likely that these personnel have an advantage over their civilian counterparts.", "Personnel in some retention-critical occupation areas were more confident that they could do well in the civilian world compared to other enlisted personnel.

Electrical and mechanical equipment repairers were about as optimistic as other enlisted personnel regarding jobs in the civilian world.", "The perceptions of personnel serving in retention-critical occupations were mixed. To the extent they have marketable skills, the perceptions of those in retention-critical occupations were equally or more positive than other enlisted personnel. Some felt that translating their skills directly into a civilian occupation would be difficult. For instance, those serving in communications and intelligence occupations were much less positive about their ease of transition and ability to find a civilian job than were other enlisted personnel. This may be because the occupational area is made up of several occupations that may not have direct civilian counterparts.
